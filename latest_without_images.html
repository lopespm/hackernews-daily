								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As someone who dropped C++ almost entirely a decade ago because I couldn&#39;t deal with both the immense complexity and the legacy baggage of C++, this is pretty exciting honestly.What I find a bit strange is that he explains that he&#39;s been working on this since 2015 (with &#34;most of the &#39;syntax 2&#39; design work in 2015-16&#34;) and he doesn&#39;t want to give documentation because &#34;that would imply this project is intended for others to use — if it someday becomes ready for that, I&#39;ll post more docs.&#34;Why this reticence to opening the project and have others play with it and, potentially, contribute to it? I can&#39;t imagine a new language becoming successful with this mindset."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been engineering videogames in C++ for almost 20years working on AAA games and I can tell you that modern C++ is not very appealing to the vast majority of our industry. Modern C++ it&#39;s overcomplicated and from what I can see all the best software engineers I met in my careen write very simple C++98 code, maybe a bit of C++11 but that&#39;s it. They keep it simple. They don&#39;t need a move constructor because they&#39;ve been already clever enough to solve a prolbem from a different angle. Modern C++ is for experienced C++ developers and it&#39;s solving problems that experienced developers know already how to solve without all this extra complexity. And because of that it&#39;s keeping away young developers...
This new C++ syntax is just a gimmick that we don&#39;t need. The C++ community seems it&#39;s feeding itself to create a new standard every couple of years. It&#39;s just disappointing..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Pros:- Transpiling to C++ means it will work wherever C++ works. On any toolchain. With relatively little effort. It shouldn&#39;t be hard to add CMake and bazel support, for instance. Even mostly dumb makefiles should be workable.- Approaching the community this way could avoid fracturing the community more than it already is.- Targeting specific success metrics (like CVE causes) could provide focus around design and requirements- Seems simpler and easier to learn and teach.Cons:- The pitch assumes C++ modules are implemented, ready to use, and reasonable accessible.- There will be a lot of tooling to reinvent: static analyzers, syntax highlighters, etc.- At least for a while, debugging cpp2 problems will involve juggling multiple parallel realities: cpp2 code, C++ code, and actual program behavior (i.e. compiled binaries).- Doesn&#39;t address other major C++ ecosystem problems like build times, packaging, build systems, etc. cpp2 could make them slightly worse."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Will this apply to bots? What if I have a big list of a complaints about a certain politician (use your imagination, there&#39;s more than one politician to complain about), but the &#34;other party&#34; doesn&#39;t follow me, in fact, I have very few followers overall.So I create a bot that spreads my opinions by replying to millions of other Tweets. Anyone who mentions the politician of interest will receive a reply from &#34;me&#34; (my bot) within 2 minutes. Now I will be heard by millions, and my lawyer is ready should I be banned from the entire site.Now imagine many people doing this, what a cesspool, you make a Tweet and the bot flood gates open. You Tweet about your grandchild and 30 seconds later you have 400 replies expressing &#34;political opinions&#34; about shady websites with cheap Viagra. Twitter can&#39;t ban them though. Welcome to truly free speech. You better learn to code if you want to be heard.We&#39;re already at the point where websites can&#39;t control bots. AI that can write better than most humans is knocking on the door, and it can run on my personal computer. This law will only make it worse by adding real legal risk to banning suspected bots.Am I exaggerating here, or is this actually possible? This feels like a loss in the humans vs bots battle more than a political one."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Important to note that this 5th Circuit ruling conflicts with the 11th Circuit&#39;s ruling.  And SCOTUS had previously reinstated an injunction against this very same law.And this 5th Circuit opinion has very idiosyncratic reasoning [0, just the first few pages will blow your hair back].  A sample:  &#34;In urging such sweeping relief, the platforms offer a rather odd inversion of the First Amendment. That Amendment, of course, protects every person’s right to &#39;the freedom of speech.&#39; But the platforms argue that buried somewhere in the person’s enumerated right to free speech lies a corporation’s unenumerated right to muzzle speech.&#34;

How the 1st Amendment might protect a corporation&#39;s religious POV but not its exercise of editorial control is a very good question.  I&#39;m not saying this very conservative SCOTUS won&#39;t adopt the 5th Circuit&#39;s reasoning, but it still seems unlikely.  In my view -- much more likely is that they resolve the Circuit split by adopting the 11th Circuit&#39;s view wholeheartedly.[0]: https://techfreedom.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/2022-09-1..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don’t really understand the law, and I agree that big tech shouldn’t be able to regulate online speech. However one thing that I’m confused is, what about some dangerous stuff like radicalisation which then will produce terrorists or extremist? Other than that, I agree that no one should be censored for any reasonI guess it is a hard topic to define which one is the limit of freedom of “speech”"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Here we are, deep down in the dystopia of Automatic Content Classification by robots.Far less important of an example, but I was just put in &#34;Facebook jail&#34; for 24 hours for posting a picture of my son at the beach in his bathing suit with no shirt. Y&#39;know, as one does at the beach. I can only assume it&#39;s because my son has long hair and the Convolutional Neural Network or whatever decided he was a girl and therefore I&#39;m a pervert.Sadly it was the &#34;appeal&#34; I submitted that got me blocked. Presumably by a &#34;human&#34;, but who knows.Before I appealed they were simply going to not show the picture. Appealing got me in &#34;trouble.&#34;  That might be even worse than the original misclassification. On top of that, if I was actually a &#34;community standards&#34; violator who posted potential child exploitation imagery, I&#39;m not sure how a 24-hour ban on activity on Facebook is of any use, either? Except I&#39;m terrified to imagine a world where Meta might have called police on me based on the output of a neural network image classification.Others have said but I&#39;ll say it again: This kind of business doesn&#39;t scale ethically. You can&#39;t have billions of people on a bulletin board. It doesn&#39;t work. Moderation is essential to modern communication. But you can&#39;t do moderation automatically or at scale and in a universal way.Very dark patterns emerge the moment you go FAANG scale and toss algorithms tuning for advertising and &#34;engagement&#34; into the mix, and attempt to do so with the help of computers.&#34;Sad&#34; as it is, we will need to &#34;retreat&#34; back into smaller forums and BBSs where communities self-police.Facebook has infiltrated so many aspects of society. Want to interact with the parents from the local school your kids go to? You have to do that on Facebook. Event announcements? Keeping in touch with your distant aunt? Facebook.If something like Facebook is really a universal utility, it will have to be put under public administration; like the post office. But clearly, that isn&#39;t going to happen and would have other problems.I am going to have to find some other way to engage with old friends and family.Frank Herbert had some intuition with his whole &#34;Butlerian Jihad&#34; thing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem is that no automatic method we have now will catch context. There is a difference between &#34;Jews were murdered by Germans during war&#34; and &#34;Jews destroyed German economy before the war&#34; that will not be recognized by any machine we have nowadays. The first is true, the second is bullshit, how algorithm can now this?More, even if Facebook employees humans to do moderation still for some contractor from Asia &#34;Jews destroyed German economy before the war&#34; might not be easy to verify. For a contractor maybe Jews did that, who cares, I have 20 seconds to moderate this and move to other post. The same way if I was asked to moderate some historical details about India-Pakistan conflict or other historical facts about Asia, Africa I have no knowledge about at all.I was reading quite a lot recently about war in Angola and still I have doubts which side was &#34;good&#34; and which was &#34;bad&#34;, besides that people who lived there were hurt in the history like almost no other nation.Even worst. Some, especially historical, facts are judged from different perspective. For instance in Poland Napoleon Bonaparte is a mythologized person that brought hope to Polish hearts to get back their homeland [1]. From the point of view of someone from Austria or Italy, well, Napoleon is considered to be far from hero.We don&#39;t have to go back that far in the history. US intervention in Afghanistan or Iraq can be seen differently depending on somebody views.How to moderate all this?[1] Fun fact: not a big surprise that Napoleon didn&#39;t give a crap about Poland, he even refused to give them a proper King at the short time he could (he has chosen some Saxon prince). At the end, when Napoleon lost, remains of Polish military units were sent to Haiti to help France to maintain their colonies. Many Polish soldiers died from tropical illnesses there, many joined Haitians as they saw that those people were fighting for their freedom like Poles were."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was just talking to an author who published an ad on Facebook for their sci fi book. They had the word &#34;beat&#34; in the ad. The FB algo said that words intills people to violence, banned her account for 2 months, and kept all the ad money.Funny enough, her book is about the dangers of an algorithm-based AI supersystem...Facebook is the worst."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A little while ago, a patent for high throughput DNA synthesis using silicon chips went off-patent, so I have been learning analog IC chip design to build an open source high-throughput DNA synthesis chip. If it works, and I sold them at cost, it would reduce the cost of oligo pool synthesis by ~100x and possibly gene synthesis by 10x.For about 8-9 years now my goal has been to build a cell from scratch for less than $1000 and enable anyone to be able to do so. While I’m handling the other bits elsewhere, DNA synthesis is a key technology primed for open source disruption."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m working on making body doubling a more main stream approach to accomplishing everyday tasks.Body doubling is known within the ADHD community and entails performing a task in the presence of another. More details here: https://www.healthline.com/health/adhd/body-double-adhdIt helps to engage motivation by using another person as the proxy. I wrote a bit about how I think it works here: https://doubleapp.xyz/blog/body-doubling-proxyThe technique goes way beyond just ADHD applications for executive functions and is something we tend to do anyways, e.g., running with a friend, studying in a group, etc.It solves an issue for myself and I truly want to help others with the approach by making a way to stay accountable through the help of others."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My sister works as a veterinarian and is experiencing some serious burnout from her current practice (a subsidiary of a larger corporation).I guess it&#39;s pretty common practice for corporations or private equity to snatch up smaller independent practices and then run them like a sweat shop.

The firmware would need some way to do aborts/timeouts and kick a partially complete request back to software too.Is it complex...?   Yes.    But will the compute savings be worth it...?

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love reading these kinds of posts. Whenever I’m reminded that I’m not alone, I get a little bit more self-compassion and that makes me more excited to release my game and helps me appreciate all the progress and hard work to date.I’ve been working on King of Kalimpong [0] on and off since playtesting a one-week prototype of it in 2014. I had no idea how much work a networked physics vehicle/movement shooter game would be. (I should have, I was 8 years into a programming career).Working part-time was critical (for many reasons), but so was learning that progress is a product of discipline, not motivation, and that I needed to learn “infinite endurance” (I think that’s what Chris Hecker called it).Once I adopted the perspective that I was some finite number of 3-4 hour blocks of concentration away from turning a goofy idea into a game that anyone could play, finishing became something that felt inevitable — as long as I kept going.I’ll take the time to write about my experience after I release (which is now months instead of years away) in case any other game developers get anything out of it. Until then, thanks for another reminder that I’m not alone![0] https://store.steampowered.com/app/1989110/King_of_Kalimpong..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Thing is, it‘s true in essence, but talking about this stuff without numbers is completely pointless. It is written in a sensationalist way.1. Subsidies for wood pellets were a thing but are phased out in Germany.2. The awareness of some stupid calculations of burning wood come up quite frequently in the German media (the Twitter thread is like 2-3 years late).3. There are no numbers in the thread about the carbon emitted in the process of producing and shipping wood pellets.4. Not all wood burned in Germany is wood from the US.5. Not all stoves in Germany are utterly bad. The tech advanced in recent years.6. The comparison with coal is kinda dumb, because we had different goals a hundred years ago.- I personally think burning wood in housing areas should be banned entirely for health reasons.- I think the general gist of the thread is true: burning wood is at least partially some kind of green washing scheme.- But the reality is more complex than this thread claims."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well, I stopped reading here, because it is complete bull** &#34;Nearly 40% of Europe’s so-called renewable energy is currently obtained by combusting wood, much of it coming from forests in the US.&#34;I live in Poland and my (self built) house uses a wood pellet heat source. 30% of the surface area of my country is used for woodlands. Most of the wood produced is used by manufacturing industry. One of the byproducts made when manufacturing furniture and other things from wood are shavings, wood chips and wood dust. This can be made into many engineered wood products, but a lot of it is purchased by small manufacturers of wood pellets as fuel. Before I chose a heat source for my house I did enough research to know that the pellets I use (and are mostly accessible here) come from sustainable sources.So if there are countries in Europe that import their fuel wood from US it is not &#34;much of it coming from US&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Does not trump the absurdity of heavily subsidizing an american EV company in order to buy their cars, then telling users not to charge them during the winter.As an EU-country citizen I am concerned by the dominance of political appearances in all the workings of EU since before the pandemic. Insisting in formerly-popular CO2 deadlines in the face of long-lasting ukraine war is absurd. Phasing out ICE cars too early is absurd. Subsidizing buying EVs throughout europe, even though many countries clearly can&#39;t support the future EV load is absurd. Fining power production through coal is absurd, as is not having a nuclear strategy. Keeping the marginal pricing of wholesale energy during war, is absurd. Begging the dictator of azerbaijan for oil at the same time that they are attacking their neighbor, while also sanctioning russia for doing the same thing, is absurd.Ursula VdL is a bad leader, and Charles Michel (president of the council) has recently publicly called her out for her bad leadership in energy. This EU that we see now is unrecognizable: inward-looking, woefully stuck in its own processes and populist obsessions, preoccupied with appearances (e.g. demanding gas and and even power cuts from countries that are NOT dependent on russia), and complete lack of vision. I am personally thankful to the US for taking initiative in nearly all fronts: arming ukraine, providing LNG to northern europe, coordinating sanctions and even Pelosi showing her support for democracy in the region."</p>

I know it is fashionable to mock the EU regulatory efforts in the US, but the EU has a tendency to step in once something reaches proportions where regulation is actually needed. Ridiculously high roaming charges, for example, have been eliminated through regulation.Once you are the dominant provider of something that is nearing life-essential utility status, you should provide support and escalation routes, and you should be accountable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel that many of the answers here, which explain what could have been done beforehand to prevent this - are not very helpful to someone who&#39;s already locked out of their account.It&#39;s never gonna be possible to 100% prevent any possibility that could cause loss of access to your 2FA. Some people will always fall through the cracks - whether that&#39;s due to their own negligence, lack of technical understanding or some algorithmic false positive doesn&#39;t really matter imho.The real problem here is, that there&#39;s nothing that can be done to resolve something like that, AFTER it already happened. Not even if you were willing to pay for support to help you.If you got good contacts, are famous, manage to go viral or something, you might be able to actually get help - but as a regular, boring, everyday person, you&#39;re just fucked. The only &#34;advice&#34; you are gonna get is: &#34;you should have done this or that beforehand...&#34; - and the obvious answer to that is: &#34;I would have, had I only known!&#34;The only thing you can do, is post your story on HN and Twitter, and hope someone from Google reads it, and goes out of their way to actually help you - which obviously is AGAINST standard company procedure."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This might sound dumb, but if the phone number belongs to someone else now, could you just call/text them and explain the situation and (eventually) ask them to read you the code or something? Admittedly it&#39;d sound suspicious as heck, but if you&#39;re willing to provide sufficient proof of your identity and somehow offer a reward in a safe manner, the person might understand and be willing to help? You&#39;d have to be pretty smooth about it, but it seems worth preparing for and giving it a try.Alternative idea: If you&#39;re really desperate, you could even try to dig up the phone number owner&#39;s address and show up at their door or something and explain it that way. (Note I&#39;m not recommending these per se; I&#39;m just pointing out what&#39;s possible. Obviously be very careful to consider everything before doing such a thing.)"</p>

Hope their acquisition price didn&#39;t assume the ability to convert those free tier users to paid, because I doubt many are willing to stick around given the way this was handled."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I got that e-mail too, on a decade-old test account: first an e-mail that reads like my account simply &#34;expires&#34; if I don&#39;t update. Then an invoice.Here&#39;s what I don&#39;t get: After a stunt like this, any reputation/brand value that you might have had is gone. So, the obvious conclusion is they bought the company purely to pull this trick. Any other value the company might have had is deleted. Can that have been worth it? Very few people will pay voluntarily, I can&#39;t imagine them successfully collecting the money, and the acquisition price probably wasn&#39;t 0 either. I can&#39;t imagine that the math checks out, or does it?"</p>
