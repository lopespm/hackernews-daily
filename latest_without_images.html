I saw a lot of interesting things during my time, but I can&#39;t recall seeing a payment database next to a source code repo.Did their s3 bucket get popped or something?Even if their github enterprise got popped, that doesn&#39;t explain that streamer payouts down to the dollar were leaked. &#34;Oh yeah, I commit all my stripe data into github.

I&#39;ve struggled so many times with websites that either don&#39;t offer a deletion option in the account/profile settings or where customer support never responds to requests. My hope is that deletion in this case really means deletion: The user data will not remain in their database to then eventually be accidentally leaked or hacked."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The situation is quite interesting here.- Imagine, you&#39;re living outside of USA/UK/Europe.- Formally, it&#39;s possible to proceed with &#34;Permanently delete my account&#34;.- You will even receive email assuring you that two weeks later profile would be completely deleted.- Then, couple years later you&#39;ll occasionally seen email from facebook that someone tried to log in into your (&#34;permanently deleted&#34;) account.- You&#39;ll try to log in, probably restore and change the password among the way.- And after that you&#39;ll be successfully logged in. And the profile&#39;s state would be like nothing changes. Nothing. Completely.- You&#39;ll contact Support. Seriously? They&#39;ll ignore you.- Maybe some interaction with 3rd-party websites triggered 
cancellation of the process, you thought.- Then, you&#39;ll implement blacklist just to avoid any interaction with facebook, something similar to: https://pastebin.com/FAV2f9eA and try to repeat the flow again.- Then another 2+ years later situation will repeat again. Deja-vu. And again. And again.There&#39;s no way to delete facebook profile if facebook didn&#39;t really care about its users."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I got rid of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp about 4 years ago. Facebook and Instagram was easy, but people who have WhatsApp really think you’re weird for not having it.Deleting WhatsApp, while annoying for me personally, has resulted in many people I know joining Signal or Telegram — the network effect can be broken by being belligerent.If you don’t want to have a conversation about why you deleted WhatsApp, simply say it’s a moral issue, nobody wants to know."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Most of the time tech companies have their fans and detractors. In virtually any discussion about tech companies, you’ll find people for the company in question, and others against, Apple and Google are great examples.I find it interesting that I don’t think I’ve ever come across any discussion about Facebook (and I read a lot of them) where anyone is defending them. Either people are strongly against the company, or at most they admit grudgingly that they do use Facebook services because everyone else they know uses it.The only people I ever hear championing Facebook are Zuckerberg and other top management.I don’t have a Facebook account, so possibly all the positive discussion is on Facebook itself and I’m not seeing it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a pretty thorough and high profile hack on a major tech company - this isn&#39;t something I&#39;d expect from an Amazon owned property. The hack (allegedly, I haven&#39;t downloaded it) includes* Entire git histories* Internal/Private AWS SDKs* Encrypted Password dumps and payout reportsIt&#39;s so comprehensive I&#39;m very curious into how an attacker got that level of access. I can&#39;t think of another, large, corporate web 2.0 startup who&#39;s gotten owned in a similar fashion. Could the same attack work on Amazon? YouTube?It&#39;s also strange that someone who has this level of access to what is presumably a multi-billion dollar company decided to just leak the data? Maybe they did try to ransom it, but I&#39;d imagine someone with this kind of access inside Twitch must have had some creative way of making money."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I raised over 400k for Andrew&#39;s POTUS run and devoted a year of my life to running his official Reddit (104k subs at peak), then joined a SuperPAC to further his positions after the run.The campaign team was full of fools who squandered almost every good turn received, most campaign workers were paid less than minimum wage, and Andrew eventually stole the pac&#39;s name and branding - Humanity Forward - put everyone out of a job, and then did basically nothing with the organization.I&#39;ve given so much time to this person it&#39;s insane.  He&#39;s not trustworthy, he&#39;s a horrible manager of people, and he never pays off on what he promises.  Just dip your toes into YangGang social media and see how his former fans act now, or the stories of abuse within the campaigns that Andrew hardly acknowledged.Inspiring message, but I&#39;ve been close enough to the sausage factory to know it&#39;s fluff.Beware.  If you are interested in this endevour do the best you can to build your own power base, do no rely on Andrew&#39;s circle to help you in any way other than a retweet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What&#39;s missing here, IMO, is a party. Who&#39;s with him? Do you have defectors from the 2 parties? Independents or popular figures joining up? Candidates being stood?A political party is not a manifesto, it&#39;s an organisation.I actually think there&#39;s room for a party to start gaining ground in the US. There are so many elected offices that  the surface area is huge. Great for &#34;guerilla tactics.&#34; IE, earning easy victories by picking the battle..Maybe your pick a thousand low key positions, and work on them. Standing a thousand candidates with success, even if the offices are minor, makes you a full fledged party by default.Uncompetitive regional strongholds, are another opportunity. You could split the large party&#39;s vote and earn immediate relevance. You could even split the small party&#39;s vote and try to steal 2nd place. That might make you one half of a dichotomy the next time. You could run candidates in republican or democratic primaries. The primary electoral system is diverse, so you can choose to do this where it has a chance.So, where&#39;s the party? Who&#39;s running? Where/what? Who else is involved?A political manifesto is OK, I guess. A party manifesto... that would be a lot more interesting. What are you planning to do?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The top line, &#34;Not Left. Not Right. Forward.&#34; kind of reminds me of Macron&#39;s &#34;En Marche&#34; (&#34;Let&#39;s Go&#34;) that took over France in a storm, taking over the presidency AND the parliament only one year after its foundation, with very few previously known political figures in its ranks.The whole thing looked like doing management rather than politics, and offered an alternative to fed-up voters who didn&#39;t dare turn to the usual far-right and far-left &#34;protest votes&#34;.Headed with a nimble tactical vision, the formula was extremely efficient... for one mandate."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This took about a year and a half – a little over a year coding in between experiments and training.It&#39;s a chess engine with a primary neural network just like AlphaZero or Leela Chess Zero&#39;s, but it adds on a secondary &#34;commentary decoder&#34; network based on Transformer architecture to comment on positions and moves. All of the code and data for training and search is from scratch, although it does use Stockfish code to generate legal moves and manage chess positions.You can watch it play on Lichess here: https://lichess.org/@/PlayChessCoach/tv or challenge it here: https://lichess.org/?user=PlayChessCoach#friend, and see its commentary in spectator chat. It only plays one game at a time, so you may need to wait a little bit. It&#39;s fairly strong (~3450 rating, roughly on par with Stockfish 12 or SlowChess Blitz 2.7), but you can set up a position when challenging it so that it&#39;s missing a couple pawns or a piece (Variant: From Position).I ended up writing much more about it than I expected. If you&#39;re into the technical side of chess or machine learning, beyond the linked overview, there&#39;s:High-level explanation: https://chrisbutner.github.io/ChessCoach/high-level-explanat...Technical explanation: https://chrisbutner.github.io/ChessCoach/technical-explanati...

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really think that action changes attitude faster than attitude changes action. Learning this the hard way in my 40s, it&#39;s been really life changing for me. Particularly when you&#39;re depressed, demotivated, find yourself procrastinating, etc.You can try this yourself -- the next time you&#39;re feeling demotivated, start with the smallest amount of tiny measurable action. If you can&#39;t get out of bed, move your fingers, shake your head, work your way up to standing up, walking, leaving your house, and very slowly building momentum.If you&#39;re procrastinating about work, start with opening up a terminal, launch your editor, write one tiny snippet of code that just compiles, add another snippet, build momentum.You&#39;ll find yourself making excuses, telling yourself that none of this matters, or that you&#39;re too tired, or that you&#39;re not in the mood. Accept the thoughts and push through the actions.Very quickly, as the dopamine hits from these tiny successes arrive, you&#39;ll find your attitude changing, and this turns into a feedback loop where you end up performing more actions, further improving your mood and attitude."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Alternative take: in the hiring process education is often used as a proxy for motivation, when actually it only proves that once upon a time someone was motivated long enough to get educated, but it doesn&#39;t actually say anything about their present state in terms of motivation.A &#39;Do-er&#39; is at least at present motivated, and educating them will get them to the desired combination of education+motivation in the present, even if that education is going to be by necessity a very narrow one (typically: job specific).Being hungry for money and creature comforts also tends to be conflated with being motivated (&#39;ambitious&#39;), but it doesn&#39;t really align well because once financial success (for some very modest success) is attained the motivation will vanish. That&#39;s not necessarily a bad thing, but it tends to confuse people who were not aware of the driving power being the outwardly visible motivation.The movie &#39;Rush&#39; has a nice bit about that, James Hunt just wants to be WDC, once. He doesn&#39;t care about anything past that point because it will give him what he wants. But until he&#39;s got it he will be super motivated."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think he&#39;s likely to trigger a lot of ire with this tweet.  However, given what I know about his history, I think I know where this is coming from.  Carmack himself did not finish school and was motivated early on to get involved in the profession of writing software despite lacking official credentials which entitled him to do so.  I have a similar story and can relate.  Therefore, I think what he&#39;s getting at is that it&#39;s important to just get started on something without waiting until you think you&#39;re &#34;allowed&#34; to.  This quality of being a &#34;doer&#34; can stand out in colleagues.  But of course there are many sides to the story.  I don&#39;t think he meant to discount the others.Update: I want to add that I think I recall being aware of figures like Carmack in my teenage years.  Knowing of people like him, who were making lives for themselves by actively pursuing their interests, is I think a huge part of why I got involved in software early on in high school.  It was a way for weird kids like me to have a sense of self-worth and accomplishment even if we were getting bad grades in more traditional subjects like &#34;World History&#34; or &#34;Social Studies&#34; on account of just not fitting in.  And it was also at a time (in the 90s) when the economy highly valued such people going into the dot com bubble.  So this tweet doesn&#39;t surprise me at all.  I think the historical context I&#39;ve given here probably describes Carmack&#39;s life as well and is really relevant in understanding his statement."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m having a hard time reconciling all this right now.  On the one hand, from the outside, I can see the actions that Facebook takes and they seem awfully guilty of what they are accused of.  But on the other hand, I personally know and have previously worked with some of the people who work on trust and safety, specifically for kids.  Good people who have kids of their own and who care about protecting people, especially children.The best I can come up with is that Facebook is so big that the &#34;evil&#34; is an emergent property of all the different things that are happening.  It&#39;s so big no one can comprehend the big picture of it all, so while the individuals involved have good intentions with what they are working on, the sum total of all employees&#39; intentions ends up broken.So maybe Zuck is telling the truth here, that they are trying to fix all this.  But no one can see the forrest from the trees.I can&#39;t reconcile it any other way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Now that today&#39;s testimony is over, I wanted to reflect on the public debate we&#39;re in. I&#39;m sure many of you have found the recent coverage hard to read because it just doesn&#39;t reflect the company we know.Yeah, we know you don&#39;t know, because you&#39;re looking at it from on top of a mountain of 100 billion dollars, Mark. There isn&#39;t a single damned thing that can change your picture of it being the absolute greatest thing ever.&gt; We care deeply about issues like safety, well-being and mental health.What you care about, and what you say you care about, are nothing compared to your actions.&gt; It&#39;s difficult to see coverage that misrepresents our work and our motives.We don&#39;t know your motives, other than the obvious ones. We know your actions.&gt; At the most basic level, I think most of us just don&#39;t recognize the false picture of the company that is being painted.That&#39;s because you live in a big dumb bubble where chat apps are somehow world-changing innovations and creepy stalker behavior is completely fine to you. You are out of touch and people are screaming it at you. You think you are entitled to encroach on everyone&#39;s private lives, intermediate on every interaction and mine it for vulnerabilities to auction off to advertisers. Your entire model of the world is broken, Mark. No wonder nothing makes sense.Stopped reading after this point. I&#39;m sick of billionaires with megaphones blaring their virtues."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; And if social media were as responsible for polarizing society as some people claim, then why are we seeing polarization increase in the US while it stays flat or declines in many countries with just as heavy use of social media around the world?That&#39;s a point I&#39;ve made myself before, and I think there is some truth to it. Social media can&#39;t explain the high and increasing degree of US political polarisation, because other countries (including other English-speaking countries) consume social media about as much and yet have less polarisation, and don&#39;t show the same degree of increase in it either. The real explanation must lie in other aspects of US culture, or the US political system"</p>

					<h3><a href="https://ic.unicamp.br/~stolfi/bitcoin/2020-12-31-bitcoin-ponzi.html">Bitcoin is a Ponzi</a></h3>
				</div>
				<div class="story__comments">
					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28781586">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In a Ponzi scheme, a fraudulent perpetrator takes your money (and the money of many others), gives some of that to early dropouts but takes the rest for himself. Ponzi schemers profit from lying to you where your money goes.With a decentralized digital asset there is no sole person or company that profits from just lying to you about where your Dollar goes in exchange for digitals. Sure, miners and exchanges make profits based on fees when Bitcoin is created or sold, respectively — but they are only being rewarded for their legitimate efforts required to maintain and sell a digital currency. They do not pretend making your money work for you by some magical scheme.This whole confusion stems from a rather vague understanding of what the subjective theory of value means: Goods and services provided by humans have no intrinsic value but become precious simply there being demand by other humans. Gold can become worthless if nobody wants or needs it anymore. A stupid trading card may cost thousands of dollars costing pennies to make but is sought after by enough collectors. Edit: Yes, Bitcoins are just numbers stored in a computer memory around the world but so is software. And software ain’t cheap.While Bitcoin‘s value might be grossly overestimated due to rampant speculation but even then, these speculators are no victims in an investment fraud but they truly believe that Bitcoin will become much more useful in the future. They may be wrong but, currently, nobody knows. Only the future will show.Edit: Typos."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of the &#34;Common Objections&#34; relate to the REASONS people choose to own Bitcoin and how those cases make it a Ponzi.There are many different reasons to own Bitcoin, however the author seems to only view it through the lens of someone living in a wealthy and developed country with financial stability.The properties of it being difficult/impossible to confiscate and its privacy make it valuable in oppressive regimes. A refugee could store their wealth in Bitcoin, leave their country, settle somewhere else, and access their Bitcoin without the risk of it being confiscated during the journey, because they can simply memorise the seed phrase (24 words).It&#39;s predictable issuance schedule also makes it valuable in countries suffering from high inflation or hyper-inflation.This is a good article to rethink the use cases of Bitcoin: https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/check-your-financial-pri...Alex Gladstein works for the Human Rights Foundation and does lots of good work in Bitcoin advocacy. His other articles are worth checking out.And the data backs this up. Some of the biggest growth in Bitcoin users around the world have been in places around Africa and Vietnam who are subject to some of the situations mentioned above.Do you think these people see Bitcoin as a &#34;Ponzi&#34;? Do you think they care if such a definition doesn&#39;t change the properties they find useful/valuable?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While I agree that crypto generally seems to have the structure of a Ponzi scheme, I don&#39;t see any problem with that, as I assume everyone participating has the same idea.
It&#39;s just a matter of who has the guts to stay on for long enough to cash out big, who gives up too early, and who does not get off before the train crashes into the mountain."</p>
