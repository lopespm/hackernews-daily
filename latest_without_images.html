					<h3><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30171800">Google to turn on activity tracking for many users who turned it off</a></h3>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hello hello, PM for the feature checking in here. amf12&#39;s reply is quite on-point. Web and App Activity is designed to store search activity across all Google services, and we&#39;re splitting Workspace data out since it&#39;s governed by strict data handling guarantees, with the hope that more people will feel comfortable getting the benefits of better search in Workspace without having to opt-into search history being tracked for all Google services.Search history can be immensely useful for our users, since a lot of them re-run prior searches or want search experiences built on top of prior ones. Today, for the Workspace paid offering admins who choose to disable the somewhat confusingly named Web and App Activity admin console control, users in the domain have no ability to get relevant and historical search suggestions in Drive or Gmail that can help them save time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Note: this seems to be about their paid &#34;Workspaces&#34; offering. I have a private paid domain email on Google Workspaces. I received their email and checked out their FAQs to see how it would affect me in terms of privacy.Workspaces data is inherently said to be private under contract and not used for advertising or other Google purposes. Here are relevant snippets from their new FAQ:- &#34;Google never uses your data in Google Workspace core services for advertising.&#34;- &#34;Google Workspace search history includes search activity in Google Workspace services such as Gmail and Drive and is subject to the data protections that Google Workspace provides for users’ data.&#34;Seems to me that other non-core services are not covered by it, which may be the reason for this split?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What crazy to me is how hard to parse the email was. I could hardly make heads or tails of it, and I&#39;m no dummy. It almost seemed intentional, and now it makes sense.Even manually setting this feature once you understand it I can&#39;t do either!So first you might land here:https://support.google.com/a/answer/11194328#zippy=%2Chow-do...Then the instructions say:&gt; You can enable or disable Google Workspace search history:&gt;   * Go to the My Activity page.&gt;   * Click Other Google activity and then Google Workspace search history.&gt;   * Click On or Off.But this is wrong! When you follow the link the &#34;Google workspace search history&#34; is hidden in a hamburger menu in the top left. You have to click that to open the menu, THEN you can click on &#34;Other Google Activity&#34;. But on THAT page there is no setting called &#34;Google Workspace Search History&#34;.  Just the old &#34;Web &amp; App Activity&#34;So what, I have to set a reminder for after 3/29/22 to come back to this screen? Madness!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I sometimes read these and wonder if I need to retrain. At my age, I’ll struggle to get a job at a similar level in a new industry.And then I remember that the thing I bring to the table is the ability to turn domain knowledge into code.Being able to do competitive coding challenges is impressive, but a very large segment of software engineering is about eliciting what the squishy humans in management actually want, putting it into code, and discovering as quickly as possible that it’s not what they really wanted after all.It’s going to take a sufficiently long time for AI to take over management that I don’t think oldies like me need to worry too much."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It never ceases to amaze me what you can do with these transformer models. They created millions of potential solutions for each problem, used the provided examples for the problems to filter out 99% of incorrect solutions and then applied some more heuristics and the 10 available submissions to try to find a solution.All these approaches just seem like brute-force approaches: Let&#39;s just throw our transformer on this problem and see if we can get anything useful out of this.Whatever it is, you can&#39;t deny that these unsupervised models learn some semantic representations, but we have no clue at all what that actually is and how these model learn that. But I&#39;m also very sceptical that you can actually get anywhere close to human (expert) capability in any sufficiently complex domain by using this approach."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is extremely impressive, but I do think it’s worth noting that these two things were provided:- a very well defined problem.  (One of the things I like about competitive programming and the like is just getting to implement a clearly articulated problem, not something I experience on most days.)
- existing test data.This is definitely a great accomplishment, but I think those two features of competitive programming are notably different than my experience of daily programming.  I don’t mean to suggest these will always be limitations of this kind of technology, though."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Underlying study is here. [1] Full disclosure, I co-wrote the piece for The Daily Beast [2] that originally suggested that Tesla&#39;s methodology was seriously flawed. I am not a Tesla-hater though — I just thought it was odd that the company was playing quite so fast and loose with their safety claims.1: https://engrxiv.org/preprint/view/1973/39862: https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-tesla-and-elon-musk-exagge..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have felt since day 1 that &#34;autopilot is better than the average driver!&#34; is the most misleading fact/statistic in the industry.The &#34;average driver&#34; involved in an accident includes drunk drivers, road ragers, habitual speeders, teenagers, people driving in bad conditions (rain, snow), people driving without sleep and several other risky groups that most people buying Teslas aren&#39;t part of. To be worth it, the car has to reduce my personal accident risk under the conditions I usually drive, otherwise I prefer to keep my own hands behind the wheel over handing over control to an algorithm."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, adjusted for driver age the difference vanishes.That&#39;s quite an interesting observation, and it shows the importance of proper statistics. It also raises questions about companies producing their own stats, it&#39;s often only when someone takes the time to dig into it that we discover this kind of thing.I am not holding my breath waiting for the common consumer to understand statistical critical thinking though. I sometimes catch myself forgetting the due diligence even after many years of forcing myself to think about stats.Perhaps some sort of ombudsman could do this, pointing out when stats are lying to people."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This headline and article is a gross misrepresentation of the ruling. The ruling is that the TCF consent string contains personal data and that the IAB is the data controller for this bit of data. This ruling has no impact what so ever on consent popups. It basically &#34;just&#34; trashes the industry standard that is used to pass consent signals. There are plenty of custom or non TCF implementations (all equally awful) of consent dialogs.This ruling puts Google and FB in a much more powerful position - because they do not have to rely on standards like TCF to pass consent signals.Instead of going after publishers and website owners who integrate these popups in the first place - they went after the inventor of the spec."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It was obvious to anyone technical they didn&#39;t work as they presented themselves to work, but it takes time for the courts to deal with such things.They are also totally annoying and I suspect there primary purpose was to annoy users and not actually comply with the GDPR.  It was a way for these companies to fight the GDPR with a war of attrition.  I&#39;m glad you see with this round hasn&#39;t worked... Yet.I suspect that based on this ruling, things will not get better, as in providing a less annoying user experience and more compliance with the GDPR.  Instead I predict another round of pseudo compliance and a more annoying user experience.  Eventually they&#39;ll start a policy campaign in earnest stating that the GDPR is unworkable."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is from Mark Zuckerberg&#39;s post. I think it&#39;s a decent explanation of their performance. Historically Facebook always made these longer-term bets and they&#39;ve typically paid off.&#34;Before I get to that, I want to briefly touch on our Q4 results, which I know Sheryl and Dave are going to go deeper on. I&#39;m proud of the work our teams did here. We shipped products, our community continued to grow, and businesses of all sizes turned to us to help them reach people. But there are two things that I want to call out that are having an impact on our business.The first is competition. People have a lot of choices for how they want to spend their time and apps like TikTok are growing very quickly. And this is why our focus on Reels is so important over the long-term. As is our work to make sure our apps are the best services out there for young adults, which I spoke about on our last call.The second area, and related to this, is that we&#39;re in the middle of a transition on our own services towards short-form video like Reels. So as more activity shifts towards this medium, we&#39;re replacing some time in News Feed and other higher monetizing surfaces. So as a result of both competition and this shift to short-form video as well as our focus on serving young adults over optimizing overall engagement, we&#39;re going to continue to see pressure on impression growth in the near term. Now I&#39;m confident that leaning harder into these trends is the right short-term tradeoff to make in order to get long-term gains. We&#39;ve made these types of transitions before with mobile feed and Stories, where we took on headwinds in the near-term to align with important trends over the long term. And while video has historically been slower to monetize, we believe that over time short-form video is going to monetize more like feed or Stories than like Watch – so I&#39;m optimistic that we&#39;ll get to where we need to be with Reels too.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Facebook’s core business model appears to be in decline. They don’t have a very diversified revenue stream despite trying various side businesses. This is the market worried that Facebook’s best days are behind it.Facebook is betting the farm on the metaverse stuff but without meaningful financial results that’s not going to placate market concerns over what looks like a downhill future for the core businesses. Facebook’s less than fantastic record at making money on its other businesses doesn’t have the market terribly optimistic about about the future prospects metaverse stuff either. Net net stock down 20%."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I would have advised him to stay quiet about this. Not out of fear of the North Koreans, but out of fear of our own security agencies seeing the activity as interfering in international relations. Also the vagueness of our hacking laws probably make what he did a crime.But I also am immensely proud that we have people willing to take things into their own hands when needed.Also, I feel like the 2nd amendment should be interpreted to include the right to bear digital arms (strong encryption for a start).

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It seems like many journalists are failing in their primary responsibilities to keep the public informed. Fact checking liars or misleading statements is tedious, and some politicians lie or mislead.Journalists should be doing investigations and creating reports that put social and political issues in context. Yet so often these issues, real issues that affect lives, are treated as political theater or a public sport.I can&#39;t blame journalists for the politicians lying or misleading, but I can blame them for so often going for the easy stories that they are fed, instead of the hard ones they have to look for or put together.As a result, when I read the news I pay special attention to stories that are based on original investigations, public records requests, whistleblowers, or stories in which actual context is provided from multiple viewpoints that are informed by the facts, rather than merely by self interest."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This conversation isn&#39;t formal enough to be meaningful.If you want to talk meaningfully about how &#34;facts&#34; are used, you need to be able to invoke any notion at all of propositions and implications. It doesn&#39;t matter if your implications are mathematical in nature or scientific in nature or just correlation, facts exist in the structure imposed by implication. And facts without an implication structure are useless.In order to mislead with a &#34;true&#34; fact A, it needs to already be the case that there is a false fact of the form A implies B already sitting in there. The combination of a belief in A implies B (false) with this newly introduced belief A (true) yields a belief in B (false).The essence of &#34;lying by telling the truth&#34; is then just finding these false implications, and exploiting them.Fortunately, It&#39;s much easier to fact check implications. If A implies B is false, then you just need to come up with an example of A and not B.Unfortunately changes to belief do not always propagate reliably, and the combinatorial game is against the implication checkers. For any given true fact A there are as many potential false beliefs of the form A implies B as there are propositions B.Fortunately, most humans make do with as few (quantified) implications as they can. Rules are hard to remember. Getting rid of false implications is much easier when you can replace them with &#34;true&#34; implications.I suppose I am arguing then that the solution to all of this is education that doesn&#39;t teach facts, but rather implications (which are themselves just higher order facts)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From that article:Our task is to create new processes for determining what counts as a shared, socially meaningful, mutually understood “truth.” Obviously, this requires more than making sure that every fact is checked.It&#39;s recognizing with double quotes &#34;truth&#34; as a different thing than Truth. Hence it&#39;s a confession that their task is to &#34;create a new process for determining what counts as &#39;truth&#39;&#34; and not genuine fidelity to reality. This means that the process they claim to desire will have, by design, the backdoor of the shared illusion effect. In other words they want to be marketeers of a shared feeling of truth. That&#39;s not science, not professional journalism, that&#39;s Propaganda. They accuse people of using facts to manipulate the public imaginary and they propose to solve that problem by becoming that people themselves imposing their own manipulation of facts.Here is an idea: You can have your own opinions but you can&#39;t have your own facts. Let reality show you Truth regardless of how that makes you feel and restrain yourself from wanting to impose worldviews on anybody. Nature is infinitely wiser than you (and all of us)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Postman founder here. Thank you HN community for highlighting this feature. We have been seeing gRPC usage exploding especially in microservices driven architectures and we are looking forward to the feedback we get on the feature.A few other observations on comments that I read through:1. Postman leans towards adding UI affordances instead of hiding them. This can irritate experienced developers at times who already know the complexities of HTTP or other protocols but that is really how new developers find their way around. So while it is attractive to have 1000 options hidden behind a command line interface, nobody uses 995 of those features. We are getting better at building experiences for both experienced and new developers. Also, I don’t believe reading man pages of git or curl is a better experience.2. Performance is a huge area for improvement. More to come in subsequent releases this year.3. Our roadmap is community driven: https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-app-support/issues. Raising more investment helps us do more. We have built a business model around doing the maximum for every developer on the planet while also providing value to companies so we can charge for it and continue development. I find it fair that companies spend hundreds of millions of dollars on salaries can pay some money for improving their productivity by spending in developer tools.4. API Development is a huge and growing area and developers are spending more and more time working with APIs rather than their IDEs. API Design, documentation, and testing are areas that a large number of developers tell us they wish they had better tooling for. Most of their time is spend pointlessly in trying to figure out how an API works (in some cases whether an API even exists). We decided to take Postman in those areas even though paradoxically it might lead to “less” Postman usage. (The faster people figure out an API the fewer number of calls they have to send)5. Finally, it is good to see here a call for fewer features which we insist internally as well. Unfortunately at some point some part of the community is upset that we are NOT adding features (just see the gRPC thread on our issue tracker!). We don’t see issues to remove features as much as we have requests to fulfill. We do remove features consciously but it is a hard problem, so we default to adding them slowly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Postman is so incredibly bloated and slow these days. All I want is a REST client, but it feels like every time I want to perform a basic task now, I have to dig past all of their confusing platform and cloud stuff that I have no interest in."</p>
