								<p class="story__comment_others">"First a pandemic and now my online home of the last 20 years being torn apart. This is really upsetting. The people of freenode are something special. I really hope the community can manage the switch without loosing too much of everything. Already the channel registration on libera is throwing established communities into chaos.I really hate that corporate shell game bullshit and attempts at monetization are being made by a dude that professes to love IRC. I wish andrew could acknowledge the hurt he is causing but it seems like saving face matters more to him at this point."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; When freenode announced that it was joining with Private Internet Access, staff were uncertain but assured that PIA was to have no operational influenceI mean, promises like that sound like obvious bullshit to me. ‘EA promises that Codemasters will continue to operate on their own like they did’. Yeah sure buds, who are you taking me for. Unless the company is a cash cow startup, why would anyone buy it with other aims than to try making it bring a bit more profit than the previous owners could manage? (Buying the team/the technology is pretty much the same, as it means the workings of the business will be thrown away.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love stories like this. I have one of my own, actually.When I was first getting into IT I started sending out CVs. Mine was terrible. I had been working in call centres for years at this point and all my &#34;experience&#34; was basically self-taught, so not really experience at all. As a result my CV was void of any actual content a hiring manager in IT would want to read, thus it was binned a lot.I applied for a job at a nearby network hardware repair place. They needed someone to look after their Cisco kit and about 30 Debian Linux systems. I was attracted to the mix of responsibilities so I applied, sending in me not-so-good CV. I was eventually asked to come in to have a chat after waiting about a week to hear back from the place.At the end of the interview, Bob (let&#39;s call him), said I was more knowledgeable than the RHCEs that were coming through his door. This was nice to hear, but then he said something that really made me smile...Apparently my CV was worse than I thought. It was so bad, that Bob literally put it in the bin under his desk. About four days later, Bob was reading through a local Linux User Group (LUG) mailing list and he saw a name he recognised: mine. So he opens the email and reads the thread in which I helped another LUG member compile a sound driver for their kernel. The instructions I gave worked.Bob was impressed but he couldn&#39;t quite remember where he had seen the name. At this point the business owner, John (heh...), was standing besides Bob&#39;s desk and noticed my CV in the bin. He pulls it out and reads my name across the top. The penny drops for Bob and I get the call to come in and have a chat.I got the job."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It was 1992 and I was a high school senior.  My teacher got me a job at the local DPW in the electical department.  I was to work in the warehouse under a guy named Al who was an old timer and lost his hand in a forklift accident 30 years prior.  My job was to clean the warehouse, and when I was done Al told me to &#39;go hide somewhere&#39; which I did, at the top of the shelves 20&#39; in the air, which I had also cleaned.  
This got boring and so I wandered into the main office where people were huddled over a computer.  They were doing a mail-merge with quick basic to inform customers that their power would be out, and it wasn&#39;t working.
I looked over their shoulders and it was exactly what I had been doing to send out mailings to companies for free stuff as I had read in Radio-Electonics magazine.
I fix the problem, and the Chief Engineer said &#39;come with me&#39; and takes me to the (air conditioned!) sub-station and into an even colder computer room where they had just setup the SCADA system to control the towns breakers and monitor the power.  
Nobody knew how to program it, so he pointed to a 3&#39; pile of manuals and said this was my new job.  By the end of the summer we saved the town millions by siphoning power from the local college at peak power demand.  I still hung out with Al, and helped him in the mornings.  The linesmen still made fun of me, even more so when I accidentally turned off half the towns power for 15 minutes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a kind of similar story when I started studying in the late 2000s years. There was a company that had a specialized and really expensive measurement device. But the vendor went out of service. They changed part of their system but kept the measurement device only to find out it could not talk to the new system because the file system of the data was proprietary to the measurement device.I got a student job at that company and one of my first tasks (and that of several students before me) was to open measurement results on the device and type them into excel spreadsheets. I did this for an hour or so until I became totally bored so I started to tinker around. The measurement device had it&#39;s own PC that booted Windows (I think it was 95 or 98) and autostarted their software in full screen/some sort of . This was easy to bypass via the task manager and running explorer.exe. I found out that the proprietary file format was simplay an MS Access file with a different extension. I tried to open it, but the file was password protected.   
At this time I had little to none experience with programming or anything else that was &#34;low level&#34; computer stuff, but I occasionally stumbled about writeups about hacks and exploits and skimmed over them. So I was pretty sure that there had to be a hardcoded password somewhere. I started to open every file I could in a text editor with no luck. Then I got a hex editor and opened the binaries and finally, in a dll there was a password. 
The next few days at this job I spent teaching myself enough Python to read the Access files and write the contents into an Excel file.This worked and I used the free time to study/eat/sleep while getting paid for it but then one of my supervisors found out that I wasn&#39;t doing anything but still got results and wondered how I did it. He immediately put me onto another problem they had, thus starting my career as a software engineer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Many of the comments on this article are so cold. I can’t believe it. When I read the original article I was imagining all the constructive ways HN readers would interpret it and hold a mirror up to their own behaviour. Some commenters are doing this. But it surprises and depresses me how many people are commenting saying “no, this list isn’t what it says it is, it’s a list showing the author has a negative mindset / is not from the Valley bubble, and that problem can be fixed by just getting over it.”. We can do better than that.As someone who has sat at some interesting class and race intersections during my career in tech, including my time at some very prestigious institutions like the University of Cambridge and FAANG, and has exhibited and noticed many of the listed behaviours and the lack there of, I can say this article had the undeniable ring of truth and made me feel sick to my stomach. Guilty for when I’ve been on the rich side and angry for the times I’ve been on the poor side.The psychology of growing up with financial uncertainty - and a risk of racial exclusion - is hard to shake and can be passed from parent to child. My life has mostly been financially blessed but you can’t buy your way out of the mindset, or snap your fingers / empty the cache / cycle the power the way the average HN commenter seems to think you can."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Three paychecks is a month and a half of income (rent and two car payments by my fevered calculations, which never stop)&#34;Pay attention to those last three words. This is very important. I&#39;ve been on both sides too, and to me those words are like a slap in the face: stark reality.If you&#39;re poor enough (relative to the costs of your life) you are at a constant exhausting deficit because you CANNOT stop calculating and recalculating the mechanisms of your basic survival. Even if you&#39;re not juggling bills and having to gauge what will blow up worst, you&#39;re projecting worst-case scenarios and trying to plan against adverse situations, which will come up more often for you (example: old car problems)&#34;which never stop&#34;Consider those words seriously. You can improve the quality and performance of a person a great deal by allowing them to function as they &#39;normally&#39; would, rather than in constant emergency mode."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m from a &#34;poorish&#34; family, but from Europe. Some stuff is relatable some is not:- People ordering lunch always felt weird for me, in my mind I think &#34;why should I pay 10€ for a bowl of salad, when I can go to the grocery store below the office and have the same for 1€&#34;, or even better pay 70 cents for the raw vegetables, wash them and chop them in the office and they will last 3 days- Student debt doesn&#39;t apply, the good thing of being &#34;poor&#34; in Italy is that the country pays you to go to university and not the opposite- When I got my first tech job I was like &#34;wow, I got a MacBook just for joining the company, this costs like 1 year of salary of my previous job&#34;- The part of stealing I don&#39;t find relatable, even when my bank account was empty I would never resort to stealing, must be some honour system I grew up with- The gym part is also not relatable, when I was fat and I did go to the gym everyone was very supportive, and every little progress was celebrated by everyone making you want to go more and more.A thing I notice, is that the mentality stays with you no matter your salary, I always try to avoid spending more than necessary, with a comparison with my colleagues my monthly expenses are less than 1/3 compared to them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s interesting to me that the draft was censored and mentioned a buyer, while this one only talks about control. For me, it paints the situation worse.Still sad to see FreeNode fall. This will lead to a lot of split communities and dead links.EDIT: Fuchs finds some harsher words[0]:&gt; In the past few weeks, this has changed[2], and the existance of a legal threat
to freenode has become apparent. We cannot know the substance of this legal
threat as it contains some kind of gag order
preventing its broader discussion within staff.
The democratically elected heads of their respective teams, 
development, infrastructure, projects and communities
were removed by force[3] and have been informed that they are not 
entitled to act in their respective capacity.&gt; [...] A contract in which christel, former head of staff, allegedly sold freenode, surfaced.
And while I personally think that this would have neither included any servers
or code or user data, since that did not belong to christel to sell, I am not a lawyer
and apparently some of our volunteers got pressured very hard and their personal life
could have been ruined easily should we have fought against this apparent contract.This makes it look far more hostile than the linked note. Sad to see.[0] https://fuchsnet.ch/freenode-resign-letter.txt"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Apparently London Trust Media, the company founded by Andrew Lee and which purchased Freenode, has now rebranded under the name &#34;Imperial Family Companies&#34;. londontrustmedia.com now redirects to https://imperialfamily.com/ and it lists Freenode under Technology.Andrew Lee also claims to be the crown prince of Korea, which was no doubt the inspiration for this move: https://www.latimes.com/business/real-estate/story/2020-12-0...Lee also hired Mark Karpelès (of Mt.Gox infamy) as CTO of London Trust Media. and he is still listed as CTO of Shells.com, which is also owned by Imperial Family Companies: https://www.shells.com/l/en-US/teamEdit: Comment was moved, reworded to make it work in its new context."</p>

The buyer put the money on Escrow.com, I transferred everything over, and they went AWOL. What I found out is that there is no straightforward way to obtain the funds when it happens. Apparently there is no way at all except via the court system. Which would mean the only real protection Escrow gives is against the buyer going bankrupt (or using false identity, I suppose).Fortunately, they came back several weeks later with some nonsensical excuse and closed the transaction, but I will never use Escrow.com again."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hard to take this seriously with all the straw men and broad generalizations.Reality check: there has never been a hotter seller&#39;s market for software engineering talent.  The fact that you have not landed a job does not mean that supply is not short in general.  Rather than blowing your stack at some recruiter who you heard on a podcast interview, you might want to reflect on yourself and how you might be coming off in job interviews.As far as low pay goes, yeah, welcome to the labor market.  It&#39;s easy to write a blog post about how companies need to pay more, but hard to reconcile the reality that if they don&#39;t have FAANG cash flows, &#34;market rate&#34; for developers may not be viable, regardless of management&#39;s good intentions or lack thereof.And with regard to bad interviews, remember interviewers are individuals, with skillsets all over the map.  Once you get more senior it gets even more frustrating to be judged by someone who has a fraction of your experience.  Trust me when I say there is no value in dwelling on this or getting your undies in a bunch.  Suck it up and figure out how to play the game (read CtCI, practice on interviewing.io, ask for feedback) and land the job, then do the best work you can every day.  Angry screeds will not change anything about the industry and will not help you."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This person sounded really experienced, so I looked them up on LinkedIn. 7 months at their first company. 9 months at their current company. That&#39;s it, aside from non-programming jobs before their bootcamp.The whole thing reads like inventing scenarios that didn&#39;t happen or embellishing them.&gt; A bad interview is when you ask them the definition of some specific thing in some specific framework like “Tell me what a closure in javascript is.” then treat them like they’re stupid if they don’t know.Not that believable, but okay.&gt; I once had an interviewer ask me if I was a wizard with GO, C++, Rust, and C over the phone. Then when I said I had some experience with rust, he immediately cursed at me and hung up.Didn&#39;t happen.&gt; Nobody in their right mind is going to move to San Francisco, California to be a “Lead developer” for only 70k with zero equity.Are any companies actually trying to recruit like this? And is it successful beyond just throwing up a hiring post and not getting anything? I put in a limit buy of $3000 for 1 BRK/A on a whim once."</p>

I&#39;ve done a fair bit of interviewing on both sides of the table, and can say with complete honesty I&#39;ve never heard a curse said in anger in any of them. I&#39;ve also never heard of it happening from a co-worker or friend."</p>

Already feeling like some of these are one person&#39;s opinion, biased towards the current status quo in mobile/web. Although there are a lot of good points around padding, font, contrast, etc. Main theme seems to be around consistency.Edit: Okay, well, I got  7580

I think a lot of this was more &#34;find the difference&#34; than it was &#34;tell me what version is better&#34;. Once you are able to find the subtle difference, it&#39;s pretty obvious which one is better, mostly because one of them lacks self-consistency.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a big fan of 1Password. I&#39;ve been paying for it for years. A few years ago I got my partner setup in a few minutes and now they have strong passwords everywhere.  Its got great features for sharing vaults with other people so I&#39;ve got password managers setup for the kids too. My partner and I both have personal vaults, we have a shared vault for financial stuff, and a shared vault for our media accounts (that we share with the kids too)I get that people bristle about SaaS subscriptions in their personal life but the $60/year it costs is well worth it. The research shows that strong passwords and limiting re-use is extremely effective at preventing account compromises and 1Password makes this dead simple.The thing that finally made it an incredible app was when Apple finally allowed 3rd party password management in iOS.Yes there might be better password managers out there and they might have better security. However show me an alternative with a UX that is simple enough for my 6 year old to use, that works on iOS, Android, MacOS, and now Linux."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"PSA: Note that AgileBits intentionally hides the standalone license option and pushes subscription as the only visible scheme to get the application. This is a long standing dark pattern, and though the support staff will admit on their forums or here that the standalone license does exist, you wouldn&#39;t be able to find it without some special incantations on the forums. They will keep reiterating that it&#39;s for your own good so that you don&#39;t get confused.The application UX may be great. The sync may be great. The security of the closed source application may be great (because of audits). But this single dark pattern and the condescending attitude of their team members whenever the topic of standalone license comes up are enough to avoid this company. If you can get to the standalone license purchase option within three or four clicks from the main site, do let me know.I switched out of 1Password to Bitwarden long ago. I will admit that Bitwarden is not fantastic (I find it somewhat slow and also lacking some features). But it doesn&#39;t use dark patterns like AgileBits does."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting:&gt; 1Password for Linux also debuts with several features that are coming soon to 1Password for Mac, Windows, iOS, and AndroidThat should be encouraging for Linux users. It suggests that the Linux version is not just a port that will forever at best follow the other platforms. It can get pretty annoying when you have something that is available on multiple platforms, and your platform tends to always lag the others."</p>
