								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been maintaining a spare phone running lineage os exactly in case something like this happened - I love the apple watch and apple ecosystem, but this is such a flagrant abuse of their position as Maintainers Of The Device that I have no choice but to switch.Fortunately, my email is on a paid provider (fastmail), and my photos are on a NAS, I&#39;ve worked hard to get all of my friends on Signal. While I still use google maps, I&#39;ve been trialing out OSM alternatives for a minute.The things they&#39;ve described are in general, reasonable and probably good in the moral sense. However, I&#39;m not sure that I support what they are implementing for child accounts (as a queer kid, I was terrified of my parents finding out). On the surface, it seems good - but I am concerned about other snooping features that this portents.However, with icloud photos csam, it is also a horrifying precedent that the device I put my life into is scanning my photos and reporting on bad behavior (even if the initial dataset is the most reprehensible behavior).I&#39;m saddened by Apple&#39;s decision, and I hope they recant, because it&#39;s the only way I will continue to use their platform."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember an Apple conference where Tim Cook personally assured us that Apple is fully committed to privacy, that everything is so secure because the iPhone is so powerful that all necessary calculations can happen on the device itself, and that we are &#34;not the product&#34;. I think the Apple CEO said some of this in the specific context of speech processing, yet it seemed a specific case of a general principle upheld by Apple.I bought an iPhone because the CEO seemed to be sincere in his commitment to privacy.What Apple has announced here seems to be a complete reversal from what I understood the CEO saying at the conference only a few years ago."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m really conflicted about this.For context, I deeply hate the abuse of children and I&#39;ve worked on a contract before that landed 12 human traffickers in custody that were smuggling sex slaves across boarders. I didn&#39;t need to know details about the victims in question, but it&#39;s understood that they&#39;re often teenagers or children.So my initial reaction when reading this Twitter thread was &#34;let&#39;s get these bastards&#34; but on serious reflection I think that impulse is wrong. Unshared data shouldn&#39;t be subject to search. Once it&#39;s shared, I can make several cases for an automated scan, but a cloud backup of personal media should be kept private. Our control of our own privacy matters. Not for the slippery slope argument or for the false positive argument, but for its own sake. We shouldn&#39;t be assuming the worst of people without cause or warrant.That said, even though I feel this way a not-small-enough part of me will be pleased if it is deployed because I want these people arrested. It&#39;s the same way I feel when terrorists get captured even if intelligence services bent or broke the rules. I can be happy at the outcome without being happy at the methods, and I can feel queasy about my own internal, conflicted feelings throughout it all."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s funny to see anyone here could find this acceptable. I wonder what&#39;s comments would be after Apple start to scan phones for anti-censorship or anti-CCP materials in China. Or for some gay porn in Saudi Arabia.Because you know in some countries there are materials that local government find more offensive than mere child abuse. And once surveillance tech is deployed it&#39;s certainly gonna be used to oppress people."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So if I understand correctly, they want to scan all your photos, stored on your private phone, that you paid for, and they want to check if any of the hashes are the same as hashes of child porn?So... all your hashes will be uploaded to the cloud? How do you prevent them from scanning other stuff (memes, leaked documents, trump-fights-cnn-gif,... to profile the users)?Or will a huge hash database of child porn hashes be downloaded to the phone?Honestly, i think it&#39;s one more abuse of terrorism/child porn to take away privacy of people, and mark all oposing the law as terrorists/pedos....also, as in the thread from the original url, making false positives and spreading them around (think 4chan mass e-mailing stuff) might cause a lot of problems too."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Cuomo also sent thousands of elderly people to their deaths by forcing them back into nursing homes.And yes, I mean forcing.Do you remember the hospital ship?  The field hospitals?  Javits center?Did you know the hospital ship went home after being almost completely unused?  Did you know it treated IN TOTAL 182 people?  With a crew of 1200 and 1000 available beds?Did you know that javits center never even got remotely close to full?  In TOTAL in treated about 1000 patients and had 4000 beds.And yet he’s forcing these elderly back into nursing homes because it makes him look in charge, and fuels his idiotic feud he had going with the federal government over who was more leadery.  He won an Emmy for it!Cuomo should be facing prison.  The people who have been helping him cover up killing thousands of elderly people as a political play should as well.The fact that he was transferring state employees around so he could kiss them on the cheek and touch their face should get him disgraced and fired.  It is absolutely a distraction from the horror he has inflicted upon thousands of people.  Imagine him sending your grandmother to her death so that he could look good on television.  Absolutely evil."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;&gt; Dani Lever — who had worked in Cuomo’s press operation since 2014 but left in August 2020 to join Facebook as a communications managerThis is the sort of hire that drives me nuts.  I&#39;m sure this person is a fully capable communications manager, but what Facebook really purchased was political access.  Is it no surprise then that long after beginning work she was doing favors for her former employer?  Maintaining a connection to powerful politicians might well have been in her job description.&gt;&gt; Prior to joining Cuomo’s office in 2014, Lever worked as a press assistant for President Barack Obama’s 2012 presidential campaign and worked in press relations at the Clinton Foundation, among other roles, according to her LinkedIn profile.Which is more valuable to Facebook: her skills as a &#34;communication manager&#34; or the fact that she probably has the personal numbers for half of Washington?After some quickly googling: she appears to be the daughter of a prominent NYC attorney, which might have something to do with her previous work, as a student, for NY&#39;s attorney general.  And for NYC&#39;s comptroller general.  I would have killed for such jobs during law school.  She seems to have bounced between them while an undergrad.&#34;Lever, who grew up in Quaker Ridge, graduated from [redacted] and the University of Wisconsin-Madison also worked for state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, President Obama&#39;s 2012 campaign, and Clinton Foundation. She is the daughter of Joel and Debbie Lever of Bradford Road.&#34;https://scarsdale10583.com/about-joomla/the-project/5776-sca...I love that &#34;Bradford Road&#34; reference.  That is New England code for an old and well connected family.  (The implications of her highschool are just inappropriate and so I redact it.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The shocking thing about Cuomo is how blatant it all was. Not just the sexual harassment but his character across the board.This is a guy who wrote a book about his leadership in the covid pandemic during the covid pandemic. That&#39;s like Churchill writing his memoir of World War II during The Blitz.We ought to have a culture where someone who behaves like this is laughed out of the building."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s so irritating to be an American that has moved overseas. Basically the only country in the world that charges taxes on money you make and spend somewhere else, just because of where you were born. Thanks to IRS regulations, 90% of investment firms will just reject me outright rather than deal with the paperwork. Getting someone to help file my inordinately complex taxes costs thousands of dollars more than I actually pay in tax. I can&#39;t have a proper retirement account here since America doesn&#39;t recognize the local pension providers, so my government mandated pension is deducted from my salary here and then also taxed as income in the USA. If I ever want to leave, the IRS charges a small fortune for the privilege of not being a citizen too.I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a small number of rich people gaming the system, but for the vast majority of expats the citizenship-based taxation system is almost cartoonishly cruel."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting facts about renouncing American citizenship:- There is renunciation fee that has to be paid and currently stands at $2,350 (the highest in the world).[1]- A final tax return will sill need to be filed. [1]- An Expatriation tax is payable if [..] Your net worth is $2 million or more on the date of your expatriation. you will be treated as having disposed of your assets the day before your expatriation and will be subject to capital gains tax.- The highest capital gains tax bracket in the USA is 20% [2]Now there will be ways this is avoided but it would seem that the IRS is trying very hard make this process unappealing[1] https://www.expatnetwork.com/how-to-renounce-us-citizenship-...[2] https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/capital-gains-tax-r..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m an &#34;accidental American&#34; who has navigated this issue and it&#39;s incredibly easy. Just don&#39;t file. Every professional that writes blogs about this has a professional duty to give legal advice but the practical advice is just don&#39;t file. Look into what exactly triggers data to be sent to the IRS under your tax treaty and the policies of your financial institutions. Being &#34;accidental&#34; is the key here. If you tell your bank you aren&#39;t an American and you have a non-American birthplace and birth certificate they have absolutely zero way of knowing and your information will not be sent. If you have an American birthplace you can lie and say you renounced, but this carries some risk as the IRS maliciously publishes lists of renouncers so it&#39;s possible they could guess you lied. FATCA and FBAR are egregious violations of your rights. Not even the NSA has the right to spy on Americans abroad, but the IRS can do dragnet surveillance on American financial data from foreign countries with no probable cause and no warrants. You have a duty not to comply."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was doing research for something else and found this great anecdote about Kid Pix that I&#39;ve saved.&#34;Other product teams do not have the time or resources to work with children as often. In the case of Kid Pix, when it was first released back in 1989, Borderbund sponsored their first Kid&#39;s Day. It was a weekend testing day for 20 children to try out Kid Pix. Developers offered their testers cookies for a break and a crafts table with paper, glue, glitter, etc.--just in case the testers got bored. According to Broderbund employees, few cookies were eaten and almost none of the crafts were used. It was determined that Kid Pix would be a hit (Druin and Solomon 1996).&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oh man this brings back memories.I must have been 6 years old. My dad came home with a computer that they were getting rid of at his work. He set it up that night and, having never seen a computer, I wanted to play with it. Well, for some reason, it had Kid Pix installed. I remember drawing something with a couple of green lines and a few rabbit stamps for good measure. As I recall, I then insisted that we had to print it and wouldn’t take no for an answer."</p>

Like a kid running butt naked around the house, or a photo of something like a rash that is sent to a nurse friend for advice on what it is etc.I&#39;m all for protecting children from being abused, but how are they going to filter what is normal and what is abuse without human intervention? And at that point isn&#39;t that a vast invasion of privacy to the perfectly innocent?

If I lose the false-positive lottery, am I going to have the police calling and have my mugshot in the evening news for &#34;CP on their device&#34; in particular in my state&#39;s months long backlog for digital forensics. Law enforcement aren&#39;t exactly known for their understanding of technical evidence like hash-matching.I&#39;m very sympathetic/supportive of anti-CP initiatives in general, but this still seems problematic.PS - And before someone replies with &#34;they aren&#39;t contacting the police,&#34; don&#39;t forget the &#34;yet.&#34; Once this is in place they&#39;ll immediately get pressured by politicians and well-intentioned people alike to flag any positive detections to authorities who will overreact (as law enforcement has a history of doing, particularly around this topic)."</p>

Quoting /u/hamsterman20:&gt; &#34;First of all, he was going to a chinese university with a chinese scholarship.&gt; He left the swiss university because of some weird technicalities while attending the Chinese university.&gt; He posted political messages against china and 1 picture depicting a chinese with yellow skin and slit eyes.&gt; Im not surprised he was kicked out of the chinese university and that the supervisor wanted to distance themselves.
