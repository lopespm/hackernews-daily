								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Let&#39;s be clear about this, the donation money isn&#39;t just used to keep the encyclopedia online. They have hundreds of language versions of Wikipedia itself, and many related &#34;sister&#34; projects, with perhaps the most clearly impacting being Wikimedia Commons (a huge repository of free-content media with a focus on educational use - including much media in the public domain) and Wikidata (a project that has now emerged as the closest thing to a &#39;hub&#39; in the still-developing Semantic Web ecosystem).  Quite a bit of their funding also enables growth in least-developed countries, where access to high-quality educational content in local languages is going to be especially impactful wrt. broader development goals.People like to focus on the excess growth of management roles within the foundation and call it &#34;cancer&#34;, but all large organizations have some possible waste within them.  It might just be one of the many costs of doing business and pursuing what are in reality some very ambitious and perhaps worthwhile goals.  And building a long-term endowment only looks like the prudent thing to do, since the results of fundraising can be quite volatile and uncertain."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The WMF also has high-flying, global plans to “become the essential infrastructure of the ecosystem of free knowledge” by 2030. It says it wants to create “knowledge equity”—a world where people everywhere will have as much access to information in their own language as a first-world citizen—and that this will require continuous budget increases.Godspeed to them in this endeavor. I think this is not the time to become absolute purists in the choice of tech overlords. The tech world is being controlled by less than a handful of trillion-dollar monopolists that crush anything that stands in their way. A few hundred million in this war is a drop in the ocean.Yes, power corrupts, and money is power. Yes, left to their own devices, people in NGOs will maximize revenues and expand their employee empires - just like those in the for-profit sector. What matters is the strategic goals and their execution by the leadership, and there is nothing - absolutely nothing - to indicate that WMF went astray from its stated mission.I cannot but feel this is another pissing contest like the open source world experienced, where everybody and their brother started their own distributions/forks to virtue signal their true commitment to the open source goals. This led to a massive fragmentation of the scene, the few companies that tried to use the model, like Redhat and Ubuntu, were exposed as deviationists from the party line; meanwhile big tech ate the world and put every man, woman and child on the planet in invisible jails."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ridiculous question and even more ridiculous factoids.The assumption that operating as a non-profit implies an entity should stop asking its audience for help advancing the mission, or that it should pay its necessary staff less than competitive wages...please.Give wikipedia more so they can take on the MUCH more well-endowed and entirely opaque private capital taking over nearly every other information outlet in the US and often around the world."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The article suggests using a probabilistic failure model instead of a large a safety factor, and explains how a safety factor established in the 1930s affected the cost of the Space Shuttle. But spacecraft might be a special case, where any additional weight is so expensive, and you also expect the models to be especially accurate and manufacturing to be extremely precise.For more everyday civil engineering, I think the safety factor &#34;covers up&#34; a lot of systemic inaccuracies everywhere in the system, from modeling to design to manufacturing to unintended uses. Some of those you might account for in a probabilistic model. But it&#39;s very difficult to probabilistically model errors in the model itself, as the financial industry found out the hard way.When driving over a bridge built the way suggested here, how comfortable can we be that certain stresses aren&#39;t correlated in ways that the engineers didn&#39;t anticipate? Or that a certain distribution isn&#39;t actually as well approximated by a Gaussian as it was assumed to be? Intuitively, it&#39;s a lot harder to be wildly wrong with the factor of safety approach.To put this another way, a more complex way to reason about safety necessarily has more moving parts, and is thus more likely to be wrong. So in effect, adopting more complicated safety models introduces a safety risk all on its own. I think that needs to be considered as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Grossly increasing the factor of safety is a subtle way that science fiction stories connote a feeling of very advanced technology.For example in the JJ Abrams movie Star Trek Into Darkness we see the Enterprise operating at depth in an ocean, then dramatically zooming away into space. Then later another ship falls from orbital height and plows through San Francisco without losing its hull shape.In Star Wars the Millenium Falcon is constantly doing things that would seem to be outside a normal design for a spacecraft, and it survives (aside from the radar dish).Even as far back as the movie 2001, the monolith is made out of a material that humans can’t dent or cut. Why so strong? It’s basically just an automated radio.The idea is: this advanced civilization has such command over physical technology, that they can effortlessly engineer unnecessary strength without losing any of their designed performance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;&#34;&#34;A non-empirical alternative to the factor of safety has been around since the 1940s, but still doesn’t have widespread adoption. I think the image below describes the concept, called probabilistic design, best.&#34;&#34;&#34;This is _exactly_ LRFD (Load Factor Resistance Design) which has been in the Civil Engineering building codes since the mid 80&#39;s, and became common in use the 90&#39;s when I was an Engineer (in training).(It&#39;s the difference between the older green book and the newer (at the time) silver steel design handbook)It was absolutely drilled into us in school though, that Safety Factors and LRFD factors covered material and other uncertainty, they did not cover blunders."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m Danish and this is a big scandal, but the reality is, when the US asks you dance like the vassal state you are.We really shouldn’t have bought those f-35 planes either. They were more expensive, as in a gazillion times more expensive. The delivery schedule was already falling at the time. They were already terrible planes at the time compared to their competition. Most hilarious of all, they don’t actually fit into our small country because they are loud, so the government is still buying up properties in areas that they’ll have to fly over because the noise levels are so illegal they have to let people move away. They are also struggling with what to do with the airspace in one of our Airports, because the only two routes these planes have around it is over the ocean (fine but typically avoided during rain because of the low altitude they fly to avoid the airport) and our second largest city, ooops.Somehow it still won, to no ones surprise. And that’s really just how it is. The US wants bases in Greenland? Well, it’s technically not really Danish territory but we’ll make an exception and to full colonial masters. The US wants a radar thing in one of our commercial airports? Sure! (Since moved to another part of Europe). The us wants access to data on Moslem citizens? sure thing! The US wants direct access to the internet infrastructure? Well why not!I think the only thing we’ve ever really said no to was nuclear missiles."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;The inevitable has occurredThis makes it sound like it was some sort of an unique event. ISS has huge surface area, and MMOD impacts are practically routine, damaging all sorts of equipment - radiators, batteries, pumps, solar panels, and even heatshields and windows (Cupola windows got hit by debris a couple times, so now they are kept closed when not in use).https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/orbitaldebris2019/orbital2...&gt;The ISS impact database is maintained at the NASA/JSC by the Hypervelocity Impact Technology (HVIT) group. The database contains over 1,400 records of impact damage from ground-based observations of space-exposed hardware returned from ISS&gt;MMOD damage areas of interest acquired from EVA and IVA sources mentioned here are collected in an image database managed by the Image Science and Analysis Group at the Johnson Space Center (JSC). There are currently 380 records tagged as “MMOD” in the database, although it should be noted that some of these records include multiple MMOD damages (i.e., there are more than 380 MMOD impacts represented in this database).And that&#39;s only the detected ones. Even detecting the strikes in orbit is hard; automation of all sorts is being developed for this job. (strain sensors, microphones, ML-assisted visual analysis etc)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is a big BUG in marketing economics that we do not have a price for external Junk/Waste. This one organizations junk may be &#34;free&#34; to them, but cost another organization big amounts of work and hassle.Space junk is such an example. After you launch your satellite and it does it work and then becomes obsolete, there is very low to no incentive to remove the waste in a good manner.Nature usually works differently in that there is some kind of waste harvest process that recycles the waste into a renewable process."</p>

Apart from cross-device sync, you can share your albums end-to-end encrypted, and filter photos by location and time.We recently had a &#34;successful&#34; launch on r/degoogle[3].

								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you&#39;re willing to self-host, Photoprism[0] is pretty nice and easy to get up and running.It has the flavor of Google Photos, but it&#39;s definitely a step down in UX. One of the features I really love about Google Photos is the ability to jump quickly through time. Like if I&#39;m looking for a photo I took around June 2018, I can get to it in &lt;5 seconds.I didn&#39;t realize what a magical feature it is until I tried looking for it with alternatives and found that they all have a lot of scrolling, pausing to load new photos, more scrolling.But I&#39;m impressed with what Photoprism has achieved as a small, donation-funded OSS project, so I&#39;m hoping to see them grow.[0] https://photoprism.app"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This story is amazing. The story of US war games seems to commonly be &#34;Yeah the Read Team won but...&#34; and no changes are made. Maybe those are just the stories I hear.It&#39;s also interesting to consider if the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor would have happened if it weren&#39;t for our own dress rehearsals we carried out in front of the Japanese. Maybe war games are a bad idea when they&#39;re too big to keep secret and you&#39;re too politicized to integrate the lessons. Admiral Yamamoto didn&#39;t have to worry about upsetting US Navy top brass. He was able to benefit from our lessons, even if we weren&#39;t."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well, in retrospect it&#39;s easy to say that air power is the future and battleships are obsolete. But with the information available at the time, I don&#39;t think it really was that clear back in 1932. Back then, no capital ship had been sunk let alone been severely damaged(?) by aircraft. Aircraft, and in particular naval aircraft, at the time were flimsy biplanes, with monoplanes slowly entering the scene. Sinking a battleship with those? Pfft, entirely reasonably people said.I mean, put yourself into the hypothetical supreme naval planner of, say, the US or Japan at the time. Are you really going to gamble your entire nations (or empires, if you will) capability to project force overseas on the notion that air power is the future and battleships are obsolete? If you&#39;re wrong, the enemy battleship fleet will just shrug off your feeble aerial attacks and proceed to crush your navy and conquer your overseas assets.So in that sense it&#39;s no surprise that both USN and IJN built both battleships and carriers. And at least the US kept building them long after Pearl Harbor (though the Iowas were all ordered before Pearl Harbor, but they weren&#39;t cancelled in favor of carriers or converted into such either)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The desktop is broken not because of the file/folder paradigm but because we stopped using files to represent information. Figma, Slack, and Notion should save their information to disk. You should be able to open a Notion document, or a Figma design, from your desktop, instead of through their Web interface. You should be able to save a Facebook post or Tweet and their replies to disk.Why can&#39;t you? Well, for one, social media companies don&#39;t want you to save stuff locally, because they can&#39;t serve ads with local content. Furthermore, browser APIs have never embraced the file system because there is still a large group of techies who think the browser should be for browsing documents and not virtualizing apps (spoiler: this argument is dead and nobody will ever go back to native apps again). Finally, the file system paradigm fails with shared content; you can&#39;t save a Google Doc to disk because then how can your friends or coworkers update it? It&#39;s much easier for Google to store the data on their server so that everyone can access it instead of you setting up some god-awful FTP-or-whatever solution so that your wife can pull up the grocery list at the store.I&#39;m hoping the new Chrome file system API will bring a new era of Web apps that respect the file system and allow you to e.g. load and save documents off your disk. However, this still won&#39;t be good enough for multiplayer apps, where many devices need to access the same content at the same time. I don&#39;t know if there is any real way we can go back to the P2P paradigm without destroying NAT - WebRTC tries but WebRTC itself resorts to server-based communication (TURN) when STUN fails."</p>

I opened it because I had a task to complete and all this junk is getting in my way.And same when I close a program, as the author hits on very well.Basically, the computer/program/etc always wants me to do something for it, but it never asks for those things at an opportune time.No, I don&#39;t want to update my computer right now, and no, updating overnight tonight isn&#39;t good either because I need to keep this program running until tomorrow. I understand that your new UX is better for me, and I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll love it, but forcing that on me right now is preventing me from doing what I need to do. I see your error dialog describing some odd issue, but I don&#39;t have time to triage that right now and decide to take the time to fix it.I wish software would respect the human element more.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One thing I&#39;ve seen happen again and again in a lot of technologies is a &#34;framework gravity&#34;. A lot of people see this as engineers just wanting to work on &#34;hype&#34; technology but I think what is actually happening is a reflection of global engineering time.React is great for SPAs. Most large companies are working on honest-to-god SPAs. By extension most engineers are working on SPAs. So most tooling is created for SPAs. Now if you aren&#39;t building an SPA you look around and find almost every resource is around building an SPA. Even if you know you don&#39;t need an SPA, it&#39;s easier to hire, iterate, and even use other open source solutions if you are building an SPA, so you try to hamfist your project into an SPA.It&#39;s a bit like having a bike commute in America. A bike might be the best thing for you to do - cheaper than a car, keeps you healthy and you don&#39;t need a garage. But you quickly find that everything is built for cars and it&#39;s easier to deal with the disadvantages of a car than try to commute with a bike.I remember thinking the same thing about Hadoop 5-6 years ago. If you had &#34;small data&#34; you could get what you wanted with SQL and fast disks. But everything else assumed you were on Hadoop. Newgrads were trained in hadoop. New tools were Hadoop first. New research was all hadoop. If you hit a small issue with your DB, almost every solution would be &#34;this is how it&#39;s solved in Hadoop&#34;. It was hard to even know if what you were trying to do what even possible without Hadoop.The only optimism I have is that maybe in 5 years we will all collectively wake up and stop trying to shove React everywhere just like we stopped with Hadoop."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The amazing part to me is that SPAs are so much harder to do right compared to old-school server-side rendered HTML. One could be forgiven if they think a &#34;simple&#34; SPA is a good starter project, but they&#39;d be very wrong. Async programming (Javascript Promises and/or async/await) is difficult, error-prone, and should be avoided whenever possible. On top of this, understanding how data flows through these SPAs is no small task.Compare this to server-side rendering where you run some DB queries, generate some HTML based on those results, and send it to the browser to be rendered.There are some cases where you actually need a rich experience in the browser. In those cases, I would start by seeing if plain old Javascript would work.In writing this, I definitely feel like a &#34;get off my lawn&#34; guy. But I&#39;ve just seen too many junior and senior engineers (me included) fall flat on their face trying to use these SPA frameworks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As mostly a user that doesn&#39;t develop web apps anymore, all this feels very true to me.I&#39;m soooooo sick of interfaces that load an empty useless shell of UX chrome and then slowly trickle in content at some later time, and leave spinners, or even worse, gray boxes simulating text.Send the text content in the initial reply, please! It&#39;s bad enough having to wait for webfonts, but when you wait to start doing the slow database query for content until after an html shell has been loaded, and after a huge JavaScript bundle has been parsed and executed, you&#39;re just wasting time. Reminds me of the Google Web Toolkit of yore. We really haven&#39;t progressed much in the decade for single-page apps since then, when it comes to the user. And that&#39;s a horrifying thought."</p>
