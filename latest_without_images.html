								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The environment around Jd has changed a bit since it was young! Jsoftware[0] announced it in 2012, and this particular page has been effectively the same since it was created in 2017 (I suspect this was a page move, and the content is somewhat older). In these early days the column-oriented database was quickly gaining popularity but still obscure, which is why there&#39;s this &#34;Columnar&#34; section that goes to so much trouble to explain the concept. Now the idea is well known among database users and there are lots of other options[1].The history goes back further, because column-oriented is the natural way to build a database in an array language (making a performant row-oriented DBMS would be basically impossible). This is because a column can be seen as a vector where every element has the same type. A row groups values of different types, and array languages don&#39;t have anything like C structs to handle this. In J, Jd comes from Chris Burke&#39;s JDB proof-of-concept (announced[2] 2008, looks like), and the linked page mentions kdb+ (K) and Vstar (APL). KDB, first released in 1993, is somewhat famous and gets a mention on Wikipedia&#39;s history of column-oriented databases[3].[0] Company history: https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Jsoftware[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_column-oriented_DBMSes[2] https://code.jsoftware.com/wiki/JDB/Announcement[3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column-oriented_DBMS#History"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I did some work to compare Jd to data.tables and found that it was more performant in some instances such as on derived columns, and approximately equally performant on aggregations and queries. Jd is currently single-threaded, whereas multiple threads are important on some types of queries. I tried to further compare with Julia DB at the same time (maybe a year ago) and found that was incorrectly benchmarked by the authors and far slower than both; that might be different now. Jd is more equivalent to data.tables on disk; Clickhouse is far better at being a large-scale database.Rules of thumb on memory usage:
Python/Pandas (not memory-mapped): &#34;In Pandas, the rule of thumb is needing 5x-10x the memory for the size of your data.”
R (not memory-mapped): &#34;A rough rule of thumb is that your RAM should be three times the size of your data set.”
Jd:  &#34;In general, performance will be good if available ram is more than 2 times the space required by the cols typically used in a query.”Re CSV reading, Jd has a fast CSV reader whereas J itself does not. I have written an Arrow integration to enable J to get to that fast CSV reader and read Parquet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve programmed in J professionally (admittedly not for all that long) as a data scientist and, coincidentally, have just completed a small analysis using J as part of an internal workshop about data analysis I am planning. I typically work in R and Python and I have to say that at this stage there is almost no reason I would pick up J to do any work. Unless code-golf level conciseness is your only goal, these other platforms offer superior performance, clarity, ease of use, access to libraries and are, as programming languages, substantially better designed.I say this as a great lover of function-level programming and as a J enthusiast. I would say I am quite familiar with J&#39;s programming paradigm and conceptual widgets and doodads (I know the verbs, nouns, adverbs and conjunctions and can use them appropriately). I even remembered a pretty good portion of the Nuvoc. But doing even the simplest analysis in J was _excrutiatingly_ slow and inconvenient compared to using R and the tidyverse (in particular, I missed dplyr and ggplot). The tidyverse CSV readers are, for example, much faster and smarter and more convenient and informative than anything you&#39;ll get from the J universe.I love vector languages but at this point J can&#39;t compete with the major platforms for data analysis. Its less convenient, often _slower_, much more low level, strange, and its library situation is anemic at best. I recommend learning J because it will expand your mind, but I can&#39;t imagine picking it up for real work."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you want a decent dock you have to spend a bit of money. I went through this pain before accepting the cost and buying a CalDigit Thunderbolt 4 Element Hub[1]. Run&#39;s two 4k displays at 60Hz, any peripheral and charges my laptop.So good I bought a second.1. https://www.caldigit.com/thunderbolt-4-element-hub/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve gone through a number of Thunderbolt docks over the last few years. I tend to prefer docks to hubs because you tend to use your laptop at several fixed positions, each of which might have 1 or more monitors, a network cable, accessories (eg keyboard, mouse, camera) and so on. It&#39;s easier to just plug in one cable from the dock to the Macbook that&#39;ll do everything including power it.A good example of this is the Caldigit TS4 [1]. All the ports you could possibly want. Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve learned.First and foremost, you&#39;ll be surprised at how many issues come down to a given cable being bad. It&#39;s gotten to the point that whenever I buy any sort of cable I typically buy 2 or even 3 at the same time because I assume 1 will be bad or will go bad.Second, also to do with cables, don&#39;t use any cable to connect from your dock to your laptop longer than a foot. These cables that can take power and full bandwidth for displays and accesories are the most technically demanding. Keep them as short as possible. And again, have spares.Third, while I&#39;m a traditionalist and like a wired connection (and thus an Ethernet port), it&#39;s really optional now, particularly at home where you have some control over the network. Like I can get easily get 500+ Mbps over Wifi at home. This of course assumes a sufficient Internet connection but if you don&#39;t have that then Ehternet is even less necessary.If you have flickering display in particular, your first instinct should be to blame the cable.[1]: https://www.caldigit.com/thunderbolt-station-4/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; It honestly feels like no matter what you buy, you get more or less the same hardware, and you’re most likely getting a heavily overpriced product just because some company printed their logo on it.Isn&#39;t this like a known thing? Almost all peripherals on Amazon will have dozens of the exact same form-factor with different logos on it. You just buy the one that is the perfect intersection of costs, positive reviews, and shipping time. The assumption is that they all come from the same factory in China anyways."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wow, I love this. What a thoughtful, empathetic project. This passage really stuck out to me--&#34;A typical problem is that, in the absence of equations, they project literal meanings onto words such as ‘grains’ of space-time or particles ‘popping’ in and out of existence. Science writers should be more careful to point out when we are using metaphors. My clients read way too much into pictures, measuring every angle, scrutinising every colour, counting every dash. Illustrators should be more careful to point out what is relevant information and what is artistic freedom. But the most important lesson I’ve learned is that journalists are so successful at making physics seem not so complicated that many readers come away with the impression that they can easily do it themselves. How can we blame them for not knowing what it takes if we never tell them?&#34;Of course, this writing often isn&#39;t for the layperson, it&#39;s for an audience who can tell the difference between diagram, artistic license, and metaphor, but even so, it&#39;s good to think about, especially when communicating science to the general public."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is really interesting, I&#39;ll be forwarding to my science writer friends for opinions.Potentially interesting to some: we get the same phenomenon right here on HN regularly! To someone an advanced understanding of music theory (including western harmony, tuning systems, acoustics, psychoacoustics, doing a graduate degree, etc) HN is a regular source of armchair music theorists putting forth their own musical grand unified theories of everything without understanding the foundations. I guess, much like the field the author works in, the nature of it is that a strong understanding of a small piece leads one to easily believe there is this neat and tidy system of well behaving patterns when the reality is vastly more complex. I&#39;d say once a week or so I see posts on HN that are the musical equivalents. I used to answer with pointers to what one might want to learn or suggests books, but really, I have no idea what the right response to that sort of thing is. It&#39;s way, way more complicated than one would think coming from a tangentially related field. Perhaps similarly, the popular music theory writing out there creates the same effect."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Science writers should be more careful to point out when we are using metaphors.I think she should replace &#34;science writers&#34; with physicists. In my experience, it&#39;s when physicists give overflowing and superfluous explanations of things that cause the most trouble, because they are viewed as authorities. Neil deGrasse Tyson, Michio Kaku, Brian Greene, PBS Space Time, and many others. It&#39;s interesting, because I once read an interview with Brian Green, and the question was: what career would you have chosen if you weren&#39;t a physicist? His answer was both surprising and unsurprising: a Baptist preacher. One should note that he actually has the speaking style of one.It brings up an interesting point in that physics at the highest level sounds almost like what ill-informed amateurs produce. I have degrees in mathematics and some understanding of physics, but I&#39;ve watched a few lectures of Ed Witten before, and he might as well be just making it all up. I know, it can all be backed out such that it all follows from known mathematics and physics, but one does have to marvel at the similarity, and I think this is what so-called cranks get emboldened by. It makes it worse when physicists use words like &#34;believe&#34;.I think physicists have done a poor job explaining that what they do is model building. The models are not reality. What reality is currently lies in the realm of philosophy. The models physicists build are simply our best descriptions based on what we observe (string theory aside). The article gets at this a bit with mentioning metaphors, but it still doesn&#39;t drive home the point because she&#39;s referring to metaphors of metaphors (i.e., metaphors for the physical models). Once you understanding that physics is about building models that describes what we observe in physical reality, it lowers the barrier of &#34;authority&#34;. In that, in some sense, the entire point of physics is often to find out how we&#39;re wrong just as much as it is to clarify where we&#39;re right. I think many don&#39;t understand that when &#34;is&#34; is used in physics, it really means &#34;is modeled by&#34; (or something to that effect).I&#39;m reminded of this scene from one of my favorite movies, A Serious Man: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzWYjVrvpI"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; I bought him a Chromebook for schoolwork, but also for other private things. When we logged in...This is why you need to pay attention to the technology choices that you make, and that your schools make. Chromebooks are designed from the ground up to be locked-down dystopian spyware once you &#34;log in&#34; to them with a specific Google account. For heaven&#39;s sake stop buying any more Chromebooks.The correct solution here is not technological at all. Call into the school&#39;s board meeting during public comment, and make it loud and clear that the school is installing spyware on students&#39; Chromebooks. Share your technical credentials and the method by which you found this. Emphasize stories of previous data breaches involving educational companies [1], and show officials that they are putting students&#39; sensitive data at risk. (Edit: See the important point in the reply from &#39;n8cpdx below about the correct tone to use in your comments – don&#39;t repeat my words verbatim!)The technical details don&#39;t matter too much to educational officials – as soon as the &#34;Chromebook = bad spyware&#34; label sticks and they think that a fuck-up here could cost them them bad press, they will allow their IT department to make more privacy-respecting technology choices even when those choices cost a little more. If no one speaks up, it&#39;s a race to the bottom driving us closer to the fiction in The Right to Read [2].----------------------------------------[1] https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/smarterselect-exposed-mill...[2] https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/right-to-read.en.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I work for a school district (not CPS) with about 2000 deployed Chromebooks and you&#39;re likely running into one of two things.1) You somehow &#39;enrolled&#39; the device into the Chromebook management.  This is hard to do by mistake but if you do, essentially puts the device under the control of the school district.  It also uses up a license on their end.  We only allow particular IT only accounts to enroll devices.
2) You&#39;re logging in with their CPS account.  Once a person logs in with their managed account it can deploy user level policies that include everything you described: extensions, filtering, and blocking signing into another account in the browser.  You&#39;ll also find some random pages are blocked to keep students from bypassing the restrictions.That you can wipe the machine makes me think you didn&#39;t enroll it - if you wipe an enrolled device it will prompt/force you to re-enroll.
You should be able to reboot the device so you land at the login screen and hit &#34;Add Person&#34; down at the bottom.  From there sign in with a different Google account and it should be completely unaffected by any policy the school is deploying.  Unless you enroll it, the policies are deployed to the Google account, not the device.Its likely the CPS Help Desk Staffer you reached doesn&#39;t have the power to fix things for you if you&#39;ve enrolled things - that usually requires permissions that are restricted to a few admins.Feel free to shoot me a message via the email in my profile - I&#39;m happy to give you some of the inside perspective and help you figure it out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a longtime armchair attorney who has closely read summaries of cases like this on Slashdot for well over the past decade (IANAL, BTW)...you could go the lawyer route but this basically amounts to your kid being a minor in school which means they don&#39;t have full legal rights, and the interpretation of 4A is likely up in the air here anyway. Constitutional rights don&#39;t necessarily apply at school or anywhere near school (see bongrips4jesus case), your kid is a minor anyway (another special case), and a school doing this for the sake of &#34;preventing cheating&#34; may not fall under the umbrella of unreasonable search.There was a PA school district back around 2009 that issued laptops to students preloaded with spyware that let school staff watch students through the webcam, while the students were at home and not doing schoolwork. Neither the students or parents were informed of this. IIRC the FBI got involved but nobody actually got in any real trouble, I&#39;m not even sure they were fired.I wish things weren&#39;t this way. You could maybe use Wireshark and black hole anything the spyware tries to connect to at the router, or maybe add the addresses to the hosts file on the machine itself (not sure if ChromeOS lets you do this)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a useful analysis of what &#34;being an adult&#34; means. I&#39;ve noticed that the moment when I feel like avoiding social discomfort or potential conflict as the precise moment when I have a choice: either be an adult and understand what I want and communicate it, or avoid it and dislike myself and project those feelings onto others.Invariably when I choose to behave like an adult I feel empowered and ultimately at peace with myself and others in the end. If I choose avoidance, resentment builds, and further avoidance follows.The idea that avoidance behaviors can be selfish or agreeable cuts through much self-deception. This can be helpful when I tell myself &#34;I&#39;m just being nice&#34; because it adds the proviso: &#34;yeah, but I&#39;m not being an adult.&#34; Which I could see being a really helpful inner monologue in those situations.This is also intimately connected to the concept of &#34;taking responsibility&#34;, which begins with not avoiding something which &#34;someone else&#34; might deal with so you don&#39;t have to."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just an observation, n=1; when I moved to Los Angeles to go to school, I was shocked to find that people cancelled plans on me all the time. At first I took it personally, because that didn&#39;t happen in the more rural town I&#39;m from. But then I realized: its part of the culture, and maybe its just an attribute of very dynamic urban social networks, where an exciting new opportunity might pop up any moment. So I learned to not get my hopes up, and learned to cancel on others too without worrying about it over much.When I moved back to rural California, people thought I&#39;d become a jerk. Took me a while to shift back."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like this article, but I wish it was phrased &#34;are you being a baby&#34; instead of &#34;are you a baby&#34;. Labeling oneself as wholly a particular attribute is one of the mechanisms by which anxiety takes root: you _are_ or _aren&#39;t_ something, full stop. Labeling actions or states shifts your mindset so that you can clearly see this is something you&#39;re free to change. It&#39;s the sort of thing that makes no difference at a factual level (they&#39;re logically equivalent! right!?) but emotionally the tone shift makes a huge difference."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This study shows that 25% of Twitter users send 97% of all tweets:
https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/new-study-shows-that-2...And some 80% of that are retweets or replies, not original tweets.Most people do not use Twitter at all. When they do use it, it is mostly read-only. When it&#39;s not read-only, it&#39;s most retweeting stuff.You can&#39;t deny that Twitter has an outsized cultural influence, but the underlying reality is sobering. It&#39;s not a &#34;speech&#34; platform for the masses as no actual speech happens by the masses themselves. If the retweet button were to be removed, the platform would collapse.It&#39;s not surprising that the masses don&#39;t post. You can&#39;t express yourself on Twitter due to the character limit, so all you can do is witty superficial takes. Threading and replies are a disaster making a structured discussion impossible. These two things alone make the platform useless for most speech purposes.And let&#39;s not forget the sour atmosphere of extreme hostility, permanent outrage, bad faith discussions, smearing, doxxing, cancellations, the culture is terrible.Back on point, I think Twitter has a far bigger problem than a free speech problem. There is very little speech and it excessively rewards the most unreasonable speech."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lots of people have high hopes about this development. However, the funny thing about all this is how the center of power is somehow moving to big tech - meaning that the rich guys with the big yachts are kind of in charge of The Show. Does that remind anyone of those Russian oligarchs? I mean, i mean that there&#39;s some kind of pattern here: the oligarchs get to run the show, then there is some sort of crisis, the oligarchs pick some side kick from the province to fill in the vacancy of frigging dictator, however the dictator eventually manages to kick out all of the oligarchs... Happened in Germany, happened in Russia, will you get something like this in the States too? (the problem seems to be that ollies have a problem because they lack legitimacy, they therefore tend to delegate power to some dictator, who they think can be controlled on their part, however eventually this turns out to be a miscalculation)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; The major goal of the program, Amazon’s head of worldwide consumer business, Dave Clark, said, was to reduce employee attrition by fostering happiness among workers — and also productivity. Shout-Outs would be part of a gamified rewards system in which employees are awarded virtual stars and badges for activities that “add direct business value,” documents state. At the meeting, Clark remarked that “some people are insane star collectors.”Truly insane, there is nothing stranger (or more dystopian) than fiction after all. Rather than fix the system of working their employees to death (literally in the case of the tornado) or improving their conditions, Amazon tries to use virtual gold stars (not even physical stickers like kindergarten) as a band-aid. That list of banned words is right out of 1984 (as cliché as it is to reference at this point): ethics, fairness, freedom.I cannot imagine anyone here seriously defending this unless you’re just looking to be a contrarian. This is not “par for the course” for manual labor jobs as some people are claiming. Most manual labor jobs do not restrict you from talking about ethics or justice with your coworkers or have even a need for some virtual gold stars beyond a little whiteboard in the building with number of sales, employee of the month, etc. The fact that these techniques won’t work for Amazon just shows that their laborers are really over-worked compared to the norm. Unfortunately, Amazon is able to use their massive resources and capital to pay just more than the local factory, packing gig, etc. so they have a stream of desperate people willing to take it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I spent five years in the Air Force. Posts like this are really helpful, a lot of Americans are disconnected from members of the military, especially in the upper classes where people do not need to serve, or in fields (like tech) where people can often find less intrusive ways to pay for college. My favorite part of the article is dispelling the myth that in the military senior people bark orders, and don&#39;t ask for feedback, and subordinates dutifully carry out those orders. None of those is true. There is a time to &#34;shut up and color&#34; but that is by far the exception. For the young people on here, I can&#39;t tell you what to do, but I can tell you serving in the military was a positive experience for me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The most important thing to realize about military service is that you sign away all your citizenship rights (free speech, etc.) when you sign up for the service.  Hopefully you won&#39;t be used in ridiculous debacles like the 2003 Iraq Invasion, based on lies about WMDs pushed by Washington (and see British role as well), but you&#39;ll have no say in the matter.The other thing to realize is that, at least in the USA, they&#39;ll do everything they can to deny you medical benefits for injuries suffered in basic training, and this will persist after you get out, i.e. Veteran&#39;s Administration health care is pretty poor by all accounts.  You can&#39;t just trust the system to look out for your interests in this area.In addition, the &#39;educational assistance&#39; is barely enough for a two-year vocational training program, certainly nowhere near enough for a full four-year college degree.  It&#39;s better than nothing, certainly, but the advertising and the reality have a big disconnect.If you&#39;re a teenage with zero alternative options and are completely desperate for a way out of an urban slum nightmare or a poverty-stricken rural life, the military is there as an option.  I was once in a similar situation but I rejected military service because I&#39;d heard too many Vietnam vets tell horror stories about how they&#39;d been treated by the military.  It wasn&#39;t much better for those who had to serve more recently in Afghanistan and Iraq, for equivalently dubious reasons."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If I knew my country&#39;s armed forces were 100% a domestic defense and emergency response force, I would absolutely have considered signing up when I was young. You learn good skills, and I see great value in some larger-than-self contribution to community there. My father is German and left Germany for good not long after doing his compulsory 1 year service. He hated it, and it was one of many factors that led to him emigrating. But one thing my aunts have told me is that before he joined he was a disorganized messy irresponsible person, and afterwards he was neat and structured. He is also an amazing marksman, which he learned there (before he left they were talking to him about advancing him through sniper training). He amazed my Canadian uncles when he went hunting with them.But even here, in Canada, the armed forces gets involved in adventures abroad which I can would characterize as &#34;dubiously thought through&#34; at best ... but &#34;blatantly imperialist&#34; at worst. Being deployed to Afghanistan or some other adventure that I could not support would both enrage and depress me."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I made the mistake and told the truth one time early in my career.I got fired, err... I wasn&#39;t retained after a multi-month temp period, and was brought in to be fired, then exit interviewed.I was upset, but stuck to the truth. My direct boss was passive aggressive, didn&#39;t like me, and excluded me from the team. His code was awful, in the long term wasn&#39;t maintainable, and wouldn&#39;t be able to meet the needs of the road map because of poor design decisions. Some cliques had formed to the determent of the tiny company.Unfortunately after that exit interview, it became extremely difficult for me to get work in that community. Unknown to me at the time, I made an enemy of my direct boss, who had much deeper connections with that area tech community than I ever could have imagined. I only found out after making friends with someone else who told me they had heard nothing but bad things about me.It was a lesson learned. After a many years, and a move, it is no longer a problem, but it derailed me for quite a while."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don’t think they are a trap. You can make constructive criticism without being personal. A lot of times middle management is implementing policy that it didn’t have a say in.At the end of the day, everyone is human, and most people are more concerned with handling their own problems than making life hard for others.And if the company has a functional business quality plan, they should be reviewing data from all the exit interviews on a regular basis (maybe quarterly or semi annual). You are just one data point. No matter how brilliant you think you are, they are going to be looking for major trends. Like, everyone made lateral moves for more pay, maybe our pay scales aren’t  competitive, or we aren’t recognizing success appropriately.The exit interview isn’t like pointing at the ship’s unmanned helm and letting the watch officer know the pilot has been in the head for 2 quarters."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You should definitely go to an exit interview.In the case of a sour breakup, you should 100% lie. Just say it was great but you were in need for a change. Don&#39;t dramatize the lying part because you lied to get in and the employer lied about how great their company is. Work is a lie, play the game.In the case of a drama-free breakup, when pressed for feedback and the room being receptive of it, do share your thoughts. But toned down, in a light hearted manner. Comment on things and processes, not people. This gives the impression &#34;helpful until the end&#34;.Both ways are a clean exit, with no bridges burned. There might come a time in your life where you&#39;re less desirable on the market, having intact relations can make a huge difference then.You should internalize the dishonesty as a type of strength, because that&#39;s what it is in this context. In a sour breakup, you&#39;re given the perfect opportunity for revenge, with little immediate consequences.Your ex-boss Tim is an asshole. He knows he is. And you know he is. You now have the opportunity to finally say it to his face.Applying silence in this situation is powerful. It says so much more. I could harm you right now, but I chose not to. This radiates self control, which is widely respected. Meanwhile, Tim was looking forward to a good burn and argument, but didn&#39;t get any. He feels submissive, like a Roman emperor giving him a thumbs up, allowed to live another day.And that&#39;s how you play it. Alternatively, you can be 21 years old and post on Medium &#34;7 reasons why I quite company X after 8 months&#34;. Let me know how that goes."</p>
