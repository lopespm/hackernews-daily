								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I guess this is the end of &#34;sending customer data to the us&#34;.
Quite impressive how fast the US-politics can burn billions in $, endanger the technological lead and build a massive opportunity for Europe!I, as a European could not be happier about this, from a economic standpoint.Hope you guys over there are not drifting to a surveillance dystopian."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"US folks who are interested in writing their Senators can find information at https://www.senate.gov/senators/senators-contact.htm?OrderBy...FWIW, I sent the email below (largely cribbed from the EFF).Dear :I am a constituent.  I urge you to oppose the EARN IT act, S.3538.  It does not strike a reasonable balance between fighting crimes and the rights of users to privacy and encryption.The bill empowers every state or territory to create sweeping new Internet regulations, by stripping away the legal protections for websites and apps in Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. The states will be allowed to pass whatever law they want to hold private companies liable, as long as they somehow relate their new rules to online child abuse.The bill’s sponsors have stated that EARN IT will pressure Internet companies to do widespread scanning of user messages and photos. This scanning is incompatible with strong encryption.  Consequently, the act allows states to pass laws that will punish companies when they deploy end-to-end encryption, or offer other encrypted services. This includes messaging services like WhatsApp, Signal, and iMessage, as well as web hosts like Amazon Web Services.The sponsors have falsely claimed that the act would protect children. But abusive images are already highly illegal under federal law. Any Internet platforms that knows about child sexual abuse material being distributed or received are required to take action on it, and can be severely prosecuted if they do not.EARN IT would lead to penalties for people and companies that use encryption.  The harm done by this will fall on vulnerable people. Once we allow encryption to be compromised in order to scan for one thing, authoritarian regimes will demand the same capabilities to track information shared by activists and journalists. Another example is that people subject to domestic abuse, including children, won’t have secure channels of communication to report and reach out for trusted help.Once again, I urge you to oppose the EARN IT act.Thank you,"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was very interested by the question, and closed the page after skimming through the first screen: why is there any need to scenarize? why would I want to read about some guys in a bar? Can&#39;t we make it interesting to talk about what it really means for a device to &#34;listen on port x&#34;? In my experience (listening to Collège de France podcasts), any topic, even the most obscure and narrow field of knowledge, say &#34;Late Babylonian scriptures as seen by Ibn Amhoud during 8th Century&#34; (invented), can be made a thrilling experience if the speaker is really passionate and knowledgable about it. But there is never any need to start by a conversation at starbucks: one just dive in head first. &lt;/rant&gt;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For me SO_REUSEPORT was only a solution to be able to immediately reuse a port when a process crashed in some odd way and the OS was not releasing the port immediately.When I read that multiple processes can use the port it finally made sense to me how nginx is able to spawn so many workers. If they are listening to port 80 or 443 with SO_REUSEPORT, each worker would get a new client in a round robin fashion, effectively spreading the workload without depending on the main parent process to pipe the data to them (and back to the client), which is how I thought that it was working.The funny thing about this submission was that when I read the title I somehow thought I was reading it on Stack Overflow and was expecting a noob asking this question and didn&#39;t know what kind of answers I was about to be confronted with and if I should get excited to see a really good one.Then, while in the article, I liked how it started to raise so many issues, fanning out into these special cases which really made it a valid question to ask what it does mean to listen to a port, how complicated it can become.Sadly the article does not go into any detail, like showing snippets of C code from the networking stack and explaining how it is really working, how each requirement (or kluge, for that matter) is being satisfied, but it&#39;s OK, it&#39;s an article which touches the subject in an enticing enough way while having an excuse to not deep-dive into the details by keeping it in the form of a dialog between two students.I liked it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What is strange about Discord is this great discrepancy between the ones that love it and the ones that hate it. If I were to guess on the reason of why that might be it would be that Discord is probably really good for the people that are constantly on it, and don&#39;t really miss any communication going in. These people have probably been there for some time so they don&#39;t feel the problem of not knowing where the past information is, because they were there when that information was communicated and therefore never need to look back at it. These people will (obviously) recommend using Discord, since it works so well for them!The problem arises when you have people that just now-and-then hop into the Discord. These people are not in the &#34;clique&#34; so they don&#39;t feel comfortable talking/discussing too much in the channels, and they also really have no clue where to go for any of the lost information these super users don&#39;t even think about. This is probably why I never really use Discord except for voice, since I just don&#39;t get anything at all from reading an endless chat log. It&#39;s like being someone stepping in to a tight knit friend group with a long history and no way of looking into it.Discord will most likely have to figure out how they can keep it so that it works for these super users, but somehow make the information organized for people that aren&#39;t hard core community members.Edit: Wrote &#34;clique&#34; wrong"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Endless scrolling is a black hole for information. And the hawking radiation that comes out is keyboard diarrhea.If I were trying to subtly encourage pounding out content free crap, I would probably want people to use difficult to search, non paginated scroll feeds as much as possible.Discord might be a black hole, but Discourse has some of the same properties. Facebook is the same way.Anything that funnels people into multi-thousand post individual pages is going to lose information.Old proboards forums, github issues, and wikis don&#39;t have this problem.  Content is in smaller blocks that can be linked to easily, and there is a strong culture of keeping topics focused.  You don&#39;t have multiple unrelated conversations in one place.You can jump to the end or beginning of a thread when quickly skimming to see if it&#39;s relevant.And you can see all threads in a given time period pretty easily with pagination, when you want to understand the larger picture at a point and time.These are all things that are useful both for a sense of community and for technical work itself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a strong believer in Zulip with respect to a perfect mix between instant messaging and actually retaining information- functionality for a public export (can also restrict to specific channels), .e.g. https://leanprover-community.github.io/archive/- in addition to the above, they are working on a guest mode, so you can read the discussions without logging in -- hopefully that would make it possible to index without setting up a separate archive hosting https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/13172- messages/threads have proper meaningful URLs (unlike random obfuscated UUIDs like in Discord)- you can easily open things in new tabs -- unlike Discord, where search pane takes like 10% of the screen, or Slack where once you clicked on search result, you lose the context about the remaining results- you can login with Github (so no need to register for many people, at least for programming-related projects)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember walking down the main street in my hometown on my way to drink at a bar and seeing saurik and some friends at a bars all with their laptops out and hacking on something.  What caught my eye was a terminal open and a Vim session.  I walked up and we all chatted for a bit.  Back in the day you didn&#39;t run into that very often where we lived so it was pretty cool to see.  That boosted my conviction for my choice of IDE and I started bringing my laptop out to the bars in the evenings as well.  Years later my friend and I built a business and pretty much all the code was written in the evenings at one of those bars.  You can be social and code at the same time it turns out, and coding prevented me from drinking too much while I was out.  No real morale to the story, just an anecdote I wanted to share.  That said, congrats on the bounty saurik!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I grew up in Egypt, my dad is from a town on the Suez Canal called Ismailia, famous for its mangoes. We would wait the whole year for mango season (August/September). As kids, our clothes would all get mango stains. Our parents would make us take our shirts off before we eat them to avoid that.I moved to the US, and I haven&#39;t had a good mango here. When friends visit Egypt, I tell them to get mangoes (in season, around September), especially a variety known as Eweis. They get obsessed. I&#39;ve never figured out why the US just doesn&#39;t have good mangoes, I&#39;m guessing they&#39;re hard to grow locally or ship."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For growing mango from seed, or really anything from seed, you cannot beat a small plastic container (like what cottage cheese, sour cream, or green yogurt might come in) filled halfway with coconut coir. It&#39;s absolutely the best medium for germinating seed. Fill halfway with coir and water once a week. Coconut coir keeps water evenly distributed and I&#39;ve never had a seed or seedling mold over using it.I personally use 2 lb greek yogurt (or soup, as in from Costco) containers because the extra height also lets me keep the seed in there longer and develop initial root structure. That&#39;s incredibly helpful for transferring to pots, and a little coconut coir in the soul doesn&#39;t hurt."</p>

This is an important benchmark, I understand scientific journals don&#39;t cater to laypeople but popular media does.From CDC website: &#34;Studies have shown that flu illness is associated with an increase in heart attacks and stroke.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In my mind, state is the real enemy impacting: comprehension, 
brittleness towards making changes, and the surface area exposed to potential bugs. OOP as frequently implemented, while claiming to encapsulate state, ends up creating so much more.In accordance with this view, I think project architecture should be approached with an emphasis around how much state is necessary for it to run. This is why simulations like say someone making a game or simcity with like relatively independent entities that map to something in real life use OOP. If you&#39;re writing a service doing requests, you want as minimal state as possible. Singletons are state. Initialized/non-static objects are state. The smaller amount you have the easier it is to reason about the system.As I write this however, I worry a little that my view is overly simplistic, or maybe applicable only to domains that I have worked in. If anyone wouldn&#39;t mind poking holes in this argument or offering examples I would appreciate it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have not read the article but I&#39;ve seen other blog posts on the subject.
The issue with &#34;OOP is bad&#34; is that OOP means different things to different people.Abstract Data Types are sort of a subset of OOP and are massively useful, I certainly don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea to expose the internal implementation of a data structure most of the time. Any sort of plugin system works in an OO matter. It is a useful tool, no question.Even things like Actors like in Erlang (which are much closer to the Alan Kay style OO) are massively useful in a distributed setting where state is naturally distributed.Where you get into trouble is when you go the whole &#34;lets model a taxonomy of the world&#34; style with inheritance hierarchies or go ham on design patterns, layers upon layers of abstraction and other nonsense like that.The saddest thing about the &#34;object–relational impedance mismatch&#34; is that the focus went totally to the wrong side. The relational model is a much nicer way to model relations than a graph of objects (that&#39;s the whole point after all). SQL sucks but that&#39;s a separate issue, Entity Component Systems are a form of relational modeling for example and work really well, or even better Datalog."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My issue with OOP is: Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software.I don&#39;t take issue with the authors, with their insights, or anything related to the content of the book. It&#39;s that the book exists at all: it&#39;s a book filled with solutions to imaginary problems.When using a procedural language the first thing you do is start implementing a solution. When using OOP, you first have to solve the imaginary problems created by OOP, only then can you start down the path of typing out a solution.It&#39;s significantly more difficult to refactor OOP (even with great tools) than it is procedural.If you could spend 20% less brain power, possibly 40% fewer keystrokes to describe the exact same solution, why wouldn&#39;t you?"</p>
