								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been an Amazon SDE and an Amazon SDM. I enjoyed my time as an SDE, luckily free from these horror stories. After having been an SDM, I understand how these horror stories can form.Generally, Amazon has two minds about performance management. In written documentation, it&#39;s all about whether your reports meet the role guidelines. The written documentation is solid. They share how to evaluate people objectively and how to minimize bias. Verbally, it&#39;s all about numbers and probability. The organization wants X number of people to leave this year, to do that they want Y number of people in performance improvement plans.There is an intense pressure to force a certain amount of attrition each year. While Amazon may claim stack ranking doesn&#39;t exist, Amazon uses rating and calibration mechanisms to learn who you think as a manager are your lowest performers. As a manager, you get verbal (never written) lashings from your manager and skip manager to put the lowest performers on performance plans that ensure that any attrition counts. As soon as you capitulate, your lowest performer is now considered a low performer.As an SDM, I wanted to maintain the illusion of great Amazon culture for my team. Behind the scenes, I spent a lot of time advocating for my team and trying to poke holes in the performance ratings of other teams. It was exhausting. There are certainly a lot of shortcuts I could have taken like putting potential internal transfers on performance management, but did not. I feel bad for the LinkedIn poster here, I think he had a lazy manager."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve worked at Amazon. I made it a few years, but was almost pipped in the first few months. Management dropped a huge project on me, a brand new tier 1 service, with full dns resolution, api, database, distributed system, along with micro services. The deadline was three months. Brand new tech stack. When I was struggling to meet the deadline, we started having “performance conversations”.I ended up switching teams and had a decent time at the company, but the nightmare situations are very real. You are replaceable and there’s no mercy"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some people meet this with a healthy level of scepticism, which is great. However I used to work at Amazon, working on the performance evaluation and HR tools used within the company. It was a couple of years back, but I am fairly certain that the same tools are still used, given that all of them were developed from scratch. At the time it was in line with the company&#39;s PR of removing its toxic work culture.It&#39;s worth mentioning that it wasn&#39;t uncommon for people to move around teams, and to be honest HR is not the most exciting field for software development anyways. So, as expected, the HR dev teams had people move around quite a bit. Nothing toxic so far.One of the projects I worked on was what used to be called the dev list or personal improvement plan (pip) now renamed to Pivot. Most likely the exact same same tool. Management wanted to update the processes in order to automate as much as possible and reduce the risk of managers putting someone in pip, just because they didn&#39;t like them. However the process was set up in such a way that a manager can progress an employee through a pip for waaaay too long, until a failsafe, or a second pair of eyes even takes a look at it. I, personally, voiced my concerns about it, but it was shrugged off as &#34;it shouldn&#39;t happen&#34;, &#34;managers wouldn&#39;t do that&#34; and &#34;it&#39;s fine&#34; by the project stakeholders.The project starts, development is going a usual and a couple of years go by. I moved to another project within the HR space. Most of the team developing the tool has also moved on to greener pastures. Apart from that one guy, who has been there since its inception. He went from being a backend engineer, learning React and painstakingly working on a messy frontend codebase, eventually leaving him the only person competent enough to make changes to it. Eventually he was fed up and wanted to move to a different team. Lo and behold - his manager, the manager of the team building the pip tool, put him in pip to prevent him from moving. Haven&#39;t seen someone decide and actually leave a company as quickly as he did. So if the manager of the pip company can use it to blackmail people not to leave, I can&#39;t even imagine what it&#39;s like for the rest of the company."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Google searches for React and node.js exceed searches for Ruby on Rails by 100% and 50%, respectively [1]. Some people have used this to argue that React/node are more popular than Rails. But I wonder if perhaps this discrepancy appears in Google Trends because it takes more google searches to accomplish the same thing in React/node versus Rails. I feel the Rails ethos of &#34;convention over configuration&#34; allows me to accomplish the same objective with less googling.[1] https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?cat=31&amp;date=today%2..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used to write Rails professionally for many yearsThis comparison isn&#39;t a good one. Rails is an all-encompasing framework.If you compare Rails to something like Nest.js, there&#39;s not much you&#39;re missing. Nest is one of the best application frameworks I&#39;ve used in any language, and it comes with all this stuff you say JS doesn&#39;t have.---EDIT: To clarify (because it is confusingly named), NestJS is a framework modeled after Spring Boot for TypeScript + Node:https://nestjs.com/Not to be confused with Next.js, which is a framework for building SSR React apps."</p>

But while you&#39;re still writing thousands of lines of boilerplate in both the front and back ends, and getting your types sorted out, I&#39;m done with my app, and moving on to the next one."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Last night I watched a YouTube video that had a song in the background that I hadn&#39;t heard but really liked. I pulled up Shazam but it didn&#39;t recognize the song, so I took to Google. I entered the lyric and added the search terms &#34;lyrics&#34; and &#34;r&amp;b&#34; at the end. Google returned 4 YouTube videos to songs that didn&#39;t contain the lyric, a link to a Boyz II Men song on Genius that didn&#39;t contain the lyric (good job Google, you know an R&amp;B band), a link to peterbe.com to find a song by lyrics, and a bunch of other useless links. I clicked on to page 2, which hilariously presented 3 of the 4 YouTube videos that were on page 1.I was immediately turned off, so I pulled up DuckDuckGo and Bing, entered the same exact query, and both engines returned the song I was looking for in the first result. I laughed out loud.I then thought to myself, &#34;I wonder how many pages I would have had to flip through in Google to find this result.&#34; Eventually, I found it. It was the 68th result on page 7."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m just gonna throw this out there as I&#39;m noticing it more and more at this point since switching languages.What the actual F has happened to google search results for programming issues?I used to be able to google a question and get, more or less, a right answer from a forum or stack overflow.Recently, many coding tutorial websites have clearly figured out how to hack googles pageranks and now instead of one &#39;right enough answer&#39;, its 5 clone &#39;tutorial&#39; websites, with all the same crappy answer that isn&#39;t actually what I was asking. Like I can&#39;t use google for coding questions any more. Not like I was able to previously. Also, Stackoverflow with bangs from ddg are broken and it thinks I&#39;m a robot. No answer except to go to SO directly and search."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just as I saw this link a notification popped up on my Pixel phone:&gt; Trending: &#34;Turkey inflation rate&#34;
&gt; See search resultsI&#39;ve already put a lot of effort into purging as many categories of Google spam notifications from my phone as possible, but they just keep adding new categories that I have to track down and opt out of individually. And the only way to silence them from the notification itself is to block all notifications from that app/service.I paid good money for this phone — just stop with the OS-integrated spam! It&#39;s a never ending game of spam whackamole with Google these days. I guess various product owners are incentivised to increase &#34;engagement&#34; or whatever, but right now they&#39;re just increasing my engagement with Apple&#39;s product pages."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m shocked those defending the Apple tax aren&#39;t considering the fact that businesses are just offloading that tax onto consumers making things artificially more expensive for iOS users. Even worse, when you do this you can&#39;t communicate why this is the case or tell people you can use the web for cheaper so users feel like you&#39;re just scamming them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Apple allows “free apps” that are entirely ad-supported, never giving Apple a dime (aside from $99/year), yet they are consuming infrastructure: hosting pages, downloads, reviewer time, etc.  Why isn’t Apple concerned about any of those costs?  Simple: they make overwhelmingly most of their App Store money from the handful of developers that offer purchases.  This also leads to perverse outcomes like Apple dragging its feet on scams that make them heaps of money.Developers are literally subsidizing other developers, and it’s not necessarily the richest ones helping the poorest ones.  Someone trying to make money on a $0.99 app is sacrificing more to Apple than Facebook does with their free app.That’s why I find all these percentage and payment discussions weird: income is so insanely distributed that a lot of this literally does not apply to more than 80% of the stuff on the store.  There are fundamental issues that need to be resolved too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What people want is to stop being forced to pay Apple’s 15-30%.Alternative payment processors were never going to accomplish that, as this case shows. You can make Apple accept alternative payment processors, but that doesn’t really change the price they set for using their store.Unless you want to abandon a free market economy, a government can’t force a company to provide a certain service at a certain price. Squeeze one spot with regulation and a company will extract more revenue from another. Squeeze everywhere and a company will leave the market.What they should do is force Apple to allow competing stores.Apple can keep it’s 15-30%… if it can compete at that level. If not, it will have to adjust, by either offering something more compelling to developers or charging them less. And if Apple can’t do well enough, and pulls back from its app store, then, well, iPhone users will still have the stores of all those stronger competitors to choose from.We don’t have to wonder what a platform with a competing sources for software looks like. We have a bunch of them, and they seem to work well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a rough datapoint, I run a consumer targeted e-commerce site. We ran a campaign before Christmas were we were selling a new product that was only marketed on Facebook, we are certain that (almost) all customers found it though that Facebook campaign. Facebook was only able to attribute about 50% of the sales to the ads, it should have been close to 100%. This then meant that Facebooks estimated CPA was effectively double what it actually was.Important to note about 60% of our customers are on an iOS device, which is a little higher than the global average but matches the market segment we are in in the UK.The situation improved after about 4 weeks, I believe Facebook now uses some &#34;AI&#34; to help with attribution on iOS, but it&#39;s somewhat difficult to be sure as by then we had other campaigns running.So, this will definitely be effecting marketers decision making process of where to allocate spend. It certainly made us more courteous about spending on Facebook."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember when Facebook Platform came out. The super early version where you could embed your app on Facebook and engage with the social graph.I thought dang, this is smart. They’ll basically own the next level up the stack from the browser: they’ll own the “social chrome” of every application on the web.Although it devolved into spam, Facebook was a hot spot of weird social games for a while there. And every web dev was learning how to build Facebook apps. We wondered if we’d even really need a domain for much more than a landing page, if 99% of our engagement was going to come through Facebooks.And then they killed it because they wanted to own the entire experience inside Facebook. It became not a walled garden, but a walled flower pot.It always seemed short sighted  to me. Yes, they lost control allowing third party apps in their frame. But didn’t they want to be a Microsoft and not a WordPerfect?Looking back, I wonder if it was a missed opportunity. They have to go try to be the metaverse because social never became a platform."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem isn&#39;t just Apple&#39;s action on IDFA. It&#39;s that Facebook seems to be so poorly managed on some fronts that its reactions, rather than mitigating problems, has caused further harm. For example - in a rushed effort to get their privacy issues in order, they are deactivating the live facebook integrations of customers based on cursory/mistaken/possibly machine-based readings of their privacy policies.They did that to us yesterday: https://shared-crater-f3a.notion.site/Facebook-is-Breaking-A...We spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on facebook app ads per month. We can deal with IDFA giving way to more aggregated attribution (we don&#39;t want to track individuals - we just want to measure if the ads we paid for led to sales). But facebook breaking our app in production because they can&#39;t be bothered doing their job properly is very serious. It can&#39;t be solved by reducing ad spend, only by removing their SDK from our app.If this is also happening to many other developers right now, that, more than the Q4 results or the IDFA issue itself, could be causing the drop in the share price.In fact, if you look at the Q4 results, the earnings miss was more because of growth in G&amp;A (which grew by 3 percentage-points of revenue if I&#39;m not mistaken)  than because of a top-line slowdown. And if you read the comments as to what made G&amp;A grow, it&#39;s &#39;legal costs&#39;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Poignant remarks.  We&#39;re not getting any younger:&#34;Erik &#34;alphageek&#34; Jan Tromp passed away in 2020 after a long illness. He was
a long-time member of the Slackware core team doing a ton of stuff behind
the scenes and a master of lesser-known programming languages like Tcl. :-)
For a long time he lived closer to me geographically than anyone else on
the core team, but unfortunately with an international border between us
we never did meet in person. But he was there in chat every day and was a
good friend to everyone on the team. He is greatly missed. Sorry I didn&#39;t
get 15.0 out in time for you to see it...My old friend Brett Person also passed away in 2020. Without Brett, it&#39;s
possible that there wouldn&#39;t be any Slackware as we know it - he&#39;s the one
who encouraged me to upload it to FTP back in 1993 and served as Slackware&#39;s
original beta-tester. He was long considered a co-founder of this project.
I knew Brett since the days of the Beggar&#39;s Banquet BBS in Fargo back in
the 80&#39;s. When the Slackware Project moved to Walnut Creek CDROM, Brett was
hired as well, and we spent many hours on the road and sitting next to each
other representing Slackware at various trade shows. Brett seemed to know
all kinds of computer luminaries and was an amazing storyteller, always
with his smooth radio voice. Gonna miss you too, pal.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Slackware was my first Linux too. I remember making the installation floppy disk set. And then it was my first introduction to running a computer others could remotely control. After learning how to dial up AOL from Linux then join an IRC chat room, I was immediately &#34;pwned&#34; by someone in that chat room who guessed my root password and rm -rf /&#39;d my entire hard drive. I was probably 8 or 9 at the time and cried."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the last entries in the -current changelog before the 15.0 release was the following:  Wed Feb 2 04:17:39 UTC 2022

  a/kernel-generic-5.15.19-x86_64-1.txz: Upgraded.
  a/kernel-huge-5.15.19-x86_64-1.txz: Upgraded.
  [...]

This gives the following:  %% (fortunes2)
  A manager asked a programmer how long it would take him to finish the
  program on which he was working.  &#34;I will be finished tomorrow,&#34; the
  programmer promptly replied.
      &#34;I think you are being unrealistic,&#34; said the manager. &#34;Truthfully,
  how long will it take?&#34;
      The programmer thought for a moment.  &#34;I have some features that I wish
  to add.  This will take at least two weeks,&#34; he finally said.
      &#34;Even that is too much to expect,&#34; insisted the manager, &#34;I will be
  satisfied if you simply tell me when the program is complete.&#34;
      The programmer agreed to this.
      Several years later, the manager retired.  On the way to his
  retirement lunch, he discovered the programmer asleep at his terminal.
  He had been programming all night.
    -- Geoffrey James, &#34;The Tao of Programming&#34;

No matter how practical it is to use Slackware in the current year (works for me!), it makes me very happy that projects like this are still going. Congratulations Patrick on a fantastic release."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"But remember to reduce your personal carbon footprint! /sWe&#39;re expected to shave off a few kilos of CO2 here and there, usually at significant personal expense, while nothing is being done about these releases that a) could be avoided relatively easily b) have a much bigger impact.The abstract mentions ~8 million metric tons of methane per year. Using a GWP of 28 (which seems to be the value from the IPPC&#39;s AR5) that&#39;s equivalent to around 224 million tons of CO2.That&#39;s 224 billion kg CO2e, or around 28 kg CO2e for every human on the world, just from the large leaks (not from the ongoing smaller leaks which are &gt;10x as big according to the article). So yeah, go ahead and tell me (and everyone else) to go vegan for a month [1] or make similarly impactful changes just so companies can continue venting methane.To avoid being only negative: The obvious solution would be to require companies to buy emission certificates for those emissions, with a penalty factor that accounts for the probability of detection if they didn&#39;t accurately self-report and had to get caught. This would create an immediate incentive to reduce those easily avoidable emissions, and should be relatively easy to implement if we can get accurate enough data from satellites or aircraft. It would also ensure these emissions are accounted for in the emissions trading framework, so we don&#39;t emit the allocated amount elsewhere and are then surprised by the unaccounted-for emissions.[1] Assuming I replace 250 kcal from pork per day with Tofu (around 100g of pork which seems to be considered &#34;one serving&#34;), this would be savings of ~1 kg CO2e per day: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/ghg-kcal-poore"</p>

Or for a more specific example, in Portal, at one time, you have to quickly fire a portal to avoid being crushed, it is a tense situation, and an important part of the story. So, to avoid a stupid death at the worst time, if you fire the wrong portal, it silently switches the other portal to correct your mistake.Aesthetic Manipulations (Trick questions or toying with emotions or our subconscious desires) is the entire point of many games. We want games to play with our emotions. Take a horror game for instance, you are sitting on a couch, at home, in the least scary environment you can imagine, the game has to pull all the trick on you if you want the scares you paid for. And no one is going to tell you that getting attached to characters is a bad thing and they would rather see them as the bunch of pixels they are.Frequency biases are all over the place too, usually in favor of the player. So much that when the game uses true randomness, it feels unfair. Good games are designed for player enjoyment, not to punish them with randomness.It also considers competition a dark pattern, are sports a dark pattern too?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, this site has a very low threshold for considering something a &#39;dark pattern&#39;. If you look at the psychological section, these are all considered dark patterns:* A leveling up system* Badges/achievements* Collecting things* Getting better tools/equipment as the game progressesThat&#39;s like...most games, I think? Most single-player games at least probably have at least one of those.edit: some of the examples listed here are hilarious&gt; D4DJ Groovy Mix&gt; &#34;difficulty 1 through 14 is easy to learn and master, while 15 is the hardest difficulty in the game. makes people think that they have 90% of the skill of the best player but in reality it is not the case&#34;&gt; Magic: The Gathering Arena&gt; &#34;There are mysterious matchmaking algorithms. It isn&#39;t clear how these work. At face, they appear to match players of similar skill or deck strength.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So this can help parents and kids with mobile games, but let’s talk about the elephant in the room of the games we ourselves are addicted to or our kids keep coming back to play.When I was a teen I was addicted to World of Warcraft. I played for a few years before quitting. My grades dropped, my social life was hurting, and all for just in game items? I remember how worried my parents were about my screen time and the lengths they went to try and limit it.Some of my best friends continue to play to this day and keep telling me that they are bored with it and will quit next expansion. They are now re-playing the same game over like they did with me a decade ago as it’s now a “classic” version.How do we help people get help they desire when these games create almost a combative, intervention needed type of situation?There’s https://www.restartlife.com/ and other similar types of websites out there to help, but I feel like the problem is the dark patterns already have a hold on one’s behavior to the point where only that person can be the agent of change or a major event happens in their life to spark the change."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"“There are approximately seven scanners per million inhabitants and over 90% are concentrated in high-income countries. We describe an ultra-low-field brain MRI scanner that operates using a standard AC power outlet and is low cost to build.”This is fantastic. What a sentence to get to write."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The images are better that I expected.
The ‘FLAIR like’ image is not particularly FLAIR like. FLAIR are nicer to look at when fat saturated (not everyone agrees with that), but that’s probably not feasible at that field strength and adding scan time would be a problem on these long sequences.
Voxel sizes of 2x2x10 are pretty terrible resolution, but if the alternative is nothing, I guess that’s ok.
The static field is so low, I’m impressed it works at all."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Edit: This post was intended as a reply to https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30209618 , presently below&gt; The lead author, Dr. Craig Bennett, wanted to get something fresh, so he headed in to the grocery story first thing in the morning. At the fish counter, he spoke the words that will echo down the centuries as a testimony to the dedication and drive of neuroscientists throughout the ages:&gt;&#34;I need a full length Atlantic Salmon. For science.&#34;That reminds me of the day that I needed a strong lightweight cable for a silica-fiber melting/drawing apparatus. After some puzzling, I realized that bicycle shift/brake cabling would probably be perfect for the task.I&#39;ll never forget the puzzled look at the bike shop -- &#34;What kind of bike are you putting it on?&#34;  &#34;I&#39;m not, I just need some brake cable for a science experiment....&#34;  As I recall, I think we finally settled on some precut cabling for a GT Zaskar of some kind.Similar things came up the day that I needed a valve that switched faster than our dedicated micro-switching valves. A similar light-bulb went on, and I went down to the nearby auto shop for a fuel-injector.&#34;What kind of car do you need it for?&#34;&#34;I don&#39;t, but there are a couple of different valve-switching protocols, some that latch open and others that accept straight TTL at reasonable currents. I need one of those.&#34;That experiment was brought to you by an injector for, I believe, a Dodge Caravan, and later, when I needed another, an injector for a Ford Mustang.  Fuel-injectors are really good valves."</p>
