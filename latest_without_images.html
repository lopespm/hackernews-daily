								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"These advertising networks are destroying web performance. Most of these &#34;Supercookies&#34; are optimizations to improve performance. By abusing them, advertisers have turned what should be a great performance tool into a liability. I know FF suggests this won&#39;t significantly affect most websites performance, but web advertising and trackers are already responsible for a huge chunk of performance issues already.Of course we&#39;ll have the inevitable guy pop in here and talk up how awesome web tracking is because it helps sites monetize better, but that&#39;s all bullshit. At this point, all the advertising profits are sucked out of the web by Facebook and Google. The rest of the industry, including publishers are just struggling to get by while two trillion dollar behemoths throw them scraps."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;In the case of Firefox’s image cache, a tracker can create a supercookie by  “encoding” an identifier for the user in a cached image on one website, and then “retrieving” that identifier on a different website by embedding the same image.&#34;Clever. And so frustrating that optimisations need to be turned off due to bad actors."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Per-site caching negates the principal selling point of centrally-hosted JS and resources, including fonts. The convenience remains, but all speed-related perks (due to the resources being reused from earlier visits to unrelated sites) are no more... which is actually great, because it reduces the value that unscrupulous free CDN providers can derive from their &#34;properties&#34;.It also means that I can remove fonts.google.com from the uBlock blacklist. Yay."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I run a small company and offer an app to monitor sales reps work. Managers use it also to see how much time employees spend in the field. To count how much time is spend in some specific location my app uses background location updates.10 years ago I was distributing just the apk file. Then I moved to Play store. It turned out that most people on their company owned Android devices don&#39;t configure Play Store. App updates are disabled until you log in. So I had to educate my customer employees how to log in to Play Store and install my app. The additional benefit was that people had security updates of Chrome and other apps.Two months ago my app was suspended after I made all necessary changes to support Android 10. The Gbot claims that background location updates aren&#39;t essential for my app. As you may guess I wrote appeal without success. My customers pay mainly for that time report feature but Gbot knows better what my paying customers want.And I just do not care about securing my customer devices and Play Store any longer. Now I distribute apk files again and train people how to install apk files from unknown sources."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Time to go back to distributing direct apk files and setting up self-hosted stores to manage updates.The Play Store was supposed to be only an interface for searching and installing packages, like aptitude or yum.Then it started taking arbitrary decisions &#34;for the benefit of the users&#34; (of course, Google always knows what&#39;s best for its users, even more than the users themselves).Then, like the guy who loves the smells of his own farts even when everybody around him disagrees, they decided that their process was indeed so good that it could have been completely automated, with almost no human touch and no possibility for developers and users to appeal.And now it ended up being this Kafka novel where you&#39;re stuck in the gears of the process and you don&#39;t know why, nor when a real human will actually take a look at your case.And, in the meantime, you lose traffic and users, but Google doesn&#39;t seem to care.Time to start boycotting the Play Store. There&#39;s plenty of alternative stores, it&#39;s easy to set up one yourself for your apps, and you can always distribute your apk files through your website."</p>

					<h3><a href="https://pgm.di.unipi.it/">PGM Indexes: Learned indexes that match B-tree performance with 83x less space</a></h3>
				</div>
				<div class="story__comments">
					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25899286">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some context: A few years ago, there was a paper from Google (https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3183713.3196909) that made learned data structures popular for a while. They started from the idea that indexes such as B-trees approximate an increasing function with one-sided error. By using that perspective and allowing two-sided error, they were able to make the index very small (and consequently quite fast).Many data structure researchers got interested in the idea and developed a number of improvements. The PGM-index is one of those. Its main idea is to use piecewise linear approximations (that can be built in a single quick pass over the data) instead of the machine learning black box the Google paper was using."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a major practical advance from the succinct data structure community.This community has produced so many brilliant results in the past years. But, they work in the shadows. Since the rise of interest in neural network methods, I&#39;ve often described their work as &#34;machine learning where epsilon goes to 0.&#34; It&#39;s not sexy, but it is extremely useful.For instance, Ferragina previously helped to develop the FM-index that enabled the sequence alignment algorithms used for the primary analysis of short genomic reads (100-250bp). These tools were simply transformative, because they reduced the amount of memory required to write genome mappers by orders of magnitude, allowing the construction of full-text indexes of the genome on what was then (~2009) commodity hardware."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t get it. I&#39;ve implemented B-trees. The majority of space the used by a B-tree is the data itself. Each N-ary leaf of the tree is a basically a vector of data with maybe some bookkeeping at the ends. The leaves are more than half of the tree.Sure, you can compress the data. But that depends on the data, completely random data can&#39;t be compress. Other data can be. But a point blank 83x space claim seems bizarre - or it&#39;s comparing to a very inefficient implementation of a B-tree.Edit: It seems the 83x claim is a product of the HN submission. I could not find it on the page. But even the page should say something like &#34;a compressed index that allows full speed look-up&#34; (akin to succinct data structures) and then it would make sense."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I had once suggested that the main page be woven out of a combination of popular + new, perhaps 50/50:1. popular2. new3. popular4. newThis injects a lot of noise into the front page, because most of new is noise, but it helps.Another option is to front-load popular stories, then have 10-20 &#34;new&#34; items at the bottom of the page. That way the front page remains highly salient, but anyone who merely scrolls more will also see a small chunk of new. So 1-30 popular (as it is now), then 30-45 new (making the frontpage longer)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I visit &#34;New&#34; occasionally but I find it often disappointing because it is full of flagged submissions. Many of them seem reasonable submissions (not on TV, not click bait), so I keep wondering why they are flagged. Not sure if some people flag duplicates, but finding out whether it is duplicate takes quite a while, especially on a phone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some issues I see on HN new links are:- People missusing flagging as if it was sort of &#34;super downvote&#34;- Coordinated groups of people promoting certain news, like programming communities (spam for tech solutions)- Meaningless blog posts crafted only to drag HN users onto them (low value but appear to be voted enough somehow)EDIT: format"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Ask yourself, how much brighter is it outside than inside (assuming a sunny day vs a brightly lit office)?Before looking into this, I would have guessed 2X or 3X, but would you believe it&#39;s actually over 100X!I bet most people&#39;s guess would also be off by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude.Even outdoors in the shade, it is over 50X brighter than indoors.(For specific numbers and comparisons, see: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6656201/ )Apparently, our eyes adjust so quickly to the difference that we have a very poor sense of the magnitude of light change between indoors and outdoors.I bring this up because one of the largest factors in myopia development appears to be outdoor light exposure in childhood.Genetics are likely a factor too, but light exposure seems to have a huge effect: 
&#34;The prevalence of myopia in 6- and 7-year-old children of Chinese ethnicity was significantly lower in Sydney (3.3%) than in Singapore (29.1%), while patterns of daily outdoor light exposure showed that children living in Singapore were exposed to significantly less daily outdoor light than Australian children.&#34; (from the same study linked above)The obvious takeaway for parents, schools, and governments: ensure your children have plenty of outdoor playtime. It will greatly reduce instances of myopia (not to mention the benefits from higher Vitamin D levels, exercise, etc)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Off on a complete tangent here, only remotely related.Yo, fellow four-eyed geeks.I noticed that when lying down and looking up in a room with a light source, with my glasses on, if there is a small droplet of water on the lens (say, due to having just cleaned the glasses and not wicked up every last drop), this droplet can bend the light in such a way that when it subsequently hits the cornea and pupa, a perfectly straight, parallel beam of light passes through the vitreous humor right to the retina.The consequence of this is that all the junk floating in your eye is rendered in &#34;4K clarity&#34; in a circle of light, regardless of whether it is next to the retina, or floating somewhere in the middle.Imperfections in your cornea or elsewhere are also rendered, making themselves evident."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Correcting? They mean temporarily  cure... If this works, it&#39;s fascinating!One thing I have been wondering for a while, and I thought this what it was when I read the title, is, why can&#39;t we have zoom lenses with a camera turned inword to the retina applying autofocus algorithms? As I age, I need a different prescription for every 20 cm I push my laptop back, something like this would be very useful.Anybody knows what happened to this project https://www.core77.com/posts/12220/brilliant-water-based-eye... ?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Ken White has been talking about the potential for this suit for a couple weeks now. He spends a lot of time talking about what isn&#39;t defamation --- people use defamation suits and threats thereof to chill free speech, and he&#39;s a 1st Amendment guy --- but the Dominion cases are apparently examples of very serious defamation cases.The core of defamation is (1) a false statement of purported fact that (2) causes damage (there are some exceptions to (2) that aren&#39;t relevant here). Most defamation cases you hear about fall apart on (1) - they target non-falsifiable statements of opinion, which can&#39;t be defamation because they don&#39;t purport to relate an objective fact. What makes Dominion&#39;s cases terrifying is that they are chock full of purported facts, all of which are batshit, and have so devastated Dominion&#39;s reputation, in a reputation-intensive business, that it had to hire private security to protect its employees from death threats.What makes the case challenging for Dominion is that they will almost certainly be treated as a public figure for the purposes of the case. The standard for defamation of a public figure is higher than that of a normal person; we add a condition (3): actual malice or negligence, meaning Dominion must show that Giuliani either intended to destroy Dominion&#39;s reputation by spreading facts he knew to be false, or that he was at least negligent, acting with reckless disregard for the truth.The problem is that it&#39;s not totally clear whether Giuliani believed any of his crazy-talk. It may actually be the case that Giuliani is just off his rocker. If he himself was sold by the (false) facts he received from others, he is a more difficult defamation target.Here&#39;s attorney Akiva Cohen analyzing the case a bit:https://twitter.com/AkivaMCohen/status/1353700596407283721"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think it&#39;s nuts for a modern democracy to allow for anything but open source software being used to count paper ballots with chain-of-custody records, voter ID validation, biometric markings, and redacted ballots being published on the web for all to view and count independently.Software systems can easily be hacked, and it isn&#39;t easy to inspect and tell. A vote is a one time, one sided transaction. It&#39;s not as easy to detect fraud in an election as it is with say, a double entry banking record."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a superb set of resources for anyone interested in the history of computing in the 80s and 90s. I&#39;d go so far as to say it&#39;s great even if you don&#39;t intend to watch the show (although you should!). I wish this had existed back when I was teaching history of technology.One of the best decisions the show made was to set the series at a series of fictitious minor companies and startups struggling down there in the trenches of the computer revolution without ever quite making it big. This avoids the trap of teleology and gives you a sense of how things could easily have turned out differently. It is why the show is so much better as both computing history and drama than all those films about Apple or Steve Jobs and the rest that tediously rehash the same stories of the winners. (Although one of the main characters, Joe Macmillan, has some Jobs-like character features. I do not mean this as a compliment.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve probably said this before, but I was a computer engineer in Texas in the 80s and this show captures that culture perfectly.* I first learned &#34;Halt and Catch Fire&#34; as an obscure illegal instruction on the 6800 processor that would lock it up. When I heard about this show my first reaction was &#34;How dare they title a show with a meme from an obscure part of my hindbrain! Guess I can&#39;t use that for a password any more.&#34;*Well almost perfectly. I don&#39;t remember many engineers or coders being as attractive as the actors on this show."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The strange thing is that the “instruction” Halt and Catch Fire originated in a joke System/360 “green card” (reference summary) from the 1960s, along with Rewind and Break Tape, Execute (or Punch) Operator, and many others I&#39;ve long since forgotten. Reference is sometimes made to an undocumented Motorola 6800 instruction, but the term is from the Big Iron era, and has nothing to do with personal computing. It&#39;s really from the &#34;Blinkenlichts&#34; era, when people commonly put up cartoons in the machine room showing a floating-point adder as a snake in a birdbath.By the way, Big Iron&#39;s abilities in the physical world were real. I occasionally operated a System/360 with 4 2311 disk drives, 7.5MB monsters with the form factor of washing machines. When running the IBM sort program, these clunkers were apt to move around the machine room."</p>

The aim is to stimulate demand to develop an industry. Large cities also banned motorbikes and scooters, with the same aim.This is no way market driven demand, BYD is a very interesting company to look into. It is my understanding that Warren buffet has a large share in this company.My believe is China sees oil dependence as a long term strategic weakness. In the event of a navel blockade it will be much harder for them to get the oil they need to run the economy. If a large part of the consumer sector is driven by electric powered by local sources (coal, hydro, nuclear) they can keep the logistic channels open. As a side benefit they get to fund a sector hoping to have the same success as they did with solar panels.The article might have pointed this out but it was paid past a certain point on my device."</p>
