								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The date of the video is the most impressive to me here. It says “Sept. 30, 2021” both as the date of the article and the date of the video. If this is not a mistake that means they managed to deliver the video from the hurricane to the internet in less than 24 hours.Why is this impressive? Either they beamed it out through satelites, which is notoriously hard from an unstable platform on big waves, or they recovered the saildrone and obtained the footage directly which is equally impressive in or around a hurricane.All around if the dating of the footage is correct it is very impressive to me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really didn&#39;t grasp the size of that drone. It is not a little model boat, it is a ship. This video shows it being launched, and includes images of what it looks like:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJ-uYy9Ap8A"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Coinbase made everyone whole, and the attackers stole the credentials (not because of Coinbase&#39;s fault) ahead of time, and the attackers had to perform a &#34;SIM swap&#34; type attack on the users. &#34;Breach&#34; may be the required term for the Californian government, but this wouldn&#39;t qualify to most people as a traditional breach (i.e., compromise of Coinbase&#39;s infrastructure).Edit: California, not Canada. My bad."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;&#34;We will be depositing funds into your account equal to the value of the currency improperly removed from your account at the time of the incident. Some customers have already been reimbursed -- we will ensure all customers affected receive the full value of what you lost. You should see this reflected in your account no later than today.&#34;I sympathize with the &#34;Not your keys, not your coins&#34; crowd, but you have to admit that you are far more likely to be compensated in the event of an attack if you are using a large exchange. Not guaranteed, of course, but Coinbase has an image to maintain.I also believe, personally, that a large exchange has much better security than anything I could muster with a hot wallet. Yes, I know I can airgap a cold wallet but I like the ability to quickly sell some amount of crypto at market rates without having to transfer from a paper wallet. I also worry about physical security since my home has been burglarized before. Therefore, I keep my coins on exchanges and follow good practices with 2FA across my accounts (no SMS for any) and have withdrawal delays / whitelisting active."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this reflects very favorably on Coinbase. They&#39;re making everyone whole, and gosh - the attackers had the user&#39;s usernames, passwords and phone numbers. Hard not to be sympathetic to Coinbase in that scenario. How are they supposed to know those aren&#39;t the real users? Consider that if they are going to identify those cases as fraudulent actors, then they could easily lock-out legitimate users as well.I&#39;ll guess the users had the same usernames and passwords that they&#39;ve used for a hundred other sites, and one of those got breached at some point. Don&#39;t do that!"</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28711421">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very interesting read. This seems to be implemented as a Bluetooth LE app running on the ultra-low power “always on processor” used for a variety of features, like “wake-up on motion.”Much like an Tile or AirTag is implemented. No comment on what this is capable in the future.. but for now this shows power usage / signal strength / proximity of other “actually on” devices are a limitations of this feature.What’s impressive is the mesh network effect of all these iPhones / iDevices to locate a “lost” device. I’ll be thankful if I manage to use this to retrieve a lost phone. I’ll be pretty shocked if I’m “spied on” with this style of device."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In some way this feature reminded me of Android&#39;s song detection functionality which is also on by default and is constantly listening in the background [1].So now tech companies normalized that:- the mic is always on.- the phone is always on, even when it&#39;s off. (thanks to AOP)- devices are always online even when they are offline.(thanks to company-operated p2p networks like Find My or Sidewalk)What could possibly go wrong?https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/7535326?hl=en"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article is wrong about AOP being on while the phone is off. AOP is on while the phone is in standby. It powers down when you shut down the phone. Its job is to save battery by doing things like the Hey Siri and sensors processing without powering up the main cores at all. It does not stay on when the system is shut down.The part about the Bluetooth chipset staying on is correct. Think about it, why would they need the AOP when the Bluetooth chipset can run that applet autonomously and send the beacons?Nothing is listening to your mics while the phone is off. The stuff that runs while the phone is off is rather limited. Mostly things related to the NFC chipset, to support payment and transport applications while the battery is dead (which is a requirement of some of those systems) and, as we just saw, Bluetooth LE features."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Cruise founder here. This is kind of confusing. Short version:- Cruise permit is for robo-taxi service, available to public (fully driverless, nobody in the car)- Waymo permit is for robo-taxi service, available to public (human safety driver behind the wheel at all times)- Nuro permit is for robo-delivery, available to public (no human passengers)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Between the noise of self-driving singularlists, and that of self-driving impossibilists, it&#39;s great to see plodding, sequential progress like this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The California DMV said in a separate release that Cruise driverless &#34;vehicles are approved to operate on public roads between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. at a maximum speed limit of 30 miles per hour.&#34;At night only testing at super low speed. It&#39;s a good way to get started, but definitely not an autonomous taxi that title implies."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s so weird to see these scams running in full view of the public and casually discussed as if they&#39;re not basically just criminal ponzi or mlm schemes dressed up with some jargon. Hopefully when this ends up collapsing, it will be public and clear enough that &#34;tokens&#34; etc will have the same credibility as a Nigerian prince asking to help transfer money, but in this case I feel like there is always more lingo to keep dressing up the scams as something new, e.g. NFTs.I don&#39;t generally like government intervention, but I do hope the &#34;real&#34; financial system is sufficiently isolated from these scams so their collapse won&#39;t cause problems."</p>

If they need to ask money back and really have poor recourse? Didn&#39;t current banking and legal system to develop just solve those issues?"</p>

					<h3><a href="https://github.com/ruby/www.ruby-lang.org/pull/2690">Ruby removed “Participants will be tolerant of opposing views” from its CoC</a></h3>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28712821">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wish we responded to situations more proportionally.In this case, someone made a joke about women not liking to reveal their true age as they get older. It&#39;s a boring cliched joke. Something I&#39;ve heard too many times in my life (and, most often from women). Is it sexist? I can see the argument. Is it professional to make such a joke on a ruby mailing list? I don&#39;t know, perhaps not.Does it warrant responses like &#34;Knock that bullshit off.&#34; or &#34;you made an ass of yourself&#34;... I don&#39;t know. Seems a little ironic to use unprofessional language in this situation. Maybe even worse than the joke itself? I don&#39;t know.Then, folks take the discussion to github and twitter (and, eventually reddit and hn). Presenting only their verdict: &#34;A newer member made a sexist joke, and was called out on it as being inappropriate.&#34; No links to the joke. No evidence that the joke is sexist. This makes it so much easier to imagine something really bad. No, we just get a verdict and we should all rise up against this sexism (which absolutely is bad, of course). Let&#39;s get our pitchforks. This amplifies one side of the argument and shuts down any useful conversation. Worse, it&#39;s used to rush through a CoC change without allowing any thoughtful discussion.Is this reaction proportional to the original joke? Is the reaction itself exemplar of how we would like to conduct ourselves?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Almost more surprising is that this was removed:&gt; When interpreting the words and actions of others, participants should always assume good intentions.In favor of this:&gt; Participants should speak and act with good intentions, but understand that intent and impact are not equivalent.Also changed yesterday:&gt; Behaviour which can be reasonably considered harassment will not be tolerated.became:&gt; Behaviour which can be considered harassment against protected classes will not be tolerated.The updated CoC is here: https://github.com/ruby/www.ruby-lang.org/blob/master/en/con...This is very weird because fundamentally it stems from a failure of the moderators. If someone makes a sexist joke you don&#39;t just let them because you&#39;re &#34;assuming good intentions&#34;, that clause means that you tell them it&#39;s not appropriate here, and if they apologize you assume they are sincere, and if they don&#39;t you swiftly boot them. But there is no substitute for good moderation, shifting words around won&#39;t help much.Aside: Open source discussion opening with &#34;My rationale for these changes are documented on Twitter: [link]&#34; also seems somewhat crazy. And I love Twitter, it just seems very odd to link to a thread of tweets instead of restating your case in the proper medium."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I realize CoCs were introduced to make certain supposedly marginalized groups more at home at conferences.  But my personal experience/feeling is the complete reverse.  I am a member of a minority as a person with a disability.  In all the years I was interacting with the community, I haven&#39;t had a single issue with someone I couldn&#39;t handle myself.  I never felt uneasy interacting with others.  But the day I saw the first CoC being used in a community I was interacting with, I started to feel uneasy.  I cant really say why, but I feel I dont want to interact with groups which need rules like these.  I also stopped going to conferences.  Gosh, I am even glad I didnt go to the DebConf where they invited Linus only to realize later that they are very unhappy with his speaking style.  I would have felt too much shame for being a part of such a group of hyprocrits."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The best thing about this is that AMP links totally break “open this page in the website’s native app” links, which I encounter frequently, presumably because the browser is on an AMP proxy domain and thus the iOS native app URL listener doesn’t work. It’s absolutely shocking that such a core flow is completely broken by default when you’re coming from Google search results.This app fixes this problem!"</p>

These days the organic results are after the page fold. This is unacceptable for something that’s supposed to be a search engine.—-The second one gets little attention but it’s infuriating to me. 
I mean, I’m explicitly telling the engine what I want. If it’s not including it in the results, I might as well not even be here typing. Just show me whatever it thinks I want based on everything it knows about me. And no, unfortunately verbatim doesn’t always help."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This isn&#39;t a great specific example (it&#39;s &#34;just&#34; a meme and not even a particularly culturally significant one in the grand scheme of things), but in general this is why projects like youtube-dl are important.It might not be glamorous, and it might be a little stupid, but damnit this is our culture, for better or worse! And we should preserve it.Private companies seem to be the only ones with the resources to store all the video content we produce, and they&#39;re also exactly the wrong ones to be hosting our collective shared culture for posterity.It&#39;s a shame a torrenting-based youtube wouldn&#39;t really work for various reasons, both legal and social.So, short of that, at least being able to download stuff important to us as individuals is an important right to preserve.My personal stake in this fight is a video of &#34;Scotland the Brave&#34; that I used to listen to a lot, which featured an older Scottish gentleman standing in the beautiful highlands, loudly and proudly calling down through the glen.It got randomly copyright-removed recently and I&#39;ve been unable to find it elsewhere.

I can&#39;t wait to see what more conventional history they&#39;ll delete.For now, note the conscious blowing-off, on YouTube&#39;s part, of all the re-uploads. Will they also get got?

I used to be an Adobe Suite (PS, AI, AE, PP) user, but I&#39;ve yet to encounter a situation where I&#39;ve felt limited by not having access to those &#34;premium&#34; applications any more.There are issues of course - memory leaks and odd GUI handling on Windows in particular - but I&#39;ve had the same sort of issues with Adobe products as well.A really awesome thing about Inkscape for me is how it uses standard SVG as its default file format. It makes a lot of sense and makes the raw artwork highly exportable and flexible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I absolutely love this program. Few times per year I need a vector tool. After some toying with proprietary vector tools (Illustrator), I learned Inkscape (as it was readily available in my Linux envs).I never looked back. It does the job. I never have to look for cracked software in order to open my old files or use my acquired skills.It just works."</p>
