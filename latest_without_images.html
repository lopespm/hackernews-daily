								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It is absolutely unbelievable (and unforgivable) that a cash cow such as GTA V has a problem like this present for over 6 years and it turns out to be something so absolutely simple.I do not agree with the sibling comment saying that this problem only looks simple and that we are missing context.This online gamemode alone made $1 billion in 2017 alone.Tweaking two functions to go from a load time of 6 minutes to less than two minutes is something any developer worth their salt should be able to do in a codebase like this equipped with a good profiler.Instead, someone with no source code managed to do this to an obfuscated executable loaded with anti-cheat measures.The fact that this problem is caused by Rockstar&#39;s excessive microtransaction policy (the 10MB of JSON causing this bottleneck are all available microtransaction items) is the cherry on top.(And yes, I might also still be salty because their parent company unjustly DMCA&#39;d re3 (https://github.com/GTAmodding/re3), the reverse engineered version of GTA III and Vice City. A twenty-year-old game. Which wasn&#39;t even playable without purchasing the original game.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Holy cow, I&#39;m a very casual gamer, I was excited about the game but when it came out I decided I don&#39;t want to wait that long and I&#39;ll wait until they sort it out. 2 years later it still sucked. So I abandoned it. But.. this... ?! This is unbelievable. I&#39;m certain that many people left this game because of the waiting time. Then there are man-years wasted (in a way different than desired).Parsing JSON?! I thought it was some network game logic finding session magic. If this is true that&#39;s the biggest WTF I saw in the last few years and we&#39;ve just finished 2020.Stunning work just having binary at hand. But how could R* not do this? GTAV is so full of great engineering. But if it was a CPU bottleneck then who works there that wouldn&#39;t just be irked to try to nail it? I mean it seems like a natural thing to try to understand what&#39;s going on inside when time is much higher than expected even in the case where performance is not crucial. It was crucial here. Almost directly translates to profits. Unbelievable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is why I come to HN,  I was going to skip this because I thought it was about video games, but really glad to have read it, and loved every line of the article.So much to get from this.Even if you don&#39;t have the source, you can make a change if you are annoyed enough.If you don&#39;t like something, and the source code is out there, really go contribute.Performance matters, know how to profile and if using an external dependency, then figure out their implementation details.Algorithms &amp; Data structures matter, often I see devs talking about how it doesn&#39;t matter much but the difference between using a hashmap vs array is evident.Attentive code reviews matter, chances are they gave this to a junior dev/intern, and it worked with a small dataset and no one noticed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I fully agree about dumb TVs for personal use. Even having to wait for your TV&#39;s OS to boot up when you turn it on is a terrible UX.However, when it comes to buying a TV for your conference room where you have a TV running 12hrs/day (when you&#39;re not a small startup with 10ppl), invest in a proper commercial TV like NEC or (my personal favorite brand) iiyama: 1) the&#39;re dumb TVs from the start, 2) you get proper warranties and support, 3) you can get larger TVs without 4K HDR (which your computer may not support anyway), 4) the color grading is more apt for your PowerPoint slides, etc and finally, 5) these panels are actually rated for that kind of use and won&#39;t break after a few weeks. From my experience building conference rooms, that investment is actually worth it"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m really pleased the author called out the Apple TV as a device that lets you avoid ads. We tried to go cheap on another of our TVs and get an Amazon Fire Stick and in addition to it being not as smooth (combo of UX and speed) at the Apple TV, it had a good amount of ads all over the place.There’s lots of griping about the cost of an Apple TV 4k, but I’ll pay that extra $100 to avoid ads and not be tracked so extensively."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s an obvious &#34;following the local law&#34; thingy, Facebook doesn&#39;t give a s*t, I personally reported 3 posts on different FB pages1st was a religion extremist guy who says to Iraqi people that they should protest and fight the &#34;other side&#34; of the religion (aka start a new civil war) instead of protesting against the corrupted government.2nd was a post that was praising the guy who murdered the Danish (Or was he Norwegian?) teacher who mocked Islam, and calling him a hero.and the 3rd was a post that says &#34;Women education is satanic, women&#39;s purpose is marriage&#34;.all of these 3 reports was &#34;The post was reviewed, and though it doesn&#39;t go against one of our specific Community Standards&#34; and then it explains how to block blablabla...

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think it is demonstrably proven that Facebook has no qualms about aiding and abetting government campaigns of crushing dissent across the world, despite its claims of &#34;cherishing free speech&#34;. Facebook (and Twitter) has been doing the same in India [1].[1] https://theintercept.com/2021/02/27/india-climate-activists-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s the correct decision (although Facebook likely only cares about its bottom line). the YPG is designated as a terrorist organisation by the Turkish state and it&#39;s quite obvious that Turkey will want to exercise sovereignty over its communication channels rather than letting an opposing military force broadcast freely to its citizens.It&#39;s not really the job of a private company to undermine nations in this way for simple reasons of sovereignty, and because even if Facebook were to somehow win in the short term, the five to ten year consequence would probably be that nations like Turkey decouple entirely and take control over communications back a la Russia or China."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I won’t be able to provide information that other people haven’t already but I have encountered one of these “aircraft”.I own a small light sport airplane and was flying between UT and CA at 12.5k ft and saw one of these pass 1,000ft below me not far outside of Reno. ATC didn’t call it so presumably they didn’t see it on radar. It was exactly as described, small, shiny, cylindrical, no wings, and fast. If I could guess it was doing 500kts in the opposite direction. By the time I pulled out my phone to snap a picture it was gone. If it was a cruise missile it was flying over a populated area and not in restricted airspace or a MOA. Not sure what conclusions to draw other than these things are real and probably more common than people assume. It was not an airliner or private jet I’ve seen plenty of them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My observation is that much of industry does not care about any of these technical or security issues.In theory microservices are technical artifacts, but what they tend to be are cultural artifacts.Microservice adoption is often driven by cargo culting, or (better) a considered decision to work around a lack of organisational cohesion.What microservices let you do is ship your org chart directly, and also map back from some functionality to an owning team. You know who to page when there&#39;s a problem and it&#39;s easier to tell who is late delivering and whose code is slow. In cultures with &#34;lax&#34; technical leadership (aka no everyone uses same thing mandate, I&#39;m not judging) it lets teams use their favourite tools, for better or worse.Other org related things are the ability to have independent (per team) release schedules. Separable billing. Ability to get metrics on performance, cost and failures that can be used as indicators of team performance and promotion material. Microservices can also act as &#34;firewalls&#34;, limiting the impact a bad hire or team can have across your codebase.None of this is intended to be negative judgement; microservices can (among other things), help teams feel a sense of agency and ownership that can be hard to maintain as org size scales up."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"IMO this is a confused take on modularity. I think isolation and security are related concepts, but not what modules are for. Those things have to follow module boundaries, but they&#39;re not the goal of modules. For me, modules are about understanding; in order to use this code you don&#39;t need to read all of it, you just need to understand the interface. Modularity is for humans, not computers.They do often follow Conway&#39;s law, but that&#39;s not a desirable thing. Most modules are outside of that kind of context -- they&#39;re in libraries written by people you don&#39;t communicate with at all!I&#39;m interested in people&#39;s opinion here. I&#39;m also planning an article on the relationship between services and modularity."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I found this to be surprisingly interesting and novel - usually I expect to see really low quality content when it&#39;s a post about microservices, whether for or against the idea. This boils it down to isolation, which I myself have written about in a similar vein[0].&gt; at this point security people simply don&#39;t believe that any of the following (each one the very best technology available at the time) is totally safeTo be fair, we don&#39;t think anything is totally safe :) that&#39;s the point. Actually a lot of those things listed are why Chrome is so secure. I think this is a bit pessimistic about process isolation, which is actually quite powerful, but I get the point - there&#39;s no gap like an air gap.I prefer to think of monoliths and microservices as being completely unrelated ideas - they aren&#39;t on a spectrum of &#34;big to small&#34;, they&#39;re just two totally different ways of approaching software development. I might put &#34;monoliths&#34; closer to SOA, in that they both describe a very basic approach to a problem, whereas Microservices is not &#34;small services&#34; it&#39;s about bounded contexts, patterns, organizations, etc.Anyways, I appreciated this post.[0] https://www.graplsecurity.com/post/architecting-for-performa..."</p>
