2. The payment cleared in a specific 2 day period.
3. The item cost &lt; $100.  The cost of shipping has to be included in the item&#39;s cost.
4. The item falls into specific categories that almost certainly don&#39;t match whatever categorization system you are attempting to use.Seriously, calling out just one example, https://comptroller.texas.gov/taxes/publications/98-490/scho... points out that a kit containing school supplies qualifies as long as the cost of the qualifying school supply items in it exceeds the cost of the non-qualifying items.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was working on a billing system for utility company and it was a nightmare but not for the reasons from the article.Dates are no problem, everything is billed at the end of month, quarter or year.Upgrades are downgrades are simplified, customer can legally change tariff only on predefined dates/events.Usage - yes, but exampled in the article do not even scratch the complexity of thisIdempotency is not really needed, the billing process is not continuous, it is a batch job.Cash collection is out of scope of billing software.Taxing was clear. Yes, there were multiple billable items with different tax rates, but not too complex. All customers were local.The nightmare part was:- customers can have multiple consumption locations, location can have multiple meters and customer can request to split the bill on multiple invoices or combine multiple bills to single invoice as they please- meters can be replaced at any time- meter readings are available on dates totally independent from billing cycle. Most of consumption data are mere forecasts.- when the actual consumption data is available, everything must be recalculated AND compensated (on a correction invoice showing the difference)- actual consumption data can be wrong and may be corrected at a later date, even multiple times- consumption points can be added or removed or moved to different customer at any time, but this information is only available after the fact- the prices can change mid-billing cycle for some customers but the consumption data is not available with that granularity- customer legal information (company name, address) can change mid-cycle"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve worked at two companies in their payment systems. This post does a good job of mentioning many of the billing system challenges. I think it understates how difficult and important idempotency is to maintain at scale with multiple teams though.Additionally, it didn&#39;t mention financial regulation changes. India had changes sometime in the last few years which required whole new systems built that were specific to India customers. One example of complexity is this: does the system apply to customers who are in India or does it apply to businesses who are in India (the owners might not be)?He also did not mention fraud, which is basically uncollected spend that results in charge backs typically. If you get too many chargebacks, you&#39;ll get fined. If you get even more chargebacks, you&#39;ll get kicked off the card network and will no longer be able to accept cards within that network.Post pay (customer gets the product and pays afterwards) models are subject to more fraud, uncollected charges, etc.There&#39;s also the fun of dealing with downstream payment processors. I haven&#39;t worked with a processor or bank yet that was very reliable. Sometimes they&#39;d return 500 http codes and then process a payment, requiring manual intervention. Sometimes that happens with files of payments because most banks deal with files for transactions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Well whether you add “site:.edu” or not, Google still does the thing where they just spit out a pile of extra “matches” that don’t contain your search phrase AT ALL.  Just thrown into the list, as if they have any business being there (oh wait, they do have business: Google’s business).Frankly, if it’s not reliable as a tool, it has no real value and I can’t believe it has come to this.  Imagine if every time you ran `ls` in a shell with a glob pattern, it just decided to sort of “add in” a few other files loosely based on your query (or heck, files that aren’t based on it at all)?  Oh, now imagine if `rm` did that.Sadly this happens with lots of search tools now.  Why the heck is the default state on a new Mac to funnel what you type to everything, e.g. I searched for “Chrome” and hit Return and the FIRST thing it did was throw me into the App Store and call up some not-even-a-web-browser scam app with Chrome in its name, instead of selecting the Chrome already installed on my computer and opening it?  More and more it seems that you have to turn off all kinds of poor defaults to put tools into a useful state, or there is simply no way to get them there at all."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is nitpicky but the tire changing page doesn&#39;t actually fit your rational for choosing .edu pages&gt;Professors are paid generous salaries to share knowledge with the paying customers of the University (students). So, let’s find some paid unpaid University knowledge on how to change a tire by using our new trick!But the bottom of the page says&gt;Prepared by: [students] For Dr. Bruce Magee&#39;s English 303 (Technical Writing) Class, Winter 1997-1998.The professor is actually an English professor and the page was written by students as an assignment. I looked into this because I was wondering, &#34;what would a professor be teaching that he&#39;s writing notes on tire changing?&#34;. There&#39;s probably some professor out there that does that in an academic context, but there&#39;s probably a lot of things that no professor actually gets paid to write about. Maybe they would write about something miscellaneous like that anyway and put it online, but they would be doing so out of the culture of web savvy professors having personal pages where they upload stuff they think is helpful."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s not a Google problem, it&#39;s a web problem.Everything is based around SEO spam. If someone has a website, and they&#39;re producing content, their point is to monetize the browsing of the website itself, or promote their main product via the website.This incentivizes a certain kind of content, which is marketing content.These days I&#39;m back to searching social networks like Reddit or Hacker News for (at least somewhat) unbiased information.Google is a fuzzy-search address bar at this point for me."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is really cool for a number of reasons:1.) Apple Silicon currently can&#39;t compete with Nvidia GPUs in terms of raw compute power, but they&#39;re already way ahead on energy efficiency. Training a small deep learning model on battery power on a laptop could actually be a thing now.Edit: I&#39;ve been informed that for matrix math, Apple Silicon isn&#39;t actually ahead in efficiency2.) Apple Silicon probably will compete directly with Nvidia GPUs in the near future in terms of raw compute power in future generations of products like the Mac Studio and Mac Pro, which is very exciting. Competition in this space is incredibly good for consumers.3.) At $4800, an M1 Ultra Mac Studio appears to be far and away the cheapest machine you can buy with 128GB of GPU memory. With proper PyTorch support, we&#39;ll actually be able to use this memory for training big models or using big batch sizes. For the kind of DL work I do where dataloading is much more of a bottleneck than actual raw compute power, Mac Studio is now looking very enticing."</p>

Almost all technology of any kind selects in favor of aesthetics over equal access.I have moderate amblyopia and severe astigmatism.  For a frame of reference, I only barely pass the driver’s license vision test when I renew my license (don’t worry I don’t actually drive).My vision has good days and bad days.  My ophthalmologist thinks that I frequently have eye strain from looking at screens which further (temporarily) degrades my vision.Examples that I’ve run into _in the last 24 hours_.  - Why can’t I choose the colors of web sites and applications?

  - Why can’t I choose (and override) the default typefaces on mobile browsers?

  - Why can’t I change the default system font for my iPhone or my Mac?

  - Why can’t I change the font size in modern video games?

  - Why do most desktop applications fall of the edge of the screen below 1080p?

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; And before we continue, let’s make it absolutely clear that we have no control of the color of the text in this very article, as it is hosted through Medium.com, which features poor visual accessibility of their site design. Further, Medium prevents their users from selecting black text as a choice. While Medium’s “Fischer-Price-simple” content creation is easy to use, it is also extremely limited, and fails in accessibility in areas beyond color. Perhaps this article can serve as a wake up call regarding this issue.So - why on EARTH are you publishing there? And for what it&#39;s worth, the areas that fail WCAG AA for colour contrast on this page are areas entirely within the control of the publication."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I can tell you why people still use ncurses: if you’re actually interested in accounting for all the nuanced eldritch madness that is terminal emulation implementation and history it’s a monumental effort, at least imo.Sure, if all you care about is coloring text on recent terminals, I do think just using ansi codes is fine.However, I completely disagree with the assertion that hardcoding ansi codes is somehow “more readable” than using a well-named API call that abstracts such detail away from the user. Maybe I’m alone in this, but I really don’t want to waste brain space memorizing ansi codes. Yeah I can write my own library or little macros to do this but…why? If I’m doing anything more involved than coloring text why wouldn’t I just pull in the lib I need? There’s no way in hell I want to maintain a custom implementation of terminal cursor movement for kicks. I’d much rather reach for a battle tested library that scores of other devs have already used and improved upon, whether it’s ncurses or one of the more modern TUI libs.Also, it’s become cool recently to hate ncurses for some reason. Are there things ncurses should do differently from today’s perspective? Sure. Is it’s api awkward to use in the face of modern programming features and paradigms that we’re now used to? Sure. But on the whole it’s design is really solid and it has plentiful documentation. Whenever I see rants like this I get the impression the author is a person that lacks an appreciation for history and the way technical development proceeds in general and imagines they are our technical savior, come down from the heavens to enlighten all us blindered fools about how terrible X is.If you want to educate people about ansi codes, great. A really inefficient way to do that is to wrap your advice in an obnoxious rant."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I built a cross platform app to print &#39;pretty formatted&#39; source code [1]. I didn&#39;t want to re-invent the wheel on formatting source code, so looked at all the existing libraries. Originally I figured formatting to HTML, and then building a print-friendly HTML render would work. But this proved super challenging. I tried a dozen HTML engines (including Chromium) but none gave me enough control to render just a single page of the original source file.Then I noticed Pygments, a Python-based library for pretty formatting source code, has an option to output an ANSI formatted file. I quickly found a bunch of libraries that could render ANSI formatted text to a print canvas.In the end, I put the original source code file through &#39;pygmentize -16m -o tempfile.an` (`16m` is the 16M color terminal ANSI formatter) and pipe the `tempfile.an` through a print-optimized renderer to actually print the source code.ANSI escapes FTW![1] WinPrint - https://github.com/tig/winprint
[2] https://pygments.org/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author seems not to be aware of the recent TUI rennaisance[1]. There are libraries like termbox and blessings (python) that are a middle-ground between full ncurses and adding your own ansi codes. There are a lot of modern TUI frameworks like tui-go or tui-rs that bring common GUI conventions back to the TUI (heck there are TUI programming libraries that are designed to be similar to react) - these too tend to be a lot nicer than working with ncurses.Definitely worth checking out the full landscape these days if you&#39;re going to dive into making your console programs prettier.[1] My words, I just coined that name (although I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if others had said it too). I mean that in the last ~decade there has been a lot of TUI work in the background, with lots of new programs and some pretty stunning results. I blame unicode - once the web folks realized they could use something like font-awesome instead of sprite-sheets (or maybe as a pre-build sprite sheet?), and the &#34;icons in a font&#34; movement took hold, terminal programs got a lot prettier too. It makes sense, its the same font/font renderer provided by the system no matter if the app is a browser or terminal emulator."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s interesting that TTS is getting better and better while consumer access to it is more and more restricted. A decade ago there were a half dozen totally separate TTS engines I could install on my phone and my Kindle came with its own that worked on any book."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wowsers. This is a step change in quality compared to SOTA. I suspect that without evaluating samples as a correlated group, distinguishing between the generated samples and those recorded from a human will be little better than a coin toss.And even when evaluating these samples as a group, I may be imagining the distinctions I am drawing from a relatively small selection that might be cherry-picked. Nevertheless:The generated samples are more consistent as a group, and more even in quality, with few instances of emphasis that seem (however slightly) out of place.The recorded human samples vary more between samples (by which I mean the sample as a whole may be emphasized with a bit of extra stress or a small raising or lowering of tone compared to the other samples), and within the sample there is a bit more emphasis on a word or two or slight variance in the length of pauses, mostly appropriate in context (as in, it is similar to what I, a non-professional[0], would have emphasized if I were being asked to record these).In general for a non-dramatic voiceover you want to maintain consistency between passages (especially if they may be heard out of order) without completely flattening the in-passage variation, but tastes vary.Conclusion: For many types of voice work, these generated samples are comparable in quality or slightly superior to recordings of an average professional. For semi-dramatic contexts (eg. audiobooks) the generated samples are firmly in the &#34;more than good enough&#34; zone, more or less comparable to a typical narrator who doesn&#39;t &#34;act&#34; as part of their reading.[0] Decades ago in Los Angeles I tried my hand at voiceover and voice acting work, but gave up when it quickly became clear that being even slightly prone to stuffy noses, tonsillitis and sore throats was going to pose a major obstacle to being considered reliable unless I was willing to regularly use decongestants, expectorants, and the like."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The best solution to getting past the anxiety/fear-avoidance cycle is to take small, manageable actions while accepting the feelings that go along with those actions.Start with the smallest steps possible. Maybe that means opening the assignment and saving it to your computer. Then put it down and walk away. Come back in a little while and take another small step, such as reading over the assignment or making an outline of what you need to do to get it done. Often once you&#39;ve done something you will often start to feel a lot different than if you&#39;ve done nothing.Keep track of how you&#39;re feeling. It&#39;s okay to feel more anxiety at first because you&#39;re doing something instead of nothing. Those feelings tend to subside over time as you take action, but the point is not to reduce your anxiety, the point is that you are making a commitment to do something in your life, to live your life, rather than to remain paralyzed in fear. Your goal is not to get rid of the anxiety but to live the kind of life you want to live.This is the model for Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. A great book on this is &#34;Get Out of Your Mind and into Your Life.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This was a slow process, but:1. Regular written self-reflection, i.e., keeping a journal and2. Re-framing &#34;failures&#34; as learning experiences; forgive yourselfhelped me a lot.The written part was important to me because it forced me to revisit my previous thoughts and reevaluate them in light of what had happened since last time I wrote.(2) also helped me do things with the mind-set that &#34;failure&#34; wasn&#39;t actually failure.  The goal was to try and learn from it.I didn&#39;t get around to doing this until after school, but I wish I had.  In your situation, I&#39;d try to get myself to do the assignment with a quick pass early on leaving notes for things I wasn&#39;t sure about.  Take a break, then revisit and revise.  Afterwards, write in your journal what worked well and what didn&#39;t.  Write about what you want to try next time differently if some things come to mind.Hope you find a solution that works for you.  E-mail is in my profile if you want to talk more about what&#39;s worked for me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been through the same cycle for many years (I can even say decades). My recommendation is to seek help from a psychiatrist. You probably have generalized anxiety disorder and it often goes hand in hand with depression. A psychiatrist will be able to diagnose those and give you medication if you need it. She could also recommend therapy, but you need to be diagnosed first.Unfortunately, it is very difficult to find a good mental health professional. You&#39;ll have to try many before finding a good one. Plus you will procrastinate of course. But you need to persist and make this task your priority. I know the pain you&#39;re going through, and nothing should be more important than ending the suffering right now. Once you get better you&#39;ll wish you had sought help sooner.From my research and my experience, there are two effective treatments for anxiety and depression backed by scientific evidence: antidepressants and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.The other comments are well intentionned but most of them are basically asking you to change your mindset and just do it. Obviously, if it was that easy you would have done it already. Anxiety and depression don&#39;t allow you to think clearly, that&#39;s why it is extremely difficult to get out of it on your own."</p>
