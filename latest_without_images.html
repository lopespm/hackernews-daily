								<p class="story__comment_others">"What really raises the most suspicion of the lab leak theory in my mind was how the Chinese government acted towards the rest of the scientific community...well before it was a theory at all. Not allowing foreign scientists in, destroying evidence, arresting journalists, etc. That just screams cover-up, even if there was none (in terms of a lab leak.)Then Western scientists that rely on grants with Chinese ties, etc trying to cover the asses publicly, while privately saying it&#39;s possible...really doesn&#39;t inspire a lot of public confidence imo. There is a pretty big monetary incentive from the very people that we&#39;d want to figure this out to say it didn&#39;t happen, even if it did."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If this comment thread is the way the self proclaimed smartest forum on the web deals with articles like this then we&#39;re doomed.This article contributes zero actual evidence, is littered with out of context quotes (including of all places the title), doesn&#39;t appear to understand the science or the probabilities involved and finally is clearly written with an agenda.It shouldn&#39;t have been posted to HN in the first place, it just serves to divide, not to find fact. If there is an article that deals with the actual evidence available in a neutral manner it would be nice to read, but opinion-masquerading-as-fact is not."</p>

It was in 2017, around April 12th when we launched Postmates Unlimited - the subscription program that inspired all this. Now, we all know Postmates didn&#39;t win the space but some product decisions outlast a company and this was one one of them. I still remember the meeting when we decided to launch the subscription. No one had ever done it, the board thought it was nuts. It became the industry standard. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like these marketplaces could maybe justify 30% on the purchase of an app up front, where there are clear benefits to the exposure and platform offered by them. But ongoing revenue is really attributable to the app itself and feels to me much harder to justify.At this point I’d be happy if Apple just let me install apps outside their ecosystem, then they could at least defend themselves by saying if the developers aren’t happy with the terms of the App Store they can offer alternative methods."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The answer is simple.  Uber, Lyft, and everyone else, should have different pricing on Android and iPhone.For something that costs $10 on Android, charge $13 for iPhone.This is a win-win solution.  The app companies get more money and Apple gets positioning as a premium brand."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I need to share something as literally today I fixed a bug in our project that&#39;s somewhat related.MS SQL encodes everything with UTF-16. Emojis (code points) require up to 4 bytes. If it&#39;s a grapheme (emoji constructed from emojis), it will be even more.We are using Django. If you check length of an emoji, it will give you `1` and Django assumes utf8 everywhere. If you try to save it to PostgreSQL with char field `max_length=1` it will work just fine, but on MS SQL it will fail as it requires 2 characters (4 bytes) in the DB!I tried it with MS SQL 2017, 2019 with different collations on nvarchar and I&#39;m pretty sure there&#39;s no way around it.&gt; Because in CHAR(n) and VARCHAR(n) or in NCHAR(n) and NVARCHAR(n), the n defines the byte storage size, not the number of characters that can be stored, it&#39;s important to determine the data type size you must convert to, in order to avoid data truncation.https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/sql/relational-databases/co..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"SQLite is a relational database. Wouldn&#39;t it be a better fit to use a graph-database as the backend for anything &#34;web&#34;?The idea is good, that a web-page should be generated from some data somewhere. But &#34;web&#34; is much about not a single document but the links between the documents, which allow you to to represent a &#34;semantic net&#34;.  The data should be  about the links between them. Now where is such a database?  And how can it &#34;sharded&#34; into multiple databases running in thousands of locations on the internet?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a similar idea with PDF documents. Instead of having the royal PITA of parsing generated PDFs (e.g. invoices), things would be much simpler if every generated PDF came with a built-in SQLite or JSON that contains the structured data of that PDF.One day I will do it.Speaking more broadly, whether we talk about HTML or PDF it&#39;s the same problem: documents should have two representations - human-friendly and machine-friendly until AI gets so good that only having the human-friendly representation is enough."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Effectively, this is a pretty cool way to get an OSS version of something like https://www.snowflake.com/guides/public-data.  Also something like a lighter version of https://datasette.io/.The thing it&#39;s kinda missing for me is the ability to compose multiple SQLite databases, possibly provided by different domains.It&#39;d be nice to join together different public datasets.  In a weird personal example, if Strava exposed SQLite, I&#39;d love to do a join to weather.com and see when the last time I biked in the rain was.It&#39;d be cool if one half of some table was at foo.com and I could add a few rows to it on my bar.com domain, and then the combined dataset was queryable as a single unit."</p>

We&#39;ve been hard at work improving the model quality since the last time the site was posted[1]As both a professional fantasy illustrator &amp; software engineer, I find the concept of AI creativity so fascinating. On one hand, I know that mathematically AI only can hallucinate images that fit within the distribution of things that it&#39;s seen. But from the artist perspective, the model&#39;s ability to blend two existing styles into something so distinctly new is so incredible (and not to mention also commercially useful!)Anyways, happy to answer any question, thoughts, or concerns!---[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20511459]"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is extremely impressive. It’s the first GAN I have seen which lets you tweak the result in a meaningful way rather than being just random.I think the speed that GANs have come in to the world has really shaken people up and it’s hard to process what this all means and what it will result in. Especially the ones which generate based on real people.But the feeling this gives me, is what happens for the future of art. Sure, this example is no where even close to replacing real artists, but it’s already generating images better than I can draw after a year of practice. It does give me a feeling of “what is the point”. Which might be an irrational feeling, but I’m sure others feel the same."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Sock shoe sock shoe or sock sock shoe shoe?This is an amusing question. I was thoroughly confused by what this meant.In my country, I keep my socks in a completely different room from my shoes. So when I put on clothes, I first have to put on socks, then leave the room, and then put on the shoes. I&#39;ve observed the same in Germany, France, Austria, Poland, and Spain (off the top of my head).As a separate issue, the habit of walking in shoes within your house is still utterly baffling to me. I&#39;ve seen people not walk in shoes even at the office (because it&#39;s uncomfortable). Can&#39;t imagine the smell of feet after walking in shoes the whole day."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A more recent example of &#34;how the heck do I pronounce this word&#34; is Bazel, the build system.I&#39;ve always pronounced it like &#34;hazel&#34;, but many of my colleagues rhyme it with &#34;dazzle&#34;.The Bazel website even has an FAQ entry about it, but they managed to completely confuse the issue:&gt; How do you pronounce “Bazel”?&gt; The same way as “basil” (the herb) in US English: “BAY-zel”. It rhymes with “hazel”. IPA: /ˈbeɪzˌəl/https://bazel.build/faq.htmlLittle problem here... Basil, the herb, can be pronounced either like hazel or like dazzle. Or even rhymed with hassle!So naturally I opened a PR attempting to clarify this.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The most stunning outcome here is the apparent internet consensus that Star Wars is better than Star Trek.This is indefensible.A Star Wars fan will tell you there are, at most, four good Star Wars movies. A Star Trek fan will tell you there are 6-7 good Star Trek movies, depending on whether you count Galaxy Quest. This might leave us with some room for debate about whether the cultural impact of Star Wars episodes 4 and 5 outweigh Star Trek&#39;s larger amount of quality material.Except that Star Trek is a TV show.For the movie franchise to not even be the better movie franchise is just... there&#39;s... it&#39;s not even a question."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"With all the lock-in and connectedness of Google owned systems, they cannot complain.  And it&#39;s not Apple&#39;s fault that Google can&#39;t build long term successes in most products it creates.  That&#39;s a management/strategy problem.How many messaging systems has Google had over the years?Their shotgun approach works financially, but it means that only a few of their projects really stick (win).  The rest just trundle along until they get discontinued.The hypocricy is tiresome.  When there&#39;s a regulation that threatens them, they make a lot of noise about &#34;free market&#34;, and &#34;let the market decide&#34;.  But when the market decides against them, they want some government intervention."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"All Google had to do was to keep improving on their original messaging software, Google Talk.Similarly, Microsoft would likely be a dominant player in the chat space today if they hadn&#39;t rebranded and renamed MSN Messenger several times and then abandoned it altogether.MSN Messenger was frickin awesome. You could draw pictures into the chat window. You could play a game of checkers while you chatted. It had a thriving ecosystem of apps and plugins. Everyone I knew used MSN Messenger... and then one day, Microsoft just said screw it, everyone can move to slow and clunky Skype... and that was the end of it.Hell, ICQ might still be around if AOL had put more development resources into it.The chat space is so bloody fragmented now, but it has nothing to do with Apple. Any one of the above mentioned companies could be killing it in this space if they hadn&#39;t pissed away what they had."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google shouldn&#39;t have done its part to kill XMPP if they really cared about lock-in.iMessage is incredibly popular with certain demographics in the United States -- it&#39;s an in-group signifier the way teens have always had in-group signifiers (when I was in high school, it was AIM, a Nokia, and wearing Abercrombie) and that isn&#39;t about bullying. If Google had its way, its products would be used as the ways to &#34;bully&#34; the out-group. So this is much ado about nothing.It is notable that iMessage has persisted with its popularity in the US for as long as it has. And it is true that iMessage is definitely an ecosystem carrot, again, in the US. But in countries that didn&#39;t adopt SMS/MMS the same way we did in the US (b/c of cost/international variance/etc), the in-group messaging app is something else. It&#39;s always fascinating for me to go to other countries and see a ton of iPhone users not using iMessage but something else because that app has become the in-group signifier.And every teen I know uses Discord more than they use almost anything else. The ranking typically goes Discord, IG, iMessage.Having said all of that -- even if you took away iMessage, the iPhone would still be a status symbol/in-group signifier for a lot of people, especially young adults in the US. Samsung has had the best track record with some of its devices with approaching similar brand loyalty/&#34;it&#34; factor, but even if Apple adopted RCS -- it&#39;s not like the phone all the influencers and cool teens would be using would be Pixels. It would still be the iPhone for a host of reasons that have absolutely nothing to do with technology. White earbuds have been a fashion marker for 20 years now and that&#39;s what this comes down to. It isn&#39;t about lock-in or regulation or technology. It&#39;s about fashion."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"OCaml has recently interested me for being one of the few languages that:- Compiles to a binary
- Achieves good speed
- Is functional, while accommodating imperative styles.
- Has a static typeIn particular, it interests me because of how Forth or a threaded code-based VM could be implemented in it. You could implement the operations of such a machine with a bunch of individual function calls, but that&#39;s slow and rather unnecessary. A jump to the next VM instruction&#39;s code is what you want instead.Switch statements or pointers to labels are what are often used, but that means you end up with hundreds or even thousands of lines of code which cannot be split into modules. The solution OCaml and other functional languages provide involves tail-call optimization:  let rec first x = print_endline &#34;foo&#34; ; second(x)
  and second x = print_endline &#34;bar&#34; ; first(x);;

  first 1;;

In a usual compiled language, these two functions would only be able to print &#39;foobar&#39; a few hundred or thousand times before causing a stack overflow. In a language like OCaml this can run forever, and quickly too. This allows for what this web page calls continuation-passing threaded code:https://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/forth/threaded-code.htmlI have mocked up the concept in lua, an imperative language with tail call optimization, and it was quite easy to implement a basic Forth while keeping the code legible. To take the idea further OCaml feels like a good choice. If anyone has experience with OCaml, or any warnings, it would be helpful."</p>
