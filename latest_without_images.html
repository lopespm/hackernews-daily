								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There were days on the internet when a car analogy was appreciated -- let me try here.Suppose there was a rally driver who would claim that rally cars could go much faster if they were always driven in reverse. He did some rudimentary experiments and might have found a significant improvement. The general public and other racing drivers, who in my analogy can all be wonderful people but happen to know little about the mechanics of cars, are naturally enthusiastic: a potential breakthrough in driving! But clearly we need more experiments. So other rally drivers get to work: they set up an elaborate system with ropes and pulleys so they can reverse the driver&#39;s position in the car and run a car as fast as they can, but in reverse, on a test track. What do they find? Sadly, their answer is somewhat inconclusive, probably negative, but perhaps the test track had many bends. So they would like to repeat the experiment on a track with a few more straight segments: they write grant proposals, build a track, and plan other test runs... and all the time their progress is eagerly followed by the general public.Now suppose you are a car mechanic in all this. What are you to do? This cannot work! It flies completely in the face of the way cars are set up, not to speak of the disadvantages in air flow. So you can loudly dismiss the claim as preposterous early on, but then you will be called a pessimist and the public point out that at least the rally drivers are trying something new - what the bleep have you been doing all this time? So you just wait the whole thing out, see it come... and go.I guess I should at least be happy that I did not buy any shares in EnDrive Inc?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For everyone that’s expressing a view like “what a waste of time”, consider this. This hypothesis was by a respected scientist. The experiments have been done by lots of labs. There has been a reasonable position the skeptics have taken throughout. It still has taken a very long time of a bunch of smart people on how to build an experiment to rule these kinds of things out. That means theories have tighter bounds. Technology has been improved in the area which can have knock on beneficial educational and technological effects, etc. Being able to quickly and efficiently rule out hypotheses is a hallmark of the area that science shines in. Being able to say “no, definitely not” with very good certainty is a useful thing to this disciplines toolbelt. From that perspective it’s a pure win and worth any distraction on the scale of all human investment globally."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I placed an order for their previous model, they assured me that I should get it 4 - 8 weeks. After I didn&#39;t get anything for 6 months I messaged them that I want to withdraw my order (the phone had already old hardware during release, and it was a year old when I ordered it, but at the same time it cost as much as a high end phone). I got no response from them. I then contacted my credit card company and they charged back.It sucks, because, I would really love phone with a hardware keyboard. I would place an order, but am afraid of the same thing happening again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I still consider my old Nokia E70[0] my favorite phone of all time, so I am definitely in the target demographic for this, as I&#39;m 100% sold on the usefulness of a physical keyboard on a phone... However the CPU just doesn&#39;t match the &#34;pro&#34; branding, or the price range. I&#39;d personally rather throw an extra $200-300 on top to get a flagship CPU and then it would be close to a perfect phone for me! As it currently is, the Snapdragon 662 shipped in the pro-1x gets blown away by my current Pixel 5&#39;s Snapdragon 765G - and Pixel phones recently have been generally characterized as having &#34;above-average hardware specs but not enough to justify flagship prices&#34;.Separately, I am also curious for a phone like this that could run Android, LineageOS, and Ubuntu Touch - are there &#34;dual boot&#34; options in the mobile space? With 256GB storage it seems like it should be possible. I&#39;d like to have old reliable Android as a daily driver, but maybe periodically drop into a less stable but more flexible environment like ubuntu.[0]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_E70"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s no free lunch, and it&#39;s easy to overlook the compromises involved in the devices that used to have physical keyboards. By modern standards, blackberrys had a woefully small screen and phones with slideout keyboards were very fat. This device doesn&#39;t look fat which suggests to me that the compromise might be either battery life or low processor power.That said, although this is definitely not for me, it&#39;s generally good for the market to have some devices that are genuinely different rather than just another &#34;me too&#34; Samsung/iphone lookalike."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Does anyone expect covid to be a significant cause of death in the US past, say, May 15? I guess if we get another wave very soon, maybe it could persist. But it just seems like this is on its way out between organic immunity and vaccine immunity (especially because the latter was focused on the vulnerable).I&#39;m not an expert, so don&#39;t take this as advice to go coughing on everyone. But we all have to make some decisions based on imperfect information and it seems like covid is nearly knocked out.There is some concern over another wave, but it might just be minor cases from unvaccinated young people. That hopefully won&#39;t lead to a lot more deaths."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m seeing a lot of similar concerns in the comments so I just want to post this video from Vox. They did a great job explaining this issue.Effectiveness doesn’t really mean much between approved vaccines in the US. Please watch this video:
https://youtu.be/K3odScka55AFrom what we know so far, any of the approved vaccines are excellent and no one knows for sure if one is better than the other. The only logical thing to do is get what is offered to you as soon as possible.That being said, this is excellent news that Pfizer is protective against the SA Variant. Not trying to minimize that news, just point out that it still is better to just get whatever approved vaccine you can."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m always confused about &#34;effectiveness&#34; numbers. Are these &#34;effective at preventing severe disease&#34; or &#34;effective at preventing symptomatic disease&#34; or against transmission period? The article seems to suggest it&#39;s the latter, but it seems somewhat ambiguous. Does this term have a specific definition in epidemiology that journalists and pharma marketers assume everyone understands what kind of &#34;effectiveness&#34; they&#39;re talking about?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I receive a lot of newsletters and communiqués, some of which I even signed up for.So, I don&#39;t know what designers use to receive e-mail, but here in the non-designer / non-linux world, Outlook is pretty popular.
Now, Outlook - at least all configurations I have seen, has pictures via HTML disabled. I have sampled a few IT departments only, of course, but I feel like this is probably a pretty common policy.So let me tell you:Your picture banners, your &#34;rounded corner buttons&#34;, your main engagement centerpiece that&#39;s just a picture ... 
it all ends up being one of those nice 90&#39;s type beveled empty box we remember from surfing with IE and ISDN.This may be a shock, but it really doesn&#39;t make your important newsletter look any better. So, if you are not specifically going for nostalgic &#34;bad modem connection&#34; look and feel, maybe ease off the HTML pictures a bit, okay?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is desktop software, why is there a monthly fee?I occasionally want to send “nice looking” emails but get asked by lots of comms people about it. Recommending a monthly fee service is a non starter, but buying some software is pretty easy to decide. “Should I pay once? Or pay forever?”Is there anything in the functionality that takes advantage of SaaS? Other than updates and whatnot?Of course the price/value computation is up to y’all and your customers but office365 only costs $10/month. Seems tough to value authoring email as higher value than cloud productivity suite.It would be nice if there was a way people like me could use since our competition is an outlook template but still scale up to people who may do this all the time and be willing to pay $20+/month."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"HTML in email is legacy hell. I wonder if someone wants to create a new MIME-type like text/html+css, and clients who want can implement it.In theory you could have representations of the message like video/mpeg4 and text/plain, and depending on the client capabilities and configuration, the receiver could watch a video or read plain text. The information content of the 2 (or more) don&#39;t even have to be the same! Found this out when trying to parse text out of emails into a CRM system, another system sent information in the HTML part, but an empty plaintext part."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Just in case you were operating under the illusion that tech giants are run by forward thinking executives who are immune to the usual politics and problems of corporate life. Nope, most of their exec layer is a bunch of people who cut their teeth the industry in the 90&#39;s, and are operating within a thick fog of local workplace politics. I guarantee that behind this move is an executive who believes that developers need to be physically colocated to be productive, because that&#39;s how it worked when he was coming up at WordPerfect or whatever. Backing it is also a group of people who have a lot to gain from it politically.At my employer we have some  pockets of embarrassing leadership like this, but thankfully I haven&#39;t seen it in anyone senior enough to make global policy like this.  My department is letting go of remote teams and only hiring in a handful of cities around the world, while ramping up office space spending. It&#39;s more expensive, less flexible, and less productive... and everyone knows it. But I guess it makes some people feel important, and it&#39;s how some others remember developing when they last did it 20 years ago. So it&#39;s happening anyway, and many of their best engineers are now on the market."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When will introverts realise that their working conditions are being dictated to them by extroverts? The pandemic-driven remote working is hell for some people, and unfortunately they call the shots.I don’t mind coming into your office now and again (there’s a special dimension to IRL connections), but the reason I don’t want to work there full time is that it’s crap for knowledge work. I outspend you by 10x per head in my home office, and everything there is to my exact specification. The whole field of modern office design should be a discredited pseudoscience; management is addicted to it because of the real estate crisis though.This is also kind of terrible, because a lot of people use FAANG as their North star for every policy decision.“Well Google use primary colours in their logo, Brian”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have been working remotely for decades.Most people can&#39;t work remotely and productively because they are not trained to do so. E.g. You are in your office (inside your home) and your wife, your dog or child enters it demanding you do some kind of non important issue right now, distracting you from your work.You need to be trained to not them let them distract you. The people living in your house need to be trained as well on what to do.The training for working in the(external) Office started at school, from a time fiber optics telecommunications were unheard for common mortals.Most people feel alone because they lack the social skills to make friends outside work, or just lack the initiative, knowledge and internal motivation to work without external pressure and supervision.The companies that will solve this issue at big scale in the future are those that solve it because the they have to in order to survive(against established companies). It will be a startup that faces all the risks involved, not an established company like Google or Facebook.It will not be companies that could pay millions for people living in ultra expensive places and are already making big bucks doing that. They don&#39;t need to change because the system already works for them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"SSN, DOB and other personal data of my child is part of this leak. But it was already leaked through  a different hack at a health insurance provider in any case.It should be clear by now that as long as the data is stored somewhere it is at risk of being leaked. It doesn&#39;t matter how secure you think your tech stack is. Improving tech is not the solution. Here&#39;s the solution:1. Don&#39;t collect information in the first place, unless absolutely needed. Some schools collect DOB, address and so on just to register for a webinar.2. Don&#39;t permanently store information. If you collect SSN for employability verification then do the verification, store a flag, then delete the SSN. Similarly, after verifying DOB, store a flag then delete DOB.3. Assume information is already public. This is the most important part. Despite all of the leaks happening, many financial and other sites will let you use your DOB, SSN etc. to prove that you are who you say you are. This is absurd. It appears American businesses prioritize convenience over security. Americans need to demand better."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The damage from incidents such as this would be at least somewhat limited if organizations did not collect SS numbers when they have no legal purpose for doing so, and if people did not automatically comply when asked to supply these numbers. Whenever I go to the doctor and am asked to fill out the usual form while waiting the usual 90 minutes past my scheduled appointment time, I leave the ubiquitous space for my SS number blank. They are not paying me a salary, so have no legitimate need for this number. I know why they want it, and that purpose does not benefit me. Not once has this led to a problem: they know that there is no legal basis for demanding the number, but ask for it anyway, as they have nothing to lose by doing so."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Sublime Text has the strangest development cycle I can think of.It does big-bang releases with lots of features, followed by frequent bug fix releases that quickly resolve issues, followed then by years of silence even though there are still issues... until there&#39;s a major version bump and the cycle starts again.This then means that the plugin ecosystem is fairly under developed and inactive because there&#39;s little incentive to actively develop plugins for software that appears to be dead.I used Sublime for many years and it was hard to let it go, the speed was great and the SublimeGit plugin was the best Git client I&#39;ve used, but multi-project development was a pain because the Python/JS/etc plugins didn&#39;t have good support for virtualenvs/per-project config/etc, and it was clear that they were out of active development.I switched to another editor and it&#39;s slower, but fast enough. It&#39;s not quite as nice in many ways but it&#39;s nice enough. Critically though it&#39;s got a great plugin for most things."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are text editors and there are IDEs, and each has its place. Sublime Text is, to me, the best GUI text editor around.(For those with the patience to master them, Vim or Emacs may be both objectively and subjectively better. But I&#39;ve never had that patience. Emacs has a hell of a steep learning curve.)You can&#39;t knock Sublime for not having the features of an IDE, because that&#39;s not what it is. If we keep pushing for Sublime to be as &#34;full featured&#34; as an IDE, we&#39;re gonna kill what makes it great.VSC seems to be trying to be both, and by all appearances, those who like it, like it a lot. I&#39;m not in that group, but I admit that there may be something(s) outstanding about it that I just haven&#39;t yet appreciated."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I switched from Sublime to VSCode around 2017, and then switched back to Sublime in 2019. My return to Sublime was triggered by a funfunfunction video[1] wherein Mattias recounts an anecdote where he spent an enormous amount of time learning and configuring his IDE, editors, and tools.I realized this is what I was doing with VSCode -- adding more and more extensions, and spending an increasing amount of time configuring them or troubleshooting them when they broke. I realized I was happier and more productive using a &#34;dumber&#34; tool like Sublime Text. I still use plugins with ST, but try to keep them to an absolute minimum. If there is a CLI for what I want to do, I prefer to just use that instead of an extension that obfuscates it. Also, ST is significantly snappier than VSCode, an Electron app.I&#39;ve been using ST4 for over a week now, and it&#39;s been a breath of fresh air.[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIjKJjzRX_E"</p>
