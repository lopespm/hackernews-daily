								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Magnusviri[0], the original author of the SD M1 repo credited in this article, has merged his fork into the Lstein Stable Diffusion fork.You can now run the Lstein fork[1] with M1 as of a few hours ago.This adds a ton of functionality - GUI, Upscaling &amp; Facial improvements, weighted subprompts etc.This has been a big undertaking over the last few days, and I highly recommend checking it out. See the mac m1 readme [3][0] https://github.com/magnusviri/stable-diffusion[1] https://github.com/lstein/stable-diffusion[2] https://github.com/lstein/stable-diffusion/blob/main/README-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Everyone posting their pip/build/runtime errors is everything that&#39;s wrong with tooling built on top of python and its ecosystem.It would be nice to see the ML community move on to something that&#39;s actually easily reproducible and buildable without &#34;oh install this version of conda&#34;, &#34;run pip install for this package&#34;, &#34;edit this line in this python script&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s insane to me how fast this is moving. I jumped through a bunch of hoops 2-3 days ago to get this running on my M1 Mac&#39;s GPU and now it&#39;s way easier. I imagine we will have a nice GUI (I&#39;m aware of the web-ui, I haven&#39;t set it up yet) packaged in an mac .app by the end of next week. Really cool stuff."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Funny story: my first task when I joined the original iPhone team was to merge our forked WebKit with master. It was a sort of hazing ritual slash &#34;when else would we do it but when someone new joins?&#34;. Anyways, we used a tool called SVK[1] in order to get very primitive &#34;git-like&#34; abilities. It was basically a bunch of scripts that used SVN under the hood. For example, in order to get the &#34;local everything&#34;-style behaviors of git, the very first thing it did was checkout every single version of the repository in question. For WebKit, this meant that the first day was spent leaving the computer alone and letting it download for hours. I made the mistake of having a space somewhere in the path of the target folder, which broke something or other, so I ended up having to do it all over again.Anyways, I distinctly remember one of the instructions for merging WebKit in our internal wiki being something like &#34;now type `svk merge`, but hit ctrl-c immediately after! You don&#39;t want to use the built-in merge, it&#39;ll break everything, but this is the only way to get a magic number that you can find stored in [some file] after the merge has started. If it&#39;s not there, try `svk merge` again and let it go a little longer than last time.&#34; A few hires later (I think possibly a year after) someone set up a git mirror internally to avoid having to do this craziness, which if I remember correctly, was treated with some skepticism. This was 2007, so why would we try some new-fangled git thing when we had svk?1. https://wiki.c2.com/?SvkVersionControl"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is not even the most famous case of such practice in China, which goes to He Zhili [1].[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/He_ZhiliThe gist is that she was ordered to lose in one World Table Tennis Championships, but refused and proceeded to be the champion.Later she wasn&#39;t selected for the next Olympic, which she felt was the punishment for her disobedience. She later immigrated to Japan and played for their national team and gave China some trouble for a while.There is also this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badminton_at_the_2012_Summer_O...The funny thing is, they do that in table tennis (actually also badminton in some other cases other than the one in the article) not even just to secure the gold medal: since China is/was so dominant in this sport, they sometimes do it to ensure certain player can get his/her &#34;grand slam&#34; [2] (to win all the major tournaments in their career).[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_tennis#Notable_players"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"FWIW, Ye&#39;s story has been reported on Chinese media since at least 2007: https://web.archive.org/web/20170309082422/http://sports.soh.... Unfortunately Google Translate doesn&#39;t seem to work on wayback machine, but you can copy paste the text.Funnily enough, at least in this particular report, it is her coach who told the story. Really shows how this behavior was normalized enough for it not to be considered too shameful to admit.The reason Ye and her husband are persona non grata is unrelated to the Olympic incident, but because her husband is involved in the &#34;New Federal State of China&#34; (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Federal_State_of_China). Supposedly this is what the &#34;fierce criticism&#34; the article is referring to."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Iranian athletes have been dealing with this nightmare: if in an international competition they face a competitor from Israel, they will be told that they have to avoid competing.This is part of Iran&#39;s Islamic government&#39;s symbolic gesture to show that they do not recognize a country by that name, and so their representatives do not compete against them.This has caused a huge amount of damage on these athletes&#39; professional lives. Imagine an Olympic competition, you might be in the right shape to compete in the Olympic only once, and you miss that not by your chance.No officials in Iran take the responsibility of this decision, no one knows what institute forces athletes to abandon their competition, but this continues.Many of top athletes migrate to other countries (usually just stay in the country they are for the competition as refugees, and do not come back with the team, then they move to another country) for a chance to compete free from this restriction."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"While I agree completely with the premise of this article, on the other hand I&#39;m weighing the relatively robust findings by Meehl et al. They find, time and time again, in all sorts of fields, that extremely parsimonious models like equal-weighted linear regression of one or two predictors outperform expert judgment[1].One would think this is cognitively dissonant enough, but it gets worse:This article, with the thesis that good arguments are more important than data, is based on, well, a good argument – not much data. On the other hand, the work by Meehl et al. claiming pretty much the opposite, is based on, well, a lot of data, and maybe not much intuitive reasoning. (There&#39;s some, yes, but the main thrust of why I believe it is that variants of the experiment have been replicated reliably.)I don&#39;t know what to believe. Fortunately, as I&#39;ve grown older, I&#39;ve become more comfortable with holding completely dissonant opinions in my head at the same time.----Edit a few minutes later: This actually prompted me to refresh on the subject. It might be the case that Meehl is actually making the same argument as this article, only it gets distorted when repeated. Some things are reliably measurable; for those things be data-driven. Other things not so much, then use your expertise.----[1]: Here&#39;s just one relatively early example: http://apsychoserver.psych.arizona.edu/JJBAReprints/PSYC621/..."</p>

But if you start to ask questions, it&#39;s all very obvious that they didn&#39;t really understood what they were doing and that very often it doesn&#39;t really matter to them in the first place; it&#39;s all about reaching a decision using some pseudo-scienty method that nobody dares to question because &#39;data&#39; and &#39;science&#39;, without having to take responsibility."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have experienced this first hand, so this article resonates a lot with me.I worked with a manager who prioritized work which was easily measurable, so he could report the good numbers to leadership and get career points out of this. Unfortunately the project we took on was a demanding and technically challenging problem, and in almost a year of work of a team of engineers we made barely any real progress or made any actual difference, but the numbers were great and people were satisfied during presentations. I ended up feeling completely disconnected from my job and losing all motivation to work there."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Yes, the situation is dire. I live in Lisbon as a foreigner for more than 12 years now. We pay a rent for a small flat that used to be very expensive and now is on the cheap side in our quarter of the city. Luckily, we have an older contract that cannot be changed as easily as newer ones. I&#39;m not thrilled by the possibility that our landlord might cancel it some day, however, e.g. for relatives to move in. Rents in the city have skyrocketed, we&#39;d have a hard time finding anything, even though we both work full-time and have salaries above average. It&#39;s crazy because all new homes and apartments are &#34;luxury apartments&#34; with insanely high pricing both for buying and renting. They&#39;re mostly empty or are (often illegally) rented out as holiday apartments. It&#39;s incomprehensible to me how ordinary Portuguese families survive in Lisbon. I guess most of them have inherited property.Quite honestly, apart from the generally increasing  gap between rich and the poor, one big problem in societies nowadays is that you can simply get richer and richer just from owning property. For example, if you own three ordinary apartments in Lisbon, you can live in one of them and easily make a good living by renting out the other two as holiday apartments. Because cleaning services, guys who do repairs, etc., are cheap in Portugal, this involves almost no work. Moreover, the net worth of your property will continually increase while you do (almost) nothing. I&#39;m not saying I blame these people, I would do the same if I had the opportunity, but this is a huge structural problem in my opinion."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This sounds like what happened in the SFbay area(south bay/pennisula), I grew up there and it used to be a great place to live, center left politics, lots of families and a diverse set of industries with many middle class opportunities. right around 10-15 years ago things started to change dramatically for the worse, housing and costs everywhere skyrocketed, homeless population exploded, politics veered hard left. Most of my friends from high school(90%) were forced to leave due to rents going from $1k a month to $3k a month for a 1-2 bdrm apts. Those that owned houses also moved as they were fed up with crime and could get a way better house somewhere else. Middle class jobs all disappeared from the area, families also left, the neighborhoods I lived in San Jose (rose garden/willow glen) had barely any kids for my daughter to play with as there were no families anymore, the rose garden neighborhood had 0 kids on the street, the willow glen neighborhood had 1 family w/ kids who moved away during the pandemic.I was lucky and making really good money in tech but was devastated by how the area I grew up in had turned into a nightmare and everyone I know (even family) leaving the area. I too ended leaving as the cost vs. quality of life didn&#39;t make any sense and I couldn&#39;t see my family living in a place I didn&#39;t even recognize anymore. Most people don&#39;t talk about it but there is a huge diaspora of bay area residents due to the stuff mentioned above and it breaks my heart to think we will most likely never return and familiy/friends I expected to spend the rest of my life with all leaving."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very difficult to change because, in the &#34;Pax Neoliberalia&#34; world we live in, profits are Sacrosanct - and the higher the capital concentration, the holier so.
But some straightforward fixes:1. Flood the market with affordable state housing, Austria-style - with the bonus of building new, boosting the national economy.2. Create very progressive (rapidly rising) taxes based on property value - making untenable the current practice of parking money and profit by simply buying &amp; holding empty flats and the like.3. Raise salaries - currently portuguese salaries, and their weight on GDP, rank the lowest in the EU.(and no, it won&#39;t create an inflation spiral:
the current inflation spike is, first and foremost, the result of a supply shock, price-gouging and speculative/cartel practices - corporate profits being at a record high is proof of that)Unfortunately, incentives are heavily stacked on leaving things as they are, as the ruling class is mostly made up of the landlord class, and, is not sensitive to (sometimes even not aware of) the struggles of assetless commoners that only earn income from their (low) salaried labor. Or, even worse, stands to lose their current large gains on capital/assets if this is fixed - and most portuguese media outlets trumpet their - private - master&#39;s voice and interests.
Additionally, just leaving things as they are, also scores brownie points with the EU by making the Government (even if &#34;center-left&#34;) appear &#34;frugal&#34;. And PM Costa has personal ambitions for future EU high office.(...who will be the next head of the European Commission or the European Council?)"</p>

But that&#39;s false.An email system that guarantees case-insensitive email addresses can still fail during comparisons of lowercase-to-lowercase, due to international encodings, locales, I18N, L10N, etc.Pseudocode:    string-compare-case-insensitive(x, y) =&gt; true // Right way

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the goals of any code base of significant size should be to reduce the cognitive load (not lines of code per function).Assume the developer working here just had a 45 mins sync, has a meaningless repeat meeting about vapourware in 10 mins and a 2 hours town hall meeting after lunch... and still have to deliver that mess of a requirement you made him promise to deliver before any of these interruptions were even on his calendar!- Always aim for declarative programming (abstract out the how it does it),- limit the depth of the function calls (rabbit hole developers...),- separate business logic from framework internals and- choose composition over inheritance.- Also avoid traits and mixins (run from the dark magic)- don&#39;t over document the language or framework, only the eyebrow raising lines, the performance sensitive stuff and the context surrounding the file if it isn&#39;t obvious.- name stuff to be easily grepableEasy rules to go by, (there are probably more), they can make or break your ability to work, so that you can get interrupted 12 times an hour and still commit work.I don&#39;t find these in books, just decades of sweating and pulling my hair &#34;why does it have to be so hard!?&#34; I have met plenty of senior devs who naturally do the same thing now.The code size fallacy is a prime example of the wrong way to look at it. Plenty of extremely large code base in C++ are far more manageable than small JavaScript apps.Mixing boilerplate framework junk with your intellectual property algorithms &#34;what makes your software yours&#34; is a sure way to hinder productivity in the long term.You write code 3-4 times. You read it 365 times a year.One last thing I recommend if you deal with a lot of interruptions and maybe multiple products, various code bases... keep a    // @next reintegrate with X

The @next comment &#39;marker&#39; is a great way to mark exactly which line of which file you were at before you left this project, for a meeting, for lunch, for the day, etc.  And it allows you jump back into context by searching for @next and go. Also since it&#39;s visual and located, your brain has a much better time remembering the context, since we&#39;re good with places and visual landmarks.It&#39;s far more efficient than roughly remembering what I was doing, looking at the last commit, scrolling endlessly through open files. Don&#39;t commit @next though :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Multiple levels of abstraction kills me, at least without adequate documentation. Conceptually, it&#39;s veey easy to grasp, but in code it becomes a mess making jumps through multiple unfamiliar files in a large code base. Essentially, you end up having to hold all the pertinent information on that code in your head, which largely defeats some of the purposes of breaking them into multiple files."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve often thought of this as &#34;developer empathy&#34; when I was working at Amazon. Generally regarding people who create APIs for other developers to use. The idea being that you can make your API simple or complex, and most developers tend to make their API complex, because they think their system is really powerful and cool and want to expose all the power to end users. But, you need to remember that your users aren&#39;t just using your API. They are using maybe 100 other ones as well. And there is no way for a person to learn the ins and outs of all 101 complex APIs. Add to this the fact that the more complexity you expose, the more unintentionally coupled your API becomes to your implementation (generally). So, make your APIs simple, and provide backdoors if you really want to expose complexity.I will say, this did not get me promoted at Amazon."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve worked at multiple startups sub 50 to &gt;1000 (unicorn status) and have founded and sold my own company. I&#39;ve also worked at a few of the FAANGs. This is common advice, especially among VCs since it&#39;s one of the key benefits used to pitch prospective employees on giving up that fat FAANG salary, but in my personal experience, it&#39;s not so cut and dry.Working in a startup will brand you as a startup person and help you meet VCs which may make it easier to raise. It&#39;ll also show you the problems that that particular startup faces and give you n=1 degree of pattern matching. On the flip side, something like YC can give you the same benefit or just shipping a for-profit side project on the side. Additionally, given how poorly run most startups are today, I&#39;d posit that you&#39;re actually in more danger of learning the wrong lessons than the right lessons by joining a startup. At the end of the day, the truth is likely to be Peter Thiel&#39;s observation that joining the right, highly successful, high growth startup as a very early employee is a great way to learn exactly 1 method of starting a successful company--the way that company did it. But if the startup you join isn&#39;t that rocketship, you&#39;ve only learned how to (or how not to) achieve that particular path of failure or mediocrity.Not particularly great advice though, because then the challenge becomes identify those startups. And if you could do that reliably, I&#39;d suggest you switch careers into VC instead :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Want to get to point X? Visit point Y first!&#34;Just go to point X directly. Too many people shy away from their dreams and delay, because they want to learn first, practice first, and get ready before the real adventure. You will never deplete &#34;more things to learn&#34;. You are only depleting your lifetime. And no matter how close working at a startup is to working on a startup, it will never be as close to it as itself.If you need to save up some money or take care of any other blockers first for your own safety, fine. If there is a great company working on a great problem that you are excited by, great. But if you want to start a new company, then working at a startup is not a practice for starting a new startup. It is a practice for working at a startup and a practice for wasting another day of your life not living the way you really want to live."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wish I had had that opportunity back in 1985 when I founded my first one, but being outside of the Bay Area (as in 1500 miles away) there were basically no software startups at all, and with no internet/web/ycombinator etc, no way to learn anything except by trying and failing. We did ship our product, do marketing, make some sales but not enough so we had to sell the product and close down. Today I know all things I did wrong but back then you were working in a world unlike today, and not even one person to ask as everyone starting software companies back then was just as clueless unless you were in a few places in the country. It&#39;s hard to explain to people today just how hard this was (for example I tried to borrow some money at a local bank to buy computers, and when told we were a software company, the loan officer assumed we were making ladies undergarments)."</p>
