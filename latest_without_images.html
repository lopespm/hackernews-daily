								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This literally could have been written by any developer in the UK. I think most of us start out like this! I think the best one was a company I worked for in Leeds, it was building a secure learning platform for schools which ultimately fell flat on it&#39;s arse. The company was run by a self-made millionaire who was notorious for scamming people.He&#39;d randomly lay off huge numbers of the sales team, and the first anyone would know about it is when the door code would be changed and we&#39;d have to ring the &#34;office manager&#34; (ex-SAS) for the new code.His grand idea to save the failing online learning platform was &#34;pivoting&#34; to selling personalised dog food online........... (and I mean personalised in the sense of just slapping the dogs name and their face on some generic crap dog food, not actually nutritionally personalised to the dog)Left that place being owed 3 months wages (which I never got).Last I heard he was being investigated for fraud. (this was the scum bag in question: https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/04/barclays-sm...)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is eerily similar to a job I had. I also worked for a young asshole CEO called Andrew, with multiple rubbish businesses, pretending to have more money than he had, having no idea what he was doing, and faced jail time a few years after I left.If you replace &#34;property market&#34; with &#34;education sector&#34; and &#34;UK&#34; with &#34;Australia&#34; we could have almost written the exact same article.I wonder how many of these companies are out there. Be wary of CEOs that don&#39;t bring anything other than money to the table. The more useless someone is, the more of a cunt they can be. Obviously this guy was struggling to pay his rent so he was going to take whatever job came up, but if you&#39;re entering startups and have the privilege of a bit of money in the bank and time on your side, try and pick the one with founders that are actually doing the work themselves. Look for some proof that they&#39;ve built, designed or sold something substantial, before you agree to do all the work for them. Because if they haven&#39;t even begun to do the hard yards themselves, they&#39;re not likely to respect any of your work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My first paid developer job was writing backend code for what I would later learn was the Canadian mafia. I was doing some backend and embedded work to build super shitty gambling kiosks for them. They already had some person &#34;managing&#34; project and the Indian contract house that was building flash games for the kiosk. He was useless, so I was stuck figuring everything out. Including getting things running on a then obsolete HP Itanium Integrity server with an old insecure version of Fedora on it. Plus figuring out how this was all going to work in the Dominican Republic where power was not a given at any particular time nor was connectivity. These kiosks would be scattered across 10&#39;s of casinos down there.Eventually things got weird, and I figured out that it was probably a form of scam against their investors. Since they wanted things very insecure and unlogged. Then they wanted me to come down to the DR and help with setup there. I bounced at that point, I was unwilling to give them that sort of power over me. They were in with the former president down there and I would have been at their mercy.10 ish years later I would hear from the &#34;manager&#34; again. He wanted me to help with an automated locker system. I helped a bit but once he begged me to go to an ATT store and recharge his prepaid phone I was done with him. (I did recharge his phone because I am a sucker for a sob story)If someone seems scummy, DO NOT work for them. Your gut is probably telling you something.That said, a good work ethic and a baptism by fire where you have to do everything can be an effective way to get your start."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wow this is like a flashback to my own experiments in Excel,  prior to going full mad-scientist for the past 6 months and creating a web app for FI/FIRE planning called ProjectiFi:https://projectifi.io/I had been using similar functions in parts of my spreadsheet, but as I kept adding more and more nuance and flexibility to the life planning and projection aspects, eventually the formulas just reached such a critical mass that the whole spreadsheet got really painful to maintain. If you feel like kicking the tires on ProjectiFi, I&#39;d be curious to hear your thoughts -- I&#39;ve been working hard to make everything that had become unwieldy and difficult in Excel for FI planning and experimentation feel more intuitive and straightforward."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Love these formulas and wish this information was more understood and accessible to people when making decisions. I&#39;ve personally benefited a lot from a mortgage payoff spreadsheet I have. It&#39;s so easy to duplicate a tab, change the interest rate or additional payments and see what the long term impact is.That being said, and a disclaimer that I created this, I have been charting my path to being able to retire early. I found it difficult when duplicating tabs to simulate different scenarios and keeping the tabs up-to-date with formula changes. If this speaks to any of you, then consider checking out the tool I made - I have not looked back at my old spreadsheets.Sample forecast: https://fiers.co/forecast/6020f254b4e8cForecast comparison: https://fiers.co/forecasts/compare/6020f254b4e8c/60488472528..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The value of work is not in the work done; it&#39;s in the decisions being made. It&#39;s the ability to handle edge cases, to work your way through ambiguity, to &#34;unstuck&#34; a stuck situation, and to resolve tricky unforeseen issues.If you build a robot that only handles the main workflow and can&#39;t handle any of the exceptions, you&#39;re not automating anything; you&#39;re building a convenience tool. Basically, you&#39;re removing some of the labor part of the job, but still keeping the decision making part of the job for humans.This is both economically unviable and largely unpopular. You&#39;re not reducing labor costs by much, because you still need humans around. And workers lose control over their job, and have to &#34;work around&#34; the robot&#39;s limitations. Instead of being freed up to do more work, they become babysitters of machines that they have to oversee so it doesn&#39;t mess up everything.This is why partial robotic systems don&#39;t really exist; either it&#39;s a nifty tool that speeds up a small repeatable process of your work, or it&#39;s building the entire house."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The question I would have around automated building construction is &#34;why use bricks?&#34;.Bricks are great for humans to build with, they are just the right size and weight for the human hand to manipulate and place.  They are not optimised for machine manipulation.I would guess that if you wanted to automate construction you would start by making things like walls on an automated production line, then ship the largest practical piece to the construction site.  Once there I&#39;m guessing some automated cranes could move them into location far more easily than thousands of slightly randomly sized pieces of hard clay.Work out what problem you are trying to solve.  Do you want cheap construction?  then why choose a material that requires thousands of operations just to build a wall regardless of if it is a human or machine doing the building.  There are far more efficient building materials used every day... Just see how fast commercial buildings can be constructed and you can be sure that they are optimised both for speed of construction as well as (hopefully) energy efficiency and ease of maintance after construction.The problem seems to be people have a emotional idea of what a dream house is, an idea that is firmly stuck in the red brick house of 1970&#39;s sitcoms."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you think bricklaying is a simple task, you&#39;ve probably never laid bricks, or likely ever worked a construction job.There is _a lot_ that goes into laying a brick wall. From excavation, base compaction, material choice, mortar composition and viscosity, wall type, overlap patterns, leveling, overhang patterns, set time, and much more. Using an incorrect overhang pattern for instance can allow water drops to fall and contact the relatively soft surface of bricks and destroy them in a few years. Having an incomplete mortar seal allows the elements to penetrate through what would normally be waterproof, especially in places with high wind. An improper excavation, compaction material or compaction of said material, improper leveling, and many more factors will lead to failure within just a few years.The best way to learn about this stuff is to go try it! One could volunteer for Habitat for Humanity or a local shelter that builds homes and get some time with the tools. None of this stuff is simple, straightforward, or easy, and there are a million ways to do it incorrectly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article touches on &#34;Request Coalescing&#34; which is a super important concept - I&#39;ve also seen this called &#34;dog-pile prevention&#34; in the past.Varnish has this built in - good to see it&#39;s easy to configure with NGINX too.One of my favourite caching proxy tricks is to run a cache with a very short timeout, but with dog-pile prevention baked in.This can be amazing for protecting against sudden unexpected traffic spikes. Even a cache timeout of 5 seconds will provide robust protection against tens of thousands of hits per second, because request coalescing/dog-pile prevention will ensure that your CDN host only sends a request to the origin a maximum of once ever five seconds.I&#39;ve used this on high traffic sites and seen it robustly absorb any amount of unauthenticated (hence no variety on a per-cookie basis) traffic."</p>

It works on the same principles, with the added nuance of also needing to replicate data over high-latency networks between data centers as far apart as Sao Paulo and Mumbai for eg.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"While the article is correct, it omits most of the actual function of CUPS. Many printers are capable of accepting various types of documents directly over the network, with postscript, HP PCL, and PDF being commonly supported---and ASCII pretty much universally supported.The problem is that few printers support _all_ of these standards. Postscript, for example, is surprisingly complex to implement in practice, which leads to a lot of inexpensive network printers actually lacking postscript support. Further, printers are very slow at rasterizing, and so while support for PDF rasterization is very common you probably don&#39;t want to use it. You can easily see a minute per page for printing modest PDFs. In-printer PDF rasterization is also of very uneven quality, and I have seen issues like completely broken kerning in documents due to the printer&#39;s poor handling of embedded fonts.One of the key functions of something like CUPS is to address this problem: CUPS standardizes the format of all printed documents to something that is well-supported by the printer, and performs much of the rasterization ahead of time on the much faster print server. This saves time and improves reliability since you don&#39;t need to figure out if a given document is supported by the printer. For most printers these days some variant of PCL is the preferred language for jobs, as it&#39;s simpler and easier to implement than Postscript. It also presents fewer security concerns.Of course the other major problem CUPS solves is the management of the queue, including across multiple users. That&#39;s an important feature but not one that matters in a lot of home situations. That said, if you don&#39;t use a printing system you can and will run into annoying situations where you cannot print a document because you are waiting for the previous one to complete sending, which often gets blocked on the printer&#39;s memory space or rasterization."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hah. I had a similar moment of enlightenment with FreeBSD when somebody explained that you can just cat a wav file into /dev/audio (or /dev/dsp? forget the exact name). And that you can produce white noise by catting /dev/random to the same destination. With no barrier to the sound card like that, I was free to experiment with programming dfferent noise algorithms and figuring out how digital audio works. I eventually did things the proper way with OSS and finally sndio on OpenBSD, but direct, universal interfaces like files invite that initial exploration and help you get things done quick and easy.netcat is also a secret weapon around the house. My girlfriend runs macOS, but it&#39;s way more reliable to just nc files to each other over wifi than deal with all the cloud and airdropping bullshit."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"FWIW, the Internet Printing Protocol (and IPP Everywhere in particular) make printer setup in CUPS far, far easier, but distributors seem reluctant to encourage it.  I wrote about my experiences with IPP back in June (https://lwn.net/Articles/857502/).  I expect to never have to hassle with printer drivers again..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"(I don&#39;t use the product. Or maybe I should say, I&#39;m not a Facebook product)&gt;Facebook moved to penalize the researchers in part to remain in compliance with a 2019 data privacy agreement with the Federal Trade Commission, in which the company was punished for failing to police how data was collected by outside developers, Clark said. Facebook was fined a record $5 billion as part of a settlement with regulators.That&#39;s a reasonable explanation for their action, right? Even if it&#39;s not 100% true, if you&#39;re a manager at Facebook, and the situation isn&#39;t 100% clear cut, you&#39;re still going to act, so you can show it as an example the next time the FTC tries to fine them.And they did offer an alternative:&gt;Clark said Facebook offers targeting data sets for political ads, and has suggested the NYU group use that information."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Cambridge Analytica got their data by obtaining consent from users to install their app on the FB platform, claiming that it was for academic use. The difference here is that this group is using a browser extension, but in both cases the methodology is to collect data from Facebook’s API on behalf of the user.Facebook also goes after other browser extensions that scrape data, not just researchers: https://www.zdnet.com/article/facebook-sues-two-chrome-exten..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The debate on who has control over data typically creates two parties: the individual user who it is related to, and the corporation providing the platform or product.We ought to add another party: the public. Perhaps data should be able to be used for the public good, and we should be able to participate in deciding what data is collected and how data is used.In this case, having data about what ads are seen, by whom, and why they see those ads, seems like it could lead to us better understanding how FB and other companies algorithms are segmenting the population and how certain ideas proliferate within those segments. This seems beneficial to the public, since as we&#39;ve seen over the last 5 years or so, these platforms and the way they choose what information we see can have drastic effects on the economy, politics, etc. If I had a choice, I would choose to continue collecting data about the behavior of advertisers and the platforms that serve them for that kind of analysis. But we don&#39;t have a choice, because facebook &#34;owns&#34; that data.A number of people in this thread have referenced Cambridge Analytica. When Facebook does choose to share data with other parties, we have no say over what data is shared with them or what they may do with it. We don&#39;t even get a choice in how Facebook internally uses our data. Instead of democratizing the decision of what data is collected and how it is used, the FTC applied the rules of private property and fined FB for lack of privacy.The public got nothing out of that situation. Facebook now is more defensive of their ownership over our data, which also precludes us using it for the public good."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; And finally, something that would, in my opinion, really add to the realism and historical flavor of a medieval-themed city builder would be the introduction of mechanisms in which agricultural surpluses are skimmed by the church and the feudal lord. Tithes, taxes and rents! Instead of merely abstracting the taxes into an income modifier or letting the player be the extractor himself, we could be shown the tax collector visiting the village, counting the sheaves by the side of the road, selecting the calves and chickens. This way, the experiences of our medieval forebears are visualized and may help to educate the public about medieval village life.This is the part that&#39;s most interesting to me. I always feel tax policy &amp; land use is very rarely explored in games; in most of these games if you can set tax rates at all it always seems to be a straight tax on productivity so you just have to pick the amount of deadweight loss you&#39;re willing to accept to generate the revenue you need to run your government. There&#39;s also very rarely any distinction between government spending and private spending, and how government spending on public goods influences the asset values of private interests. You could make an entire game about just that subject.EDIT: As a follow-up, I found this history of land &amp; tax policy in Denmark going back to the middle ages to be quite fascinating and might be a useful point of contact for this sort of thing: https://bibliotek1.dk/english/history/centuries-of-experienc..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I would love a building game where you can&#39;t build roads. All of those building games so far allowed that, but I think it would be more fun to just allow for constructing building, and roads/pathway would form depending on their connectivity inside the production chain. I.e. you wouldn&#39;t connect your farm to a butcher, but pathways would form and eventually turn into street based on the amount people from dependent shops walking to it (also depending on terrain and usage of i.e. horse carriages)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hrm.  My opinion is that complete accuracy isn&#39;t all that fun.  Folks have used tax records to do analysis of, say, how many farmers it takes in a village for a blacksmith to be present, and so on and so forth.  It was a lot more than you might imagine.On the other hand, looking at the D&amp;D 3.5 Dungeon Masters Guide 2, they have finally fleshed out Saltmarsh.  Bizarrely, a town of less than four thousand people actually has an assassins&#39; guild, with roughly ten members.  Do they take turns, each assassinating one person a year?  Because that&#39;s roughly how infrequently it would have to occur for their little club to escape notice.  Hardly worth paying dues for, sitting around, discussing that murder you managed five years ago and how you look forward to one in another five.Take a look at city-building ... in most games you rarely see the hub-and-spoke develop around a port city, despite that being a prevalent pattern, or the unique feel of isoheight versus steep streets in a hilly region (the San Francisco pattern).  If you watch city maps over hundreds of years, many forces are at work, and I think they might be simulable but I don&#39;t know if the end result would be enjoyable enjoy to warrant it.If you look at our actual cave ecosystems, troglobionts, which are adapted for living strictly in caves, are typically quite tiny.  There&#39;s simply no food down there!  Resources are scarce.  Hence you would get no gelatinous cubes or hook horrors or carrion crawlers stumbling around the caves, lurking about, waiting for adventurers or the average bear.  Instead you get some very small, pale shrimp.  This is not exciting for the adventurer.  Some handwaving of a source of energy called &#34;Faerzress&#34; eventually takes place and is only vaguely acceptable if one does not look hard, serving as kind of a bottom trophic level for the game.The balance between actual plausibilty and what one might call &#34;fantastical satiation&#34; is quite difficult.  Your large-sized dragon, perhaps your standard-issue Vermithrax Pejorative, would need something like a log flume ride of virgins delivered straight to its gullet to sustain its bulk, not to mention the caloric expenditure.  Clearly, this isn&#39;t very satisfying for your story-telling, either.The balance is rough and I suspect that nitpicking in the name of accuracy can undermine most of what is constructed."</p>

Makes me sad that we can&#39;t have a calm discussion about the merits of the policy.From what I can tell, you might be opposed to this policy if:1. You have fears about getting a vaccine, moreso than for coronavirus. If this is you, do you prefer a mask mandate? And if so, how do you enforce this in a restaurant, where anyone eating takes off their mask right away?2. You have fears about the privacy implications. If so, what are those fears? Perhaps your vaccination status can lead people to make inferences about your health?3. You are not particularly concerned about the community spread of coronavirus (and the implications of that)There aren&#39;t a lot of choices. You can 1) avoid high-risk areas and escape infection/spreading disease, in which case, this policy doesn&#39;t really directly affect you. Or 2) you can take your chances with coronavirus, which you will get sooner or later, and spread it. Or 3) you can &#34;take your chances&#34; with the vaccine which, statistically and biologically, is safer than getting coronavirus and reduces spread.This policy allows people to choose from 1) and 3) but not 2), which is in all ways the worst decision.

Then you&#39;ll need more shots, the TDAP and meningococcal conjugate.These are all vaccine requirements. Is it an invasion or privacy to demand children&#39;s records? Is it the nanny state? We could go down that road, but who wants to live in a world where we lose herd immunity to all of those diseases because 30-40% of people choose to opt their children out?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To preface: I got the vaccine months ago (as soon as I had access), I&#39;m a big believer in vaccines.With that being said, this policy doesn&#39;t sit well with me. None of the currently available vaccines in the US are FDA approved. Of course, a lot of people have received those vaccines, but I also don&#39;t necessarily fault individuals for feeling hesitant (the nuance here is that I think people ought to get the vaccine).  mRNA is a new, unknown technology, and the vaccine was rushed faster to public access than any other vaccine before. We have absolutely no idea if there are any long term side effects of these vaccines.Both candidates Biden and Harris expressed the need for full trials and transparency in regard to the vaccine before they were in office, then changed their tune after (see: https://twitter.com/pbhushan1/status/1416969060890210305).  Biden says:&gt; When we finally do, God willing, get a vaccine, Who’s going to take the shot? Who’s going to take the shot? You going to be the first one to say, “Put me — sign me up, they now say it’s OK”?If the vaccine is as effective as it seems, then this decision feels positively nanny state to me. It takes away an individual&#39;s agency to inform themselves of the risks on both sides and make an informed decision."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In case anyone is interested, this is what it looks like on Internet Explorer 5 in Windows 9x: https://i.imgur.com/g668yBy.pngWhat&#39;s happening is that the &lt;h3&gt; tags are all nested, since they don&#39;t auto-close in this situation, and modern browsers define the &lt;h3&gt;&#39;s size as &#34;font-size: 1.17em;&#34; which of course adds up over time. I&#39;m not sure how IE5 interprets the page. Maybe I can get an older embedded version of Firebug to check.I think it&#39;s important to not break even older websites even if they have totally busted HTML, but this is probably such a rare case that no one ever thought of it, and at this point it&#39;d probably be much more disruptive to try and &#34;fix&#34; it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The font-tags are getting unfairly blamed!The increasing size is due to the unclosed &lt;h3&gt; tags combined with unclosed inline level tags. This is parsed into a nested structure, with h3&#39;s nested into h3&#39;s deeper and deeper. The font-size of h3 is defined as relative increase, so the nested h3-elements get increasingly larger size.The effect can be reproduced with this HTML snippet:     &lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;hello
     &lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;hello
     &lt;h3&gt;hello

Which is parsed as:     &lt;h3&gt;
       &lt;span&gt;hello
         &lt;h3&gt;
            &lt;span&gt;hello
               &lt;h3&gt;hello&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;/h3&gt;
       &lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;/h3&gt;

Usually a h3 would be automatically closed when a new h3 (or any block-level element) is encountered, but because of the unclosed inline element (span in the above example) it is instead parsed as a nested structure. In OP it is unclosed font-tags which cause the h3&#39;s to nest, but it has nothing to do with the semantics of &lt;font&gt; per se, it is just because they are unclosed.So why did it look correct in old IE? I think this comes down to the built-in browser style-sheet. I suspect h3 is defined with an absolute font size in the IE browser style sheet which means nesting does not increase the size."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m kinda just pulling this out of the swamp of 25-year-old web design knowledge, but the unclosed code on that page consists of &lt;font&gt; tags, which are long since deprecated, and those font tags have size=&#34;2&#34; / size=&#34;-2&#34; attributes. I&#39;m pretty sure the old behaviour was that &lt;font size=&#34;[signed int]&#34;&gt; affected the size relative to the parent in the same way that CSS &#34;font-size:200%;&#34; or &#34;font-size:50%;&#34; would do. So nesting them doesn&#39;t create any new block elements, but it modifies the font size within a &lt;td&gt; or &lt;p&gt; relative to the parent. Just at a look, that seems like the explanation for the increase in font size, in this admittedly odd document.[edit] I believe the page would look as intended if each &lt;font&gt; tag overrode the prior unclosed &lt;font&gt; tag, rather than treating it as a parent, and that was probably how IE 6 interpreted it. In fact I think old browsers would auto-close &lt;/font&gt; if you wrote a new &lt;font&gt;."</p>
