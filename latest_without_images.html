								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I see the TrustArc in use at quite a lot of sites - the fake delay, and the whole UX in general, is intensely irritating, and it just feels like the darkest of dark patterns. Really gives me a bad feeling about sites that use it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"IME this isn&#39;t unique to Starbucks, every single site that uses TrustArc does this.Thankfully, I haven&#39;t had to deal with any of these stupid pop-ups since installing the &#39;I don&#39;t care about cookies&#39; add-on. [1]Related question: Does anyone have experience using &#39;Stardust Cookie Cutter&#39;? [2] Is it better than &#39;I don&#39;t care about cookies&#39; or does it do the same thing?[1] https://www.i-dont-care-about-cookies.eu/[2] https://get.stardust.today/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I seem to recall a relation between loading time and visitor retention? A quick search gives dozens of statements along the lines of..A 1 second delay in page response can result in a 7% reduction in conversions. [1]47% of consumers expect a web page to load in 2 seconds or less. [2]40% of people abandon a website that takes more than 3 seconds to load. [3]...etcEither those cookies make up for the lost business, these statements only hold for the initial page load or these statements are factually incorrect. I suspect the statements only hold for the initial page load, that spinner and the slowly but surely updating fake counter holds visitors enthralled for the final outcome.Anyway, the path is clear: close that Starbucks tab after ~2 seconds of faked cookie setting time and get your caffeine kick elsewhere.[1,2,3] just search for it - most results are commercial entities trying to sell some &#34;marketing&#34; or &#34;website enhancement&#34; service which I do not feel like boosting by linking to them. Much of the original research seems to come from Google and can be found in a report titled  “The Need for Mobile Speed&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I guess we live on the shoulders of nastiness and things get better. So TEL was part of our boot sequence. What nastiness are we subjecting ourselves to today?BTW: The guy that invented TEL also invented CFCs! 
See Thomas Midgley Jr:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Midgley_Jr.This guy who invents awesome working chemicals that are tragically bad for people on a worldwide scale manages to exit life dues to his own inventions, unrelated to chemistry... Kind of Ironic! Thomas Midgley, Jr. (1889–1944) was an American engineer and chemist who contracted polio at age 51, leaving him severely disabled. He devised an elaborate system of ropes and pulleys to help others lift him from bed. He became accidentally entangled in the ropes and died of strangulation at the age of 55. However, he is better known for two of his other inventions: the tetraethyl lead (TEL) additive to gasoline, and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve got a sneaking suspicion we ought to go through everything else Thomas MIdgley Jr. invented and ban it, just to be sure.  Leaded gas, CFCs, and the contraption he killed himself with is a worrying pattern.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Midgley_Jr.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting, I had assumed they just didn’t know that lead was bad back then. What’s even weirder is how there are still people today who insist that banning leaded gasoline was an key example of government overreach.Someone once was arguing this point to me and I just had to drop the topic because it was such a baffling stance."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"PipeWire is how audio should be on Linux, and it&#39;s ready to use. No more complications between PulseAudio, ALSA, and JACK. PipeWire implements all 3 of these interfaces, which means you can use applications that depend on any or all of these interfaces simultaneously with no conflicts. Playing a video in Firefox and a track in a digital audio workstation at the same time works with no special configuration. PipeWire makes audio on Linux as easy as it is on other OSes.The Arch Wiki page describes some of the use cases for PipeWire: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PipeWire"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For the last ~12 years, I gave PulseAudio a try every time I upgraded the Fedora distro on my main computers. I almost never had the catastrophic bugs many people complained about. But pulseaudio has always taken 10-15% of one CPU when in use (be it on audio/video calls, or music/movie playback). This is across 3 different laptops and 2 desktops. It is not a huge deal, but it is a bit frustrating on laptops where battery life is precious. I understand that PulseAudio is very powerful, but it represented no practical gain for me personally, with my very simple use cases, so I simply disabled it.Weirdly, I found very few people complaining about PulseAudio&#39;s CPU usage. Maybe nobody cares about 10-15% of one core.However, I am happy to report that PipeWire seems to not have this problem at all. Since it became default on Fedora, it has barely shown on top&#39;s first page. Given that it is even more ambitious than PulseAudio in terms of latency, this is incredibly impressive!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wanted to try debian 11 last weekend. First time I installed it from debootstrap. I plugged in a 1TB SSD on an USB 2.0 to SATA case, formatted it, prepared the root filesystem with debootstrap, chrooted to it, installed a bunch of packages, setup locale and timezone, installed linux-image, grub and booted it. Worked flawlessly.Tried a &#34;ps|aux&#34; and discovered it is already running wayland and pipewire. Works so well it is boring. Nice!"</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28500014">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Good related reading: https://raphlinus.github.io/color/2021/01/18/oklab-critique...., with some analysis of various colour spaces of different types, focusing especially on their behaviour in gradients, to do with interpolation.My biggest complaint about perceptual colour spaces has been that they make working with colours near gamut boundaries really hard. For example, with #ff0 (yellow) in LCH, you can’t tweak any of the three parameters in either direction without going out of gamut (play with it at https://css.land/lch/ to get a vague idea of what I mean, though it doesn’t handle going out of gamut well). Yet such colours have plenty of practical value, and it’s a shame that many things eschew them because they’ve drunk too much perceptual uniformity kool-aid. Colour palettes often just don’t have any decent yellows at all. (To be sure, you do need to use such colours with care, but to remove them altogether is distressing.) For colour pickers especially, perceptual colour spaces have just been no good, because of their weird shapes and because you’re more likely to want to pick interesting colours nearer gamut bounds.So I’m really glad to see this, because it’s just what I’ve been grumbling about the absence of. Thank you Björn, I continue to enjoy your work!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the real story is subjective, not quantitative. Color pickers:https://bottosson.github.io/misc/colorpicker/OKHSL works a lot better than the alternatives. It&#39;s really nice!OKHSV doesn&#39;t seem as good, and neither do the other new ones."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My personal complaint with color pickers is that they make it hard to find many normal environmental colors. Where is brown? I&#39;ve learned to find it around red, a little toward orange, and a dark saturation. It&#39;s not intuitive, and I don&#39;t feel like I just pick _some_ brown because I can&#39;t easily explore the space of browns through beige and tan. Flesh tones are similarly difficult.I&#39;m not sure what the solution is. A purely algorithmic color picker probably isn&#39;t the answer because it&#39;s not just our color perception that matters, but also the way colors are formed in our environment (which is what gives us so many browns)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Related to this, there is an intimacy of small community which makes you feel valued and a proper contributor, that social networks really seem to oppose: they want to make the network bigger, you are part of the biggest world context, everybody on TikTok is eating a habanero while watching Bob Ross, so only if I do the same nonsense do I have a chance of 100 people noticing and liking  the video and maybe opting to see more of my content.When I put it that way it feels banal, but like, you know the “fast-growing subreddits” list on Reddit? There were meetings! Someone worked on that! People literally sat in a room and said effectively, “Hey Fatimeh, what is the status of the ‘make subreddits suck faster’ feature? Management is very interested in delivering that in Q3.” Right? Like this connection from global to personal is just automatically assumed, nobody spends a waking moment thinking it could be anything but that way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Somehow this post takes the least interesting part of the source article[0] and draws false conclusions from it.&gt; In the simulation, the decision whether to rebroadcast is random, rather than being driven by “virality” or cognitive bias, so the simulation is an optimistic one.
&gt; It turns out that message propagation follows a power law: the probability of a meme being shared a given number of times is roughly proportional to an inverse power of that number.So they implement a textbook model and a textbook result comes out - surprise? There’s nothing to be drawn by this.I may share the authors sentiment but frankly this blog post is bunk.There’re some interesting parts in the source though once you get through all the grand-standing fluff.[0]: https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/information-overl..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As soon as your news feed becomes too big for you to read all of it and then decide whether to repost anything, the quality of information you propagate is going to fall because of that filtering process.I avoid this by unfollowing people very frequently. I see one stupid candid or a pout or a food shot, I just unfollow that person.Same goes for SJW/White Supremacy types. Whether you are OP or a sharer, you get muted/unfollowed.This is how I use Quora. When I used Facebook five years ago, I used it this way.Twitter I use only for professional content. Very strictly. I also set the trending country to Namibia, so that I don&#39;t even know what they are talking about.I am less and less active on social media with the passing of days, but a good social media experience can be achieved by strictly filtering normies, politics, food porn, etc."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I had a brief love affair with Elixir/OTP recently. The language ist beautiful, the platform very impressive. Genserver and the actor model are very powerful tools for concurrent systems and Phoenix is one of the best web frameworks I ever tried.BUT the tooling was a bit lacking (e.g JetBrains IDE, good debugging workflow), the library support was a bit spotty (e.g for Auth, everything high quality but often abandoned). Then if you use e.g GCP there is no real first class language support and if you deploy to Kubernetes then there is a lot of overlap with Beam/OTP for deployment management etc. this and I feel for most quick web development pure functional programming is too much mental overhead for me (maybe this comes down to practice). I feel way more productive with e.g Go or Node.I have mad respect for Jose Valim and the community for delivering such an exceptional project in a world saturated with languages and frameworks. But I fear its not for me. At least not yet."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great resource, thank you. I&#39;ve been slowly transitioning my programming time to Elixir/Phoenix the last couple years. Every couple weeks I dive in, but mostly going back to Rails. But recently with the `1.6.0-rc.0` release, this time it might stick. HEEx templates are fantastic, esbuild as the default is a really good choice, LiveView is getting some traction, and the packages seem to be picking up. Fantastic language &amp; framework in general."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; “The biggest mistake was to miss Kubernetes. We were in that collective thought bubble where internally we thought Kubernetes was way too complicated and Swarm would be much more successful,” Jérôme Petazzoni, one of Docker’s first and longest serving employees, said. “It was our collective failure to not realize that.”They were not wrong on saying that Kubernetes was very complicated, at least in some sense. In the beginning no one wanted to use it because they could easily setup Docker Swarm with minimal effort. This argument still pops up frequently on HN when there&#39;s a new post about Kubernetes.I guess the problem was they didn&#39;t realize why Kubernetes needs to be that complicated. And if a system is complicated for good reasons, that&#39;s actually good business opportunity and tons of people and companies will be willing to make the effort to fill that gap."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good read, and touches on a lot of the pain points from that era. As someone who was lurking on HN at the time during the containerization boom, I think that the key failing of dotCloud/Docker was not capitalising on Docker Swarm almost immediately. Docker Swarm was touted almost from the start but the repeated delays gave it a reputation of smoke and mirrors left people scrambling for solutions.I also clearly remember the multiple high profile spats that &#39;shykes had on HN which burned a lot of bridges. At the time he had a reputation for answering lots of questions on HN which helped a lot with community building. After those bridges were burned there was no one to speak for Docker as the developer mindsets shifted slowly towards Kubernetes. IIRC the Github PRs were also a source of contention as dotCloud corporatised.To be fair, Kubernetes was a real slog to understand at the start and had a lot of competition; it was definitely not the same level of simple, direct technical solution that Docker was.Interesting trip down memory lane and what a pivotal technology! Regardless of the rest Docker is a true cultural phenomenon and a testament to the insight of the creators working outside of the myopia of big tech."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The truth is, Docker had the chance to work closely with the Kubernetes team at Google in 2014 and potentially own the entire container ecosystem in the process. “We could have had Kubernetes be a first-class Docker project under the Docker banner on GitHub. In hindsight that was a major blunder given Swarm was so late to market,” Stinemates said.&gt; Craig McLuckie, Kubernetes cofounder and now vice president at VMware, says he offered to donate Kubernetes to Docker, but the two sides couldn’t come to an agreement. “There was a mutual element of hubris there, from them that we didn’t understand developer experience, but the reciprocal feeling was these young upstarts really don’t understand distributed systems management,” he told InfoWorld.The article criticizes Docker Swarm as myopic, but IMO, there were only two possibilities for Docker to move forward; either they acquired Kubernetes, which was a possibility in this telling of events, or they won with their own Docker Swarm."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This was really when people started figuring out how bad fallout from thermonuclear bombs could be. General Fields described it most lucidly:&#34;If Bravo had been detonated in Washington, D.C., instead of Bikini, Fields illustrated with a diagram, that lifetime dose in the Washington-Baltimore area would have been 5,000 roentgens; in Philadelphia, more than 1,000 roentgens; in New York City, more than 500, or enough to result in death for half the population if fully exposed to all the radiation delivered. This diagram was classified secret and received very little distribution beyond the Commissioners.&#34; [1]Image reproduced here [2].Thermonuclear bombs are really terrifying. If one goes off and you&#39;re in the fallout zone do not go outside for at least 2 weeks. If you survive the initial blast you have about 10 minutes to get inside where you must stay. If you&#39;re still outside and it&#39;s &#39;snowing&#39; ash you&#39;re already dead.
