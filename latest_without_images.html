								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hey congrats on making it 10 months!&#34;Urgent to not block progress, but also ironic that they are asking a person who has no clue what they are doing to deliver critical work&#34;Friend of mine started a role there (this was 4-5 years ago) and was fired (sorry... more or less asked to leave, being told he could keep his signing bonus if he just left) within about six weeks because he wasn&#39;t immediately delivering on some insane amounts of work. Truly, he recapped it for me, the expectations were absolutely incredible and I&#39;d consider him a hard worker who has found a ton of success in his current role.I bag on Amazon a lot on here (which if I were to review with my therapist is likely because I had an absolutely HORRENDOUS experience in an interview loop with them my first step out of college that still makes me nervous in interviews, even 15 years later). But living in Seattle, a notable chunk of my social circle works there. I&#39;d say a few enjoy the scale of things they get to work on or perhaps the brand name, but overall none of them ever talk about liking the work environment/balance/culture.One friend, at a director level, just quit on a whim because he came back from parental leave and his direct reports had all been put on a PIP while he was out. He told his VP to fuck off, left, and is now on sabbatical. I&#39;ve never seen him so happy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Please consider increasing the contrast on your text. As is (light-gray-on-lighter-gray) I cannot read it as it literally hurts my eyes trying to focus on it.EDIT: It seems this is not intentional, some of the stylesheets are returning 404 for me but not other people... weird.EDIT: Amazingly, it turns out this site is hosted on the platform of which I&#39;m the lead engineer (Cloudflare Workers / Pages) and the problem is in fact our own fault, not Ben&#39;s. Wow. We&#39;ll... get on that. Sorry.FINAL EDIT (hopefully): Not necessarily a bug so much as classic cache skew... explanation here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29814868"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I see a lot of these comments have taken to a kind of Amazon-bashing and venting their own experiences, where the author actually... didn&#39;t?I thought the author was incredibly fair/objective, and at least the way I read it, it wasn&#39;t so much that he had such a miserable experience or could only stomach 10 months of pain/abuse (in fact if you actually read to the end, he praises his manager, his teammates, etc.), and more so that it only took him 10 months to realize that the company culture and way-of-working was not aligned with his personal preferences. He does have legitimate complaints about parts of his experience, and makes some keen observations about the consequences and tradeoffs of Amazon choosing to adopt the culture that it does (though I also think he&#39;s wrong about a few things too), but overall it&#39;s less of a &#34;Amazon == bad&#34; piece and more of a &#34;this is why it wasn&#39;t to my taste&#34; reflection.Frankly, I would congratulate the author, and think of this as a success-story. Paraphrasing his own words, he learned a lot, met some good people, found some good practices that he&#39;s going to carry forward with him... isn&#39;t that a successful outcome (minus the annoyance of another round of job hunting, but hey in this market, another job hop is probably just an opportunity to level up comp, rather than an existential threat that you might be unemployed and starve)? Obviously the team/org he was in is suffering major attribution problems, and that&#39;s obviously a bad thing, but that&#39;s not his problem either.Note: in case it wasn&#39;t clear, I do work within Amazon, but these opinions are my own, not representing my employer, blah blah"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a very odd design document and it makes me think this author has thought a lot about materials and buildings but not actually built anything.The steel moment frame, to someone with shallow knowledge, sounds so strong and resilient.  But in fact, a rigid steel structure is more vulnerable to seismic (and even wind) loads than wooden framing which can flex and move and dampen those loads naturally.The stainless spec for the frame is just pure silliness.  Looking at my notes now, for steel beams buried in the ground:  200 microns of rust per year in very aggressive soils, but it rusts on both sides, so make that 400 microns.

... which means that it takes ~25 years to rust through naked 3/8 steel buried in the most aggressive soils.... which also means that unburied steel, protected from elements, up in the air, is going to last more than 1000 years.Oh, and also, the SS is more brittle so you&#39;ve made your seismic issues even worse....If I had an unlimited budget and was aiming for &gt;1000 years I would pour the piles to bedrock with stainless rebar inside fly-ash concrete and top those pilings with plate connectors into which you could socket large wooden columns (perhaps 8x8) and build the structure with large wooden members connected with steel connectors and column caps, etc.I would only use steel members if the span called for wood that was too big (like a 24&#39; span needing a 8x14 or whatever)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I expected something much simpler : bricks, stones, and wood. It&#39;s not like we are running low on examples of 1000+ years buildings (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/11th_century_in_architecture). These castles, cathedrals, farms, were built to last, so it&#39;s appropriate to use them as examples.We can, however, apply modern technics and materials when they make sense : insulation, windows, waterways... Prefer wood, wool and steel over plastics or composite materials and you&#39;re good to go.On a side note, I&#39;m currently buying a house (old farm) with over 200 years old plain oak carpentry. The thing is absolutely massive and would be unimaginably expensive to build today. With the proper care, it might last another 200 years without issue. Remember, Notre-Dame de Paris used 300 years old trees cut in ~1150 for its roof -before the 2019 fire-. With the proper care it would have still be standing today. I find that to be deeply humbling."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If I were to design a house with the idea that it should serve future generations, I&#39;d design it to be reconfigured, recycled, or torn down easily.After reading some of Stewart Brand&#39;s writing, I&#39;ve learned to love ugly buildings."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Has anyone been able to use darling for iOS CI jobs yet? Admittedly I haven&#39;t researched this in a while, but one of the biggest hurdles in large scale iOS development is sane DevOps infrastructure. I know due to Apple&#39;s TOS that you will never be able to build, sign, and distribute your app on non-Apple hardware. But i&#39;d love to use darling to run unit tests/CI jobs on commodity cloud infrastructure.Even if you do get dedicated mac instances, managing them is a bit of a nightmare since MacOS isn&#39;t designed to be headless."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just thought it may be worth mentioning if there are devs from the project here, but Darling is one of the efforts that I would sponsor/donate to (just small amounts for now as I haven&#39;t made my millions yet ;-) if there were a more defined road map with milestones/goals.This is an amazing and important goal!  Thank you so much for dedicating your time and efforts to this!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am absolutely flummoxed by this review. Mine is configured with nearly identical specs (except that I have 64GB RAM) and is one of the worst purchases I&#39;ve ever made.Enabling deep sleep works fine; waking from it is impossible. WiFi stops working. The touch pad becomes hypersensitive. I&#39;ve resorted to turning the whole thing completely off after every use. But the battery still loses power even when the machine is completely powered down.The machine also freezes if I try to open a jpg or a PDF from the file explorer. Just completely freezes. Fan spins up like crazy, but as I mentioned, I have 64GB of RAM in this thing. It should be able to open a single one-page scanned document from my own scanner. If there&#39;s anything wrong with the file, this is the computer that&#39;s making the file poorly.The internet connection also just turns off after about half an hour of use. I have a Belkin dock with Ethernet plugged into it, which is then plugged into my Framework&#39;s USB-C port. This dock supports my work Mac all work day every day with no issues at all, so it&#39;s not the dock&#39;s problem. But the Framework? Internet just stops working after half an hour. And it manages to kill both wired and WiFi when it dies. I can turn them back on, but this is a ridiculous problem to have.This last point is pretty minor, but the hinges are floppy. The whole screen shakes around when I type on it.I have no idea how this author&#39;s experience is so much better than mine unless they just haven&#39;t used it much yet, but I regret absolutely everything about the purchase of this machine and feel like I was sold a bill of goods by all the glowing positive reviews all over the internet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author does not address the screen resolution (and just says the screen is nice) but I&#39;m hearing that the screen res is a bit to high to work with without scaling and a tad to low to do 2x scaling. And people don&#39;t like fractional scaling, at least in Gnome (it seems to look weird). Is this still an issue?I tend to prefer 1080p for this reason on 12-14&#34; screens. My Thinkpad X13 gen 2 has a 13.3&#34;, 1920x1200 screen, windows sets it to 150%, which seems ok, although Ubuntu works well for me without scaling still. The Frame work laptop has an even higher res (2256x1504). I do hear people scaling the fonts and that seems to be a nice solution... I remember from back in the old days that I never really liked the look of this.What do people think of this? I&#39;m hoping that in the future you can choose the screen (and easily get replacements as well, I hear they are working on that).Edit: I hope these issues are being addressed by established DE&#39;s, I&#39;m assuming they won&#39;t be an issue on Canonical&#39;s (hypothetical ;)) Flutter based DE that&#39;s (obviously ;)) coming and on System76&#39;s Rust based new DE for Pop OS [0].[0]: https://www.theregister.com/2021/11/08/system76_developing_n..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been at it intensively for a couple months and my mind simply refuses to cooperate. If anything, after having done 400+ problems I seem to be worse at them than when I started.Yup -- brain fog, paralysis and negative performance are the sure-fire signs of burnout (as least as pertains to your capacity for grinding LC).  Excellent preparation for the daily grind of actually working for companies that rely on these tests.Leetcode isn&#39;t about fun and challenging things, it&#39;s about thinking in one particular way, spitting out solutions using the same exact data structures and jumping through hoops on command without philosophizing or creating anything that can be reused/extended.Exactly.  And these are apparently precisely the &#34;skills&#34; these companies are &#34;desperately&#34; seeking to find among the engineers they invite for an on-site interview.And don&#39;t forget the strong &#34;culture fit&#34; signal indicated by the sheer willingness to grind, grind, grind.You memorize, regurgitate and participate in the agile masquerade. Creativity is shunned. Tried architectures/patterns are what is expected.That&#39;s ticket.  This is exactly the mindset these companies are after.  That&#39;s why they swear up and down on the efficacy of these tests.On the bright side: at least you&#39;ve been freed of any illusions, by this point, about the intrinsic value of your advanced hard science degree."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a 20+ year Senior Software Architect, Team Lead, Senior Developer and a PM (all at the same time at the moment!).  I&#39;ve done everything from C++ to 20 years of .Net to now TypeScript and Angular 13 with .Net Core REST APIs against an Oracle SQL database.I am self-taught and I can&#39;t do these leetcode problems if my life depended on it.I still deliver high quality software on time, and on budget, and have a solid grasp on my career.I wouldn&#39;t worry about this too much.  It depends on what you are going for.Sure, if you want to pass a FAANG interview where you are going to get these types of questions, go for it.  To solve day to day business problems, you rarely need this stuff.  You just need to learn how to write quality, performant, correct code that results in solutions.The best way to do this is develop experience in the industry over the years.My 2 cents."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t see this mentioned by other commenters so let me provide another perspective. Namely, I think OP is doing it wrong.OP claims to have done 400+ LC problems over a couple of months. Let me say it out loud here: this is simply crazy. It strikes me as an attempt to not learn how to tackle these challenges, but to actually brute-force through them. To anyone preparing for an interview: don&#39;t do this! Grab a book like Elements of Programming Interviews (EPI), maybe follow some online courses on programming puzzle patterns, and then start grinding LC. Maybe interleave grinding with learning? Your end goal should be to develop deep understanding of what you are doing, not memorise the solutions.Also, while going through LeetCode, it is very important to realise that the problem classification there is a bit wild at times. Don&#39;t stress that you cannot solve a medium sometimes as they are mislabeled. I did mediums that could be hards, hards that could be mediums, and hards that were just impossibly hard. Typically a very hard problem is not something you should expect in an interview setting as most interviers* don&#39;t expect you to implement KMP on the spot. Doesn&#39;t hurt to know it and impress the interviewer with knowledge, but if you think memorising KMP is the way, you&#39;re mistaken.* - there is still luck involved and you can have a crazy interviewer. It can happen, so just accept it and move on. Don&#39;t treat it as a personal defeat.Source: I grinded and I had offers from most of FAANG letters."</p>

Having a user login for patreon is something that would be missing and require some more thought I admit.I think quite a lot of other people have mentioned in the thread that they are getting a lot of other &#34;benefits&#34; from using multiple services, but I don&#39;t see how these help solve the problem of data delivery besides taking advantage of the  Cloudflare + Backblaze alliance which is $31 if their main website is a static one."</p>
