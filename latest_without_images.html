								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"At one point (a very long time ago now) it was declared that Dogwood was the future and as a result Go would be the language of choice at Heroku and Erlang would be no more.Trouble is that Erlang ran all the important Cedar code (it might still today) and the Erlang engineers didn&#39;t particularly like the news that Erlang code was essentially deprecated so they left and nobody knew how to maintain the stack. This definitely wasn&#39;t the only problem we had but it was a big one.What do fellow Herokai think? Was Dogwood a fool&#39;s errand? Or did we just not get enough staff to build it properly?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The only thing I don&#39;t like is their usage-based pricing. On Heroku I could pay $7 a month and know I&#39;d never be charged more than that. I&#39;m sure when you&#39;re scaling a service it&#39;s fine - maybe even better - to do it on a sliding scale. But for a fire-and-forget blog site, I don&#39;t want to have to worry about stuff like that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I could relate to the comment on Redis.  The only things I can see missing are automated Redis hosting by the platform.

There have been so many times I wanted some simple key value store which I do not have to bother about setting up and taking care of. Something like &#34;ambient Redis&#34;. It&#39;s OK not to have crazy scaling promises. You just enable an API (maybe for a small fee) and just use it.If and when you get big enough you switch to a setup you bother about setting up and taking care of.Am I making sense to anyone?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Litestream author here. The motivation for this docs page was two-fold. First, laying out the different options with their trade-offs helps people understand what Litestream is trying to be so it helps keep my focus narrow. For example, if someone is looking for very high durability guarantees then they can see that rqlite might be a better fit and they don&#39;t try to fit Litestream into that mold.Second, Litestream doesn&#39;t interfere with other backup methods so you can run it alongside a cron-based backup. I typically run both because I&#39;m overly paranoid and because it&#39;s cheap."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A service that says &#39;here is an alternative to our service&#39;? Right on their own website? Even though cron backups are basically &#39;competition&#39; to litestream?That&#39;s it. I&#39;m giving fly.io a try next hobby app I start.I&#39;m so impressed with their business decisions right now, I was afraid for litestream but then I read how the creator is just hired to work on it full time. What a splendid development!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Following the announcement of Fly.io acquiring the Litestream project and hiring its creator Ben Johnson I&#39;ve been looking into it (and am very impressed by what I see!)Reading through the docs I was delighted to find this full set of instructions including script commands for setting up a simpler regular snapshot backup using cron - for situations where Litestream is (quote) &#34;overkill&#34; - ie where the database is smaller and your durability requirements are lower.In fact, the docs have a whole alternatives section for different requirements. I think this kind of thing is great, and something more projects should do! Wanted to share it because of this meta thing, but also because it&#39;s just pretty useful per se."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I managed a Bitcoin mining operation a long time ago. We made machines that made 50% of their BTC in the first month of their operation, and the remaining 50% over the next 5 months. After that they cost more to run than they produced.The accountants wouldn&#39;t believe us when we told them that the machines were worthless after only 6 months."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some of the top-rated comments make me wonder whether the authors have even read the article. This isn&#39;t about whether PoW or cryptocurrencies as a whole make sense, but strictly about the economics of mining, and how standard accounting practices might obfuscate miners&#39; true profitability. The author sounds like an investor who would be equally happy to hold long instead of short positions in those stocks if their prices were different."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Disclosure: I hold short positions in companies mentioned in this article. This is not financial advice.Hmm. Well, on the one hand, he is putting his money where his mouth is. On the other hand, this could be prime evidence of motivated reasoning. The author has also submitted his own article to HN it seems. Reading the analysis, it makes sense, but I&#39;m not experienced in analysing company financials. Other people I respect/trust who have a good track record don&#39;t feel this way about the companies in question.I think, in general, shorting volatile assets is a pretty fraught undertaking. There could be a Gamestop style short squeeze fueled by Crypto bros for example. There could be a purchase announcement that could spike the price. ARK could decide to buy a large stake. All these things could lose you a lot of money for &#39;no good reason&#39;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I weigh 350 pounds. I&#39;m very obese. I know this.When I was a teenager, I looked at people who weighed 300+ pounds and though, how do you get that way. Don&#39;t you realize that you are gaining weight? Don&#39;t you know that you just have to eat less to lose weight?Anyway, now I realize that I am hungry. It never goes away unless I eat a significant amount of food. My body told me to eat, so I ate.It doesn&#39;t even take that much extra food to gain a lot of weight. One extra piece of cake a week is a few pounds in a year. If you live a few years, it adds up. You gain weight in kilograms and lose weight in grams.Hunger is a sensation that happens inside a person&#39;s body and mind. You cannot compare your hunger to my hunger.So many diets talk about not being hungry while you are on the diet. I&#39;ve been to dieticians and told them I&#39;m hungry, and they suggest eating more protein or more fiber. That does help, but I still feel hungry.There is a very good chance that someone is writing a reply with some suggestion as to how I should eat so that I&#39;m not hungry. Thank you for the thoughts, but realize that you don&#39;t live in my body, you don&#39;t know how I feel, you don&#39;t know what I&#39;ve tried.Hunger sounds like a problem to people. Hunger feels like a problem inside the body. People still tell me I shouldn&#39;t be hungry. Maybe part of the solution is realizing that eating to satisfaction is ... bad for some people. Maybe it&#39;s Ok to be a little hungry.Anyway, these are just some thoughts. I&#39;m down 30 pounds from my max. I think I have a good mentality now, but it took years to get here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While correct and useful advice for some people, this advice is useless for many (I suspect most) overweight and obese people.I&#39;m on the border of overweight/obese. I can lose weight if I focus on losing weight. I&#39;ve dropped from 100kg to 74kg and back. I&#39;ve gone back down to 91kg and back. How? Eating less, of course. By counting calories. But here is the problem. Anything below 95kg and my body and mind is hyper annoying, constantly interrupting my thoughts (amygdala?) insisting that I go eat something. It is impossible to program computers when my brain keeps interrupting me. I simply cannot focus on anything other than eating. It&#39;s like a very slow motion breath hold... eventually you will come up for air. I find life so miserable at those weights that I eventually learned to accept my fate and I&#39;ll die early I&#39;m sure, but at least life will feel tolerable until then.Why do some people&#39;s bodies/minds insist so insistently that they eat more when they clearly are already overweight? That&#39;s the question I would love to have answered. People often postulate the answer lies in the kinds of foods you eat, but I&#39;ve proven that hypothesis wrong (for myself) many times. Avoiding sugars and fried foods and eating oatmeal, fish soup, salads, fruit and veg with lean proteins...  does not make any weight difference for me, nor does it make low body weights any more tolerable. Sounds great, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s healthy, but I&#39;ve proven on myself multiple times that this technique does not work. Only counting calories works for weight loss (actually distance running works for me too), and it always leaves me famished and miserable.Going on a zero-carb diet might work. I&#39;ve seen success stories. I haven&#39;t seriously tried it. When I&#39;ve tried in the past I was craving bread so massively that I caved in."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Someone finally wrote this article. So refreshing. It&#39;s obvious when you live with a fat person why they have trouble losing weight, even when they&#39;re on a diet: they&#39;re usually not actually following it. Whether they don&#39;t understand portion sizes for calorie math, or look at calories at all, or eat things that they say &#34;do not count&#34;, there is almost always a failure to understand what and how much they are eating."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A perfect example of how &#34;democracy dies in darkness&#34;. They will keep pushing anti-consumer laws through the backdoor of &#34;free trade&#34; agreements, until we stop it by requiring that:Before any international agreement may be ratified, [our country] must pass all the laws needed to comply with that agreement ahead of time, through regular democratic processes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Free&#34; trade agreements. &#34;Free trade agreement&#34; is a propaganda term anyway, but applying it to agreements that impose intellectual property monopolies is bizarre.https://cepr.net/trade-agreements-that-increase-protectionis...https://cepr.net/trade-deals-are-about-increasing-protection...&gt; It is also important to point out that the liberalization of trade in goods is largely a done deal. Tariffs are already zero or near zero in the vast majority of cases. The potential gains from further liberalization are limited, especially since goods are a rapidly falling share of total output.&gt; Instead, deals like the TPP are largely about locking in rules on items like intellectual property protections and preserving Mark Zuckerberg’s dominance of the Internet. The TPP, like other recent trade deals, calls for longer and stronger patent and copyright monopolies.&gt; These protections are 180 degrees at odds with free trade. They are about shifting more income from the bulk of the population to people who benefit from rents on patents and copyrights, by making them pay more for drugs, medical equipment, software and a wide variety of other items."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was prescribed benzos because of sleeping issues, but I was also taking phenibut at the same time.  After about 3 weeks of using large doses of the benzos every night, I stopped taking them, but a year later I still feel pangs of withdrawal sometimes when I get stressed.  It took me another 4 months to get off the phenibut and a month or so after that before my sleep returned to normal.  There were months where I maybe got an hour or two of sleep a night.  If I got stressed, I simply wouldn&#39;t sleep at all.  I once went three days without sleep.  The torment of that combined with the withdrawal from the drugs showed me what hell was like.  I tell everyone to never take benzos for any reasons.  I don&#39;t care how safe the doctors say they are; they aren&#39;t.  Period.  There are repercussions - as this study shows - and they will not help the underlying cause of your issues.  Treat the cause, not the symptoms."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Caution:  While this is a cool study in Nature Neuroscience, almost all facets of this work are based on a single fully inbred strain of mouse—-C57BL/6J. This strain also happens to have a major mutation in the  GABRA2 gene that reduces expression about 2X relative to almost all other strains of mice.  GABRA2 is one of the most important receptors involved in inhibitory responses in CNS and benzodiazepine responses.This same strain also has a well known splice variant mutation in a key mitochondrial gene, NNT, that modulates both mitochondrial and macrophage function. The microglial mentioned in this paper are a special class of macrophages that reside in the CNS.Given these comments, when the authors refer to “wild type” (WT) mice, remember these are anything but true wild type mice. Fully inbred strains always carry numerous homozygous recessive and dominant mutations (several hundred each) that often affect CNS, immune systems, and mitochondrial functions.The results may well hold up in other strains, but I would not count on it. Do benzodiazepines affect all humans uniformly?Would studies of other strains or types have been practical? Yes. The Thy1-GFP and Thy1-YFP lines can be crossed to make F1 hybrids. This particular transgene is also available on at least one other strain of mouse (DBA/2J).Unfortunately, most reviewers at Nature Neuroscience are not geneticists ;-) They are typically strong molecular neurobiologists who are used to reductionist methods. They are perfectly content with submission to Nature journals that are based entirely on with N=1 mouse genome—almost always the mutant C57BL/6J inbred strain.In my own work I try to avoid this N=1 trap. (But I have also failed ;-)Generality and robustness of results (see quote below) should ideally be established across two or more diverse genomes before making broad claims of relevance to other species, including od course to humans.The quote:“We have demonstrated that microglia in WT mice alter their morphology and functions upon diazepam treatment and cease to do so in Tspo−/− mice.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The world of medecine is degenerate. Sustainable, non addictive and non neurotoxic anxiolytics exists:
the #1 being opipramol the sigmaergic.
emoxypine (which btw cure hangover) and guanfacine are worth mentioning.
Maybe beta blockers to some extent. NMDA antagonists such as memantine have side effects but are not neurotoxic to my knowledge and there are milder ones such as mg-lthreonate.
afobazole is interesting but its pharmacology is too weird to be sure. Etifoxine is revolutionnary, it double axon length growth rate so ironically a great cure to benzo neurodamage. its acts on the mitochondria benzodiazepine receptor. It&#39;s unclear to me wether it is subject to a tolerance effect and if so if it is lower. Also etifoxine can interact badly with other drugs on the liver.
Note that there exists ultra-atypical mechanisms, such as inositol megadose or tofisopam but they are not firstline.So yeah, basically opipramol and guanfacine should be what humans take as first line. Glycine is a nice obvious augmentation (kinda absurd that people forget about the second inhibitor neurotransmitter in the brain, especially since the effect feel nice and doesn&#39;t really lead to tolerance).
if you have benzo neurodamage, take magnesium lthreonate which is a very potent synaptotrophic.also fun fact: the benzo cartel was so strong it was the most prescribed drug in the world, all classes, in the 70s"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s no doubt that, for a lot of people, there is just a better convenience/quality trade-off. I had a good size Onkyo system for watching movies and I configured it meticulously. But it&#39;s hard to explain to others why there is so much ceremony and bulk, especially when watching habits degenerate from immersive movies to binge watching netflix serieses.Part of the experience with hobbies is some kind of sacrifice along with the reward. The drive towards convenience takes away that sacrifice and makes me appreciate something a little less.It&#39;s like takeout and boxed wine, wearing a T-shirt; versus dressing up a bit, making a nice meal, and opening a bottle from a winery you visited. The former is ovjectively good and convenient, and all of the latter ceremony is a hassle that provides little benefit (you probably can&#39;t tell the boxed wine apart in a blind test).But... aren&#39;t we happier with the latter experience?I&#39;m too lazy to &#34;waste&#34; time on that kind of happiness though. That&#39;s the sad part.I think if I&#39;m motivated by others it&#39;s different. For instance, stuff like surfing/snowsports requires a significant hassle, and it&#39;s a lot easier to find people who will put up with that hassle."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel that the AV-receiver market has gone the way of the DSLR market. Compact speaker systems like Sonos (that don&#39;t need a separate AVR) simply got good enough. Thus the need for buying a separate AVR to drive your Dolby / DTS / etc. setup has all but vanished except maybe for the most determined audiophiles (and even most of these would do well to simply get a compact wireless speaker setup instead of some monstrosity that they can hardly ever enjoy...because too small of a listening room, and neighbours).I&#39;m not saying market for Onkyo, Denon, Sony, Yamaha, etc. AVRs is a goner, but I am suggesting it may have peaked and that going forward there will be less and less demand for AVRs, especially in the low/mid range of things."</p>
