								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The whole notion of online proctoring seems pretty whack to me also: what world are we training and testing people to live in?  The real world has internet, you can search for stuff, you can work from home and take a break.I&#39;m not good at things because I&#39;m always able to magically materialize the right answer out of my mind inside an anechoic faraday chamber, I&#39;m good because I get the right answer in a reasonable amount of time using all the tools available to me (the internet, my brain, books, whatever).I get that there are a few professions where you&#39;re really going to need to know the right answer quickly without looking it up under high-pressure situations, and it seems like testing and certifying doctors and lawyers is important enough to society that we can arrange to proctor those tests in person (and still maintain covid safety, disability/poverty access, etc).  That level of extreme proctoring security seems pretty dumb for random exams WHERE school &lt;= undergrad.If you elaborately cheat your way through all online classes all the way through undergrad, that seems mostly bad for you"</p>

https://library.auraria.edu/news/2021/why-online-test-procto...I opted out of using spyware in the university physics courses I taught last year, and caught my cheating students the old fashioned way. Proctor-spyware, like airport security, is more about theater than effectiveness. You aren&#39;t giving the USMLE or a Bar Exam, so you can take the time to write a good exam and evaluate it correctly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They also are terrible at how they treat your local machine. I had to use them for a course I was in. I was having issues connecting because they kept insisting I used some Flash based tool. Their proctor started going into various settings on my Mac, clicking rather carelessly and what seemed like at random then declared the platform was unsupported. I immediately said &#34;ok, so now your going to return my machine back to the state that it was in before you started messing around...&#34; They immediately dodged the question and ended the chat. It took 3 more attempts to even get the test started and like a week to find all the damage they did to my settings. Terrible company."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve always loved playing video games. From the moment I realized there were places called arcades with wonderful machines that ate your coins, I was hooked. Game and Watch? Nagged my mom for every single one. Nintendo Famicom? We had ALL the bootleg cartridges. Gameboy? Couldn&#39;t afford it so I burned with envy. Original Xbox? I have 4 of &#39;em stashed away somewhere. Playstation 1-5? Heck, yeah. Mobile? My husband bought our first iPad because we saw someone playing Angry Birds on it. PC? I&#39;m playing The Ascent with my whole family right now.More than playing video games, though, what I wanted to do as a kid was to MAKE games. I still remember punching in a borrowed Mario Bros cartridge for the first time, pressing START and having a freaking epiphany. How cool was it that someone MADE this?? To heck with being an astronaut, when I grew up, I was going to do THIS. I knew it with all the certainty of 8-year-old me. But you know how it goes: like most childhood dreams, I put this one on a shelf and gradually left it behind. I didn&#39;t become an astronaut either (in case you were wondering).What I did was drop out of university in my third year. And since then, I&#39;ve been a copywriter, graphic designer, business owner, immigrant, stay-at-home spouse, and for a long time, the stay-at-home parent. And it&#39;s been great.  Life with all its up-up-down-down-left-right-left-right-B-A&#39;s...it&#39;s all been wonderful.&#34;Hold up,&#34; you might say, if you&#39;re still reading this. &#34;Why are you telling us all this? Boring.&#34;Right. Let me get to it. I&#39;m 48 and if there&#39;s a lesson that has been inescapable these past two years is that we may not see tomorrow. So, I&#39;ve decided to focus on happiness in the here and now. Carpet diem, as my kid used to say when he was little. And you know one thing that has added to my happiness? Dusting off my dream, sitting my ass down and finally learning how to be a game developer. And happier still? I&#39;ve done this with my husband.So we&#39;ve published our first mobile game. It&#39;s called &#34;Slingshot Effect&#34; and it&#39;s available on App Store or on Google Play. It&#39;s an infinite jumper that&#39;s easy to just pick up and play. Perfect for commutes or if you&#39;re stuck in a waiting room somewhere. It&#39;s a paid app because we feel strongly that the level of monetization in the casual game space is just...ugh...it&#39;s bad.  Thanks for listening, I really appreciate it.TLDR:
When I was a kid, I wanted to make video games. And now that I&#39;m kind of old, my husband and I made one.App Store:

								<p class="story__comment_others">"@bananabat, congrats on launching your game and on your beautiful write up here. It made me remember Randy Pausch‘a famous “Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams”, better known as “The Last Lecture.” (https://youtu.be/ji5_MqicxSo). Like many others, I remember being deeply touched by it. It is ultimately being about a man reflecting on a life well lived and achieving some childhood dreams like this is part of it.It is wonderful that you have been able to do something you find worthy in and of its self and find fulfillment here. Thank you for sharing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Congrats! It&#39;s absolutely refreshing to dust off an old hobby and do something with it!I&#39;m only 28, but during the pandemic I decided to dust off my old electronics hobbies that fell by the wayside when the mobile app boom started.Middle school and early high school me thought I was going into robotics, but the iPhone came out the year I started high school. When the App Store came out the following year, the smartphone revolution started, and about a year later I went all in on mobile apps and gaming for the rest of high school and my college years. Contract iOS and Unity3D work got me through college.It&#39;s somewhat ironic, because I haven&#39;t written or worked on a single mobile app since I left college (nor have I owned an Apple device). I ended up taking all of the knowledge of embedded Linux systems I gained doing robotics and started doing esoteric high performance storage virtualization systems as the starting point of my career. Never saw that one coming.I hadn&#39;t really done any serious hobby electronics in nearly a decade, but I&#39;ve continued to lug all of the equipment around every time I move. So, I dusted off some old hardware and got hooked once again, only to find out that the AVR is old news and everyone is into ESP32 and ARM these days :)"</p>

I wish they had mentioned the actual effect on CPU.Compare to the recent thread &#34;The LZ4 introduced in PostgreSQL 14 provides faster compression&#34; [0] where the loudest voices were saying that zstd would not work due to increased CPU.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"As happy as I am that nuclear is back, I really don&#39;t trust Macron on this. For the record, here is what he did in his current term regarding nuclear:- shut down the Fessenheim plant, one of the most reliable one. Yes it was the oldest, but not by far, and reports from the nuclear authority are pretty clear that this plant was in a much better shape than others built just a few years afterwards (Bugey, one year later which is now older than Fessenheim was when shut down, and Blayais started 4 years later).- promised to reduce the share of nuclear in the electricty mix to 50% by 2025.- shut down Astrid, the French research project for 4th generation nuclear (which is the only long term viable path for nuclear, since there will never be a shortage of fertile material (U238 or Thorium) whereas fissile one is pretty limited. Breeding reactors also solve the very-long lived nuclear waste issue).He did all of this when he was trying to seduce electors from the green party.

This is a blatant lie, as France launched a project and never ceased trying to build.  However it failed flat.The last delivered reactor was Civaux-2 (generation II), in 1999. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civaux_Nuclear_Power_PlantThen in 2002 the project Flamanville-3 was launched (a generation III reactor, the &#34;EPR&#34;, first one of its kind), and the building phase started in 2007.  It is a major failure, not delivered, at least 11 years behind schedule, and will cost at least 19.1 billion euros (initial budget: 3.4 billions €).

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think this book would be perfect for me - I have been using Emacs for quite a while, but never mastered elisp: I could never figure out how to structure things properly.Looking at the book landing page, I think I would have passed on it because the Table of Contents make it look a bit like the book is just covering specific tasks (about rearranging sentences) rather than general tasks, like using best practices for creating packages.It would be good to include the paragraph from your blog in the book landing page:    In the first chapter, it tells you basically how to find Elisp functions doing things you need.
    In the second, longest chapter, it walks you through writing a complete, useful package, showcasing lots of Elisp features and good practices.
    In the third, last chapter, it hints at a few more advanced techniques – functional programming, lexical scoping and regular expressions.

No, the stims didn’t really do /that/ kind of wealth expansion.To me, this still looks like the bullwhip effect, which is expected to have an outsized effect on demand over at least a year or two.Buyers, who got used to “just in time” shipping, got spooked by shipping delays and shortages from their suppliers, because of supply demand imbalances during shutdowns, and as a response they all put in orders for 2 to 3 times the amount they usually buy from their suppliers with the intent of rebuilding domestic stock so they don’t miss out on sales.All of a sudden, aggregate demand explodes.Shocking."</p>

Once imported you can edit/scale/rate/tag/categorize/etc the recipe. Furthermore it has meal planning tools and a grocery list built in. I love the grocery list feature because you can easily click &#34;Add to Grocery List&#34; (of which you can have multiple if you want) and then just uncheck all the things you already have. It has a &#34;Pantry&#34; feature but I&#39;ve never used it, I assume it will auto-uncheck items you already have when you go to add them to the grocery list but I&#39;m not sure about that.It&#39;s great to import a recipe and then tweak it after making it and see what works/doesn&#39;t so you don&#39;t have to find the recipe again later and/or remember the changes you made to it.It&#39;s cross platform (Mac/iOS/Windows/Android) and running it on an older tablet in my kitchen is an awesome experience (timers built in, switch between multiple recipes easily, cross out ingredients after adding them, etc).I have no connection to the company, I just love the app. If I had 1 request it would be a way to share recipes with friends through some &#34;social&#34;/&#34;friend-ing&#34; concept in the app (not using a social network). You can share a &#34;.paprikarecipe&#34; file that includes everything about the recipe but passing around a file isn&#39;t always easy and Discord just cuts off extensions longer than like 12 characters which makes it harder.[0] https://www.paprikaapp.com/"</p>

What I do with something I paid for should concern only me as long as it&#39;s within my personal bounds (no redistribution, no profit, no business, etc.) Breaking DRM for personal use should not and cannot be illegal."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is terrible, and while IANAL I’m confused why it doesn’t fall under ADA requirements to provide accessible versions of materials - especially school materials.Also, can people really claim with a straight face that running a book through text-to-speech is the same as a real audiobook (that’s often a voice actor, right?)?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some years ago, I wrote the code specification for our ebook conversions. I made a priority of specifying good semantic structure, employ ARIA tags where needed, etc. I work for a university and there was yet no mandate for it, but it seemed only a matter of time. In the long run being a little ahead of the curve aid paid off, but now I need to go through and revise things to account for changing standards, and my own improved (I hope) understanding of what&#39;s needed.I&#39;m also reminded of an incident years ago when I was working in a New York, and an agent (for a popular, well-paid writer) called our contract department from my desk phone to insist they remove the clause allowing the LOC to make audiobooks for the blind. As agent crimes go, it might not be the worst, but it always struck me for how egregiously petty it was."</p>
