								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For any non-Brits, the SWP is the main left of Labour party in Britain. As a student in the 80s I remember them as an earnest, way too serious bunch of ideological zombies ranting into microphones at the Student&#39;s Union about the latest crimes against humanity perpetrated by &#39;Thatcher&#39;. They&#39;re the kind of people that come up to you in the street with leaflets about some atrocity in Africa and shout &#34;Would you murder children&#34; at you. I&#39;m not entirely sure they&#39;d recognise what an actual &#39;Worker&#39; was if they met one. I always found them quite comical.However they are a serious party, they&#39;re a highly motivated  and active movement with significant influence in the Labour Party grass roots. They&#39;re sort of our equivalent of Antifa in that they are a significant organising presence in lefty street protests, but much more politically active and spend a lot of time in conferences and action committees wondering what Capitalism ever did for us.Importantly, they are in no way shape or form a terrorist or criminal organisation. I would not be at all surprised if some ultra-violent or would-be Red Army Faction types joined or associated with them, but that&#39;s not at all who the SWP are as an organisation. They&#39;re the well meaning, impressionable white middle class girl next door with a class guilt complex and a side shave that&#39;s been going to BLM protests.If they are getting banned by Facebook something has gone horribly wrong. Quite possibly some of them got a bit excited and posted things they shouldn&#39;t, so I&#39;m not saying this is for sure Facebook&#39;s fault, but they&#39;re not about to murder any bobbies in Parliament Square."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"How is this not foreign political interference?The UK media has been preaching to us about dangers of Russian election interference for years at this point, but simultaneously they seem completely unconcerned that a handful of wealthy Americans how the power to censor popular media outlets, entire political movements and political activists at a whim.The SWP is massive. I don&#39;t know for sure, but I suspect they had millions of followers on Facebook. This isn&#39;t some fringe, extremist group by any sane interpretation of those terms.It seems we&#39;re now quickly moving on from just censoring those with extremist political views to simply censoring anyone who who dares express a non-establishment political view online."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a positive thing for these ejections to be across the political spectrum, because it makes the demand for distributed moderation come from across the political spectrum.I hope that demand congeals on support for an open blogging protocol, such that people can very easily post once and direct it to multiple platforms or any listener. If this becomes popular enough, and posts aren&#39;t owned by a particular platform, the big platforms lose their power to control the conversation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;People who do this are generally trying to be polite by not jumping right into the request, like one would in person or on the phone - and that&#39;s great!Different people have different reasons but I notice that many people that do a naked &#34;hi&#34; / &#34;hey&#34; are trying to see if the receiver is present for an immediate reply.In other words, the sender deliberately wants a synchronous instead of asynchronous convo.They don&#39;t want to type out a bunch of words for a question if the reply isn&#39;t going to happen for a few hours.EDIT to reply:  &#34;Then send it in an email.&#34;To clarify, some people don&#39;t want an async communication so switching to email doesn&#39;t solve their problem at all.The issue is that some personality styles do not like sending questions into an indeterminant void.  Thus, a naked &#34;hi&#34; for them is shorthand for &#34;r u there to talk to me RIGHT NOW?&#34;I sympathize with their need for immediacy but I made a previous comment on why it drives me crazy:  https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17255452Yep, some people are really confused as to why many async-preference people like me do not want to answer the phone."</p>

After I wrote the original page, someone put up an internal shortlink at &#34;go/nohello&#34;.  After I left Google, someone took the Wiki page content and [illegally, since it was Google confidential, simply from being on the internal Wiki], and put it up on the net at &#34;nohello.com&#34;.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I will forever associate Larry King with the movie “Spin”. [1] It’s a rather brilliant indie documentary about the 1992 (Bill Clinton / HW Bush) election based on a fascinating technological element: back then, Satellite TV feeds would often just keep running during commercial breaks, or warmups.So the director recorded a TON of footage from these moments where the politicians and news anchors acted themselves, seemingly unaware that anyone was watching.The segments with Larry King are, um, memorable. Very candid moments.1: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(1995_film)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I learned English watching Larry King Live, because that was my father&#39;s favourite talkshow during the 90s.I didn&#39;t understand half of what was going on in those conversations, but what stuck with me was the broad spectrum of people he interviewed and how consistently respectful he was towards his interviewees."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Always enjoyed his interviews and his style.  I happened to just watched a very short clip of him talking about his fear of death with Norm Macdonald last night.  Guess we all have to face that moment, and even though he had a long and successful life i&#39;m sorry for him and his family now.I linked the clip[1] below, but it may be a bit disconcerting and too soon to view for some.[1] https://youtu.be/8ZKq7CoZv4w"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Materials aging in space is a pretty deep subject. That it is the Russian Zvevda module that is leaking/cracking is likely related to the fact that it is also the oldest module in the ISS.The ISS is/was scheduled to be retired in 2024 (aka 3 years from now) but there are calls to keep it going. My fantasy would be to have SpaceX move it into the Lunar L1 Lagrange point which would keep it in use but it would have to deal with more cosmic rays, also station keeping would be an issue unless we could really get energized tether station keeping to work (lots of solar energy to provide power, but not a lot of mass to provide thrust, so tethers are energized conductors that push against the Earth&#39;s magnetic field)Parking it in L4 or L5 could keep it for future generations but it would be even more of a challenge to go visit."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Have never agreed with a blog post more. Every single bullet point, 10/10.Okay, okay, actually I have one qualm~&gt; Standups are actually useful for keeping an eye on the newbies.Unfair. Standups are useful for communication between a team in general, if kept brief. If senior engineer X is working on Y and other engineer M has already dealt with Y (unbeknowst to X), it&#39;s a great chance for X to say &#34;I&#39;m currently looking for a solution to Y&#34; and for M to say &#34;Oh I had to solve that same problem last month!&#34;Seniority has nothing to do with this. Communication/coordination/knowledge-sharing matter at all levels."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Designing scalable systems when you don&#39;t need to makes you a bad engineer.&gt; In general, RDBMS &gt; NoSqlThese two bullet points resonate with me so much right now. I&#39;m a consultant and a lot of my client absolutely insist on using DynamoDB for everything. I&#39;m building an internal facing app that will have users numbering in the hundreds, maybe. The hoops we are jumping through to break this app up into &#34;microservices&#34; are absolutely astounding. Who needs joins? Who needs relational integrity? Who needs flexible query patterns? &#34;It just has to scale&#34;!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Usually i disagree with these types of lists, but this one seems pretty spot on.My only quible would be that only code quality static analysis is useful. Security static analysis on the other hand (e.g. taint analysis to find security bugs like XSS) is pretty overrated most of the time unless you work really hard to make it fit in your context.I also think linting rules are important, not for what they actually do, but just to get everyone to stfu about variations in code style that dont matter and arguing about more important things."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;Rather than thinking in terms of the Duchampian readymade, which is most often understood as operating iconically...&#34;I got a real kick out of this line.  At first I thought it was pure nonsense.  After a bit of searching I found out that Marcel Duchamp was an artist that made some art called &#34;readymades.&#34;  Then I realized that what I thought was just pure nonsense was actually someone talking normally, but it was about a field totally alien to me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The thing I love about modern art is that initial instinctive reaction of &#34;Anyone could do this!&#34;. I have absolutely zero training in art so this might be a infantile opinion, but I am delighted by the pieces that makes me realize &#34;Anyone could do this, but no-one did until now.&#34;All that to say, I really like this series of works."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting! It&#39;s not really about the glass cube, but about the shipping process and what that shipping process does to the things it ships. It highlights the brutality and scale well. It&#39;s almost like a QA relic put on display.  I wonder if there would be other good examples."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think this guy would enjoy seeing some of the very low end of the used computer market in places like Pakistan - where they receive 20&#39; container loads full of 5 year old Dell, HP office PCs and mix/match pieces into fully working systems that people can enjoy for more years to come. There&#39;s a whole street with at least ten different retail vendors/repair shops in Rawalpindi."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Pretty neat. Definitely recycles a lot of electronics in a good way. On the GPIO pins I would definitely replace the connector! I can tell you from experience that even if the pins straighten out, some random plugging/unplugging later and the pin will break off and the next person will end up replacing the connector. This is much easier if you have a setup already for doing the work.This is also a really great way to &#34;pay yourself&#34; to learn to do rework. Buying 200 at £61 and selling the fully restored ones (which appears to &gt; 100) at £9 is at least £900 revenue from the experience. Granted, since you are &#34;learning&#34; that would be slow work at first, but later it would become fairly routine. So something someone in high school could easily do."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I’m doing it for the blog content and the experience and to hopefully provide you guys with some very cheap Raspberry Pi’s for your projects!One other thing here that makes me happy is that these repaired Pis will not end up in a landfill, which I bet would have otherwise been the end result.  Yes, there are electronics recycling services, but who knows if the original owner would have gone that route, and I imagine there still ends up being quite a bit of unrecycleable waste, not to mention the energy required to do the recycling itself.Meanwhile, I have a thermoelectric wine fridge that died recently.  Looks like it&#39;s the logic board, but the manufacturer doesn&#39;t make them anymore (couldn&#39;t find anything on ebay etc. either).  I feel really awful that I&#39;ll likely have to have to toss the thing due to what is probably a really cheap and easy-to-replace dead part.  (I need to take another look at it to see if there&#39;s something obvious like a blown capacitor that I can replace.)&gt; Instead I will be donating the proceeds of the sales to the Raspberry Pi Foundation and they can decide what to do with the Money!This is just really awesome.  Kudos to the author."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Regarding performance, I wrote a bit about this a few months ago in a post comparing different workload isolation techniques:https://fly.io/blog/sandboxing-and-workload-isolation/Two useful links from my Pinboard research for that post:A person at Red Hat optimizing QEMU boot time:http://oirase.annexia.org/tmp/paper.pdfAn Intel deck talking about qemu-lite:http://events17.linuxfoundation.org/sites/events/files/slide...(The other thing to follow up on if you&#39;re interested in the background on this stuff is kvmtool).In both cases, a big part of the answer seems to be eliminating BIOS overhead; getting rid of oproms appears to have been the single biggest win for Intel. But the Red Hat article also finds lots of overhead in QEMU itself, and both pieces talk about kernel config issues (for instance, scrubbing the kernel you boot of subsystems that have expensive initcalls).By comparison: Firecracker is purpose-built in Rust for this one task, provides no BIOS, and offers only network, block, keyboard, and serial device support --- with tiny drivers (the serial support is less than 300 lines of code)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another incredible blog post from Julia Evans.Julia if you&#39;re reading, I&#39;m a big fan.  One request:  could you add the date/time to the post, preferably near the title?I do see a `&lt;time&gt;` tag in the HTML, but it doesn&#39;t render any human readable text.  The datetime is also part of the URL which is &#34;good enough,&#34; but it always takes me a minute to remember that and Ctrl+F won&#39;t find it.I&#39;m a little ADD about knowing when things were published, so far from an average person.  If you like it the way it is, then don&#39;t worry about me.  I just wanted to throw it out there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The blog post doesn&#39;t mention it but Firecracker was originally based on crosvm [0] built at Google by the ChromeOS team for a WSL-like Linux sandbox on top of ChromeOS running debian-buster containers viz. penguin (afaik) in a gentoo-based VM viz. termina [1]. crosvm inturn is part of a much bigger crostini project [2], which I find to be super fascinating, as it supports UI workloads (over Wayland and X).If you&#39;re using ChromeOS to run any Linux app, you&#39;re using crostini which launches those apps in crosvm managed sandboxes (Container inside a VM) in seconds. In not so distant future, it looks like Android will sandbox platform workloads (running outside the Android framework?) managed by crosvm, to considerably improve security [3].I looked for but couldn&#39;t find ChromeOS GCP instances. I mean, ChromeOS might be a great platform to run multi-tenant server workloads at this point.[0] https://archive.is/T1ZNJ[1] One can run custom Linux containers (other than the debian-based penguin) but not VMs (other than termina) at this point: https://chromeos.dev/en/linux/linux-on-chromeos-faq[2] https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/docs/+/master/c...[3] https://lwn.net/Articles/836693/"</p>

To buy Parler&#39;s contract claim, you&#39;d have to believe that Amazon&#39;s lawyers are so stupid that they set out a TOS for the world&#39;s largest hosting provider that didn&#39;t give AWS the right to boot customers, which is something AWS --- really, every hosting provider --- has to do all the time. You almost have to not know anything about the hosting business to think there could be a case here.But if you need to read a judge laughing Parler&#39;s claims off, well, now you can. Real &#34;based&#34; energy in excerpting the AWS AUP in their complaint and clipping it right before the clause that gives AWS the right to terminate service without notice to customers who violate their AUP. The judge, uh, noticed.(As the judge points out, among the many problems with Parler&#39;s restraint of trade argument, there&#39;s the fact that AWS doesn&#39;t host Twitter&#39;s feed.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As much as I don&#39;t like Parler&#39;s digital death sentence from Silicon Valley, they should&#39;ve known this was coming and prepared. It doesn&#39;t take a genius to know that such a controversial website is going to get dropped, even if it&#39;s just because it makes the webhost look bad.Yes it&#39;s unfair that Twitter gets away with hosting way worse content, but life is unfair, that doesn&#39;t mean you stick your head in the sand and pretend the risk of de-platforming never existed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been trying to come to grips with the societal impact of echo chambers, &#34;hate&#34; speech, and the obligations vs. rights of sites and hosting providers.So far, my take is that websites have less obligation than hosting. It concerns me that AWS booted a site off their platform for speech issues - I am leaning more and more to the idea that colos, IaaS and ISPs should be considered common carriers, and that only a court order should get a site booted off the web entirely."</p>
