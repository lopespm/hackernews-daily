Take this plan with a grain of salt.3. The original article by heise.de mentions that the federal government will push these plans during negotiation of the EU wide laws. The government thinks that the plans of the commission do not go far enough. However it&#39;s unlikely that Germany will implement stricter rules on a national level."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like this, but I think a reasonable alternative would be that for smart phones older than a certain age the manufacturer publish enough information for the creation of free drivers and software and unlocks for installing that software. One thing that makes me really sad is that I would probably be perfectly fine still using iPhone 5 era hardware if I had a free OS I could put on there with ongoing support. That&#39;s entirely reasonable in the desktop/laptop space so it strikes me as kinda sad that it seems non-existent in phones, when it&#39;s all just computers anyway."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The good thing about the fact that Atlassian offers both on-prem and cloud versions of their offerings is, everyone is now aware of the awful engineering practices that underpin their products. We have to assume that there are problems of a similar nature in their cloud service, which is way more of a problem considering the number of orgs that depend on the JIRA SaaS offering.Maybe the founders could have used some of that time spent planning a tunnel between their side-by-side $100M houses, or engaged in Twitter rants, to actually bother delivering value to customers. It’s only a matter of time before this product suite is disrupted, and it might represent one of the most obvious low-hanging opportunities in our entire industry.I still remember being in line at a WWDC a few years back, overhearing someone ask a developer, “where do you work?” When the developer responded with “HipChat,” the other person immediately chuckled and said, “oh — Atlassian... I’m sorry” — and then everyone around them also started laughing. It’s amazing that this company continues to fall up, and that the founders have taken on roles as the ruling digital gurus of Australia (shows you why it’s so easy for the government to run circles around the local tech industry and pass whatever laws they want)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Twitter link to a case of the vulnerability being exploited: https://twitter.com/th3_protoCOL/status/1433414685299142660NIST Link to issue: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-26084Tweet from USCYBERCOM urging users to patch: https://twitter.com/CNMF_CyberAlert/status/14337876717851852...Tweet from BadPackets showing where the bad actors are originating from: https://twitter.com/bad_packets/status/1433157632370511873"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Atlassian was so kind to update their mailing lists somewhere over the last year or so. Previously, they would email the &#39;technical contact&#39; of the license about any vulnerabilities. They quietly switched to some other notification system and never informed us about it. Hence we missed the update and got a free Bitcoin miner. Thanks Atlassian, I&#39;ll make sure to get your products out of the door as soon as possible.[edit] Oh it&#39;s even better. Their site says &#39;Note: if you are a tech administrator, you will always receive these notifications.&#39; but they never mailed us. Great job, Atlassian, great job."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Finally, something that outright says that its intent is to be a discord alternative. So many platforms try to sell themselves on some other feature, rather than just being open source and self-hostable. So many things, like Matrix, come close, but lack key components to really competing, such as voice channels rather than calls.I hope this goes somewhere!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Also working on a Discord alternative, albeit my project is a decentralized version — neat to see the space has traction. One thing I couldn’t quickly surmise: it looks like your services are centralized and neither servers/spaces (whatever terminology you’re using for logical groupings of communities) nor DMs have support for encryption. Do you have plans to support this? I don’t mean to ask this as a FUD spreader, I just am curious how you differentiate from Discord aside from being open source, and similarly, how you intend to ensure your offering stays open source in perpetuity?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Curious why you decided to use MongoDB as opposed to HBase or Cassandra? Discord moved away from MongoDB because its sharding is “complicated to use and not known for stability.” Are these issues not relevant anymore?"</p>

  When the phone rings, I put it to my ear
  without saying hello. In the restaurant
  I point at chicken noodle soup.
  I am adjusting well to the new way.

  Late at night, I call my long distance lover,
  proudly say I only used fifty-nine today.
  I saved the rest for you.
  When she doesn’t respond,  
  I know she’s used up all her words,

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love this as an idea, but I suspect as a user, I would use either zero or one posts.I do like the idea that the platform can actively disrupt the &#34;addictive&#34; patterns that develop elsewhere. Other things I&#39;ve wanted:- Instagram with an ML layer that auto-rejects pics with faces or text. Landscapes, vistas, animals, architecture etc all would be welcome.- high latency Twitter, where no post is viewable until at least 2 weeks after it&#39;s published. Bickering threads become impractical. People learn to post stuff that will be worth caring about later.- Clearly just for entertainment and not information Facebook alternative, in which GPT bots produce a significant fraction of posts, impersonating users and making stuff up. Everyone quickly learns you can&#39;t trust it, but it can still be cute/fun/humorous."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi, podman-apple-silicon developer here! I want to share some FAQs about this project. :)Q: Does this run amd64 docker images or aarch64 docker images?A: aarch64 images currently, but I&#39;m going to patch podman to make it possible to run both amd64 image and aarch64 image. All I have to do for this is to make QEMU call and Linux image configurable, so it won&#39;t be very hard. However, if you are running amd64 images, you will have to bear the performance overhead due to CPU emulation.Q: Is this toy or are you actually going to maintain this?A: I&#39;m DevOps engineer and I made podman-apple-silicon to actually use this in my day job.Q: Are you going to merge this to the upstream?A: I&#39;ll keep trying, but it won&#39;t be easy unless QEMU merges Alex Graf&#39;s Hypervisor.framework patch.I may forgot to check HackerNews, so please feel free to ask me anything about podman-apple-silicon at https://twitter.com/simnalamburt"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Tangentially, I wonder if Moby underestimated the amount of human hours that were instantly allocated to alternatives as soon as they announced Docker Desktop was going paid. (I don&#39;t know if this project is a consequence of that announcement or not.)Hopefully Podman will be able to capitalize on this event and get the polish needed for widespread use."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It looks like the real nice thing here is having a formula for QEMU with the ARM patch applied: https://github.com/simnalamburt/qemu/tree/hvfWith this I believe you could also used [nerd](https://github.com/containerd/nerdctl) instead of podman but I haven&#39;t tested it yet.Edit: It works. Had a bit of trouble since I wanted to uninstall the &#34;real&#34; QEMU first, but `lima` still depended on it, and then installing the patched QEMU needed to update the version of `lima` I had installed, which then tried to reinstall QEMU, which failed because of some symlinks which were now owned by the patched QEMU..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I understand the points about having to comply with laws. But what is is unjustifiable is my view is that their marketing does not match the reality. They probably did some A/B testing and saw that keeping vague promises about not tracking users increases conversion rate. You, as an HN reader, being in the top 0.1% of the population in terms of tech-savviness, may be able to read through the nonsense and understand how little it means when they say &#34;by default, we do not keep any IP logs&#34;. But the other 99.9% of the population won&#39;t understand it, and that&#39;s why their marketing strategy works: they are selling a level of privacy that does not exist to customers who do not know better without technically lying.Their threat model and all threat scenarios should be front and centre on their front page and sign up page. That is if they care about user privacy not just the bottom line. They have a choice between better-informed customers or more money, and so far, they have chosen the latter.What this and the new Apple debacle have proven to me is that privacy is not a product that can be purchased. If you want real privacy, you have spend a lot of time learning how to preserve your privacy. No matter what Apple and ProtonMail and similar companies tell you, you cannot buy privacy off-the-shelf."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They claim to have exceptionally good Tor support, when in reality people have (rightly) been screaming at them for years now to fix their permabroken Tor signup flow.1. It&#39;s impossible to create a paid account with cryptocurrency: You can only use it to pay for an existing account2. It&#39;s impossible to anonymously create any account over Tor: You have to at least pass SMS / secondary email verification, and it better not be an easy to get address (&#34;Email verification temporarily disabled for this email domain&#34; etc.)Lots of marketing and boxticking (.onion: check), but it looks curiously hostile to anonymity if you actually try to use it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"According to MSN [1], the DEA decided last week to give him his money back.They kept the money for 200 days, in violation of the Federal statute requiring the DEA to file a case within 90 days. It&#39;s unclear what, if any, repercussions there will be for the DEA for violating the law. Astoundingly, the Nevada Highway Patrol did not violate the law. That only means, of course, it&#39;s a terrible law and needs to be eliminated. Hopefully there will be some consequences for police that abuse this bad law, but that will have to come from local voters.Note that $87k in 100&#39;s is a stack about 4&#34; thick. It sickens me to hear people blaming the victim for the non-crime of holding his own cash, with bank receipts, and for the non-crime of simply telling the officer the truth and being totally cooperative. The lesson here is clear: do not cooperate with the police. They are not your friend, they are not trustworthy, and they will hurt you, badly, and suffer no consequences.1 - https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/crime/marine-veteran-suing-nh..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"GoodReads is all but dead for many. A few months ago, they deprecated their API keys (without notice).I started building a GoodReads-equivalent but realized that many people care more about learning from multiple media formats (blogs, videos, research  papers, interactive explorables, podcasts, courses etc) rather than simply reading books. Because there are too many projects attempting to build a new GoodReads, I ended up building something more oriented for multimedia learners.It’s up and running, open-source, built with Ruby on Rails and supports protocols like ActivityPub, RSS etc. There is a companion browser extension, integration with Slack groups, Twitter and more, and a WIP mobile app. Like GoodReads, you can build your learning lists and embed them on your sites.It participates in fediverse so your reviews can be broadcasted to your followers on Mastodon, PeerTube etc but full federation is not yet there because it has an underlying knowledge graph that will need to be synchronised across instances.I think many HN users may be interested in checking it out:https://learnawesome.org/https://github.com/learn-awesome/learn"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What exactly is wrong with Goodreads? I keep hearing a lot of hate about it, but the reasons seem never expanded on.I use Goodreads to maintain a public bookshelf of books I have read or want to read.

I typically tend not to agree, but it&#39;s nice that these exist.That&#39;s it. Isn&#39;t that what Goodreads is about? Seems like a nice website and perfectly suited for what it does.
