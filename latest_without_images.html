								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In the spirit of the old saying, &#34;the two happiest days of a boat owner&#39;s life are the day they buy a boat, and the day they sell it.&#34;The best advice I got starting out was, &#34;be indispensable.&#34;The best advice I got four years later was, &#34;don&#39;t be indispensable.&#34;In a growing company, the indispensable people may find themselves being left holding the bag while new initiatives are undertaken. I very quickly learned the meaning of &#39;working your way out of a job&#39; after the first time this happened to me.I&#39;m sure there&#39;s some min-max game I&#39;m not playing with regards to how easy I am to lay off, but once I learned there are worse fates that being laid off, I stopped looking for them. Being &#34;stuck&#34; with responsibilities is unpleasant when things are going well, but it&#39;s miserable when things are going badly. If you aren&#39;t the one who got laid off, then someone you used to trade off with doing onerous tasks certainly was, and now you&#39;re stuck doing it every single time.If given the choice between &#34;my company would be just fine without me&#34; and &#34;everything would fall apart if I didn&#39;t show up to work,&#34; the latter feels very good for a brief period when you&#39;re young, until the weight of that responsibility sinks in.  &#34;My company would be just fine without me,&#34; can mean &#34;my work here is done,&#34; and you can ride off into the sunset with a clear conscience."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The first thing to remember is – no one is indispensable. If you get hit by a bus tomorrow the company will go on without you. People may have a bit of trouble at first, but new processes will develop and new people will gain expertise just as you have now. Heck the company might be better off in the long run without knowledge bottlenecks.Second, being indispensable doesn&#39;t do a whole lot for job security. If the company is doing well, you need to perform exactly at average to stay employed, no more. And if the company is down in the dumps and there are mass layoffs, who is going to judge how much knowledge you have in your head? All the people who know how good you are are probably getting fired as well.Third, you are probably not as important as you think you are. Upper management isn&#39;t sitting around singing your praises in their weekly meeting. No, they are focused on the rising star who is executing new ideas and launching new product lines. You are meanwhile being taken for granted.Now, if you are in this position the author writes about, the time to get out of it is now. Realize that no one can help you but yourself. Start redirecting people, or ignore them altogether. Make noise up the management ladder. Play dumb if you have to. Eventually the rest of the company will find some new punching bag and leave you alone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked for a european investment bank for a number of years, and they had a policy that every year, every employee (without exception) was required to take 2 weeks holiday as a contiguous block, and during that time, their access to the company was removed, so no email access, no remote login, keycard access to the office removed etc. They basically ran the &#39;suspend this person from the organisation&#39; script and restored you when you returned after your holiday.This was primarily in place to reduce the risk of fraud in the trading/operations side of the business, but it had the side effect that it made it very obvious if the business depended on someone being in the office, since managers would have to cope with people being off and unavailable for 2 weeks. It of course also covered people leaving, or being hit by a bus etc.Overall I thought it was a very simple mechanism to avoid the business risk of being exposed to one employee both from a business as usual, and also from a fraud point of view, and also made it much easier for people to free themselves from a particular role."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Next, we keep the DERP network costs under control… by trying to never use it. When using Tailscale, almost all of your traffic goes peer to peer, so DERP is only used as a backup. We continue to improve our core product so it can build point-to-point links in ever-more-obscure situations.This is mentioned in passing, but shows a very good technique.  They incentivize technical excellence by tying it to a concrete cost.  A free plan, with DERP, is the sacred cow that must not ever be removed.  If they don&#39;t fix the &#34;ever more obscure situations&#34;, then the cost goes up.  If they pay an engineer to investigate and fix this, not only does the engineer get to do interesting technical work, and not only does the system become more reliable and &#34;good&#34;, they can also think of it as increasing the profit margin of the product (by not increasing costs).I worked with Avery on Google Fiber, and we did the same thing.  Our sacred cow was excellent US-based phone support.  That is quite expensive.  If there were bugs in our product, users would call in, and our call center costs would increase because we&#39;d have to have more people working.  So every week in our team meeting, we would look at summaries of calls, and take on engineering work to address the most common class of problems.  That let us scale up the business and still provide friendly and competent phone support, because we were reducing the problems that people called in about.  (This was things like having our Wifi access points steer 5GHz capable devices away from flakier 2.4GHz signals, or fixing &#34;black screen&#34; bugs where TV randomly stopped playing for software or network reasons.)  Because we had that &#34;sacred cow&#34;, every obscure bug that we spent months fixing not only made the product better and were intellectually stimulating to finally figure out, but had a concrete impact on how costly it was to deliver the service.What most companies would do here to reduce costs is simple.  Don&#39;t fix DERP bugs, just charge for it.  Don&#39;t fix &#34;black screen&#34; bugs, just hide the phone number on your website so people can&#39;t figure out to call.Avery has found the perfect balance between cost reduction, interesting engineering, and the somewhat nebulous &#34;good product&#34;.  Normally conflicting concerns, all living together in harmony.  If everyone copied his technique here, the world would be a better place."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For me it’s the opposite: I actually don’t mind paying for a great product such as Tailscale (which I really like), but have security and privacy concerns!Mesh VPNs have substantial control over networks that they manage (they bypass firewalls by having users instal agents from within).  They could add hidden nodes to networks, which is a major security concern, and see who is taking to who, how long, what service they are running, etc, which can be a privacy concern. They are targets.Is there a way to address these concerns, and make them “really” (not just on website) zero trust or at least minimal trust? Will Wireguard preshared keys as an option help (a maliciously added public key lacks a secret key exchanged among peers out of band)?What are the implications of the substantial control that Tailscale has?Or we have no way, but to trust someone? Looking at events of the past decade, I don’t have a good feeling about this!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Tailscale reminds me of Fly.io; fantastic tech that &#34;just works&#34;, run by people who know what they&#39;re doing and know how to write about it. What other companies belong in this all-too-exclusive cohort?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Sometimes I think this sounds conspiratorial, and surely isn&#39;t happening. Who has the time or money to pay 5 people to just go around harassing and stalking people for political gain only?Then I remember the story of the lady in East Germany who, after it fell, managed to get the Stasi records that finally proved that yes, they had been stalking her, harassing her, and spying on her.They would do things like wait until she went into a store to buy something, then let the air out of her bicycle tires. Just stupid little harassing things like that, so that if she complained about it to her family they&#39;d think she was crazy.Next time you hear some nutcase on the street talking about things like this to whoever will listen... ponder things like this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These details are wild, scary, and fascinating. Fascinating from the perspective of how easy it is for foreign governments on the other side of the world to try to scare the shit out of US citizens by hiring some scumbag PI for probably as little as $5k.&gt; Beginning in September 2021, Lin hired a private investigator (the PI) in New York to disrupt the campaign of a Brooklyn resident currently running for U.S. Congress (the Victim), including by physically attacking the Victim. The Victim was a student leader of the pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square in 1989, who later escaped to the United States, served in the U.S. military, and became a naturalized U.S. citizen. In September 2021, the Victim (then living in Long Island) announced his intention to run for a U.S. congressional seat on Long Island in the November 2022 general election.&gt; In hiring the PI, Lin explained that if the Victim was selected during the June 2022 primary election, then he might be “elected to be a legislator. Right now we don’t want him to be elected.” Lin emphasized that, “Whatever price is fine. As long as you can do it.”  He also promised that “we will have a lot more-more of this [work] in the future…Including right now [a] New York State legislator.” Lin explained to the PI that Lin was working with other unidentified individuals in the PRC to stop the Victim from being elected to U.S. Congress."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The &#34;dual use&#34; paper this is commenting on is the clickbait equivalent of &#34;encryption is for pedos&#34;, and maybe Derek&#39;s &#34;not too surprising&#34; is code for &#34;Science editors are not discerning enough&#34;.Like, this is the whole point of pharmacology: Predicting the biological interactions of chemicals (what they do to biological targets, how potent), and their ancillary physical properties (solubility, volatility, stability etc). For example,Optimizing for mu-opioid agonist activity gives you super potent painkillers, drugs of abuse, and that stuff Russia gassed a theater with to knock out / kill hostages and kidnappers (i.e. fentanyl analogues)Optimizing for inhibition of various proteases might give you chemotherapy drugs with nasty side effects, or stuff with nasty side effects and no known therapeutic use (i.e. ricin)Optimizing for acetylcholinesterase inhibitor activity will turn up nasty poisons which could be purposed as &#34;nerve agents&#34; or &#34;pesticides&#34;Optimizing for 5HT2a activity will give compounds that are great for mapping receptor locations in brains, which are also drugs of abuse, and which are also lethal to humans in small doses.And the &#34;predicted compounds not included in the training set&#34; thing is just table stakes for any predictive model!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fortunately we don&#39;t see any real work in the chemical and biological weapons space anymore. While it would still be pretty handy for terrorist groups, in actual warfare chemical weapons aren&#39;t super useful. See https://acoup.blog/2020/03/20/collections-why-dont-we-use-ch... ."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Now, keep in mind that we can&#39;t deliberately design our way to drugs so easily, so we won&#39;t be able to design horrible compounds in one shot, either. &#34;I would discount this, heavily and concerningly, as a false sense of security.  The reality is that prohibitive factors in creating new drugs from compounds discovered similarly (by AI or other automated process) is almost entirely due to testing safety procedures and regulations... If the bad actors are trying to find the most lethal compound with no such oversight - and chances are very high that they aren&#39;t bound by any such regulation if they&#39;re state-level labs operating under impunity - there is nothing but the synthesis that would make the formulation and testing of these as impractical as the author claims.  Take away the years-long, heavily scrutinized and regulated multi-stage billion-dollar path to drug approvals and you&#39;ll find that barrier is not so high.I would like to think this data could be helpful to any organizations looking to proactively develop detectors or antidotes for such compounds - especially if the threat was previously unknown to them.Let&#39;s say an entirely novel class of toxin was found in a cluster of these predictions that has no existing references in private or public records - it could be that another organization has discovered and synthesized something similar through one of many other paths.Many lines are drawn between this type of approach and that of whitehat hackers.  You must necessarily create the vulnerability to mitigate it.  It feels like &#34;white hat&#34; biolabs claiming the same are operating on the same conundrum and that the difference between &#34;studying for the sake of mitigating&#34; and &#34;creating a weapon&#34; are fundamentally indistinguishable without an absolute knowledge of intent - such is impossible from the outside."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"An interesting aspect of this is that the endless printing of money in the last few years was a sort of stress test of modern monetary theory, which has been seeing lots of discussion in those same years. I never quite understood how this theory would work while avoiding inflation, and what&#39;s happening now seems to at least be related - https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/06/business/economy/modern-m...Conceptually the answer in the theory is to suck up the excess money with taxes, which of course is not going to fly in the US. But maybe this inflation will make that more viable in the future:
&#34;Ms. Kelton and her colleagues make clear that the pandemic relief packages did not follow one of M.M.T.’s key tenets — they did not try to account for resource constraints ahead of time. In an M.M.T. world, the Congressional Budget Office would have carefully analyzed possible inflation ahead of time, and lawmakers would have tried to offset any strain on available workers and widgets with stabilizing measures and tax increases.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"But the reason why so many historical figures were tutored or homeschooled is because there was no adequate public education system. This is confusing correlation for causation. Indeed, Bertrand Russell wrote:&gt; The method of a hereditary leisure class without duties was, however, extraordinarily wasteful. None of the members of the class had been taught to be industrious, and the class as a whole was not exceptionally intelligent. It might produce one Darwin, but against him had to be set tens of thousands of country gentlemen who never thought of anything more intelligent than fox-hunting and punishing poachers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I could be totally wrong, but my hunch is that this is more related to the lowest hanging fruit rather than human capacity. Maybe scientific discoveries simply get exponentially harder.In painting, it&#39;s very rare for someone to make anything original these days. We won&#39;t have any more Picassos, etc, simply because they were the first to explore a new terrain. It&#39;s really not a matter of education, genetics, or talent. The more explored a terrain is, the less there is to discover.So the matter is really discovering new terrains, like the internet has been in the past decades."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you look at the sports world, you will see that its equivalent of tutoring is hugely beneficial and is alive and well. The Williams sisters and their father are one obvious example but if you dig deeper, you will see many more examples. Rafael Nadal was tutored by his uncle. Tiger Woods was tutored by his father. Also, look at coaches. They are often the sons and daughters of coaches.Tutoring allows exploring and independence of thought which is really how you improve your thinking whereas standardized education mostly does not. Tutoring is bidirectional and standardized education is most unidirectional."</p>
