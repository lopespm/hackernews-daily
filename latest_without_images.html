								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I lead the Microsoft Open Source Programs Office team. I&#39;m sorry this happened.We have merged a pull request that restored the correct LICENSE file and copyright, and are in touch with the upstream author Leśny Rumcajs who emailed us this morning. We&#39;ll look to revert the entire commit that our bot made, too, since it updated the README with a boilerplate getting started guide.The bug was caused by a bot that was designed to commit template files in new repositories. It&#39;s code that I wrote to try to prevent other problems we have had with releasing projects in the past. It&#39;s not supposed to run on forks.I&#39;m going to make sure that we sit down and audit all of our forked repositories and revert similar changes to any other projects.We have a lot of process around forking, and have had to put controls in place to make sure that people are aware of that guidance. Starting a few years ago, we even &#34;lock&#34; forks to enforce our process. We prefer that people fork projects into their individual GitHub accounts, instead of our organization, to encourage that they participate with the upstream project. In this situation, a team got approval to fork the repository, but hasn&#39;t yet gotten started.To be as open as I can, I&#39;d like to point to the bug:- The templates we apply on new repositories live at https://github.com/microsoft/repo-templates- The bug seems to be at this line of the new repository workflow: https://github.com/microsoft/opensource-management-portal/bl...- The system we have in place even tries to educate our engineers with this log message (https://github.com/microsoft/opensource-management-portal/bl...): &#34;this.log.push({ message: `Repository ${subMessage}, template files will not be committed. Please check the LICENSE and other files to understand existing obligations.` });&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The attitude in these threads always boggles my mind.  When YOU, your teammates or someone else you know makes a mistake, then it’s just a mistake.     But when someone at Microsoft makes a mistake it’s because Microsoft is evil and by extension so is the person who offended.“It’s a big company”, you say.  They should have a process!  And I’m sad to say, they do/will have a process exactly because of this attitude.  Then, everyone wonders why it takes forever to fix that bug they’re furious about or why features are slow to come.Full disclosure: I work for MS, though have nothing to do with this.  It’s a huge company. I know hundreds of people and most of them are upstanding and try to do the right thing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t think that just because some &#34;bot&#34; did this Microsoft is to be excused. Someone decided that using a piece of software to automatically alter license files. This is a genuinely stupid idea. And they already fucked up in the same way with the CUPS project. Will they learn without someone taking them to court over this? I don&#39;t think so."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Thank you for this gesture. 
I lost almost everything. Job, 7-year relationship, my mental health.Feeling that I&#39;m not only alone but inadequate to have a life like anybody else.I&#39;m still alive, so there&#39;s that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thank you for this post, I spent the majority of Christmas &#39;19 and &#39;20 alone and it was in the middle of a very challenging time of my life. I&#39;m very young and grateful for the friends and others that included me in their holiday celebrations, and having time alone to reflect and come to the realization that Christmas doesn&#39;t come from having family to share it with.While most traditional Christmas stories and many people focus on celebrating children, love and family, material goods, etc it&#39;s also about looking on the bright side of life, counting your blessings, and carrying on traditions. A happy Christmas is a choice, and my advice to all who are alone today is this: Build your own traditions, buy yourself something and wrap it up nice, decorate a tree, make gingerbread houses, or cook a meal you really like, whatever appeals to you.I&#39;ll leave you with the last line from How the Grinch Stole Christmas and a link to an In Our Time episode about (A Christmas Carol)[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0012fl5]:&#34;Welcome Christmas, bring your cheer. Cheer to all Who&#39;s far and near Christmas day is in our grasp, so long as we have hands to clasp. Christmas day will always be, just as long as we have we. Welcome Christmas while we stand, heart to heart and hand in hand.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This year, after a tumultuous breakup (that quite literally plunged me into my deepest crisis to day), I’m practicing being alone. Mostly because what lead to said breakup in the first place, was me being a relationship-addict, which at this point in my self-awareness journey I understand to be a transgenerational issue. Thus being with family does not help at all (even though I did my fair share of being with them yesterday). As opposed to OP, I’m less than happy about the whole thing understandably.What helps is hiking, I guess, trying to get a grip on whether doing it alone or with others helps more.I guess this is close to being rock bottom for me at this point, hope you guys feel at least a tiny bit ok."</p>

This new coworker has lately been shattering that. This person not only posts in the evenings, weekends, and sometimes into the graveyard shift, but does so in a cloying, overeager, performative kind of way.&#34;while that job was running I took the opportunity to go learn this new skill!&#34;&#34;I finished this step of the process.

I don&#39;t want work conversations to stretch into nonworking hours. I don&#39;t want this to become part of the culture in my team or company.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There are so many super cool aspects to this!- it&#39;s always fun when a new equation or formula is discovered, doubly so when it is very practical- actually really easy to wrap your head around it- seems very computationally efficient. Basically boils down to sorts and distance- not limited to strict numeric fields ( integers and reals). Anything with an ordering defined can act as your Xs/Ys: characters, words, complex/vectors (under magnitude). I think you could even apply it recursively to divide and conquer high dimensional datasets.- looks useful in both LTI and non stationary signal analysis- possible use cases: exoplanet search, cosmology in general, ecology, climate, cryptanalysis, medicine, neuroscience, and of course, someone will find a way to win (more likely lose) money on stonks."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"About 14 years ago, at my first job, I worked with a colleague[1] who introduced me to the wonderful world of open source: the culture, the philosophy, how to submit patches to open source projects, etc. He also introduced me to Debian GNU/Linux which I use actively to this day.One day, he began working on certain audio/video encoding problems that needed to be solved for our project. He chose FFmpeg as the primary tool around which he began building his solution. After having spent several days with FFmpeg, figuring out and documenting various ways of using FFmpeg to solve all our audio/video encoding problems, one day, when we went out for lunch, he declared to the team,&#34;FFmpeg is awesome! If you give me a shoe, I will turn it into a video file!&#34;[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=topa"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think it is worth posting Tom Vaughan [1]( Father of x265 )&#39;s reply here.&gt;FFMPEG is a media processing framework. It&#39;s great for simple media processing jobs (builds a graph, runs the graph). A build of &#34;FFMPEG&#34; includes that media processing framework plus dozens of open source libraries (filters) that do the actual work (x265, x265, libav, etc).&gt;So &#34;FFMPEG&#34; gets a lot of well deserved credit (it&#39;s the framework that lots of applications and well-known services run), but the core FFMPEG is probably a tiny fraction of the development man-hours in a build of FFMPEG. It&#39;s all the linked libraries that make it useful.It is also worth stating this is from 2020. I am not sure why this is submitted now.[1] https://twitter.com/tmvn/status/1258610308962111490"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There’s a lot of good stuff in here, things I’ve used in my personal life to great effect.The really important thing here (that’s hinted at towards the end) is moderation.Do some of these things. A little at a time. Find what works and what doesn’t.Saying the truth no matter what the cost is extremely dangerous advice to follow literally.Pick battles you can win. Know when saying the truth matters and when it doesn’t. Know when your “truth” is just another opinion no one around you at that moment agrees with.As my dad always told me, “you can be dead right.”Life is too short to be miserable trying to obtain someone else’s goals. It is too short to optimize everything. Remember that happiness in the moment matters. (But not at the expense of the future.)You’ll never find me reading a book I don’t like or skipping using GPS, because things cause more stress than benefit.Having a car break down and having a magical moment because of it? Do the opposite. Actively seek those moments by finding people to help instead of waiting for the moment to happen.If I have any advice to add, it is be honest and be kind. Fight when you need to fight, make peace when you don’t. You don’t need to fix everything, just make the world better by being in it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am the guy that throws a wrench into my friends&#39; plans for where to have a drink, or where to go for dinner. This guy should take a break and write some self-help garbage for nonconformists who want to be a little more socially chill. But I guess that&#39;s not where the money is.This kind of pedantic talking-like-a-successful-guy to weak-minded-people shit nauseates me. Mark Manson made a great career out of it. It&#39;s Joe Rogan&#39;s bread and butter. Dress it up in all the pseudo-historical philosophy you want, it reads exactly the same way.The best take-down ever of this is the rather forced performance given by Tom Cruise&#39;s character in &#34;Magnolia&#34;. The writing and direction of that piece of social commentary was one of the things that made me think PT Anderson was almost as good as JD Salinger at deconstructing the mind of conformist-wannabe-rebels."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Liked most of this except #1&gt; Discovering and living out a sense of calling — a personal vocation, or something you are uniquely meant to do — is the ultimate way to cut through the mimetic noise of the world and begin to shape both a moral and a vocational compass.There are on the order of 7 billion human beings on earth. We don&#39;t all have a personal vocation or something we are uniquely meant to do. One of the keys to leading a happy and fulfilled life is being able to be content to live within the bounds that most of us operate in. Most of us are not uniquely gifted, not particularly special, not here to do one thing in this world. But we can be kind, be helpful, try to do as little damage to other people and the world as we can, to find value in things that last and do not cost the world very much, to enjoy our lives regardless of what we do for a living, not because of it.It may be a gift from the Renaissance to believe in individuality in the way that #1 clearly does, but it&#39;s a gift that doesn&#39;t scale to huge populations (it may not even have been right with much smaller ones). It&#39;s wonderful to live in a society that allows for individual self-discovery and self-expression, but we should not blind us to the reality that almost all of us are not on a unique, singular mission."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"But ads in real life do not prevent me from going on about my day. There is no analogy to interstitial pages with ads like in Forbes some time ago with the button Continue to your article: it would be infuriating if you had to view an ad before being able to use the subway ticketing system. You also don’t have ads on at the airport timetable screen. You don’t have pinkertons following you to learn your habits and show you “relevant” ads. If you walk into a grocery store wearing sunglasses, the clerk will not stand in front of you and say “I am sorry, please remove your shades before continuing because ads support our store and you need to see them.”But yes, unhealthy amount of advertising IRL should be limited as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I cycle to work on an ebike. About 25 km each way. One of the major issues is the lack of proper infrastructure and awful attitude by drivers, in particular service drivers.Advertisement company vans are a prime example. There are rolling advertisement posters  in most bus stop shelters. These drivers will park up on the footpath blocking pedestrians and those using the bus to update the advertisements, often in the mornings during rush hour. They will park on the cycle lanes and force cyclists out into fast moving and unaccommodating aggressive traffic.The same goes for delivery drivers. Legally they are permitted on double yellow ‘no parking’ lines on the street but the perception is no not hinder car traffic so they park up on the footpath instead.During the pandemic there was a lot of temporary work on cycling infrastructure, mostly lazy efforts such as painted cycle lanes and plastic bollards. These drivers simply drive over the bollards or if wide enough down the protected lane. If you challenge them they are verbally abusive.The attitude of all persons in a mechanically propelled vehicle is that this is not their fault. They are just doing their job. Their companies trot out the tired line that they take safety seriously bla bla bla…So in regards physical advertisement is public space, for me this is a symptom of a wider problem of perceptions of ownership of our cities public space. We forget that cities are for people. We let cars dominate the majority of the available space. We let oversized vehicles make deliveries in medieval city streets. We use cars for short inappropriately short journeys such as for bringing our kids to school, often because it’s too dangerous to let them walk or cycle because there are too many cars.We need to start treating our cities like parks with a focus people and figure out ways to remove ICE powered vehicles and limit the space all vehicles occupy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Advertising as it is done presently has at least three faults, which is just as much a fault with the ethics of society for allowing this to go on:- adverts seeks to hijack your attention away from whatever you were doing, which is a mental burden resulting diminished performance (in the case of a work environment), is downright dangerous in the case of traffic environments and lessens the enjoyment in the case of leisure activities.- there is little to no ethical restriction on content; the advert that gets displayed is likely not that of the best product: it is the one whose owner paid the most money, and the ad that gets the most traction is the one that tells the best story, so perfused with lies by omission and other forms of deceit that we don&#39;t even notice any more.- the ubiquity of ads causes an perpetual escalation of the struggle for  attention, to the extent that we might credibly expect to get ads implanted in our brains eventually if we don&#39;t say enough is enough.The solution seems simple enough to me: we need to establish a code of conduct for advertisers which at the core means that they may no longer shove ads down our throats at every junction; instead adverts should be freely displayed in separate spaces (like a dedicated page on each website) where people voluntarily could look for products and services that they need (or just to browse), much like the ad pages in newspapers of days now long gone by.All we need is a mechanism that promotes this behavior, and sanctions breaches."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Ruby now has “punning.”&gt; Values in Hash literals and keyword arguments can be omitted. [Feature #14579]&gt; {x:, y:} is a syntax sugar of {x: x, y: y}.&gt; foo(x:, y:) is a syntax sugar of foo(x: x, y: y).This is going to be controversial and take some getting used to, but I think eventually everyone will love it. It’s not an easy syntax to learn - I remember when this came to JS it took a while to get my head around all the different ways this shorthand was used in the wild.It’s hard to come up with new syntax that can peacefully coexist with the established language. I think in hindsight it would have been helpful for Ruby if it had done something like square braces instead of brackets for hash literals, or not allowed brackets for blocks. The most ambiguous syntax all involves hash literals vs blocks… this adds to that cognitive load.But typing out a long hash literal just to capture a bunch of local variables or methods is so common, and the duplication is quite annoying, so on the whole I’m glad this was added and am sure I’ll use it a lot :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It’s surprising and disappointing to me that this—titled “ADHD Accommodations Guide”—buries accommodation recommendations under sub-links and all of the remaining content is advice for, presumably, those of us with ADHD who are trying to work around lack of accommodations.That said, there’s plenty of good advice even if it’s a little inconsistent. It’s also fascinating how much the social part overlaps with challenges faced by Autistic people[1].For ADHD folks who find some of the advice on multitasking/focus in meetings wanting: it’s absolutely okay to stim (perform some stimulating, often repetitive action) when you find your ability to stay focused isn’t what you need or what’s expected. I have a reputation for spending most of my time in meetings playing minesweeper. It’s not because I’m not engaged, it’s because it helps me stay engaged. I happily stop or mute my mic if the clicking sound is disruptive, but otherwise I’ve continually established with teammates and even clients that having that part of my focus on something mostly mechanical helps me stay in the conversation and productive.1: Which I increasingly feel confident in the idea that there’s no meaningful distinction and ADHD should/likely eventually will be considered part of the spectrum, but that’s not why I’m commenting."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a useful post, thank you.I have only recently become aware of what it means to try to work with someone who has ADHD. I’d heard of ADHD but I didn’t know what it was or what the implications were.Then, a project went terribly terribly wrong. I tried to make sense of it through empathic modelling of my colleagues circumstances, but this only made it worse. I was baffled by that, which is when I realised I needed more information about ADHD, because just placing myself in my colleagues shoes didn’t help when we were using very different thought processes.Without a model of ADHD thought processes my attempts at empathy were counter-productive.I’d try to put myself in my colleagues position in order to understand my colleagues feelings but because we have different thought processes this didn’t work at all.I think I’m seeing the limitations of empathy for the first time. Until I have a better working understanding of ADHD, articles like this with practical tips are my best guide."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The thing that most (if not all) people who have ADHD want is to be normal. This works against them, similar to other people with disabilities, in that asking for accomodations feels like admitting defeat. Like you will never make progress in your lifelong struggle. Like you have an incurable disease.While it&#39;s cool that workplaces can make such accomodations if requested, it would just be better for fucking everyone if these were available to everyone. That&#39;s the real problem with being disabled: you&#39;re treated abnormally.Sure, there will always be exceptions, but just recognize humans are not fungible, and be kind. Don&#39;t make folks lives harder than they already are."</p>
