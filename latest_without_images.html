I’ve spent many hours over the years messing with setups to resolve bugs caused by python scripts picking up the Mac OS python install rather than the user-installed version.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I remember walking around a trade show in the early 80&#39;s and doing something similar.  It was a &#34;HP Microwave Symposium&#34; and aside from lots of good talks and papers, the exhibit hall had lots of high dollar HP (later Agilent/Keysight) RF test equipment.  One of the items on display was a HP8566 spectrum analyzer which had a (primitive by today&#39;s standards, but) &#34;smart&#34; display capable of drawing vector graphics, time-linear graphs, and text.  After using one on my own for a while, I had become curious about the display so I had learned everything that I could about it.  So down on the exhibit hall floor, I walked up to the instrument while the sales guy was proclaiming how great it was (which was true) and I entered eight lines of code (about 30 keystrokes).  Then I pressed the button to view trace C (which most people still don&#39;t know about) and up popped a rolling blinking text display of my name.  Most of the people nearby were impressed, but since the instrument was no longer displaying the RF spectrum that the sales guy was talking about, he said; &#34;I know how to fix that.&#34; Then he walked over and pressed the green &#34;Instrument Preset&#34; button, which the HP documentation said would always restore the instrument to a known starting point.  When the display did not change, the sales guy yelled at me; &#34;WHAT DID YOU DO?!?!?&#34;  (My program was in Trace C of display memory, which is not initialized by the Instrument Preset function.)  So after watching him panic for a moment, I walked over and swapped traces B&amp;C (shift-key followed by the swap A&amp;B button).  Now my program was in trace B (and blanked) so the screen returned to normal.  Everyone was relieved!  So just before walking away, I swapped my program back into trace C, viewed trace C, and hit the green preset button again.  As I walked to the next exhibit, I saw him cycle the AC power to the instrument in frustration."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My FBI file was for hacking into my school district&#39;s AS/400 that handled my school&#39;s attendance and grading system.  Somehow using a public IP address with no access restrictions allowed a clear telnet path in from home.  Compounding username and passwords that were all the same for every employee.  I didn&#39;t change a thing, just LOLed and told someone.  Bad mistake. 
This was the late 90s.Oh well, 2 week suspension and kicked off the computers for less than a year.  A nice conference with FBI, police, my parents, IT and school administration.  Fun times.I learned my lesson to not talk about such things because their egoes were too fragile.When they decided to give students in their website design class ftp accounts on the district wide web/email server running an ancient version of Debian, they didn&#39;t disable the shell, just added a login script to a menu for pine, etc. for people who telnetted in, which I&#39;m sure the sysadmin was proud of.  However, a few fast CTRL-C&#39;s broke out of his script menu loop and got me a shell, and they didn&#39;t shadow protect their password files.  Ran it through john the ripper and had half the district&#39;s e-mail passwords in a default dictionary file including the root pw in a few minutes.  LOLed and never told anyone about that.Good times, the 90s...."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A person I know studied in East Germany in the early 80s via a very limited exchange program. After the wall came down, she requested her Stasi file.It was fascinating what was in the file - lots of misunderstandings and misinterpretations. For example, she was upset when the Challenger exploded, and this mystified the Stasi informers who had previously identified her as a pacifist (in their minds, the Shuttle was 100% military).Similarly, she was trying to research what happened to a relative who had remained in Germany in the late 30s, and whether she had died of natural causes or been sent to the camps. The Stasi file was filled with speculations on the details of this &#34;sleeper agent&#34; with whom she was trying to establish contact.All this to say that from the mindset of a spy, everything is spy-craft. Everyone&#39;s world-view shapes their interpretation of events and reality itself. Was the shuttle a military venture? Partly. Was it also a tool for science? Yup. But the functionaries who looked at her data in the heat of the cold war certainly couldn&#39;t see those distinctions.For what it&#39;s worth, she was able to get her Stasi file, but has never been able to get a copy of her FBI file."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This story (assuming it&#39;s true) should serve as an excellent example of why you need privacy even if you think that you don&#39;t. In peace time the NSA is only looking for &#34;terrorist&#34; and leaves everyone alone, but in case of war they would start creating lists for any and everything. All it takes is one &#34;tough&#34; agent trusting their gut feeling/algorithm based on your browsing history and shopping habits to put a target on your back and you are done.EDIT: Replacing &#34;if there&#39;s any truth to it&#34; by &#34;assuming it&#39;s true&#34;. I did not mean to imply that the author made up the whole story and thought both expressions were equivalent."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have over 20 years of Linux/FreeBSD sysadmin experience ranging from universities to major silicon valley companies in both cloud and on-prem.When it comes to companies I mostly support cloud these days but when it comes to me and my family I accept every downside and host as almost all of our digital lives in a 42u rack in a gutted closet in our house with static IPs and business fiber.I know where our data lives and no one can access it without a warrant and my explicit knowledge. I also save myself several hundred a month in third party cloud provider fees to host the same services and can reboot upgrade or repair anything whenever I want, but in general no more maintenance than cloud servers . I also never end up with exciting bills when experiments are forgotten about.You pretty much get all the pros and cons of home ownership. For me it is mostly pros. Also keeps me dogfooding all the same practices I recommend to my clients."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When my SaaS app started scaling, I saw how badly cloud can be priced if you have even slightly unusual use-cases. It occurred to me that instead of spending ~$600/mo on GCP, I can invest in a $3000 PowerEdge server with much better hardware, run it out of my home office, and it pays for itself in less than a year.Running your own server is an investment that doesn&#39;t make sense for everyone. If you can get it, it is better than you might imagine. Being in full control--the master of your own destiny--is so liberating and empowering. It feels the difference between constantly ordering Lyft/Uber/riding with friends, vs. owning your own car.Not to mention, again, my hardware resources are so much better. This one server can run multiple profitable SaaS apps / businesses and still have room for experimental projects and market tests. Couldn&#39;t be happier with my decision to get off the cloud."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A very weird thread that degenerated into: &#34;PaaS vs self-hosted/self-owned hardware&#34;.I&#39;m pretty sure most people sysadmin&#39;ing their Linux servers are actually doing it with rented dedicated servers.  TFA btw specifically mentions: &#34;don&#39;t manage physical hardware&#34;.  Big companies like Hetzner and OVH have hundreds of thousands of servers and they&#39;re not the only players in that space.They don&#39;t take care of &#34;everything&#34; but they take care of hardware failure, redundant power sources, Internet connectivity, etc.Just to give an idea: 200 EUR / month gets you an EPYC 3rd gen (Milan) with shitloads of cores and shitloads of ECC RAM and a fat bandwith.And even then, it&#39;s not &#34;dedicated server vs the cloud&#34;: you can have very well have a dedicated server and slap a CDN like CloudFlare on your webapp.  It&#39;s not as if CloudFlare was somehow only available to people using an &#34;entire cloud stack&#34; (whatever that means).  It&#39;s the same for cloud storage / cloud backups etc.I guess my point is: being a sysadmin for your own server(s) doesn&#39;t imply owning your own hardware and it doesn&#39;t imply either &#34;using zero cloud services&#34;."</p>

The revenue comes from hardware sales.  You&#39;re usually offering the driver to the public for free on your website anyway.  Why not simply open source it?If you open source your driver, community developers could potentially give you free help -- e.g. porting to Linux, getting into the mainline kernel, fixing bugs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There are a lot of fancier note taking tools but I keep going back to Zim. Been using it for years for private offline note-taking for work. I use quick notes and journal shortcuts many times a day to quickly jot down a followup note/idea/question in meetings. It&#39;s also my GTD system with tasks plugin. Love that it&#39;s just text files so I can manually edit them, version control, sync in private cloud service, etc. Never worry about losing my data.There are a few quirks I&#39;ve gotten used to over the years though:- Pasting code will be garbled or auto-create tags unless you use the source view plugin or paste verbatim.- Takes a little configuration out of the box to get just right, system dependencies, links opening in right browser, plugins, shortcuts, fonts. But once you get streamlined it just works.- The syntax feels a little strange to me but I rarely need to edit raw files. I could also export to Markdown if I ever wanted to migrate.My last tip, templates are awesome. I have ones for all kinds of things, like interviewing, 1-1s, and architecture design outline."</p>

  2. Notes can be arranged into arbitrarily deep tree. Single note can be placed into multiple places in the tree. (Think soft-links)     
  3. WYSIWYG support (CKEditor)   
  4. Tags, advanced scripting features    
  5. Other ususal wiki stuff like backlinks, note-map etc

Cons:  1. Electron.

But any language will work.Examples..lets see.  I add todo items from anywhere (including phone) with email. I use Blitzmail on the phone and an IMAP script on the computer to send myself a tagged email, then I have another script to check and parse and add them to Zims &#34;Journal&#34;My personal website is in Zim.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Like many people back then, I also found the whole proof-of-work / blockchain concept to be interesting from a theoretical computer science / distributed systems perspective.But these days, I can&#39;t help but think that we&#39;ve inadvertently created a paperclip maximizer without even bothering to create an AGI first. Humans are the AGI, and we&#39;re going to happily use more and more energy to play this stupid game for as long as it looks like there&#39;s a profit to be made, even if the global outcome is to our own detriment.If we want this mess to go away, we need to find a way to change the incentives globally."</p>

For example, he talks about how terrible Tether is and then completely ignores USDC. He also claims that none of the popular blockchains can scale, but Solana is frequently in the top 5 most popular cryptocurrencies.It seems to me that people that do an hour of research are polarized hard. Either love it or hate it. The more time you spend understanding the space the more nuanced it becomes. Many are using the technology to facilitate scams and overpromising, but that doesn&#39;t make the technology fundamentally useless or bad."</p>

Apple will use its market power and money to get support from all sorts of &#34;friends of the court&#34; as well, possibly even ridiculous astroturfing organizations. But it won&#39;t be able to counterbalance the support Epic received from 35 states, Microsoft, the EFF, and America&#39;s most cited and most authoritative antitrust law professor. It will probably be easy to see for the Ninth Circuit that those who support Epic do so because it&#39;s the right and necessary thing to do, while those who will support Apple are just going to have reasons to do Apple a favor.Update: The U.S. federal government has now filed a brief as well:&gt; The United States enforces the federal antitrust laws and has a strong interest in their correct interpretation. The United States files this brief, pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 29(a)(2), to address errors in the district court’s analysis of the Sherman Act, which, if uncorrected, could significantly harm antitrust enforcement. The United States takes no position on the merits of the parties’ claims.Further analysis on the government’s brief specifically: http://www.fosspatents.com/2022/01/biden-administration-back..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t really care about Epic (because they are far from being a dream company you are likely to sympathize today - they hardly care about anybody&#39;s rights actually, just about their own revenue) but once I have an iPad/iPhone I want alternative browser engines, terminals, emulators/VMs and being able to write and run an app of my own without having to even inform (let alone pay) Apple about this. I also believe 30% is too much for an app developer to pay the device manufacturer anyway."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Apple&#39;s 30% revenue cut is absurd rent seeking behavior. Good on these states. Let&#39;s keep it going and continue to dismantle similar systems at other companies.Apple can continue to mandate Apple payment options are as an option in every app, but let&#39;s watch as that 30% drops to nothingness once they face real competition."</p>
