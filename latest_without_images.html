								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not trying to defend TP-Link or anything, but I recently bought a pair of mesh router from them and they work very well.BTW, this hidden network probably uses another protocol (for the OneMesh). It is the 802.11s (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11s), that uses its own encryption method based on Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE) (yeah, that is the same as WPA3, however it came before it). It shows as hidden network on Wi-Fi Analyzer, but the network is not actually hidden in the same sense of a hidden Wi-Fi network: this simple happens because 802.11s has no concept of SSID.The authentication of new devices happens when you pair a new router using the application available on Android/iOS (it has a web interface too but AFAIK it doesn&#39;t allow adding new mesh routers to the network). So it seems pretty secure for me, at least sans some security bugs that I am sure that the device should have. Doesn&#39;t bother me too much considering that most bugs that I saw on those consumer routers generally comes from the security from things like administration pages and not the Wi-Fi network itself (unless it is something like KRACK that affects all devices implementing the protocol).Yeah, it is still pretty sh*t that they enable this by default, but if the router from the author of blog post is from one of their lines of mesh routers I do think this is kinda of made by purpose, because using multiple routers devices is kinda of the idea of a mesh network."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This type of whackery is (the primary reason) why I try to buy computing devices on which I can flash a clean OS (OpenWrt/DD-WRT for routers)[1]. It sucks because it limits my choices down to a few, but at the same time I feel like I don&#39;t throw out money at abandonware.[1] don&#39;t even get me started on TP-Link releasing routers with the same name but v2/v3/2020/2021 update where it&#39;s hard to even know if I&#39;m buying the one that supports the custom OS flash."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those curious about the &#34;Wi-Fi spam&#34; comment: even though nothing is connected to the network and it&#39;s a hidden SSID, it still has to broadcast beacons every 100ms. The 802.11 standard says beacons must be sent at the lowest rate the AP supports, so your ~350 byte beacon at 1mbps (2.4 GHz) uses around 5% of the frequency. It doesn&#39;t take many SSIDs on the same 2.4 GHz channel to make the throughput fall through the floor. Beacon spam is one of the reasons why 2.4 GHz is practically unusable in dense environments these days.Thankfully for 5 GHz this isn&#39;t as bad since the lowest rate is 6mbps and the signal penetrates less. Some routers have the option to disable 802.11b which raises the minimum 2.4 GHz beacon to 6mbps as well, but unless everyone does this it won&#39;t make much difference."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This may be unpopular, but after using Kodi and similar software for many years (and enjoying it!), I just gravitated back to the basics. Want to watch a movie? Navigate to it in my file manager and play it with VLC. Music? Just use Winamp 2 or Audacious. I realized I was messing with odd HDMI passthrough issues, database issues, audio sync, broken plugins, stressing about tagging, etc etc every movie night much more than just enjoying my media. My friend (Plex and Kodi user) had the same issues, we&#39;d usually spend an entire beer at the start of the evening troubleshooting things. The most lasting thing from those days was setting up a proper NAS, first to house my media, then everything else.The main thing I miss is wireless controller support, but KDE Connect on my phone has completely obviated that. It even integrates with streaming sites, youtube, VLC, Audacious, almost everything that exposes a media API. So I can sit on my couch or walk around and control my KDE machine with minimal effort. My PC audio playback even pauses when I get a phone call. If I need more control I can use my phone&#39;s screen as a touchpad mouse. You can&#39;t easily remotely compose playlists with this setup but I usually listen album by album or on global shuffle, and that&#39;s good enough for me.Am I just old school? What are people&#39;s favorite &#34;killer apps&#34; for software like Kodi? Is it just convenience and I&#39;ve have had bad luck?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I honestly can&#39;t keep track anymore. I&#39;ve used plex for a number of years and it&#39;s &#34;fine&#34; but they keep spending time developing things I don&#39;t want and ignoring things the community would like in an effort to &#34;go commercial&#34; and &#34;legitimatize&#34;.I want a media center that can do these things:- access from phone or tablet: remote is nice to have, but on my own network is a must- can chromecast everything- can scrape metadata reliably (I don&#39;t mind fixing a few things here and there)- supports movies, tv shows, random videos- automatic subtitle downloading- supports music formats, podcasts, and audio books and understands they are different things, and can grab them as needed- supports not only mp3s, oggs, etc. for music, but supports stuff their underlying media libraries already support like amiga mod, chiptune formats etc. (a major gripe of mine with plex). right now I need to convert to mp3 for this need, but the media libraries plex uses already supports these formats, it&#39;s just the damn gui and library indexing bits don&#39;t- support for photo libraries- ebooks, pdfs, cbz, cbr, etc. (I need extra apps for this)- emulator support would be a super sweet stretch goal- has smart tv apps would be also great, but chromecast support is fineDoes Kodi, emby, jellyfin, whatever support all this?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So why does Europe have such hard time popping new software ventures like the US? Is it market fragmentation? Languages? Is it capital allocation related problems?I feel that the ability to bootstrap projects in all the large EU countries is way harder than the US, or smaller euro ones (like the Netherlands or Estonia).In Spain for example, the cost of something similar of an LLC is way higher than in the US, not to mention that you have to pay almost 400€/month (at minimum) just for owning the company as Social Security fee, even if I&#39;m also working for someone else paying my social security through my salary.It&#39;s a huge burden if you&#39;re in my situation, which is having an average salary, not a lot of savings and you don&#39;t have a family that bails you out.Also, this listing lacks a few more that I listed here: https://iagovar.com/mapas/european-web-hosting-alternatives"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not sure if it&#39;s listed or not but one I&#39;m pretty happy with is smallPDF based in Switzerland. 
https://smallpdf.com/I got pissed off when I wanted to rotate a PDF 90 degrees on my dad&#39;s computer and adobe wanted to charge for it, then I found that smallPDF could do that and a whole lot more like edits and signature collections. I ended up subscribing him but the free tier already does several things that adobe would charge you for so I encourage anyone to use this service."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why does the US dominate digital products?1. Enormous internal market2. Extremely wealthy3. Well-developed capital markets for investmentSo it&#39;s an enormous, wealthy country where there is lots of investment. Obviously there are other factors but these seem blindingly obvious as starting points.I find the UK&#39;s inability to compete with the US web giants depressing. I don&#39;t like the idea of relying on a few American companies for search, cloud infra and so on. I&#39;d love to see us build a British Google for example. I don&#39;t like the guy at all, but I agree with Dominic Cummings that we should focus our efforts on something like this.I&#39;m not arguing for web service nationalism but, for economic and security reasons, way more nation states should be looking to encourage the building of their own web backbone companies. It would also be good for general Internet resiliency to not have so few companies and single points of failure."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In a sense Microsoft forgot its own learnings. Because of exactly things like this they prevent UWP apps from connecting to localhost by default and make it very annoying to circumvent and from my experience, the circumvention is not exactly a stable setup. So they really don&#39;t want you to do that, and somebody thought enough to make it extra difficult. So, they have UWP, all those well thought-out policies, then make an editor ecosystem out of web technology and throw everything out of the window. No surprise from a $T company with more teams than countries on Earth that not everything is coordinated, but they should have a guy with the required knowledge and sensibilities on any major product team. Apps installed from their &#34;store&#34; are relatively safe, but then they put a (extension) store inside their app again, which is unsafe :/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Issues like this have been repeated countless times in various IDEs, debugger interfaces and local services using browser as UI. Developers need to stop using network sockets as IPC channels for local services unless browsers significantly increase the restrictions on cross site requests. Similar situation with regular CSRF attacks. And it needs to be opt out not opt in. As long it&#39;s a responsibility of developer to implement proper authentication checks for something they consider a local service vulnerabilities like this will keep appearing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m all for this if the person reviewing my code will know the context, history and all the details and conversations we had as a team. 
But in order for that to work, I&#39;d probably be taking most of this reviewer&#39;s time. And obviously in order for them to get up to speed with our practices, conventions, architecture, code style and whatnot, they&#39;d probably need to start by doing a whole lot of development on our project first. At least several months. They could probably not do anyone elses code review then. So we&#39;d have to pay them... one full time salary to be this coder-and-reviewer type person. I wonder what this service should be called.I think I might be onto something here. &#34;Full time developers as a service&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This entirely misses the point of code review.Say it with me: Code review is a knowledge transfer exercise.Finding bugs, security vulnerabilities, and keeping the code maintainable are merely side effects that we appreciate along the way.The primary purpose of code review is increasing the bus factor of the given piece of code and facilitating organic knowledge transfer. That&#39;s it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Having on-demand engineers look at code, without broader context on the project it is in my view the same as something that can be automated either or both via static analysis and custom ci/cd workflow checks. This can probably makes sense on a project with more junior engineers where many basic improvements can be supposedly suggested without needing broader context?
