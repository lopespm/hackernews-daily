								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I started building Bun a little over a year ago, and as of about 20 minutes ago, its in public betaOne of the things I&#39;m excited about is bun install.On Linux, it installs dependencies for a simple Next.js app about 20x faster than any other npm client available today.         hyperfine &#34;bun install --backend=hardlink&#34; &#34;yarn install --no-scripts&#34; &#34;npm install --no-scripts --ignore-scripts&#34; &#34;pnpm install --ignore-scripts&#34; --prepare=&#34;rm -rf node_modules&#34; --cleanup=&#34;rm -rf node_modules&#34; --warmup=8
        Benchmark #1: bun install --backend=hardlink
        Time (mean ± σ):      25.8 ms ±   0.7 ms    [User: 5.4 ms, System: 28.3 ms]
        Range (min … max):    24.4 ms …  27.6 ms    76 runs

        Benchmark #2: yarn install --no-scripts
        Time (mean ± σ):     568.4 ms ±  15.3 ms    [User: 781.6 ms, System: 497.4 ms]
        Range (min … max):   550.8 ms … 604.5 ms    10 runs

        Benchmark #3: npm install --no-scripts --ignore-scripts
        Time (mean ± σ):      1.261 s ±  0.017 s    [User: 1.719 s, System: 0.516 s]
        Range (min … max):    1.241 s …  1.286 s    10 runs

        Summary
        &#39;bun install --backend=hardlink&#39; ran
        22.01 ± 0.85 times faster than &#39;yarn install --no-scripts&#39;

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a shame proprietary Discord is their only communication option, and proprietary GitHub their only Git mirror. They&#39;re even advertising the Discord in the CLI (https://github.com/Jarred-Sumner/bun/blob/e4fb84275715bb4de4...). Also the shorthand syntax `bun create github-user/repo-name destination` is favoring users choosing GitHub above others instead of not favoring any specific Git forge (the best path I&#39;ve seen is how nixpkgs supports github:u/repo gitlab:u/repo sourcehut:~u/repo etc. to shorthand popular options but not favoring any, while still being flexible enough to continue extending)."</p>

The grants for the science of ecosystem stewardship are in the 10k-50k$ range.Over the past few years, something killed over 5 billion giant starfish and “science” has no idea what did it. Without the starfish, the sea urchin population exploded, turning kelp forest into desert.I love the LHC. But we need to seriously grow the science pie and prioritize the science of ecosystem collapse and management. There simply aren’t enough trained scientists."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s several very good provisions in this legislation (3rd party payment processors, non-preferential treatment for 1st party apps), there are several that have a mix of upsides and downsides (sideloading is one--I personally like knowing that Facebook can&#39;t ask people to sideload some privacy destroying crap on iOS).Then there&#39;s:- Allow developers to integrate their apps and digital services directly with those belonging to a gatekeeper. This includes making messaging, voice-calling, and video-calling services interoperable with third-party services upon request.- Give developers access to any hardware feature, such as &#34;near-field communication technology, secure elements and processors, authentication mechanisms, and the software used to control those technologies.&#34;Apps will use near-field communication technology and other mechanisms to track us (consider how many device related APIs have restrictions in web browsers for just this reason), and I think it&#39;s credible that the interoperability requirements are going to be used to smash end-to-end encrypted messaging. You can have a decentralized end to end encrypted protocol. Can you retrofit every existing messaging service to use it in the short-term? Probably not.As an end user, the things that give developers maximum freedom are not necessarily the things that let me use my device with maximum freedom. I support people who want a FOSS device that is in no way locked down. I just don&#39;t want that, because I don&#39;t want to play systems administrator for an always on tracker in my pocket."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is huge. Forcing Apple to allow app side-loading, third-party payments, etc is going to wrest away control of the iOS ecosystem (and eat pretty heavily into their revenues [1][1] https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/10/apple-implies-it-generated-r...I hope some of these regulations spill over into the U.S. and the rest of the world."</p>

Sad that being in UK probably means we&#39;ll ignore it because &#34;Brexit.&#34; I got a text the other day telling me that, since we&#39;ve left the EU, roaming charges are back. Hurray!Without making this about politics, this is a great step forward. Still unsure how Apple &amp; co. will make their proprietary video and messaging platforms &#34;interoperable&#34;. I doubt they&#39;ll be writing an RFC any time soon."</p>

I&#39;m not naive enough to believe I wasn&#39;t being recorded previously, but I can&#39;t help but find this trend of sticking a camera directly in my face whenever I&#39;m trying to make a purchase extremely insulting and violating to my sense of privacy. Now after watching this I have almost no doubt that facial recognition software is installed on these systems.I&#39;ve spoken to other people about the rudeness of this but most people seem to think it&#39;s fine. Perhaps I&#39;m just weird and more bothered about this stuff than most people. If sticking a camera in someone&#39;s face when they&#39;re trying to purchase something in a pharmacy isn&#39;t going too far though I do wonder if the average person would really care about anything presented here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was initially put off by the webcam permission requirement, but the terms and conditions page says it&#39;s basically an art project and they don&#39;t send any data off (unless you explicitly accept it at the end) so I gave it a chance.I&#39;m glad I allowed webcam permission because it was an interesting, informative, and fun look at biometric tracking.Apparently I&#39;m &#34;violently average&#34; which is not a way I would previously have described myself. According to this site the most unusual thing about me is that I read the terms and conditions before ticking the &#34;accept&#34; box."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think many people commenting on the model making bad predictions are missing the point.
The speaker argues that even though models are known to be inaccurate, companies like tinder or insurance companies might still use the model outputs since they have nothing better. 
Therefore, in some future (or already today?) you can suffer from bad model predictions because you are &#34;not normal enough&#34; for the model to make good predictions, and might therefore receive a wrong predicted life expectancy and higher insurance bills."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Ultimately companies that abdicate their informatics operations like this will give their profits to their data-center operators, who will be empowered to charge them whatever price they want.  Because what&#39;s their BATNA?  Migrating from Azure to AWS when Microsoft doesn&#39;t want to let them?Renting your information infrastructure is a great way to reduce startup costs, but down the road, that information infrastructure runs your company.  Trying to outsource it is like trying to outsource upper management.To be clear, I&#39;m not saying that the optimal amount of cloud services for an established company like FedEx to buy is 0.  They bring in management consultants, too.  But it sure isn&#39;t 100%."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Making accurate calculations of data center cost is of course complicated and rarely manages to take everything into account, but the common knowledge I’ve heard is that there comes a point when a company is so large that going on-prem is what actually saves them a lot of money.If FedEx is not large enough to be one of those companies, how large do you actually have to be? Or has cloud pricing changed to the point where this is no longer true, and even huge corporations can save money in moving away from their own premises?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Its weird to have companies say they&#39;re moving from Mainframes to the Cloud.The Mainframe is a sort of cloud, each one has usually double the spare capacity and you call IBM to unlock it.The cost of running a Mainframe is measured in terms of MIPS based on amount of compute used and there&#39;s compute reserved for offloading things like JITs (zAAPS). Essentially a version of cloud compute costs.I can understand if you&#39;re locked into COBOL with EBCDIC and can&#39;t find talent, but Z runs freaking Ubuntu now! I know IBM works furiously on modern ecosystem support.Not shill for IBM, but what exactly is it that they&#39;re expecting to be so different from their cloud migrations? Or is everyone here caught up in the &#34;Mainframe old&#34; falsehood."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Academics are not the place to go to make useful novel contributions, there are too many confounding factors.  First, the university owns whatever IP you come up with, and will happily exclusively license that IP to entities with no interest in developing it.  Monopolistic corporate power centers aren&#39;t known for fostering novel competition to their established businesses.  This is why it took so long - and serious capital - to get something like Tesla going, as the likes of Toyota, Ford, GM etc. were closely tied to Exxon, Chevron etc. via their investors, and had no interest in developing electric cars.Any kind of applied research in the US academic sector these days is best understood as corporate R &amp; D for established interests in pharmaceuticals, technology, industrial chemistry, etc.  You&#39;re certainly not free to do blue-skies renewable energy research (budgets for that are still miniscule at best, and have been since the 1980s), for example.  The job description has become indistinguishable from that of in-house corporate researcher - narrowly defined assigned problems are what you get to work on, and &#39;academic freedom to pursue the research wherever it leads&#39; is a quaint myth.The obvious fix is to eliminate exclusive licensing of academic IP (i.e. repeal the 1980s Bayh-Dole Act), which would force corporations to spend capital on their own private R &amp; D divisions if the wanted exclusivity, and simply make any university-held patented discovery available to any entrepreneur who wanted to develop it for a small flat fee.Until then the author is 100% correct about entrepreneurship being the only way out of the trap."</p>

Furthermore, the article says that &#34;he dropped out of high school to become a poet,&#34; but please note that, a number of students drop out of high school in South Korea to fully focus on the college entrance exam, in hopes of getting into better universities. This is not uncommon at all. And sure enough, he got accepted into the best university in South Korea, majoring in astronomy and physics. One of his classes was even taught by a Fields Medalist. If this is his definition of &#34;being lost,&#34; I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ll ever be found."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This passage caught my attention:He proceeds just as deliberately when doing mathematics. Wang was shocked when he first witnessed it. “I have this math competition experience, that as a mathematician you have to be clever, you have to be fast,” he said. “But June is the opposite. … If you talk to him for five minutes about some calculus problem, you’d think this guy wouldn’t pass a qualifying exam. He’s very slow.” So slow, in fact, that at first Wang thought they were wasting a lot of time on easy problems they already understood. But then he realized that Huh was learning even seemingly simple concepts in a much deeper way — and in precisely the way that would later prove useful.Having gone through the American education system, I felt like I was in a factory being evaluated as a potential end product. Steamroll through as much material as quickly as possible. Optimize behavioral patterns for the next performance metric. Rinse and repeat. Is this really the best system we can come up with? Can the pace of mathematical and scientific advancement be optimized by steamrollers? I wonder how much potential we&#39;ve missed as a society because the education system has been trying to force everyone through the same hole, and destroying intellectual curiosity in the process.Personally, my experience with this educational system turned me off from &#34;math.&#34; It was only much later in life when I learnt that the mindless algorithms that I had to personally execute for years on end to get into university could barely be considered math at all. Only then could I begin to appreciate how elegant real math could be. And I doubt I&#39;m alone in my experience."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The nationalization of news and politics in a country of 330 million people is toxic. We’re one country but we don’t share a single set of values. Even the notion of “blue America” and “red America” is misleading. What would be unremarkable in San Francisco would raise eyebrows in Baltimore.I noticed this acutely living in Atlanta for the better part of a decade. Politics was not a big deal when I lived there. Atlanta was “blue” and the rest of the state was “red” but politics was forward looking and productive. The mayor when I was there, Shirley Franklin, was truly put the city above partisanship. A Democrat, she endorsed Mary Norwood, an independent, in 2017, because the Democratic candidate was a protege of a mayor she believed to have been corrupt: https://www.wabe.org/former-atlanta-mayor-shirley-franklin-e.... She waved aside criticism suggesting that she (a Black woman) should have endorsed the Black Democratic candidate instead of Norwood, a white woman.Then in 2018 all hell broke loose when Georgia’s governor’s race became the subject of national attention. The state became a battleground in a proxy war between New York and Mississippi. Racialist rhetoric reached a fever pitch in the New York Times and Washington Post (but notably, the Atlanta Journal Constitution was far more prudent). They made Georgia out to be an unreformed Confederate backwater, instead of a state that’s the destination for huge numbers of Black residents leaving California, Illinois, and New York, attracted by plentiful jobs, low taxes, and an excellent public university system. The national media completely misrepresented Georgia and the people in it to the rest of the country."</p>

NBC doubles up as Axios’ media partner.&#34;https://marketrealist.com/p/who-owns-axios/Not only that, people employed by today&#39;s media conglomerates are increasingly drawn from the &#39;wealthy liberal coastal elite&#39; sector and are typically filtered through an unpaid internship process before getting hired, leading to non-representative &#39;journalists&#39;, which is probably doing as much damage (i.e pushing the populist perception of news media as a symbol of out-of-touch elitism) as the corporate consolidation is.Another side effect of this trend is the death of investigative journalism, which generally upsets the state and corporate power centers who are increasingly joined  at the hip.  For example, the last Washington Post investigative series of note was &#34;Top Secret America&#34; from about a decade ago, and now that Jeff Bezos owns the paper and AWS is actively seeking CIA and NSA contracts, forget about anything else like that."</p>
