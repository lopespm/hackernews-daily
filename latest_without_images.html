								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The article buried the lede, which I think is this-- Google as email provider had information all along that DMCA notices it was sending to its YouTube property were not legitimate.  Google even went so far as to flag and reject some of those notices because of false personalities, but instead of going to the root cause to stop abuse of its systems it allowed the same user to plug along long enough to manipulate YouTube in a way that caused Bungie an alleged $7.6m in damages.  Then the icing is that when Bungie came knocking Google initially resisted a court-related request to allow Bungie to identify the user and stop the abuse.  Wow."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A side note that I found particularly interesting&gt; On March 22, the Reynolds account logged out of Google and less than a second later, the Wiland account logged in, suggesting the same person was behind both accounts.I&#39;ve always wondered how often timing analysis is used in practice by surveillence big tech. I suspect that as people become more privacy aware, and start using VPNs, pseudonames, multiple accounts, etc, that big tech will start using timing analysis more and more to correlate traffic and identify users. Like if your friend sends you a Reddit link on WhatsApp, and you immediately open it in your browser, that Reddit session is now linked to you.Another more complex example: let&#39;s say Google has already identified your Reddit account. You open a Reddit discussion, and deep in the discussion it links to a Youtube video, and you open it in your browser. Now even if you weren&#39;t logged into Youtube, Google could guess that it&#39;s you based on the timing of when your Reddit account opened the discussion, and when the linked Youtube video was accessed. And not just that video, but now every Youtube video watched in the same browsing session, is now linked back to you (assuming you have first-party cookies enabled, which is basically required if you ever want to log into anything).Seems a bit paranoid, but I actually suspect this happened to me a few months ago. I was using a FOSS reddit client and clicked a youtube link buried deep in a reddit thread, and opened it in Newpipe (a FOSS youtube client). I wasn&#39;t logged in, and was using a VPN, and yet the next day on my Youtube feed I started getting recommendations based on that video (and those recommendations were very different from my usual ones). Scary stuff."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Its funny how people are siding with Bungie that Google should have given them the details but these same people complain about google knowing too much about them and its privacy implications. From the looks of it Google did the right thing where it comes to siloing data of different departments. Youtube dmca should not know the ip address of someone that send the email using gmail that is the correct way to go about it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I did a digital detox in July of 2020, I had become overwhelmed with Discord and Reddit moderation and trying to Keep Up. I burned out hard. I turned off all electronics for a month and uninstalled the apps and restricted my phone use to calls and responding to 3 close friend&#39;s texts at a set time each day--I didn&#39;t keep it on me at all. No video games, no TV, no watch or music streaming. I had my library of local music loaded to my trusty Zune and used that exclusively for music as the only device I carried with me.I read through the entirety of the Percy Jackson books and the Heroes sequels, the Mortal Instruments, the Seven Realms Novels, and the complete unabridged HHGTG. All it took to get my book-a-day self back was bringing myself back to my teen years when I wasn&#39;t allowed on the computer with access to the internet and my texts cost .3 minutes to read or send and I only got 100/mo. I was averaging roughly 350 pages per day.When I wasn&#39;t reading I was drawing or writing or outside being active when it was cool enough which improved my mental health even in spite of my heat based SAD.At the end of the month I had the attention span when I got back online to attend to a cross country move and secure a job and an apartment by the end of August. I had been intending to move for the 3 years prior.I wonder how I could go about taking advantage of the burst of creativity and focus while still being online enough to develop some of the software ideas I have that I never follow through on without getting overstimulated and distracted."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; When I pulled up at a stoplight waiting for the light to change, I would instinctively reached for my phone (mounted on my dash) to check my email (personal + work), check ESPN, look up something on Amazon, etc. While pumping gas in the car, I’d whip out my phone while waiting. Stuck in line somewhere? Time for my phone. Waiting in an elevator? The phone. Riding the train? The phone. Going to the bathroom? Make sure to bring the phone! Eating breakfast? The phone. Any spare or idle moment? The phoneThis describes every single person I know under the age of 25, and I&#39;m in that demographic. It must be the single greatest public health experiment of all time.The crazy part is, not one single person I know thinks of it as a bad thing. They just seem to accept it as part of life, which makes me feel so alienated whenever interacting with them, since I am hardly ever using my phone (the computer on the other hand...)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Hari&#39;s book connected with me in a deep way, which is why I was drawn to it, page after page. Hari explains that &#34;wherever my generation gathered, we would lament our lost capacity for concentration.&#34;As a member of a generation that can still focus, i.e., one not born into a world of personal computers, let alone pocket-sized ones, nor &#34;tech&#34; hype, I hope the author and his peers^1 figure out that this &#34;economy&#34; needs to be &#34;disrupted&#34; sooner rather than later, no matter how profitable it may be for a chosen few.1.  And the other people doing most of the work to &#34;build&#34; these distractions and the people being targeted with them.It saddens me that many members of older generations, who did learn how to focus, have decided to go along for the ride with the younger ones into this attention span abyss.  IMHO there are substantial &#34;life skills&#34; that are being lost due to &#34;tech&#34; hype and money-making.  We cannot expect younger folks to understand what they are, as the mindless &#34;tech&#34; hype ceaselessly commands their attention above all else.  Money-making no matter what the cost to society.  These disappearing life skills have value, e.g., ability to concentrate, ability to evaluate facts and think critically (cf. simply voicing uneducated opinions and complaining about anything and everything to the internet), ability to deal with conflict, and so on.  The OP managed to remember the value of concentration, so perhaps anyone can do it.  Please do not give up.  That is exactly what the &#34;tech&#34; companies want you to do."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I developed the first native C++ compiler around 1987, I thought I&#39;d better check with AT&amp;T&#39;s lawyers if I could:1. sell a C++ compiler2. call it C++Their lawyer was very nice, and said sure. He also laughed and said he appreciated that I was the only one who bothered to ask."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"People questioning whether the lawyer really had the power to block this don&#39;t know how legal departments in big corporations work, as others have pointed out.A lawyer usually cannot get in trouble for saying No. They can only get in trouble for saying Yes. They feel they&#39;re doing their jobs by saying No and they&#39;ll also use the phrase &#34;out of an abundance of caution.&#34;The lawyer&#39;s supervisor is very rarely going to overrule him or her and say Yes. They will just say &#34;it&#39;s their case, they&#39;re in charge.&#34; They defer to each other that way.This probably seems excessively cynical to you. Indeed it doesn&#39;t always turn out this way. Sometimes rationality prevails."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This stories reminds me of the times before tech dominance, when programmers and innovators needed to get permission to do almost anything. Tech people were not allowed to run companies, or even manage people -- you needed MBAs for that.Anything &#34;disruptive&#34; would be immediately shut down and threatened from the dominant industry. Anti-societal violence in video games were under constant protest (like the original Grand Theft Auto, or Mortal Kombat), and don&#39;t even think about trying to start a business like Uber or Spotify.New file formats could be immediately crushed by IP concerns. Even web pages posting content about circumventing current systems or linking to sites like that were targeted. If you weren&#39;t a big player, you didn&#39;t have any way to accept money (besides asking people to mail you checks).While tech is seen as too powerful now, I think it&#39;s at least nice that we no longer have the anxiety that plagued any idea or project in the past. You don&#39;t have to worry about going to jail for programming crypto code, or be unable to find a hosting provider for your website that shows scraped public data."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I find people are religious about being git cli purists and only interacting with it in this black box (the terminal). On top of that a lot of people stop learning git after add commit push pull branch and merge so concepts like rebasing and cherry picking are scary.
In this day and age we have state of the art GUI tools that change the game and allow git users to see and interact with the state of a git repository in real time. It&#39;s a great way to demystify things like rebasing and interactive rebasing because they show you what&#39;s happening in a modern UI designed specifically for git.
I often suggest git CLI purists to get something like git kraken and just use it as a visual dashboard. Watch what happens when you run git commands. You can see everyone else&#39;s remote branches and have a much better idea of what&#39;s going on than you can without it.  
I&#39;ve worked on teams that just didn&#39;t rebase at all and I think people are oblivious to the mess they make on branches with their chaotic merge strategies.  
These days, I tend to envision the state of the branch that I want and make that happen. It&#39;s so easy to create a new branch before I do anything that if I think something might go south, I just hard reset to my previous state (a branch I created right before the operation)  
Gitkraken also has an undo button that handles all sorts of scenarios and I rarely click it without getting exactly what I expected."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My mental model of a git repo is basically a bramble bush with labels on it.The bramble stems and branches are the commit history (which may join and well as split, unlike a bramble). The labels are stuck to particular bits of the bramble. Some labels are even stuck to other labels!You can move the labels around, and you can glue extra bits of bramble to the tips of what you have. You can even hack about with the bramble, but this is not recommended. Label moving often happens automatically, e.g. when &#39;growing&#39; a bramble tip.It gets interesting when you compare two brambles (e.g. remote and local repos). You might determine that one bramble is identical to another, just with the labels moved. Or one bramble is the same as the other but with extra stems added. Or both brambles had a common ancestor bramble, but now they both have extra stems. Or perhaps they are completely irreconcilable.Better visualisation tooling would help."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This book changed me. I was an idle eight year old, and my school didn&#39;t give us homework to do. So my father decided to set me homework of his own devising, which on one occasion was reading Flowers for Algernon.I was moved by the story of a man who had little natural ability, straining to make the best of what he had. Then becoming smarter than everyone around him, and then what follows.There&#39;s many things to take from this story. I took away that we should make the best of what we have. To do otherwise is to miss out. Never take what you have for granted. Everything is a blessing; don&#39;t waste it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I collect a lot of certs for fun, but most have not been helpful. I still like to collect them anyway.I think OSCP was the most legitimately useful in tech https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/PMP has been useful to take on Project Manager roles, but really PrM roles aren&#39;t all that exciting to begin with. Still helps when you want to run your own projects.I&#39;m currently studying to be a certified parliamentarian from the National Association of Parliamentarians. I&#39;m interested in corporate governance and learning Roberts Rules of Order definitely helps.I&#39;m also a certified farmer (yeah its a thing), I have 5 sailing certs, 3 scuba certs, Wilderness Emergency Medical Responder cert, working on my pilots license, getting my real estate sales license, ham radio operator general class, almost done with my CDL, there&#39;s lots more I&#39;d have to check my notes on.I do want to get a Kubernetes cert done this year. Long term I want to knock out my CPA/CFA exams, but those are a huge commitment so we will see if it pans out.Most of this response hasn&#39;t answered your question at all, because certs really are mostly useless. Still fun to collect.I&#39;d imagine financial certs would be the most useful (CFA in particular).If anyone knows any other fun certs let me know."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This will not apply to all companies, but for our hiring decisions certs have an adverse effect. If someone puts many certifications on their resume my expectations are lower and I likely won&#39;t consider them for interviews. It&#39;s a negative signal in my experience. Your time is better spent working on side projects, contributing to open source, writing a blog, etc. I.e. do real-world stuff instead of wasting time on artificial tests that require memorization and exist largely as a revenue stream for certification providers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"MCSE really helped me.In the late 90s, 98 I think, I worked for an internet startup that didn’t end up being huge. We were on Novell and a bit if solaris and had just launched a product that used windows nt and server side activex.I was a college dropout web dev/web master making $50k. They had a hard time hiring devs who knew nt and could design and automate server farms. I learned on the job and did an ok job running it. But they wouldn’t promote me because I was really young and didn’t have a degree.I went to a Microsoft conference and would buy a study book each day and take the test there. I did 3 exams during the conference and took the other three when I got home and with all 6 certs got my Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer (with a stamp of bill gates’ signature).They gave me a raise to $60k (and the college grads went from 50-55). I then got $70k six months later and $80k six months after that as I was the “certified person.”I always thought it was funny that I did the same job before and after the certs. The Networking cert was really useful and I still remember how to do subnets and dns and dhcp and stuff."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Anecdata: exercise massively reduces my otherwise constant craving for processed sugars, deep fried and smoked or cured things, alcohol and smokes.I&#39;m not less hungry, but I&#39;m less hungry for nasty stuff, so from my perspective there seems to be a lot of truth in this!Context: I&#39;m natively extremely lazy (phisically, not intellectually), I find any phisical activity a pain an a nuisance, I derive zero pleasure from any kind of sport and phyisical exercise (except hiking and skidiving, but not the phisical effort aspects of them), the release-endorphines-on-effort circuit is 100% broken for me or I just lack the receptors for those endophins... eg. 100%-lazy-cat except not fat because genetically I come from a line of people slim-no-matter-what-we-eat. (Probably more average or atletic people&#39;s bodies just don&#39;t work like mine...)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Although this is my guess based on experience, I think said anti-hunger effect can be had without intense exercise.  I&#39;ve noticed consistently that walking has an anti-hunger effect.  Walking does take more time than running, but it doesn&#39;t really register as stress to the body in the same way that running and other forms of cardio do, meaning a lower cortisol response.  Maybe it&#39;s not as strong an effect as with something like running, but I think it&#39;s worth observing and considering.  In weighing the pros and cons, I think that walking is better in terms of longevity.  Cortisol and stress on joints are things you don&#39;t really want."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article mentions that a substance (lactose-phenylalanine) appears
after exercise in several animal studies. There&#39;s a suggestion of a
strong connection of this to reduced appetite. But this isn&#39;t
explained and more importantly there&#39;s no hypothesised mechanism. Why
would it be a metabolic advantage to reduce hunger after exertion?
Maybe it creates a buffer-period. Otherwise, common sense/intuition
would say we feel hungrier after exercise. What gives?"</p>
