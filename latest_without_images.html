								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wow, we made Apple blink. I did not see that coming. People like me who sold their iPhone and cancelled all services probably are a drop in the bucket, but it looks like the general public and the news picked up on this enough to get the ball rolling to make them step back. So now the question is in what 15.X update do they just sneak it in."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In my opinion, Apple will break its brand if they actually go ahead and release &#34;self-reporting to the authorities&#34; device features.Even if they somehow manage to make it do exactly the thing it is supposed to do and not slide into a feature for mass governmental control, I think a lot of people will loose trust into the devices they own.Automatically scanning your stuff and reporting the bad things to the police is like the concept of God always watching. Even if you don&#39;t do anything wrong and you agree that the stuff they are watching for is bad and should be prevented, there is something eerie about always being watched and controlled.The iPhones should mind their own business and leave the police work to the police.That being said, I would be O.K. if the scan is performed on the device upon physical access by the authorities. You caught someone, You have enough evidence to investigate the person, you are allowed to search his/her home then maybe it can be O.K. to run a fingerprint scan on the phone to look for evidence."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For everyone who is saying that the technical community “won”... Nobody’s been fired. Rather, Apple’s senior execs publicly doubled down and basically labeled those of us who thought this scheme to be insane, as a bunch of uninformed idiots...You can change a product decision in a day, but it takes a LONG time to change a culture that thinks these sort of insane product decisions make any sense whatsoever. Making a long-term bet on Apple has become precarious at best."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been using this for a while. Very, very, very handy for- Just exploring some code.- Quickly pull up as reference code w/ decent navigation without having to checkout locally or navigate forward/back in the source tree in GitHub.- When reviewing PRs and wanting to check out some surrounding code that is not part of the actual PR.- If you want to quickly commit something really small and trivial in master/a branch/a PR without having to do the whole stash/checkout/pull/change/commit/push rigmarole (like if you&#39;re in the middle of doing something else).Things that are very annoying:- Some of the most used VSCode hotkeys are browser hotkeys, like Ctrl+T, Ctrl+P, Ctrl+Shift+P etc. The functions aren&#39;t even rebound to anything else, they&#39;re just not available via hotkeys.- Some extensions are not available, especially ones that (partially) may rely on some kind of local binary. I understand that, but that also sometimes rules out extensions that could partially work. Example: none of the Zig extensions work because they reference tooling binaries, so I can&#39;t even get syntax highlighting of Zig code. You could argue that&#39;s an extension packaging issue, however. That&#39;s fair.- The PR reviewing UI needs a lot of work, because right now it&#39;s not as good as the normal GitHub UI, so currently, for larger PRs, I need to have both UIs open.I hope in the future you can save a gist or something with custom settings/hotkeys/extensions to load. I&#39;m sure they&#39;re working on something like that.Update: Oh, there actually is some form of settings sync. Have to check that out."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"After reading the article one thing that struck me was the &#34; internal candidates who were rejected after interviewing with the hiring manager were half as likely to exit as those rejected earlier in the process.&#34;Working at a fortune 100 top 10 company I&#39;ve applied for multiple higher level positions after 5 years and multiple high marks on my reviews and not gotten 1 recruiter call. I did get with one recruiter and he told me one of the positions was actually only posted for someone internally and they didn&#39;t even interview anyone else. My resume looks good according to them its unclear why im being passed over. Ive not even gotten an interview and if i did i think i may feel like staying and trying to continue to pursue opportunities possibly.Its essentially soured me on company though - they have all these &#34;raise my hand&#34; type crap saying i want to be considered as a viable candiate for opportunity. They have multiple manager tools to flag people for opportunity which my manager has done for me. Yet here i am - ready to move up - put my 5 years in doing excellent work - and left hung out to dry when I&#39;m ready. So I&#39;m on the verge of moving elsewhere and my boss being &#34;shocked&#34; I&#39;m looking elsewhere and saying if I find anything else let him know and he&#39;ll see what he can do - well that ship has sailed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think hiring externally is often over valued in many organizations today.There is a number of reasons for this, but one is that if you hire someone external they are more under your control than an internal hire who already has ideas of how things should work and relationships and therefore has their own amount of political clout. A new hire has no reputation to lean on so must be a bit more cautious at first.Another reason is that there is a “grass is greener” mentality. You know what you like and don’t like about an internal hire. You don’t know what you like or dislike about the external hire yet, not really. Additionally, someone from outside may have the silver bullet to solve X,Y, or, Z problem that no one else can seem to solve. You know your internal candidates don’t have the quick easy solution you want, but maybe this new person will!** hint: They don’t."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Required reading for every technical leader: https://randsinrepose.com/archives/shields-down/&gt; Resignations happen in a moment, and it’s not when you declare, “I’m resigning.” The moment happened a long time ago when you received a random email from a good friend who asked, “I know you’re really happy with your current gig because you’ve been raving about it for a year, but would you like to come visit Our Company? No commitment. Just coffee.” ... Your shields are officially down.&gt; Your shields drop the moment you let a glimpse of a potential different future into your mind. It seems like a unconsidered off-the-cuff thought sans consequence, but the thought opens you to possibilities that did not exist the moment before the thought existed.&gt; Every moment as a leader is an opportunity to either strengthen or weaken shields. Every single moment.As a CTO of a young company, I start many mornings thinking about my team&#39;s shields. Am I asking them to focus on projects or parts of the stack they don&#39;t find interesting, or being less proactive than I should be in unblocking their needs? And most importantly, am I staying true to our values and providing them the transparency they need? Because if we get to the point where the OP article is, where team members want to find a different team, there is no other tech team they can transfer to, so their shields being down becomes a critical vulnerability! There&#39;s a balance, of course, and some weeks are just too chaotic to be perfect at this, but I try as much as I can. I like to think that this is also the type of environment that makes people the most creative they can be - it&#39;s a win-win for everyone."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Is GateBoy a perfect simulation of a Game Boy?&gt; Actually no, for complicated reasons. The Game Boy chip has a handful of logic gates that operate independently of the master clock and whose exact behavior depends on things like gate delay. These gates create glitches that depend heavily on the physical placement of the gates, the silicon process used to make them, and other weird things like temperature and voltage.This is fascinating, I previously would have assumed that a gate-level simulation would necessarily be perfect by definition."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is very impressive!The creator—Austin Appleby—also created MurmurHash, which is very useful for data structures like Bloom filters. The canonical MurmurHash implementation was released with a handy non-cryptographic hashing test suite.https://github.com/aappleby/smhasherThanks for your work, Austin!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What a marvelous project! The amount of efforts that the author put into this project makes my jaw drop.This project reminds me of a question I&#39;ve had in my mind, though. If this world is a simulation, would that be an accurate simulation of the elementary particles and their interactions (like this project), or an appropriated one (like normal Game Boy emulators)?"</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28405847">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"“We conclude that piracy and similar competitive shocks push firms to innovate to stay ahead of imitator products, and that this effect is moderated by their existing patent portfolios.”I guess it’s good to study that this is the case, but isn’t this exactly why companies fight piracy and attempt to patent and then enforce those patents? That is to reduce competition and make it easier to extract value from what they’ve produced?Basically, isn’t the premise that if privacy was rampant and patents didn’t exist then more people and companies would be able to innovate on the technology without fear of a lawsuit? I think of how stagnant the Eink space is, and how much broader usage might that technology get if it wasn’t encumbered by patents (just one example)?I guess I just don’t find this surprising."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Second, we build a dataset that matches the financial information of publicly traded software firms with (1) R&amp;D expenditures and patent, copyright, and trademark counts, and
(2) a unique dataset of pirated software.&#34;That&#39;s fine, but they&#39;re measuring what can be measured easily and calling it &#34;innovation&#34; (at least in the headline), rather than anything meaningful. Having more patent filings doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re &#34;innovating&#34; more. Nor does spending more on &#34;R&amp;D&#34; which is mostly just an accounting convention.At two companies, I worked on getting more patent filings, because that was seen by management as The Thing To Do. In both cases, we would ask the engineers &#34;what have you done lately?&#34; and then decide if any of that might be patentable. Usually this involved paying a bounty to the &#34;inventor&#34; if a patent application was filed, and another if the patent actually issued (4-8 years later).In one case for awhile (Google Maps), they were actually paying people a bounty for submitting an idea for a patent, even if no application was filed! I was on the committee that decided if the idea was (1) great, file for sure, (2) pretty good, maybe file, (3) OK but don&#39;t file, or (4) so bad you don&#39;t even get the idea bounty.  (*Full disclosure: I&#39;m pretty sure this system isn&#39;t in effect anymore.*)

I&#39;ve written elsewhere [1] about the dubiousness of software patents, so I don&#39;t need to explain how they have nothing to do with &#34;innovation.&#34;[1] https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2399580"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"S. Korea gaming industry once suffered a lot from piracy in 90s. This was a main driver of their rapid transition toward online gaming. In fact, one of the earliest graphical MMORPG was invented by Nexon (a year before UO). Coincidentally, Nexon is also the inventor of loot box which becomes their dominant business model. And I think not many people prefer this over old fashioned game packages.So yeah, piracy could corner industry to &#34;innovate&#34; their product and business model in order to survive. But it&#39;s not guaranteed to be in a societally beneficial way."</p>

Other emoji have clear shapes, but not enough internal detail to understand what they mean. this is especially problematic with a set of non-Android, non-Twitter, non-Apple emoji, where users haven&#39;t learned the shapes yet, but have to go by looks. It looks like the creators of this project wanted &#34;function over form&#34;, or at least &#34;form follows function&#34;, but in their pursuit of Bauhaus they accidentally ended up with Droodles."</p>

Application developers are your users. If we application developers took offense every time a user tells us that things are not working, we&#39;d be pretty pissed off all the time. Educating and empathizing with your users is part of your job.2. Talking about how it was better before: QA teams sure do buffer a lot of crap. They also cost a bunch and slow down time to release. Yes agile is causing problems. The bureaucracy and stiffness of organizations before agile was no nirvana either.3. By your own affirmation you treat applications as black boxes that should be deployed using a runbook that should just work. This is ridiculous. Application&#39;s ownership is shared between everyone who works on it.4. And yes, as developers, networking or physical drive space are things that we tend to abstract away. Maybe if the infrastructure people were involved in development discussion earlier, they&#39;d be able to raise their hands and say: wait a minute, you&#39;re going to blow up our logs.This all feels like someone who used to not do anything suddenly being asked to take part in what&#39;s happening...EDIT: apologies for the strong language and sounding like an asshole myself, but I certainly feel irritated when someone takes the time to write a 5000-word article complaining about whiny developers who thought they could own ops but actually don&#39;t know anything and scream for help when they themselves are the cause of all evil."</p>

I keep having to tell junior devs to actually _read_ the fine error message, just in case it actually _contains information about the error_, you know. Not that it seems to help much, it’s like they can’t get the concept into their heads.This is 100% a problem with younger, bootcamp-”educated” devs, in my experience. I know the common wisdom on social media is ”no one reads text anymore”, but if that includes aspiring developers, it might be tough to replace the current workforce when that day comes…"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the article starts with complaints about incompetents devs, then it heads towards complaining about automated QA, increased complexity and faster paces.In the end, overall, it sounds like an incompetent ops, who is unable to keep up with the pace of this industry, complains about incompetents devs and that industry does not wait for people to catch up.These are all wrong.Complexity comes with valid reasons. High demands thin out the pool of competent devs/ops. We, the lucky bunch who earns 2x-3x salaries of other professions, should be the most humblest bunch, especially if there is frustration within ourselves about the fast growing reality."</p>
