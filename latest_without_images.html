								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; They already host source code of millions of apps. Release integration should be trivial to implement.Release integration is trivial for anyone. It&#39;s the easiest and most irrelevant part of the app stores.&gt; Unlike Google they actually listen to their users. They were awesome during youtube-dl debacle.And controversial on others, like shutting down Popcorn Time&#39;s repository. As any other, they&#39;ll listen if there&#39;s enough outcry.&gt; Backed by Microsoft. Microsoft has been playing good by the developers for years now. I trust them more than Apple and Google.This is situational and opportunistic. It can change any day. In fact, managing an important app store is exactly one way to re-(un)-balance this relationship.&gt; They could finally give the desktop the app store it deservesMicrosoft won&#39;t have GitHub compete with the Microsoft Store and its newer efforts like winget. It would unermine their unifying vision that has been in the works for years for no benefit.&gt; This is a minor but users will be able to raise issues with developers directly instead writing comments over app pages which I think you would agree completely suck.Sure, lets pipe user feedback directly into GitHub issues. Good luck with that if you have a hundred issues a day.I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a single angle that would paint this as a good idea. Phone manufacturers like Samsung are in a much much better position to try. And indeed they have been trying an failing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sounds like a great way to create incentives that undermine githubs mission while simultaneously taking a huge amount of developer resources for a product that will have niche interest at best.Building app stores is hard. Moderating app stores is hard. Both are significantly different from running GitHub.While I appreciate the author&#39;s intent here, this just doesn&#39;t feel like it was deeply thought out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Or we could just stop using app stores.Honestly, I&#39;ve yet to find an argument for the existence of an app store that holds water. Let people install what they want. Provide reasonable paths to update and upgrade and cut out the middle layer.The layer of control that Google and Apple exert over people is anti-competitive. But the answer isn&#39;t competing app stores. I don&#39;t need someone to tell me what I can or can&#39;t install on the operating system on my device."</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25979673">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Everyone assuming a conspiracy theory needs to read this.Keep in mind that Robinhood also gives everyone a margin account by default. They also let people invest on margin before their inbound bank transfers arrive (Robinhood Instant). The influx of new traders sending money to Robinhood or selling other stocks to buy GME quickly drained their credit lines, reducing the capital they had available for collateral.Keep in mind that when someone sells a different stock to buy GME in the same day, they&#39;re buying GME on margin. Stock trades don&#39;t settle until T+2, so any new purchases using those proceeds are done on margin.This was a capital crunch at Robinhood due to an unexpected herd of new traders all looking to do the same thing in unison. It violated the assumptions of their business model, and the only way to keep the platform from grinding to insolvency (or violating regulations) was to slow down the unexpected event by slowing meme stock purchases.Is it really so hard to believe that such an unprecedented mass movement would break the underlying business assumptions of a pre-IPO startup that was heavily dependent on their credit lines?The biggest problem is Robinhood&#39;s poor messaging. It&#39;s clear their highest priority was to avoid admission that they were running out of money. They didn&#39;t want to trigger a bank run or shake the confidence of their newly acquired users, so they tried to obscure the message as much as possible. As a result, the popular narrative assumed some sort of evil conspiracy theory."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t buy the suggestion that DTCC deposit requirements left Robinhood and other brokers unable to facilitate all transactions. It is a backwards rationalization, trying to put technical reasons to a fear-driven decision.First of all, they limited opening trades for all accounts, not just accounts buying on margin or with unsettled funds. If you have a cash account and you buy a stock, your broker has plenty of time (2days) and plenty of funds (all of them) to clear your trade.Secondly, many brokerages only blocked options transactions. These don&#39;t clear through DTCC at all. They clear through OCC and net purchases of options actually capitalize the clearinghouse and can in some cases actually be advantageous to the broker by getting their accounts long premium (if the broker is net short premium, the OCC charges them more).It&#39;s more likely that the brokerages didn&#39;t have enough staff to reconcile the trades, or that Robinhood&#39;s fake margin accounts (Robinhood Instant) left them in a position where they had to choose between telling people that they have to wait for funds to settle, or limiting trades.Any brokerage that limits trading in an asset for which the exchanges and clearinghouses are functional is harming its customers by preventing their market access. Weird hand-wavey apologetics about the DTCC or OCC don&#39;t explain why the retail brokerages had to limit trading in cash accounts."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">",,Robinhood legally could not submit trades on $GME until they could muster the deposits for GME that they needed. &#39;&#39;This sounds like a liquidity issue, but Robinhood&#39;s CEO said in the interview that there was no liquidity issue.The why doesn&#39;t matter at this point because Robinhood CEO was caught lying by contradicting himself."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I realize this is a site about the past, but I really hope this is the future. I want an internet of specialty sites, browsable curations, diversity of offering, freedom of choice, and full of the quirky/unusual. It might have to do with growing up in the 90s and experiencing that kind of world wide web, w/o walled gardens.Several years back, perhaps even via an HN post or comment, I came across a blog, hosted on a university network (IIRC, perhaps related to media studies). The page consisted of a group of possibly graduate students contributing some of the weirdest and most obscure media I&#39;ve ever seen online. Nothing obscene and nothing seemingly new/current, so it was rather hipster in that sense, but I kick myself for not having saved the URL.Nothing says I need to use walled gardens or get my news from the big networks, but I often feel I&#39;m being pointed that way. In the end, I just want something different than what&#39;s usually being served up.(It doesn&#39;t escape me that this 90&#39;s TV site is full of walled garden/big network type content of the time)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I tried polyphasic sleeping for a while when I worked at an IBank. I remember it as one of the most productive periods of my life but it was incredibly anti social and got the strangest looks from management.I&#39;d do 35 minute naps with an alarm at 0430, 0830, 1230, 1630, and without an alarm at 2030 and 0030 (on the basis that I thought my body would sleep through if I was &#34;doing any damage&#34;).It made going out at the weekends or playing poker in a casino incredibly difficult so after 3 weeks I had to pack it in.I was lucky to live a 5 minute, folding, bicycle ride from the office but I also had a little card I&#39;d leave on my desk for the corner that said, &#34;I have not collapsed I&#39;m having a nap.&#34;The one thing I&#39;ve kept from those days is that I still wear a sleep mask to bed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I use this concept of a &#34;billable nap&#34; ... it gets to the midafternoon and I&#39;m deep in a programming problem, and my thought process gets far too fuzzy.  So I can either spend a couple of hours or more struggling through, or I can shut my eyes for a bit  20 minutes idelally, and then nail the problem down in a much shorter time than without the nap."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find if I&#39;m working on a difficult problem, I feel like I can make more rapid progress if I take a &#39;nap&#39; early afternoon in that post lunch drowsy period. I often start thinking about the problems again immediately on waking, and typically find that is the most productive period in terms of breakthroughs and making mental connections.I put &#39;nap&#39; in quotes because I don&#39;t set an alarm (unless there is specific need to), and for me that usually means a 2 hour sleep! I figure that is made up of 90 mins of one sleep cycle, and some time either side for falling asleep and waking.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_cycleAll made possible by pandemic working from home."</p>

					<h3><a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/6/e2008389118">Personal experiences bridge moral and political divides better than facts</a></h3>
				</div>
				<div class="story__comments">
					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25963589">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s interesting to me that this delineates between facts and personal experience as if personal experience doesn&#39;t occupy the same space as facts. Perhaps a more useful way to think about people&#39;s relation to truth is one of proximity. For a given individual, their personal experience is entirely factual, and because it is also most proximate to them, it is weighted the most highly. Intuitively, I think we understand this, so we tend to weight other people&#39;s experiences similarly, knowing that those are as proximate to them as our experiences are to us."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Key point:&#34;The problem is that facts—at least today—are themselves subject to doubt, especially when they conflict with our political beliefs (21). In the past decades, America has seen a decentralization of news and information (22) that has allowed people to gather their “own facts” (i.e., alternative facts; ref. 23). Most recently, claims of “fake news” allow people to distrust any information that fails to align with their political beliefs (24, 25) and to trust fake news that aligns with their beliefs (26).&#34;This is the epistemic crisis we&#39;re currently facing. Up until about the late 70s we had 3 news networks that were all pretty much middle of the road politically. Newspapers could have more of a discernible political leaning, but even there most of the mainstream ones we&#39;re pretty centrist. People who hewed to an extreme political position in either direction were ostracized and thus had a very small audience. We had more of a common narrative which is now gone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A personal experience is a fact. It is a fact we can be pretty sure of, and we know the context of that fact. Obviously, once we extrapolate from that experienced fact, it becomes bias.A fact that is not a personal experience is difficult to trust. Even if I trust the source of that fact, I am often not sure if I understand the fact properly. Anyone who has ever tried to understand a math theorem might relate.It is entirely rational to trust more in your personal bias. In fact, I would argue that the only way to trust a fact is to make it somehow into something that you can personally experience. For example, to understand a math theorem, it helps to look at lots of different kinds of examples where it holds (and where it doesn&#39;t)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As I write this, I am attempting to reduce the number of licenses allocated in the Adobe admin portal.After hunting through the site, it appears easy to add, but impossible to remove licenses without going through sales support (instant response with a human), who then transfer you to the &#34;Cancellation Team&#34; which are remarkably hard to find online and have not replied to previous attempts at cancellation.This is my third try, and the wait has been ridiculous.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I believe this kind of thing is a big contributor to Amazon&#39;s hegemony in online shopping. I&#39;m reluctant to order from other sites because there&#39;s a whole new set of dark patterns I may fall victim to. At least I&#39;m familiar enough with Amazon to know I&#39;m not getting charged for things I didn&#39;t intend to order, the low stock warnings are somewhat legitimate, etc. I&#39;m not saying Amazon doesn&#39;t have its own issues, but at least it&#39;s a known quantity.If it weren&#39;t for Amazon&#39;s dominance, other sites would be able to compete without resorting to these dark patterns, so this is a self-perpetuating cycle: people only shop on Amazon -&gt; the only other sites that can survive are the ones that engage in deception -&gt; trust in non-Amazon shopping sites decreases -&gt; people only shop on Amazon -&gt; ...I don&#39;t mean to cast these scammy shopping websites as victims. My concern is more about how the legitimate sites that could exist don&#39;t because they&#39;re crowded out by Amazon (and other big players like Walmart) and the scammy shopping sites this article discusses."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is interesting - I feel like the site should separate dark patterns that add information from ones that lie or obfuscate. In my experience, consumers feel differently about these categories.I&#39;ve sat in on a few dozen user research sessions for ecommerce. This was qualitative research that included their general shopping habits, and additionally testing new features. The most interesting thing that I learned is that consumers (a) are generally pretty aware of when they&#39;re being pressured, and (b) are fine if it&#39;s transparent and accurate.A classic example of this were low-stock notifications. The shoppers were generally okay with being told that something was low stock if that was really true. Many people could name specific items they lost because they were sold out. Some could also name instances of when they had bought something &#34;1 item remaining&#34; and seen it on sale the next day. They preferred having the information because it helped them make an informed decision. It turns out that lots of people browse the same items for a while, and use sales or almost-out-of-stock as a &#34;now or never&#34; moment.The most interesting user session I ever sat in on was for a countdown timer for a sale ending. The designer refused to design it at first, and then was like, &#34;fine, I&#39;m going to design the hell out of this and then show you in user research that nobody wants this.&#34; And then she showed it to 5 people in user research, who were generally okay with it on the condition that it counted down to the actual sale ending. Some said they actually liked knowing, because when they&#39;re just looking on their phones they might not be in a good position to buy it, and want to know how much time they have later to get it. They said that they&#39;ll often refresh the page to see if the timer resets, because if it starts ticking from the same time, they feel like the site is just scammy and they&#39;ll leave.Anyways, I&#39;m not trying to defend lots of these patterns. Most of them are clearly wrong, and the ones that I mentioned above can also be used to lie and deceive. But I wouldn&#39;t put them all together - in my experience, consumers generally want accurate information even if they&#39;re aware that the company is doing it to pressure them."</p>
