On 64-bit linux, this is 8, but on windows, it&#39;s 4.  Well, &#34;on windows&#34;... maybe this throws all the APIs that make such assumptions, uh, out the window, (puts on sunglasses)."</p>

I get that the outer layers will have burned in the atmosphere, but inside is still intact. Is this useful because we suspect the surface contains different materials?

This can go wrong even at large companies.  At Netflix we once had a billing issue and it took a while to even notice, because no one in the company was paying for it (it was just free for everyone), but it looked like just general attrition, not people slowly having failed payments.After that incident, the company gave everyone a $16/mo raise (which is what it cost to have streaming and DVDs at the time) and then asked us all to set up our own payment.  The goal was to have everyone paying and hopefully using different payment methods, so that if something went wrong at least a few employees would be aware of it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So far, everyone growing vertically is growing crops that are almost entirely water because they&#39;re the only things that grow fast enough to turn a profit. They then sell them to rich people who pay 5x for taste and the feeling of eating local. It&#39;s a quality-differentiated product, not a solution to food scarcity or security.Until someone can grow cash crops, vertical isn&#39;t gonna make a dent, and it&#39;s gonna be really hard when competing with the free rain, free sun, and insane automation available for field agriculture already. Even Plenty with SoftBank&#39;s extra &#39;nutrients&#39; tops out at strawberries. See https://www.eater.com/2018/7/3/17531192/vertical-farming-agr... for some raw data on unit economics.One application of vertical that does make sense to me is as a community hub or a public health initiative around healthy eating. See https://www.thegrowcer.ca/ who makes container farms for isolated communities in northern Canada and measures success by community outcomes and entrepreneurs inspired, or https://farm.bot/ which encourages hardware hacking and food supply awareness."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It outproduces salad, but not potatoes, wheat, and most of all humus. Also the need for heavy machinery has a real cost in green house gas emissions (same issue as with electric cars).There are real ecological services provided by a healthy land and natural agriculture that can&#39;t be provided by such food factories.As @systemvoltage wrote, this is good for a heavily centralized system that&#39;s owned by big corporations looking for big profits but that&#39;s not a solution to the global environmental and soon to come (and it&#39;s already here for a lot of us) food/water crisis."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unit costs of goods sold would be interesting, compared to &#39;traditional&#39; classic modern intensive farm price.An observation from the article also could be answered: what areal space is required to generate the power?Neither of these are meant to be thunderclap proof-it-fails critique, they&#39;re just interesting.In food miles, freshness and lack of need for water, fertiliser and pesticides its winning hands down for feeding its urban population surrounding it. Repurposed brownfield site, existing buildings would also reduce impact.I fear a loss of jobs and richness in ag. Supporting towns. Jobs are empowering, even crap ag. jobs but a reality here is that farming is overwhelmingly industrialised and jobs are either kept in the family or massively exploitative piece rate so this isn&#39;t a killer argument against either, but I do worry the rural area depopulation is a continuing trend."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article is not great, it reads too much like scaremongering. But the underlying problem of PFOA/PFOS is real. The article fails to mention that most chemical companies have been phasing out these chemicals for several years.There is a pretty good movie about this topic, Dark Waters. The movie is well informed, largely accurate, and more factual than this article. The main protagonist of the movie is actually Robert Billott, the author of this article.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Waters_(2019_film)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fluorocarbons are ubiquitous. Fluorocarbons are basically magic when it comes to repelling water.Nordic skiing (and to a lesser extent, downhill skiing) have been going through a bit of a reckoning trying to remove them from competitions. Fluorowaxes are very effective for gliding quickly in wet conditions. The fact that they are melted during application makes them particularly pernicious.Fluorocarbons are also ubiquitous in water repelling in clothing. Some of the more expensive brands of outdoor wear have moved to shorter chain fluorocarbons, but they haven&#39;t eliminated their use. From Arcteryx: &#34;... non-PFC [water repellant] treatments... have fallen short of the level of performance and durability we deem imperative&#34;. It&#39;s likely less urgent with clothing, since these compounds are quite stable when left alone at normal temperatures."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Oakland relaxed a lot of zoning, and permitting regulations about 5 years ago, and so now you&#39;re starting to really see production sky rocket. This article [0] mentions 2019 was had 15x more units completed than 2018. And 3x the total units from 2013-2018 combined. Anecdotally, I have several friends who&#39;ve all moved to Oakland in the last year or so.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Don&#39;t ask, Don&#39;t get.Everyone I know who has asked for a discount has got the discount.After several months of the pandemic, and noticing the adjacent apartment being relisted by my landlord at a discount I emailed my landlord and asked if I could have my rent adjusted by the same discount. They said yes, if I committed to another years lease.Saving 5% of rent, at the cost of a one year commitment didn&#39;t seem like a win, so I politely declined explaining my reasoning, and suggested we leave things as they are.A week or so later, out of the blue by my rent got adjusted by 10%+ instead of 5% with no need to commit to stay.Sufficed to say, if their intention was for me to stay put, it worked!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; the weighted average asking rent for an apartment in the city, which currently measures around 2.3 bedrooms when counting a studio as having one, has dropped to $3,100 a month.Still too high. Was checking into apartment prices earlier in the year and it is amazing the number of landlords that will try and sell you on a “kitchen” that is a mini-fridge, tiny sink, microwave and a hot plate whilst still charging you full rent.San Francisco’s rental market is a good lesson in how supply and demand informs pricing that the residents and the Board of Supervisors alike continuously and willfully ignore."</p>

&gt;&gt;Safety is an emergent property of systems; it does not reside in a person, device or department of an organization or system. Safety cannot be purchased or manufactured; it is not a feature that is separate from the other components of the system. This means that safety cannot be manipulated like a feedstock or raw material. The state of safety in any system is always dynamic; continuous systemic change insures that hazard and its management are constantly changing.fits perfectly the description of Security of complex IT systems, nice way to explain why IT security marketplace is a wild wild west"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Another reason to use cursors is to avoid the problem of repeated or skipped elements caused by concurrent edits. If you use offsets and you’re on page 10, and someone deletes an item on page 1, the whole list shifts and you can accidentally skip an item on page 11. Likewise if someone adds an item on page 1 and you’re on page 10, one of the page 10 items will also show up on page 11.Cursors elegantly sidestep these issues."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Use The Index Luke material about this is essential background reading, but in terms of actually implementing:My favorite SQL implementation of cursor-based keyset pagination can be found on this Hasura issue: https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/issues/141, specifically this comment: https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/issues/141#issuecom....

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think that cursor should be used more with realtime data and more stable data like products in an e-commerce shop should use paginated queries.There&#39;s many UX benefits for paginated queries. It gives customer a clear overview of how many products there are and customer can also navigate faster to get a better understanding of what general prices are. If the table/list doesn&#39;t have good filters, customer can easily act out binary search to find what they are looking for in an ordered list of items.Same with highscores, forums threads and other similar things. Say you are browsing highscores and you want to see what scores are around 10000th position etc.As a user I find having only prev/next buttons a bit claustrophobic in this case. I think UX should trump whatever performance gains there are from it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The way the art has been preserved makes you sorta realize that &#34;ancient times&#34; weren&#39;t that long ago.2000 / 25 = ~80 generationsIt&#39;s not some uncountable number with a million zeros. Assuming everyone knew one of their grandparents, it&#39;s more like 40 interpersonal &#34;links&#34;.I honestly feel like if Europe didn&#39;t have the Early Middle Ages (~500-1000AD), we would feel pretty connected to all the history that happened before in the same way that we feel pretty connected to Copernicus developing Heliocentrism or Columbus arriving in the New World.I wonder whether civilizations with seemingly more continuous histories like China feel more connection to the rest of their history. India&#39;s history was sort of interrupted by Islamic invasions starting from the 1200s. The Middle East, despite its tremendously long history, experienced a significant shift in culture with the rise of Christianity and then Islam.If Chinese people don&#39;t feel that historical connection, on the other hand, it might mean that our disconnect with ancient history might more just be a product of Modernity and the rapid change of the last couple centuries."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"More so than the art and tools/homeware (which are very modern - often better than utensils I own now!), the Pompeii graffiti really changed how I think about the past.When you&#39;re growing up, it seems like the older generation is so different, and the generation before that is unrecognizable.
