								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Beautiful times. I especially loved swapping - that is you got a list of people and their addresses from a magazine and you saved on disks your favourite demos and zines (preferable those nobody else had) and then you added some random stuff for example label off your favourite drink, wrote some poems, maybe added a dried flower and so on and then you also added postage stamps. Then you were hoping that whoever received it on the other side liked it and he or she would have sent you something else. Sometimes you would just just pass on the disks you received and just added your name to a txt file or some funny looking directory. There was also a trick to put a glue over your stamps and it was the custom that the person would send you those stamps back so you could then dissolve the postage stamp and reuse them :-)
The internet somewhat killed this unfortunately.
Decades later I still remember the feeling of a postman holding packages in his hands from various places in the world and the excitement, what am I going to find? I miss that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a (retired? infinitely procrastinating?) demoscener and to be frank I&#39;ve never understood this effort. What does it help anyone that some bureacrats somewhere put the demoscene on the same list as folk dances, saunas, and &#34;the Gastronomic meal of the French&#34;?I mean sure, it&#39;s impressive that they pulled it off - I wouldn&#39;t expect whoever decides these things to understand much about computer art subcultures, but I don&#39;t know what the benefit is, to anyone.EDIT: I just realized that of course the answer is, like anything demosceners do, &#34;because we can&#34;. What was I thinking?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If they intend to maintain an archive of all the demos ever created then I will volunteer one of my old 128Mb USB drives to mirror it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A big part of the problem is people just not following the guidelines. If you have a toolbar with buttons that have labels, it’s not going to fit. But if you’re following the guidelines, you don’t have labels and it fits.If you have a list with a refresh button on the bottom you have to scroll to see that button on a small screen. But if you use the standard pull to refresh control, you don’t even need the button.If you use these smart hamburger menu overlay or scroll controls, they look bad on untested devices. Don’t use hamburger menus.Most of the screenshots in this article are from iOS apps that show Google Material Design. It’s not too surprising this doesn’t work properly on Apple devices, the design doesn’t fit and you can’t implement it using the toolkit Apple designed, built and tested to work on all their devices.Edit:By the way you don’t even need to get a tiny phone to test this because most of the problems also show up when you increase the operating system font size which you’re also supposed to test."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Google Maps thing isn’t entirely about screen size (though I would hope it wouldn’t be quite so bad on larger screens—but I’m only familiar with how it looks on a small-by-modern-standards Android phone, where it’s about the same as on the iPhone depicted in this article, or even a little less); it’s about the product’s overarching philosophy, which has changed over the past decade (in a direction I strongly dislike). It used to be about, y’know, maps, but maps are now incidental, a means to a different end, ably demonstrated by their icon change a year ago from a map to a location pin. It’s all about the destinations now, and mapping has progressively deteriorated and been deemphasised.At least in the case depicted, you should be able to get it to show just the map by tapping once in the map area.(If you’re interested in more about this, https://www.justinobeirne.com has some excellent long-form content analysing all the major maps products, how they’ve changed over time, &amp;c. https://www.justinobeirne.com/google-maps-new-app-icon and https://www.justinobeirne.com/what-happened-to-google-maps are good brief starting points.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing that really annoyed me who always preferred the smaller iPhones like the SE: When Apple updated their Music app to make everything super big and bloated it basically got unusable. Especially for classical music where you could not see past the long name of the symphony to see which movement it was. And even while playing you had to wait for the running text to reach the important part.And all this was just blown up, they did not have to cram in a lot of infos they just increased the size of every UI element, made fonts bigger and bolt. It was really poor design, it felt like a phone for the elderly. Also one feature was gone that the old Music app had which would&#39;ve helped here: hold down on a song to get the overlay of the whole name...In general classical music is really poorly supported by many music services and apps but this was such a huge annoyance that I had to switch to a third party app and delete that shitty Music app."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The followup tweet indicates that the CPU has to be in an unlocked state before this is possible, which on a typical system requires there to be a Management Engine vulnerability first. Given what we currently know, this is going to be interesting for people interested in researching the behaviour and security of Intel CPUs and might well lead to discovery of security issues in future, but in itself I don&#39;t think this is dangerous.Edit to add: https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/security-... is a discussion of a previous Intel security issue which includes a description (on page 6) of the different unlock levels. This apparently requires that the CPU be in the Red unlock state, which (in the absence of ME vulnerabilities) should only be accessible by Intel."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nothing against the original post (which just says what they found), but this seems to be really overblown. Yes, of course Intel has instructions to update the micro code, since that&#39;s a thing that they do. Neither is it particularly surprising that they didn&#39;t bother to document operations that only they would ever have reason to use (in their eyes). If, as sibling comment notes, you have to be in a specific unlocked state to use this instruction, it should be perfectly safe assuming someone hasn&#39;t compromised other layers of security. So yes, this is certainly interesting, and it could be used as part of a chain of exploits to do some really nasty things, but by itself this seems like barely news?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Look up &#34;Intel VISA&#34; if you want to go down one of the many rabbitholes of undocumented x86... it makes me sad that there are whole subsystems in the hardware whose documentation is not publicly available; not from the security perspective, but from the &#34;I bet someone could do some really interesting things with this functionality&#34; perspective, like what LOADALL enabled (unreal mode, real-mode paging, etc.) decades ago.Intel isn&#39;t alone; search &#34;9c5a203a&#34; for some equally interesting stuff on the AMD side."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The video is worth a watch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antLneVlxcsI think it&#39;s fair to say that there are definitely some sketchy moments in there. The one that surprised me the most was marked &#34;Near Collision (2)&#34; in the video (12:25). A car really close to the Tesla doesn&#39;t seem to be picked up at all until it&#39;s too late: https://i.imgur.com/BG0gN2R.jpegYou can see in the first frame there that on the screen there&#39;s nothing in front of the Tesla, it&#39;s just the usual white background. But right out the windshield we can see the car is already very close. At the bottom frame which is a split second later, the car is finally detected and we can see the screen now shows the car. But at that point the driver manually intervened with a sharp swerve right as they were about to hit the car. Going frame by frame on Youtube the green box indicating the car was only there for 4 frames before the driver disengaged.I was aware that self driving is far from ready but I didn&#39;t know that even basic detection stuff like this is buggy. Double parked cars, people walking in the street, etc, I would expect to be problematic. But this is not really an edge case, it&#39;s just a regular car at close range with no obstructions in between..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"December 2015: &#34;We&#39;re going to end up with complete autonomy, and I think we will have complete autonomy in approximately two years.&#34;January 2016: &#34;In ~2 years, summon should work anywhere connected by land &amp; not blocked by borders, eg you&#39;re in LA and the car is in NY&#34;June 2016: &#34;I really consider autonomous driving a solved problem, I think we are less than two years away from complete autonomy, safer than humans, but regulations should take at least another year,&#34; Musk said.March 2017: &#34;I think that [you will be able to fall asleep in a tesla] is about two years&#34;March 2018: &#34;I think probably by end of next year [end of 2019] self-driving will encompass essentially all modes of driving and be at least 100% to 200% safer than a person.&#34;Nov 15, 2018: &#34;Probably technically be able to [self deliver Teslas to customers doors] in about a year then its up to the regulators&#34;Feb 19 2019: &#34;We will be feature complete full self driving this year. The car will be able to find you in a parking lot, pick you up, take you all the way to your destination without an intervention this year. I&#39;m certain of that. That is not a question mark. It will be essentially safe to fall asleep and wake up at their destination towards the end of next year&#34;April 12th 2019: &#34;I&#39;d be shocked if not next year, at the latest that having the person, having human intervene will decrease safety. DECREASE! (in response to human supervision and adding driver monitoring system)&#34;April 22nd 2019: &#34;We expect to be feature complete in self driving this year, and we expect to be confident enough from our standpoint to say that we think people do not need to touch the wheel and can look out the window sometime probably around the second quarter of next year.&#34;April 22nd 2019: “We will have more than one million robotaxis on the road,” Musk said. “A year from now, we’ll have over a million cars with full self-driving, software... everything.&#34;May 9th 2019: &#34;We could have gamed an LA/NY Autopilot journey last year, but when we do it this year, everyone with Tesla Full Self-Driving will be able to do it too&#34;Dec 1, 2020: “I am extremely confident of achieving full autonomy and releasing it to the Tesla customer base next year. But I think at least some jurisdictions are going to allow full self-driving next year.”-Elon’s just been repeating the same promise for the over half a decade now. Oldest trick in the book.Disclaimer: I drive a Model 3"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This [0] is much worse than the video in the article, IMO. It repeatedly tries to pull out in front of cars going 45+ miles an hour, in some cases giving the driver very little time to stop it. For level 5 (what Elon keeps claiming they will have very soon), they need to be able to go tens of thousands of miles without a crash-avoiding human intervention, not 10 minutes.[0] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uClWlVCwHsI"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I built a print-on-demand system that integrates into Shopify stores. To vent a little...* I can concur that their API is unreliable. About 1 in 5 of my CI runs fail with mysterious 500 errors. It&#39;s infuriating.* The support channels are a wasteland. Do not expect help.* The documentation is super thin. At first glance it looks decent - there&#39;s the objects, there&#39;s the fields those objects have. But it&#39;s missing all the details about how those fields are supposed to work. Example: A Fulfillment has a tracking_numbers array, but there doesn&#39;t seem to be any way to add multiple tracking numbers. The docs are silent, and questions about this in the support channels remain unanswered. For years.* There are two completely different APIs (graphql and REST), which do not have equal capabilities. If Shopify is planning on deprecating one of them, they should give us guidance.* The API is inconsistent. I count at least FIVE different representations of an Address structure, each slightly different for no apparent reason. Eg &#34;country&#34; vs &#34;countryCode&#34;. This is the kind of thing that creeps into projects in dynamic languages when nobody&#39;s paying attention.* There&#39;s a lot of overengineered stuff. The Metadata API  is really unpleasant compared to Stripe&#39;s simpler approach.* There&#39;s no way to set up common shipping scenarios like &#34;$N for first item, $M for each additional&#34;.I could go on. But I will say this: It&#39;s better than Etsy&#39;s API. Though Etsy is finally working on it again, so maybe that will change."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been building Shopify apps for around 5 years now, and have 4 apps with around 15k users. I feel the pain this author feels with some additional notes..Our apps are built in PHP using the polaris.css for styling components. We have some embedded apps currently (before Shopify began requiring the session token). Personally, the embedded experience is only good for simpler apps. If your app is more complex with lots of options and settings and things to show, the embedded experience is SO SMALL. Literally 40% of the screen is taken up by the Shopify admin leaving only a small portion for your app. Makes interface design more difficult when so much of the top/left part of the screen is taken up by Shopify admin.Their API and webhooks are &#34;fairly&#34; reliable. We&#39;re consuming around 10k to 20k webhooks per hour and performing 20k to 50k API calls per hour. We rarely have issues. We are using their Amazon EventBridge integration to accept webhooks as a sort of buffer against them DDOSing our applications.The largest issue with their API at scale is dealing with the API limits of 2 to 4 requests per second. Since some things require performing multiple API calls, and we deal with massive e-commerce stores that may need to perform 100,000 tasks, it can take a long time to perform the work (we have to artificially delay the API calls to not hit their limits). Also their GraphQL API has a complex limit system based on the &#34;amount&#34; of data returned, which makes fetching data even more complicated than their REST API.My other big gripe with their API is that they have a GraphQL and REST API with different features. They support different filters, different fields they return, different types of objects... It&#39;s a real PITA to try and work seamlessly between two different APIs (e.g. data formatted differently). And neither API is 100% solid, depending on the features your app needs you will basically need to use both APIs.Generally my experience has been pretty good with Shopify. Their API changes can be scary, but at least they use versioning so they don&#39;t break the current version you&#39;re using. They are constantly adding new features too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My biggest problem with the ecosystem is how Shopify tries to deflect their own customer problems onto their partners to solve. And oftentimes, these same customers expect the partners to solve it for free.Examples:- Their default theme (provided by Shopify) has problems. Blame it on the app developer. &#34;It&#39;s the app&#39;s fault.&#34; Yes, there are some poorly developed apps, but this lumps together the good with the bad.- Customers use the app review system to hold developer hostage for feature requests. &#34;Create this feature for us and I&#39;ll edit my review.&#34;- Shopify&#39;s customer service reps says, &#34;It must be the app that&#39;s causing this.&#34; Reading the CSR&#39;s emails, it is clear that this person does not understand the (technical) issues and is only trying to close the ticket. Customer takes what the CSR says as gospel and you, as the developer, spends a lot of time trying to fight that mindset.I can&#39;t help but feel a big part of Shopify&#39;s early strategy was that the demographic of customers they were trying to attract just weren&#39;t a great type of customer, and that the partner program allowed them to enlist a lot of hungry developers willing to work for free (or next to nothing).There is definitely room for improvement. I have mixed feelings about it, as their ecosystem provided me with a way to make a living many years ago. I don&#39;t depend on them anymore, but I wouldn&#39;t argue against trying your luck out there if you&#39;re starting out. Just recognize that there is a certain culture and way of practice there."</p>

I don&#39;t see why that is confusing at all.&#34;Here, yyy has correct one and three significant digits relative to xxx, but incorrect 2 significant digits, since the truncation at x2x_2x2  and y2y_2y2  do not agree even to the first significant digit. &#34;This doesn&#39;t make sense. Y has the correct one?I think you might be confused about the purpose of significant digits. SD are intended to be paired with a tolerance. If there is no tolerence quote with the number, it is meaningless to talk about significant digits. You arbitrarily defined the tolerance as +/0.5 (half a unit). That is not always true, almost never true. Consider test equipment, not every multimeter is going to be +/0.5mV, some might be +/-.3uV. It varies."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My rule of thumb is that anything title &#34;...for Hackers&#34; is crap.This link was not an exception.&gt;  Since the relative error is invariant under scaling (x↦αx)(x \mapsto \alpha x)(x↦αx), we will mostly be interested in relative error.No, No, No, No. This is very much dependent on what you are measuring/modelling, what is the tolerance you are willing to accept, the consequences and so on.A 1% of error in the change the cashier gave you back maybe is not a big deal. That same error in the national budget is equivalent to 2X the NASA&#39;s budget."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is such a great example of how people that know math(s) really struggle to explain things to people who don&#39;t, because they struggle to realise how much lingo they are using.The first point explains something as basic as absolute and relative errors. Great.1 page down (s)he&#39;s casually thrown in function notation with R representing the real numbers with no explanation. Anyone who isn&#39;t familiar with this notation is immediately intimidated. But I&#39;d wager almost anyone who is familiar with it didn&#39;t need to read the page before it. But also, I think it&#39;s just unnecessary to be this specific in the first place, if you&#39;re trying to quickly explain concepts.It&#39;s actually a huge problem in maths and even Wikipedia (I feel) is pretty guilty of this.If you take a (relatively) key mathematical concept, such as the Taylor series, then the opening gambit is completely incomprehensible to anyone who isn&#39;t already knowledgeable in maths: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_seriesThis, to me, seems in huge contrast with other scientific fields. Medicine wikipedia, for example, caters towards the &#34;average reader&#34; first, and doctors later. This is entirely appropriate for an encyclopedia. For example: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AV_nodal_reentrant_tachycardia..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Misleading Title. Visa says it will allow for Bitcoin to be converted to fiat, and the fiat can be spent using a Visa Card in the same way debit cards already work.This is already done with the Coinbase card, Gemini card, etcThe statement is very vague in terms of who is covering the conversion."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The number of people commenting who completely misunderstand Bitcoin and crypto is astounding.Bitcoin will never be used directly for payments, it&#39;s a value store. Immutable deflationary digital gold.I wrote it off for years too because it was too slow and the fees were too expensive. That was the dream they had, but they couldn&#39;t realize it at the base layer. I was still walking around last year believing that&#39;s the scam they were still peddling, but once you take time to investigate you&#39;ll see it will become a major part of the world economy.COVID helped push this over as bailouts and printing money in the US and the ECB is going to drive a massive movement of money out of the markets and fiat.Normally you&#39;d see momentum go to bonds when the stocks burst but the bonds situation is unsalvagable.Also expect a ton of movement to crypto when wealth taxes get implemented to fix economies. They&#39;ll use it to hide assets, guaranteed. Form an LLC, siphon the money out that way and into crypto."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the reasons I&#39;m bullish on Bitcoin over the next decade is precisely because of the anti-BTC sentiment on this board."</p>
