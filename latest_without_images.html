								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I like Scratch - my kid uses it and I worked briefly with the guy who made Blockly, the underlying visual programming toolkit - but the programming environment makes many things far too complicated with its singular focus on sprites.It&#39;s very, very difficult to do things as simple as display a number on screen. My 7yo was making a number guessing game, and to display a two-digit number we had to make two sprites that had 10 &#34;costumes&#34; (0-9) then do modular math to select the costume for each digit. Sprites also have their own code, and if you duplicate one and edit the code the edits don&#39;t apply to the duplicate - so there&#39;s no user library or abstraction power at all.This made dealing with Scratch far more complex and time-consuming than the logic of the game my kid was making, which is the exact opposite of what you want in a learning environment. I don&#39;t really want to focus on the idiosyncrasies of Scratch when teaching programming.Some simple text and drawing commands, user-defined functions, and a library would go a huge way towards making Scratch simpler. There are some other Blockly-based environments that may have this... but they&#39;re not as popular."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It is great that Scratch can be used as an introduction to programming, but that is not why it was created. It was part of the MIT MediaLab &#34;Computer Clubhouse&#34;[1] project where it would be used to enable a remix culture of cute animations and even simple games. Scratch&#39;s implementer, John Maloney, had already helped create a programming environment for kids called EToys[2] using Squeak Smalltalk, just as in the first versions of Scratch (later rewritten in Flash and then in Javascript).So the comments about how it is hard to do in Scratch something that would be trivial in Basic or some other language are not surprising. It is an animation system that allows you to use programming to increment that.As others have pointed out, a system with the same visual as Scratch but design for actually programming is Snap![3] so it is just a matter of using the tools for what they were created to do.[1] https://web.media.mit.edu/~mres/papers/Clubhouse/Clubhouse.h...[2] http://squeakland.org/[3] https://snap.berkeley.edu/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For those who are interested and may not know; Bill Watterson also ghost-drew a few strips for the comic Pearls Before Swine (part of an arc beginning on the 2nd of June 2014[0] and continuing till the 8th). There are a couple of neat references to who it is behind the better art (anyone who&#39;s read Watterson&#39;s complaints on shrinking panel space in print media will be familiar with the guest character&#39;s comments) and I recall an old blog post by the artist of Pearls describing what it was like to work with Bill (terrifying; the thought of the postal worker just chucking these, the only comics anyone had gotten out of Watterson in years, onto his porch in the rain was horrible), but I can&#39;t find it.[0]: https://www.gocomics.com/pearlsbeforeswine/2014/06/02EDIT: Nevermind, found it! https://stephanpastis.wordpress.com/2014/06/07/ever-wished-t..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been running a Calvin &amp; Hobbes bot for ~20 years now.  Back when Google Reader was a thing, the bot published an RSS feed which had greater than &gt;1M subscribers.  It&#39;s now a bot on Reddit (/u/CalvinBot) with &gt;700k karma.During that time, I&#39;ve tried to be very mindful of Watterson&#39;s copyright and make sure I don&#39;t violate it anyway.This had led to some interesting &#34;bugs.&#34;  Specifically amuniversal.com only publishes the comic strip as a GIF.  But the official Reddit mobile app has a bug.  It treats all GIFs as a video &amp; disables other image features, like zooming.  The nature of C&amp;H is such that very often want to zoom to see all the wonderful details Mr. Watterson put into the strip.Because of that I routinely get complaints about it being in a GIF (&#34;GIFs are for movies!&#34; the whippersnappers say) and tell me to publish them as JPG or PNG.  Now converting a GIF to JPG or PNG is trivial, but there&#39;s no way I can do so without violating his copyright.  I&#39;d have to host the converted image myself, which I don&#39;t have the right the do.So I won&#39;t do it.It&#39;s minor, but knowing Watterson felt so passionate about copyright, I think it&#39;s important to honor.  But because the team at Reddit won&#39;t fix the bug, the complaints continue to come rolling in.  Enough that I wrote a FAQ about it:https://www.reddit.com/r/CalvinBot/comments/bdxb6h/why_are_p...If any C&amp;H fans knows anyone on the team at Reddit, I&#39;d much appreciate it if you could ask them to fix it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; In the old days, there was this idea of “selling out” and we as a culture decided that it was bad. Monetizing a thing immediately called into question its integrity, and more importantly, the integrity of the artist. But then an interesting thing began happening in the late 90’s and early 00’s. The idea of selling out lost its negative connotation.It did? I completely missed that, but it&#39;s probably because I&#39;m old..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Many issues with this analysis, some others have already mentioned, including:• The &#39;domains&#39; collected by the source, as those &#34;with the most referring subnets&#34;, aren&#39;t necessarily &#39;websites&#39; that now, or ever, respnded to HTTP• In many cases any responding web server will be on the `www.` subdomain, rather than the domain that was listed/probed – &amp; not everyone sets up `www.` to respond/redirect. (Author misinterprets appearances of `www.domain` and `domain` in his source list as errant duplicates, when in fact that may be an indicator that those `www.domain` entries also have significant `subdomain.www.domain` extensions – depending on what Majestic means by &#39;subnets&#39;.)• Many sites may block `curl` requests because they only want attended human browser traffic, and such blocking (while usually accompanied with some error response) can be a more aggressive drop-connection.• `curl` given a naked hostname likely attempts a plain HTTP connection, and given that even browsers now auto-prefix `https:` for a naked hostname, some active sites likely have nothing listening on plain-HTTP port anymore.• Author&#39;s burst of activity could&#39;ve triggered other rate-limits/failures - either at shared hosts/inbound proxies servicing many of the target domains, or at local ISP egresses or DNS services. He&#39;d need to drill-down into individual failures to get a beter idea to what extent this might be happening.If you want to probe if domains are still active:• confirm they&#39;re still registered via a `whois`-like lookup• examine their DNS records for evidence of current services• ping them, or any DNS-evident subdomains• if there are any MX records, check if the related SMTP server will confirm any likely email addresses (like postmaster@) as deliverable. (But: don&#39;t send an actual email message.)• (more at risk of being perceived as aggressive) scan any extant domains (from DNS) for open ports running any popular (not just HTTP) servicesIf you want to probe if web sites are still active, start with an actual list of web site URLs that were known to have been active at some point."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I downloaded the file and looked at the second 000 in his file, which refers to wixsite.com.It appears that wixsite.com isn&#39;t valid but www.wixsite.com is, and redirects to wix.com.It&#39;s misleading to say that the sites are dead. As noted elsewhere, his source data is crap (other sites I checked such as wixstatic.com don&#39;t appear to be valid) but his methodology is bad, or at least his describing the sites as dead is misleading."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I strongly dislike the idea of automatically jumping into a folder when there’s only one match: it feels like a feature optimised for very slow typers that actively penalises fast typers, because it makes things generally unpredictable: will one character be enough to navigate, or two, or three? It depends on the siblings, and if you type more characters than are required, you will be penalised by ending up somewhere else as the remaining letters are fed to the next level down that you haven’t even seen yet. My general habit in navigating is to type three characters and press Tab, because that’s almost always sufficient, and is plenty fast. I have a very few places where I’ve learned to do other things. Under my habit, I could end up as much as two levels down from where I wanted to be."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting.OTOH, people have named a number of similar tools, and I&#39;m going to point out &#39;mc&#39;
 aka Midnight Commander, which is part of most linux distro&#39;s, and is a clone of the 1980&#39;s Norton commander. Its designed to be a command line TUI helper, sorta like the project here, with not only cursor/etc based directory navigation but copy/rename/delete/etc functionality just a keystroke away. Its fairly convenient because it overlays the command line rather than replacing it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s a lot of comments on this thread pointing out typical bandwidth usage of popular streaming services, games etc and claiming that there&#39;s no need for higher bandwidth connections.There&#39;s an important point that I think people are missing, which is that the bandwidth usage of internet services is going to be carefully tuned to balance quality and stability at typical internet speeds. When a large portion of consumers have &lt; 100Mbps down of course all services are going to use &lt; 100Mbps of bandwidth - you don&#39;t know what kind of stuff you&#39;re missing out on because of these slow internet speeds, because nobody is making it available, because it wouldn&#39;t work.The most obvious thing that we already know we&#39;re missing out on is video streaming quality. You&#39;ve possibly already noticed that low contrast dark scenes and scenes with snow/rainfall don&#39;t look very good on Netflix/YouTube/insert streaming service here - this is because these are the kind of scenes with the most obvious sacrifice of quality from video compression. (It&#39;s also possible you haven&#39;t noticed this, because streaming services generally avoid producing content that doesn&#39;t play well with their video compression)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"With how slowly these proposals roll out, 100/20 won&#39;t be enough. As others said, there is a lack of both competition and pricing to worry about too.In a major tech hub like San Francisco, where I live, it&#39;s possible to get 1gb/1gb in some areas for under $90, but which those are isn&#39;t consistent nor wide spread. Home cell coverage at 100/20 is spotty at best, and there is only one flat rate vendor (T-Mobile Home, no Verizon Home yet). For those outside of the Bay Area exurbs, I can only imagine the horrors of Comcast/Xfinity or only DSL people must deal with.Looking forward, the FCC is assuming that people are just watching Netflix, Tiktok, and making angry Karen posts on Nextdoor. We&#39;re not sure where web3 will lead, and how much bandwidth will that take: Distributed file systems/data privacy? Fast crypto transactions? Metaverse/VR/AR glasses/contacts? And what about latency?1000/500 should be the FCC goal."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem, in the USA for most people, is Comcast.Downspeed hardly matters. It&#39;s been plenty for decades. Upload speed has stagnated. I uploaded as fast in 2003 as I do now in 2022. And as others have said, it&#39;s not so much about 1 fast provider as many providers and choice. In my comcast monopoly my plan started at $60/mo in 2011 and without any changes on my end and no change in my upload speed that price has increased to it&#39;s current $105/mo. In addition to the price increases they&#39;ve implemented a new system of total data transfer limits ((up/down)+internal overhead) meaning even if I could have a faster connection it&#39;d mean nothing if I used it in the first week and then got hit with multiple $10 overage &#34;fees&#34;.But I don&#39;t have a choice. It doesn&#39;t matter how good, or bad, Comcast is. They&#39;re the only game in town."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s actually some science behind this diet. Potatoes are the highest scoring food on the satiety index. https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/15-incredibly-filling-f...Basically they&#39;re the most filling food per calorie. So if you subscribe to the idea that losing weight is mainly about how many calories you consume, a potato heavy diet should be effective.And an all potato diet, while monomaniacal, even more effective.Eggs and fish are also very high on the satiety index. If you threw in pretty much any vegetables and spices of your choosing and just stuck to those along with potatoes, even with a cheat day or three you&#39;d have a very healthy diet which I bet most people would lose weight on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I spent a few weeks eating only potatoes and vegetable oil, several years ago. It wasn&#39;t for weight loss, it was because I was breastfeeding, and my baby had some kind of protein sensitivity we couldn&#39;t nail down. Potatoes turned out to be a safe food for him, so that&#39;s all I ate for a while. As it happens potatoes are my favorite food, and I had vegetable oil available so I could eat fries/chips/crisps, but even then I can&#39;t imagine doing it without a similarly serious motivation. When my choices were &#34;listen to the baby cry in pain every time he eats&#34; or &#34;eat potatoes until the allergist appointment,&#34; it was an easy choice. Otherwise I wouldn&#39;t last long on the potato diet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The only reason the potato diet is interesting to me (and presumably the reason it&#39;s interesting to the https://slimemoldtimemold.com/ folks) is the likely relationship to their environmental contaminant hypothesis for the public health issue of increasing body weights since 1980, outlined in a series of posts here: http://achemicalhunger.com/In short, while the variety and satiety explanations make a lot of sense subjectively for an individual on this diet, they don&#39;t match up with the empirical data on weight gain since 1980. Here are a few phenomena that are not explained by this hypothesis:* The inflection point at right around 1980. There&#39;s no specific change that occurred in 1980 that anyone can point to that indicates a major change in variety of food in the average diet.* The correllation of weight gain with location in watersheds: high altitude locales where surface water has not moved very far (e.g. Colorado) exhibit the weight gain phenomena much less than locales deeper down in the watershed (e.g. Mississippi and Louisiana)I&#39;m not interested in fad diets or disordered eating because they have a track record of bad long term outcomes, but I am interested in the potato diet as a blunt tool for taking action on this hypothesis, which looks pretty compelling to me. And if it doesn&#39;t work out, that&#39;s fine, too!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This looks very cool, kudos on the launch!I feel like vim tutorials mostly focus on navigating and editing a single file, which is great! But I mostly struggle with how to replicate opening a whole directory in VSCode, which makes it easy to browse the directory, switch between files, open multiple panels, etc.I&#39;m almost certain vim does all these things out of the box, but tutorials always end at &#34;this is how you edit some text quickly&#34; and never cover &#34;this is how you do software engineering&#34;."</p>

That’s all the vim most people need.The fact that less is installed on many more systems than nano is a testament to the bad assumptions too many devs make about who will be using these systems in the future. And yes, it’s not hard to &#34;apt -y install nano&#34; except at work where we have proxies and internal repos, so now I need to use vim to reconfigure apt sources just so I can use a more normal editor that doesn’t require arcane incantations to perform basic config file editing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really want to like vim and I love some things about it, like the ability to move chunks about with only the keyboard. But so many things about it kill me. Like, why can&#39;t I hit right at the end of a line, and move to the next line? Who thinks that is a good idea? Also, why do I have to have a special mode to insert things? Having to change modes just seems so complex and unintuitive. And why does the help system never tell me what I want?The frustration is that probably there are fixes for all these things, which if I were an expert I would know. But meanwhile I can use an ordinary visual text editor and I don&#39;t have to learn anything new."</p>

TikTok has not really been rewarding creators fairly, and pushes the idea that organic growth is possible, and that people have become really successful, but many creators realize after months of working for little to no reward that it&#39;s a false narrative.There are billions of accounts on these platforms yes, but the main question is are they actively posting, engaged, and satisfied?

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Heya, I&#39;m the author of the article. I&#39;ve been working on Kandria full time for close to two years now, and on-and-off for some years while I was doing my Master&#39;s at ETH. The engine it&#39;s running on, Trial, is a few years older still, and initially just started out of the good ole university boredom and curiosity. Games is how I got into programming when I was about 6, and that particular fever hasn&#39;t left me yet it seems, ha ha!Kandria itself started as a &#34;more serious&#34; attempt at a game after I&#39;d been making jam games with Trial for some years. I wanted to create something bigger, and had just finished playing through Celeste, so I just set out to replicate its mechanics in my own way. You can still find some demos of those very early days on my YouTube channel, if you&#39;re curious. In any case, the project went through several big changes until it turned into what it is now. During the pandemic in 2020 I finally decided to drop out of my Master&#39;s to pursue the project full time. At that point I also brought on a couple more people to help with the writing, art, and sound.We&#39;re currently also running a Kickstarter to get us some extra funds for the project. It ends on Thursday 14th, 12:00 CEST, so there&#39;s not that much time left in it. If you&#39;d like to support our work, please have a look: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shinmera/kandria
The campaign page has a lot more details on the project and the team, if you&#39;re curious about that.In the article I primarily cover the programming parts, giving a surface overview of the technologies involved and at least giving a brief hint at the methodology I employ to create games. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve left out a lot of details that you might be curious about, so if you have any questions, please feel free to ask and I&#39;ll try my best to answer!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a nice write up.The dark side is that they&#39;ve put years into developing the core infrastructure to empower their Lisp game journey. Ideally that&#39;s all usable by others to &#34;stand on the shoulders&#34;, so to speak, but that&#39;s always a challenge.I honestly have never had to work on a &#34;running image&#34; of any consequence. I&#39;ve never worked on anything more than a few thousand lines of code. I&#39;ve never needed any kind of source level &#34;step&#34; debugging. The ability to redefine a function quickly, I just throw in some prints to figure something out.Reloading the entire source file was always fast enough to now warrant hunting down any of the more interactive mechanisms available. This is all across using simple vi, or emacs, or even LispWorks.  (defun l () (load &#34;src.lisp&#34;))

Just save the file, and type that.All that said, my current low level fantasy is something akin to Electron, only with Common Lisp. First class DOM, first class event hooks, into a CL runtime that you can deploy cross platform. Dunno if that exists or not.I&#39;m sure at some point my codebase will grow to the point where I would need to &#34;level up&#34; and become more intimate with SLIME, packages, system definitions, etc.I&#39;ve just not crossed that threshold yet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;&gt; One thing I do have to mention though is that the workflow in Lisp allows me to create these support libraries much faster than I can in other languages.I&#39;m at that stage in my lisp journey (~18 months) where i know enough to be dangerous to others around me, i.e. i&#39;m still a lisp n00b but have completed a few lisp &amp; scheme books and written enough projects that i feel fairly productive. BUT i haven&#39;t reached, never mind come out the other side of, the &#34;trough of disillusionment&#34; yet. So everything lisp is unreasonably tainted with a positive glow in my mind.TL;DR i still think lisp is pretty awesome. It&#39;s my newest hammer and everything looks like a lisp-shaped nail these days. So i have to be deliberate and careful not to over-use lisp but it&#39;s totally changed how i write js for example. It&#39;s infected my brain.Here&#39;s the thing - that workflow statement by the OP is a fair chunk of the attraction to lisp for me. Before lisp i &#34;knew&#34; what a REPL was - i&#39;ve been using python since i switched wholesale from Perl in the 00&#39;s, i thought you couldn&#39;t teach me anything new about REPLs, even quasi-REPLs like Jupyter were entirely familiar and &#34;basic&#34; to me. If you&#39;re a lisper, you know i was wrong about that, if you&#39;re not a lisper you&#39;re probably wondering what&#39;s the big deal.The other chunk - and i&#39;m only really scratching the surface so far - has been macros. I think so far i prefer the non-hygenic type, but i haven&#39;t gone through Let over Lambda yet (although the book is on my bookshelf and is only 2 titles away from being started)For me, lisp opened my eyes to a way of working that i just wish i could fully replicate in other languages. Lisp has made me re-appreciate python and js in different ways now.If you want a really short version - Brett Victor&#39;s famous inventing on principle talk sums it up for me (he was using JS there, so there is hope...)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I tried to pick up Rust a few years ago, but there were too many sharp edges. I thought it was a nice language, but was too early for actual use. I played with some libraries (Apache Arrow, etc) and it was nice.About 2 months ago I wanted to use Arrow within Elixir, which required me to start using Rust again (Elixir uses Rustler to safely convert from Rust &lt;&gt; Elixir without theoretically crashing the beam). I am amazed how far it&#39;s come, and I&#39;ve actually been using it a lot over the last few months and haven&#39;t ran into any major issues. There is a fair amount of information out there, and the documentation as the OP pointed out is really fantastic.The libraries are really good now, and I&#39;ve had no issues using it on Linux or on my Macbook M1. Incredibly impressive speed results. SIMD is a game changer.Major shoutouts to arrow2 and Polars, I love using it for data analysis :)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love rust.  I didn’t find it difficult to learn and at this point several others I’ve introduced it to also haven’t.  I’m baffled as to where that reputation comes from.I get that it makes you think about what you’re building a little more than something you can throw together like Python or Ruby but if the end goal is software that works correctly, getting there definitely isn’t harder with rust.  It’s the complete opposite :/."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve spent some time casually learning Rust in the past few weeks, and I&#39;d really like to start incorporating it into my serious C++ projects. Rust itself is nice, but having a reliable package manager &amp; build system in the form of cargo is absolutely the killer feature for me.If I could use Cargo/cxx_build as my C++ build system (which I think may be possible, but I haven&#39;t seen a good example), I would fully embrace rust &amp; start incorporating it into my professional work today."</p>
