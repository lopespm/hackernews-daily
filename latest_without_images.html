								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Amazing work and any developer should work on whatever he pleases. 
But there is also something in me that wished development would focus on something more open. What if Apple tomorrow decides only signed kernels are allowed to boot (to protect the children). I know there currently is no ARM laptop equivalent to the M1, and ARM booting is a minefield. So I get that if the M1 becomes a viable Linux target this would be very interesting."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The silver lining of using this complicated DCP interface is that DCP does in fact run a huge amount of code – the DCP firmware is over 7MB! It implements complicated algorithms like DisplayPort link training, real-time memory bandwidth calculations, handling the DisplayPort to HDMI converter in the Mac mini, enumerating valid video modes and performing mode switching, and more. It would be a huge ordeal to reverse engineer all of this and implement it as a raw hardware driver, so it is quite likely that, in the end, we will save time by using this higher-level interface and leaving all the dirty work to the DCP. In particular, it is likely that newer Apple Silicon chips will use a shared DCP codebase and the same interface for any given macOS version, which gives us support for newer chips “for free”, with only comparatively minor DCP firmware ABI updates.How interesting: by moving some of the driver to firmware, Apple has effectively made it easier for OSs like Linux to have good support for the hardware, because the OS&lt;-&gt;hardware protocol operates at a higher level of abstraction and may work across multiple chips.The trade-off is that the protocol is not stable and so Linux has to decide which versions it will support, and make sure the OS driver always matches the version of the hardware firmware:&gt; As a further twist, the DCP interface is not stable and changes every macOS version! [...] Don’t fret: this doesn’t mean you won’t be able to upgrade macOS. This firmware is per-OS, not per-system, and thus Linux can use a different firmware bundle from any sibling macOS installations."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Now we know that it’s possible to make really good transistors with impure chemicals, no cleanroom, and homemade equipment.The good news here is that 2 of those 3 issues are pretty easily solvable.  With some work, and a ton of HEPA air purifier machines, you could probably turn an area the size of a small shed or 1 car garage into a class 10000 cleanrom pretty easily.  It would be simplest if this area were embedded in a larger area, like a 2 car garage, but, you could probably squeeze it into just a plain old 1 car garage.Chemicals, you can buy online from scientific supply houses.  Some, like acetone, you can buy from less specialized sources in high purity.  Water and alcohol, you can either buy at high purity pretty easily, or buy lower grade stuff and purify it.Of course, at the point where you&#39;re going for higher purity stuff like this, you might want to switch from acetone as a solvent to DMSO.  DMSO itself is safe to handle and doesn&#39;t evaporate like acetone will.&gt; SilaneYeah, nasty stuff.  Toxic as hell, ignites spontaneously when exposed to air.  I used to work near a rather large storage tank that contained the stuff.  Needless to say, I am glad there never was an accident. :-)  Very wise to avoid this stuff.---https://www.americancleanrooms.com/class-10000-clean-room/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimethyl_sulfoxidehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silane"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve taken a news literacy class at Stony Brook about 10 years ago, when it was then a relatively new program.  I think it&#39;s an incredibly valuable thing.It was taught in more the general sense of how to apply critical thinking to judge news stories. To the people saying that this just instills propaganda about specific news sources: consider learning a little bit more about the class.It teaches about how to tell journalism apart from other kinds of information, like entertainment and opinion; the hallmarks of good reporting, like transparency; discerning assertion from verification, and evidence from inference; the idea of seeking out multiple sources and how to reconcile them, etc.  It&#39;s more a toolbox of how to inform oneself, regardless of any specific source.It definitely included examples of bad reporting from all sorts of sources, because the message is that its ideas are applicable to any source of information.Ideas: https://www.centerfornewsliteracy.org/what-is-news-literacy/Class: https://www.centerfornewsliteracy.org/stony-brooks-center-fo..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"IMO the most effective and most widely deployed (especially among the supposedly more reputable publications) propaganda tool isn’t outright lies, but rather, selective reporting of cherry-picked facts and omission of others to shape stories into their predefined narratives. TFA doesn’t address that at all. It seems to me that students’ main takeaway from this course would be to trust NPR, NYT and the like, rather than viral content. Which is of course great for NPR, but doesn’t help when your “trustworthy” media selection decide to suppress all arguments from another side, or remain silent on certain stories altogether.Note: This comment was expanded a few times, but the gist remained the same.Edit: No, I’m not saying “trust NPR, NYT and the like instead of viral content you see on Facebook” isn’t a good takeaway. I’m saying the more effective type of propaganda (at least for people who don’t tend to fall for the obvious crap) isn’t discussed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Given the primary example used on the kids, the 2016 election, this seems more about instilling bias under the name &#34;news literacy&#34;.  Are they going to do a section studying the &#34;coverage&#34; of hunter biden&#39;s laptop?  Remember, for weeks it was cast as Russian propaganda.  What about the origins of covid.. will they discuss how at first the lab leak theory was discarded as &#34;misinformation&#34;?  I could not trust a public school to ever touch such topics.This is as comforting as hearing that schools are teaching religion."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I investigated egui early this year. It&#39;s a very good library! For me, getting used to immediate mode UI was a change from being used to DOM / React-style UI. imgui works well for a lot but it struggles with complex layouts, eg flexbox. This is acknowledged in egui&#39;s READMECouple things I built with egui:
https://artifacts.bypaulshen.com/rust-gui/code-render/
https://artifacts.bypaulshen.com/rust-gui/tictactoe/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I use this in a few of my projects. Simple, no complaints. Compile time is faster than it takes for me to yawn most of the time (using mold linker and sccache, which improves compile time a lot with a far superior linker and caching compiled dependencies, respectively).(Edit to add: below complaint is entirely within rust and irrelevant to this library)Only problem (not the fault of egui) is sometimes the elements disallow me using the templateapp object mutably as a whole: sometimes I have to mut borrow a part of `self` before the ui part (instead of mutating `self.whatever` within the UI element, I have to do `let borrow = self.whatever.borrow_mut()` before the UI element then call that borrow) which seemed odd to me as a beginner. I think this is mostly a rust &#34;problem&#34; but also maybe because of how UI element creation was designed.If you understand the borrow rules then you&#39;ll probably understand it fine. I might be able to just lock an Arc Mutex instead and avoid the problem but I just learned how to use them so :p"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Most HN posts always compare with FAANG jobs and salaries, while there is a whole different world out there.For instance, in Europe and especially low-paid countries in the south or eastern Europe, i foresee zero chance that top talent will stay in their countries to be given low salaries for jobs with local/low impact. These people are already working or looking to work remotely to companies in richer countries (e.g. UK, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland) and are already profiting for this. I personally switched to a remote-only job and got the biggest raise of my career, with a salary that no local company can match unless we are talking C-level manager position."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What bothers me more is that these tech companies aren’t even trying to have a conversation with their employees. If they did a survey and collected opinions from their employees the decision would be pretty trivial. But the managerial gang knows that and they want to side step it.The companies want to pretend they care about the employees. They claim to be giving them perks. In reality, these perks are just gamification to make the employee spend more time in the office.The managerial gang gamified CS careers with silly interviews and performance reviews. They gamified apps and information dispersal. Entire democracies were at stake and nothing changed.WFH won’t ever happen. These managers have to maintain appearances, name drop names and pretend to be “in the know”. Every engineer knows that 90% of these people are like language models regurgitating what they’ve heard. They can’t do that effectively via video.To me this is the most blatant admission of their inability to measure developer productivity."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve only just skimmed through this. And it&#39;s a subject I already know so I can&#39;t tell if it&#39;s actually a good resource. However, my initial impression is that I love it.I think that textbooks, math textbooks in particular, are an example where print publishing does a disservice. (I&#39;m counting PDFs here too.) By having to lay everything out in print form, you have to clutter up your explanations with examples and footnotes that take up physical room. Here, the examples are toggle-able. If I _want_ to explore an example, I can. But I don&#39;t need to. This kind of thing is especially helpful when reviewing content for, say, a test rather than learning it for the first time.Also finding things in textbooks is a real pain. It&#39;s difficult to index things in a helpful way, so you just have these counting schemes in LaTeX that increment for every definition, theorem, etc. I&#39;d love to be able to tag things then search the tags.And that says nothing for when you want to explain something that&#39;s difficult with static images. Being able to interact with animations by zooming, panning, pausing, slowing down, speeding up, etc. is a boon. (I don&#39;t think I actually saw an example of a non-static image here, but I think my point still stands.)All in all, I&#39;d love to see more interactive textbooks. We&#39;ve got this really expressive kind of document via the web. I think we should be taking advantage of it more."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wrote an entry on Wikipedia on visualizing the QR algorithm: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_algorithmThe visualization helped me spot an unstable fixed point and understand the behaviour of the algorithm near eigenvalue clashes. The behaviour&#39;s quite sophisticated.I think I wrote this there, but here goes again. The idea is that a positive-definite symmetric matrix can be visualized as an ellipse. This follows from the spectral theorem. Each iteration of the QR algorithm causes the ellipse to fall towards the x-axis, as if under the influence of gravity. The unstable fixed point corresponds to when the ellipse is standing up precariously, unable to fall in either direction. If you tilt it by just a bit, it will fall over (so the fixed point is unstable).The case when the ellipse is nearly circular (corresponding to near eigenvalue clashes) causes the ellipse to fall over slowly. I think this also makes physical sense, if you think of it being under the influence of gravity. If you think of this near-circle as being a matrix, then this matrix is nearly equal to a scalar multiple of the identity matrix, so its eigenvalues are essentially known. The fact that the ellipse falls very slowly implies that the eigenvectors are unstable near eigenvalue clashes, but the eigenvalues are easy to find.Note: The issues surrounding the unstable fixed point can be fixed using Wilkinson shifts. This makes each iteration into a discontinuous function, allowing all the fixed points to be stable. The issue surrounding instability of the eigenvectors near eigenvalue clashes cannot be fixed, as it&#39;s intrinsic to  eigendecomposition (even of symmetric matrices). The latter difficulties can be dodged by slightly perturbing the matrix, but the resulting eigenvectors can be very different from the eigenvectors of the unperturbed matrix."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This was achieved also by ignoring open issues and simply closing the bug even though the issue still exists. An example of this is:https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=21526In general, I find too much emphasis is now on &#34;closing&#34; an issue as soon as possible. I understand that open issues can be a burden for maintainers. However, filing issues, especially making them reproducible, can also be a burden to users, and users will stop filing issues if too many of them are closed unilaterally without actually correcting the root cause.As I remember it, the Emacs maintainers used to put a lot more emphasis on actually correcting issues instead of only closing them, and this may also be the reason why fewer issues are reported now.A great attraction of Emacs is how easily one can actually report issues, using Emacs itself: M-x report-emacs-bug RET."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you work for a corporation and feel overwhelmed try what the emacs people did, example for email: 1) select everything in your inbox, 2) mark as read, 3) archive. For bugs it would be unassign everything from yourself, or just close them without fixing.I&#39;ve done this several times and it&#39;s magical how you end up losing almost nothing important in the end. I think it works because if something is important enough you&#39;ll either remember it yourself or it will be communicated to you again, perhaps even via a &#34;higher priority channel&#34; such as the management chain.And if you think I&#39;m being extreme then yes, maybe, but maybe you haven&#39;t yet drowned in the never ending stream of problems for a long time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m sure others who&#39;ve spent more time in Costa Rica can provide more color, but I found it a very interesting place. There&#39;s generally an &#34;enlightened&#34; government in place with relatively low corruption.The government has prioritized important things like clean drinking water, food safety standards, power, and internet (sometimes at the tradeoff of roads). There&#39;s a national emphasis on preserving the natural ecology of the country, and there&#39;s no military. The budget for which goes into social programs, education, and health care.You can go from the Caribbean to the Pacific Ocean in a few hours, which is great. But be warned the coastal areas are both incredibly hot and humid. Fortunately, much of the country is at altitude and not nearly as hot thanks to numerous volcanoes which also feature a hot springs culture in certain areas. Because of the rain forests there&#39;s an impossible number of flora and fauna (and of course rain). All of this combines to make the country quite beautiful with some of the freshest tropical fruits you&#39;ll ever eat.The population is generally well educated, Intel used to have a chip fab there for a time and HP, Dell, Bayer, Bosch, IBM and more operate there. It&#39;s a heavily services oriented economy. Housing is affordable and the people are generally friendly enough. Food can be relatively basic, but is very filling and generally cheap.It&#39;s also fair to point out the downsides. Transportation around can be...rugged and the cities can be bogged down with traffic. The Capital city, San José...I didn&#39;t care much for...at least near the city center. It&#39;s also a very small country with a very small population (~4 million). This can be constraining for some outsiders.Overall though, I found it a fascinating and beautiful country and really did enjoy my time there. I would definitely go back given the chance. I also had a friend who lived there for several years and ran an consulting business to companies in the U.S. The timezone turned out to be rather advantageous and he was able to easy support U.S. East and West coast companies.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica"</p>
