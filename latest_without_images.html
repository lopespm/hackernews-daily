								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s another reason why touchscreens are used.  It breaks up one of the &#34;long poles&#34; in the project schedule.Hardware buttons and switches have to be designed, tested, re-designed, and validated very early in the process of designing a new model so that there is time to figure out how to manufacture / source all the parts, how they integrate with the rest of the car&#39;s systems, and how they&#39;ll be wired and assembled.  Just imagine what the impact would be if late in the process a new feature needs to be added!  Pretty much forget about it, add it in the next major model refresh.With a touchscreen all those dependencies go away.  The hardware team just says &#34;there&#39;s going to be an iPad sized capacitive touch screen here for climate/infotainment, and another custom sized display here for the instrument cluster&#34;.  The software guys can independently do the design of the UI, changing things down to the very last moment, or even after the last moment if the car can be updated."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"https://www.motorauthority.com/news/1121372_why-mazda-is-pur...Mazda learned it already and prefers HUDs. Tactile interfaces (buttons, wheels, keyboards...) perform generally better when well arranged. Mercedes did a good job about that thirty years ago. Logical layout, one button one task, LEDs within a button representing the status and the buttons arranged in the layout of the seat.I wonder how a complete industry just assumed that touchscreens are somewhat better just because their widespread in smartphones. Smartphone are small devices, require visual attention, every app is different and distracts the users, touchscreens are cheap and - therefore working on them is slow. Apple and Lenovo tried both the add a &#34;TouchBar&#34; but the tacticle keyboard has proven to be better. Apple tried also a touch area in Apple Remote, the current one is back to tactile buttons ;)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I drive a 2007 pre-touchscreen car, and have told the dealer every time I go in for service (yeah, yeah) that I will hold on to this car until the bitter end because it has physical buttons. I tell them &#34;I can &#39;touch type&#39; this car&#34; i.e. I never need to take my eyes off the road in order make a critical adjustment.I&#39;ve driven a LOT of rental cars in the last 5 years, and the de-standardization of the interface elements -- even how to shift!, increasing distraction and eye-aversion has made the highway driving experience much worse - both as a driver and someone who has to share the roads with distracted people baffled by their cars."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Craig here from Crunchy. Pretty excited to ship this. It started with one of our engineers showing up in slack 6 weeks ago &#34;So I did something crazy over the weekend...&#34; from there it evolved into much more.The post explains a lot of the high level, but we&#39;re going to being doing some deeper dives as well including the build process, but also some of how the tutorials are powered by an internal notion doc which allows us to easily iterate and collaborate on the tutorials themselves.Perhaps our favorite easter egg is that you can bring your own SQL into it for example: https://www.crunchydata.com/developers/playground?sql=https:..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is so awesome for two reasons, Postgress isn&#39;t exactly easy to setup, this makes it so much easer for tutorials, anything that makes teaching it quicker is good!It&#39;s also an amazing demonstration of the power of WASM, I am utterly convinced that DBs running in browser via WASM on top of the &#34;coming soon&#34; filesystem/block store api [0] will be the future of all offline first apps. I think it&#39;s going to be SQLite that really sines here (it will be a smaller package), but if you can run Postgres in browser, you potentially have a close alignment between your server and browser implementations.I love the idea of running Django in browser via PyScript with Postgres!0: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileSystem - This API doesn&#39;t grant access to the users file system, but a local virtual one just for the website. It will operate at the block level so can be used to provide efficient persistent storage for WASM DBs.—Edit rather than replying individually:It’s so important when teaching people a new thing, like sql, to hit the ground running. A lot of these people will have no experience with Docker, package managers or compiling from source. It’s so important to make technology accessible to all. This does that! Imagine high school kids having a lesson on SQL and running Postgres’s just by opening a webpage!We shouldn’t assume that someone learning Postgres, or just SQL via it, is a developer with experience of other areas of development or system administration."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Sometimes non-accounting people get hung-up on the words &#34;debit&#34; and &#34;credit&#34; and think they have to do with &#34;owing&#34; or &#34;being owed&#34; money. The effect of a debit or credit on the business depends on the accounts in the transaction and debit and credit don&#39;t have anything to do with the &#34;direction&#34; of a flow of money.My 100-level accounting instructor summarized it as: &#34;A debit is the entry in the left column, and a credit is an entry in the right column.&#34; Without the context of the specific accounts being debited or credited the terms themselves mean nothing.Aside: A 100-level knowledge of accounting can confer near &#34;super powers&#34; when it comes to dealing with finance and accounting people. Double-entry bookkeeping is one of the oldest and longest-practiced &#34;IT&#34; disciplines. Your work probably touches revenue / expenses for your employer and someday you&#39;ll need to interface with accounting or finance people. Being able to speak the language, even poorly, has helped me gain trust and credibility that I don&#39;t believe speaking only in IT terms would have."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Any time the idea of double entry bookkeeping comes up there is nothing but unanimous advocacy for it. This thread echoes the same sentiment where there&#39;s several comments about the importance of double entry. And yet like all previous endorsements I&#39;ve heard, I&#39;ve not been able to take away why it is so important. The reasons are always around error tracking, tracing source of funds, standing the test of time etc. and yet in my head I&#39;m not able to envision the specific problem double entry can solve that single entry cannot.Somewhere in my head I feel a double entry system makes sense if you have two different parties making respective entry. But if it&#39;s all with a single party, single entry system should be equivalent to a double entry system. My accounting concepts are weak so I&#39;m unable to justify. Hoping someone with more expertise can shed some light here."</p>

- double entry transfer

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s good to see Martijn Braam fought the good fight on things like the PinePhone Pro bootloader in eMMC, and I&#39;m sorry to hear the situation became untenable.After Pine64 went to all the trouble to make a series of branded early developer editions for various distros, and ongoing community goodwill outreaches, I didn&#39;t expect something like this to happen.IMHO, any handheld hardware right now wanting to be open and sustainable Linux should probably start by making sure it&#39;s solid with PostmarketOS configured with a mainline kernel, as a good test.  (PostmarketOS is a litmus test for purity, and has had a bunch of work to make bringing it up easier than the usual server/desktop purity test of Debian.)  Working Phosh and Plasma userlands running atop PostmarketOS are good further tests.  Supporting additional distros, userlands, and hacking is also important.(Even if the hardware is something like the Purism Librem 5, which has invested heavily in lots of good distro work, if PostmarketOS with mainline kernel boots cleanly and runs solidly, that&#39;s a good sign.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unless PINE64 changes course hard, I think this will be the moment they died, so to say. They may keep making SBCs etc alongside other vendors but the phones/tablets/laptops/watches/etc would continue being novelties and realistically majority e-waste. Really quite sad. If I&#39;d name one single person in the FLOSS community who&#39;s done the most good for mobile open source, it&#39;d be OP. Thank you so much for your service, work, and patience up until now.I fail to understand the reasoning of PINE64 on stuff like this recently. It&#39;s like they became a spiritually fundamentally different company. Can&#39;t see how this is supposed to make them money either.&gt; Now I can just focus on making postmarketOS work better. On the PINE64 hardware, and all the many other devices supported by postmarketOS...Maybe not so terrible after all. For a while there I almost thought pmOS was"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this is the inevitable outcome of any movement of Linux to the mainstream (Purism has done something similar). As Martijn said in the article, PinePhone devices were operable with 25 different projects. That&#39;s 25 different variations of Linux fighting over market share. As Pine enters a growth phase for their business, the consequences of this are going to manifest as paralysis.Improvements and advancements would stagnate due to the 25x duplicated effort, and resources would be lost in keeping those projects happy. Also, any potential user looking to switch would be deluged with options, which is what crippled desktop Linux.While I do not understand enough about Pine to know why they specifically made the business decision to gut their dev community and go with Manjaro Linux, my guess would be something along the lines of Manjaro&#39;s widespread dominance as a top Linux distro backed by a powerful foundation. Pine is pivoting to what they have decided is their future: a full-stack hardware to software open source offering that in their eyes would have a better shot at cracking open the phone market.They probably were aware of the consequences, but have bet on making it big and creating a new, streamlined ecosystem after extinguishing this one. It remains to be seen if they will succeed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I started off feeling hopeful/excited by OpenAI, GPT-3, DALL-E, etc, as a creator/writer. As time has progressed and I&#39;ve used these tools and other machine learning tools to create media, I&#39;ve become disillusioned. It feels as if this is about to explode an existing problem, namely, there&#39;s too much content in the world already. Lowering the effort bar for content creation and generation is, in some ways, going to cause a deluge of low-quality/mid-quality content to be generated.I wonder if we&#39;ll see a new generation of &#34;editors&#34; showing up to help curate and provide some guidance in terms of what to play if you&#39;re limited on time. I often go through the new releases on Steam and I&#39;m amazed at how many games are released that have zero reviews, or less than 5 reviews, yet people are still constantly releasing more and more.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"One topic I&#39;d like to see more discussion around is how best to set up staging environments for Docker Compose projects.Ever since the V2 migration, I&#39;ve been banging my head against multiple bugs in Docker Compose itself, which has severely damaged my trust in it as a production-ready utility. I no longer feel like I can safely update Compose without running extensive testing on each release.For example, my journey since migrating to V2 has been:* Originally on 1.29.2  - Stable and I did not encounter any issues.

* Swapped to 2.3.3.  - As part of the migration from V1, docker-compose lost track of several networks and started labeling them as external. Not a huge deal.

  - docker-compose stopped updating containers when the underlying image or configuration changed (#9291). This broke prod for a while until I noticed nothing was getting updated.

* Updated to 2.7.0, which was the latest release at the time.  - This introduced a subtle bug with env_file parsing (#9636), which again broke prod in subtle ways that took a while to figure out.

* Updated to 2.8.0, which was the latest release at the time and before the warning was put up.  * This broke a lot of things as it renamed containers and generated duplicate services, etc.

* Finally swapped to 2.9.0. No issues yet, but I&#39;m keeping an eye out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like to divide up my compose files into three:1. A `docker-compose.yaml` for basic configuration common among all environments2. A `docker-compose.dev.yaml` for configuration overrides specific to development3. A `docker-compose.prod.yaml` for configuration overrides specific to productionThen I have `COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yaml:docker-compose.dev.yaml` in my `.env` file in the root of the project so I can just run `docker compose up` in dev, and `COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yaml:docker-compose.prod.yaml` in a `prod.env` file so I can run `docker compose --env-file=prod.env up` in production. Sometimes also a `staging.env` file which is identical to `prod.env` but with a few different environment variables.It&#39;s been working pretty well for me so far."</p>
