								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Another way of looking at this scoreboard is as an approximate inverse ranking of webmail client security and leak vectors, with Gmail stripping far more dangerous elements than most webmail clients.This is actually a great tool to find vulnerabilities in various webmail clients such as ProtonMail and Hey, just compare the HTML or CSS features they do not yet filter compared to Gmail, then do a search for &#34;[feature] + exploit&#34; to see how a feature could be abused, and then submit a bounty report.For example, there are alot of good reasons that you may not want your webmail rendering SVG images (mXSS, appcache poisoning) or allowing CSS variables or imports.And I&#39;m pretty sure the list supported by Gmail could also be narrowed down further. There are some fantastic bounties lurking in here, just waiting to be discovered."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; we settled on $11,000 per month as a baseline salary for working full-time on open source.&gt; For now, Nicolò, Henry, and Jùnliàng will all be paid a temporary rate of $6,000 per month. This doesn&#39;t solve the problem,I used to donate to Babel, before they made it apparent they are just interested in funneling the money to one developer. 11K per month?! That is absolutely bananas and same reaction I had the last time this came up, but this time I cannot do anything as a reaction as I&#39;ve already pulled my funding.But my guess is that a lot of people feel the same way, as the donations seems to be going down. 11K per month could pay for many developers if you hire people outside of Sillicon Valley, which since you&#39;re doing open source, you should really really consider.Open source is not &#34;VC fueled develoment&#34; and I don&#39;t think we should go that way either. Make your operation nimble and survive on little, otherwise you&#39;ll soon disappear. Optimize for sustainability, not for paying the one of the highest salary in the world (minus SV bubble of course).It&#39;s not wonder Babel is going the way it&#39;s going, as the economy you&#39;ve setup for yourself is nowhere near sustainable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This whole thread is basically a testament as to why the OSS model, unfortunately, is broken. Very competent people are expected to write widely used software for a salary that basically merely guarantees subsistence. It never ceases to amaze me how great software engineers allow themselves to be exploited in such a way. If you consider the societal impact that some of these projects have and the skill set that some of their maintainers have, which pretty much dwarfs the skill sets of people in other well paid professions such as lawyers or doctors, it&#39;s frankly ridiculous that they are expected to work for significantly less money. Not to mention that the abstractions some of these people wrote basically allow a significant number of people to enter the industry in the first place."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Savage of Sebastian to call out Henry like that on twitter. Are you on drugs or something?
https://twitter.com/sebmck/status/1392019586833387522Publicly accusing Henry of not actually working on the project seems short sighted. Only looking at a one year slice of contribution rather than the lifetime of the project masks the full picture of Henry&#39;s contributions. Also in Henry&#39;s defense, the past year has been a terribly difficult one for most all of us to get through this pandemic.Not a good look for you Sebastian. Feels like you are looking for a place to point blame and unfortunately decided to direct that blame in Henry&#39;s direction. Henry Zhu is a great developer and contributor. Really deserves better than this."</p>

I have experience designing and building 70&#34; industrial displays that utilize Samsung LCD panels. These &#34;industrial&#34; panels are normally twice the price of consumer grade ones but are designed to operate 24/7 with a MTBF of 100k hours (approx. 11 years) and are usually twice the brightness of normal ones (a very noticeable difference).

If the Amazon project succeeds, I would expect in a few months most home devices manufacturers, to partner to implement it so they have a way to circumvent users choices."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a blatant attempt at using their market power to gain a dominant position in IoT connectivity by creating a parallel Network where Net Neutrality does not apply. If this succeeds, only Amazon approved devices will be allowed on this global Network connecting only to aws provided services thereby establishing a monopoly on non-cellular IoT connectivity.
After Apples recent move in the same direction with their „find my“ mesh network of apple devices being used to introduce a whole new mode of operation to support their Air Tags the Question of Net Neutrality has to be extended from just ISPs to Dominant Platforms that have the ability to create derivative Mesh-Networks."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Future Wi-Fi devices will be able to see through your home and business walls, for activity monitoring and biometric identification, https://www.theregister.com/2021/03/31/wifi_devices_monitori...&gt; In three years or so, the Wi-Fi specification is scheduled to get an upgrade that will turn wireless devices into sensors capable of gathering data about the people and objects bathed in their signals... When 802.11bf will be finalized and introduced as an IEEE standard in September 2024, Wi-Fi will cease to be a communication-only standard and will legitimately become a full-fledged sensing paradigm... tracking can be done surreptitiously because Wi-Fi signals can penetrate walls, don&#39;t require light, and don&#39;t offer any visible indicator of their presence.IEEE 802.11bf paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14918Papers on device-free wireless sensing (DFWS): https://dhalperi.github.io/linux-80211n-csitool/Remote sensing with low-cost ESP32 and 802.11n: https://academic.oup.com/jcde/article/7/5/644/5837600"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the industry response[1]:&gt;  &#34;It’s important to note that there is presently no evidence of the vulnerabilities being used against Wi-Fi users maliciously and these issues are mitigated through routine device updates once updated firmware becomes available.&gt; &#34;Like many previous vulnerabilities, FragAttacks has been academically well-researched and responsibly reported in a manner allowing the industry to proactively prepare and begin to roll out updates that fully eliminate the vulnerabilities. This set of vulnerabilities requires a potential attacker to be physically within range of the Wi-Fi network (or user device) in order to exploit it. This significantly reduces the likelihood of actual exploitation or attack.&#34;[1] https://www.commscope.com/blog/2021/wi-fi-alliance-discloses..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; By default devices don&#39;t send fragmented frames. This means that the mixed key attack and the fragment cache attack, on their own, will be hard to exploit in practice, unless Wi-Fi 6 is used. When using Wi-Fi 6, which is based on the 802.11ax standard, a device may dynamically fragment frames to fill up available airtime.Why does this feel like Spectre? We&#39;re trying to speed things up in a way that eventually blows back into our face."</p>

You get the alert if the tag is planted on your person/vehicle and following you around, not if it happens to be sitting still in a location that you frequent.The alternative is being constantly bombarded with alerts because other residents of an apartment building also own AirTags, which is not going to be useful to anyone."</p>

Similar to how I can opt-in to sharing analytics with Apple.I just might help out. But the idea that by owning an iPhone I&#39;m automatically opted into this and I can&#39;t (temporarily) disable it is concerning. Especially since the feature to alert users of the possible privacy invasion outlined here, seems to not yet be working as advertised.It&#39;s unclear to me if the &#34;Participate in &#39;Find My Network&#39;&#34; option is what I&#39;m talking about.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Dr. Martin Loetzsch did a great video, ETL Patterns with Postgres. He covers some really good topics:- Instead of updating tables build their replacements under a different name then rename them. This makes updating heavy-to-compute table instant. Works even for schemas: rebuild a schema  as schemaname_next rename the current to schemaname_old then rename schemaname_next to schemaname.- Keep all the source data raw and disable WAL, you don&#39;t need it for ETL.- Set memory limitis high.And lots of other good tips for doing ETL/DW in postgres. It&#39;s here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwNi21jAm4I really appreciate having data in postgres. It&#39;s often easy to think that a specialised DW tool will solve all your problems, but that often fails to consider things like:- Developer experience. Postgres runs very easily on a local machine, more specialized solutions often don&#39;t or are tricky to setup.- Learning another tool costs time. A developer can learn postgres really well in the time it takes them to figure out how to use several more specialised tools. And many devs already know postgres because it&#39;s pretty much the default  DB nowadays.- Analytics queries often don&#39;t need to run at warp speed. Bigquery might give you the answer in a second but if postgres does it in a minute and it&#39;s a weekly report, who cares?- Postgres is boring and has been around for many years now, it will probably still be here in 10 years so time spent learning it is time well spent. More niche systems will probably be superseded by fancier, faster replacements.I would go so far as to say don&#39;t necessarily need to split out your DW from your prod DB in every case. As soon as you start splitting out a DW to a separate server you need some way to keep it in sync, so you&#39;ll probably end up duplicating some business logic for a report, maintaining some ingestion app, shuffling data around S3 or whatever. Keeping your analytics in your prod DB (or just a snapshot of yesterdays DB) is often good enough and means you will be more likely to avoid gnarly business-rules going out of sync between your app and your DW."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A new Postgres-based darling is TimescaleDB.  It’s a drop-in for Postgres.It is a hybrid row column store with excellent compression and performance.It would be interesting to see how it compares if narrator would try it out.  Benchmarks would be cool.One very neat feature I am enamored  by is “continuous aggregates”.  These are materialized views that auto-update as you change the fact table.Continuous aggregates are a great idea.  InfluxDB had “continuous queries” (but the implementation of influx generally is not so neat), and firebolt has “aggregate indexes” which are much the same thing.I think all olap dbs will eventually have them as staple, and that they will trickle down into oltp too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Avoid Common Table Expressions (or upgrade to 12)Upgrading to 12 (or 13) seems like the better option here, whenever you&#39;re able to do so. The improvements are very much worth it."</p>

The only reason they were going for $179 previously is because thermoworks was buying the thermometers from sellers and reporting them as counterfeit. Thus making it difficult for sellers to sell them which keeps supply low.They have fraudulently filed copyright removals and counterfeit accusations on amazon multiple times for Thermapen listings that don&#39;t use the &#34;thermoworks&#34; name.You can see that thermoworks does not own the Thermapen trademark.https://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&amp;state=4803:hv...Edit: apparently, you can&#39;t link to a trademark search directly, so you would need to go to the basic search and enter&#34;Thermapen&#34;.https://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/gate.exe?f=login&amp;p_lang=engli..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The aspect I find most interesting and internationally relevant is that as these local rulings proliferate, they kinda make it visible to what degree companies finance their operations by selling user data.  The more the business model relies on this, the more likely companies are to get hit with a ruling like this — and it&#39;s not just the ruling that&#39;s interesting, but also what Facebook&#39;s reaction will be.  If they stop offering or reduce WhatsApp services in Germany (or India), that&#39;s a great indicator that the service isn&#39;t profitable without the sale (or other commercial exploitation, Facebook is an ad company after all) of large amounts of user data."</p>

He also asked a panel of European Union data regulators to take action and issue a ruling across the 27-nation bloc. The new WhatsApp terms enabling the data scoop are invalid because they are intransparent, inconsistent and overly broad, he said."</p>

I have a fresh wave of friends who tell me I should reinstall WA, because they &#34;don&#39;t do data sharing in Germany&#34;.I note that their terms still say that they do share data; they just have a PR line outside the terms that says they&#39;ll do it as soon as they &#34;reach an agreement&#34; with regulators.I further note that their entire business model for WA depends on sharing data for advertising.

We want to secure national security via chip manufacturing and you want billions of dollars? Give us some upside.I don&#39;t want to hear it creates jobs, it generates blah blah blah, a real equity stake and possibly repayment of the capital. Creating jobs should be a happy by-product of subsidizing an industry that is probably more well capitalized than any other in existence.According to (https://startupanz.com/5-tech-giants-hold-588b-cash-reserves...) Amazon, Apple, Google, and Microsoft had 526 billion dollars between the four of them in cash reserves. They have over half a TRILLION dollars in cash. If this were life or death, they could afford anything.But the calculus is offload risk onto the tax payer (despite being a shareholder directly in all those companies or indirectly via mutual funds/etfs), I don&#39;t want to be left holding the bag with no upside beyond the general sentiment of &#39;national security was secured&#39; while private companies reap all the benefits."</p>
