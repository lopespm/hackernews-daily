								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Tauri – Electron alternative written in Rust - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29807022 - Jan 2022 (419 comments)(The cutoff for dupes is a year or so: https://news.ycombinator.com/newsfaq.html)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In my curious search for lighter Electron alternatives to implement Zoho Writer&#39;s (https://writer.zoho.com) desktop app: I found Sciter[1]It supports multiplatform app development with HTML/JS/CSS and the entire engine&#39;s runtime is just about 5MB which is unbelievably small!I further analysed how this was possible, what I found was beyond fascinating.1. The author has wrote a compiler that supports JS with useful extensions like classes and fancy stuff, even before ES6 came into existence.2. He had built his own layouting engine that understands HTML and CSS 3.0Basically he&#39;s built a custom browser engine, but custom tailored for writing multi-platform apps. So it&#39;s super-fast without as much memory taxes. It&#39;s not backed by a BigCo or a huge community (I guess) and I&#39;m not sure whether I&#39;ll pick it for a business critical app. But the way it&#39;s architected seems far superior than the shortcut approaches that Electron or most other alternatives take.The project is not even new. It&#39;s more than a decade old which itself is amazing.[1] https://sciter.com"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not to rain on the parade, but:- What&#39;s the point of mentioning Rust when the heavylifting is done by the system&#39;s webview widget, and applications are written in HTML/CSS/JS, just as in Electron?- Isn&#39;t the whole point of Electron to have version/feature stability for the browser APIs by bundling a specific Chromium runtime? Without this requirement, it was also trivial before Electron showed up to write a small native wrapper application around the system-provided webview widget."</p>

					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31769601">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’m the CEO of Triplebyte. I just looked into this, and we are not automatically making anyone&#39;s profile public without their consent. OP, it looks like you had set your profile to be visible some time ago (I can provide details via email but won’t here for privacy purposes), and just hadn’t gotten a message until now. The support response you received was incorrect; you weren’t affected by any recent changes to the site.Since there wasn’t anything broken on our end, there shouldn’t be anyone else impacted by this. But as part of making sure that OP wasn’t visible by mistake, I had my team double-checked to make sure our previous fix from last year was properly retroactive. It was.More generally, I don&#39;t think that tricking anyone is a viable way for us to run a business. We’re trying to create a marketplace that can open opportunities for engineers who wouldn’t otherwise have them, and we need the trust of engineers in order to do that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I totally forgot about Triplebyte.  Are they even relevant still?  I remember back when it seemed like their ads were appearing everywhere and was a bit worried they were going to be the new way of hiring engineering talent.  Seems like there&#39;s been nothing but crickets chirping for the last few years.Why?  My experience with them was pretty bad.  I took their assessment for web development, I think I even did an assignment, and got put on a video call with someone from Triplebyte.  He never cracked a smile.  Suddenly I got asked a bunch of CS questions that really were not very relevant to web development, some of which were entirely inappropriate like sorting a binary search tree.  I even told the guy that I thought I was getting those questions wrong and he just scowled and said &#34;well you just don&#39;t know when you&#39;re going to use this stuff.&#34;  &#34;My point exactly,&#34; I thought.Ultimately I got rejected.The whole idea that you can boil down a candidate to some coding challenges and a video quiz is bad.  I do like the idea of streamlining the hiring process for developers, but there&#39;s more to it than knowing a bunch of stuff, because that can be gamed.  And quizzing me on irrelevant material was a bad move.  A firm like Triplebyte won&#39;t be as good at interviewing a candidate as the employer itself, and may even keep perfectly qualified candidates out of view from all employers affiliated with them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I went through their process, passed in their top cohort (or so they told me, probably it was to massage my ego). And then they dropped that public profile bomb the first time around.I’d say I cost them a lot of money when I deleted my account, but they actually cost it themselves.They could have asked me if I wanted a fancy jacket, because that ended up immediately getting recycled. The book was dece thoAnyways, I ended up getting a job that I love the old fashioned way - through a friend.Great concept, shit company.Edit: Triplebyte employees reading this: you massively betrayed my trust. Had you asked me, and let me review on my own time, I might have even been proud to have a verified skill set badge page I could link to. Instead, I will probably look directly for your competitors on my next job search. You had a great idea, too bad that you seem to be irresponsible."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">".NET is the most open, non-trivial ecosystem I have ever participated in.I experienced 2 different problems with .NET (back in 2.x/3.x days), and was able to have interaction with the actual MS developers on their Github issue page without any sort of bullshit overhead process.Within days, I saw traction on my comments and within months I saw PRs that ultimately resolved the issue I presented. The following year, I was deploying framework code to my customers&#39; instances which incorporated fixes to my concerns.Perhaps I am unaware of just how much better it is with the other ecosystems, but for me this is enough interaction with my framework vendor.Are we upset that we have to pay money for the privilege of using other peoples&#39; intellectual property? Or are we asserting that Microsoft is stealing other peoples&#39; IP? I am trying to find the actual crime here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is exactly the same as what MS did for the Python extension when the open-source LSP was replaced by the proprietary Pylance. I get the feeling that MS becomes more and more likes Google. For example, on Android, the core experience is provided by GMS while the AOSP is provided as an open-source core. In terms of VSCode, the core editor is free and open-source, but some key experience is baked by proprietary components (e.g., Remote plugins, Pylance, etc.). And the trending is that more and more plugins which are controlled by MS are moving towards to a mixture of open-source code and proprietary components."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This sort of thing has been MS&#39;s playbook since I was a kid, or earlier.  It surprises me that people are still surprised when things like this happen.  I especially think someone with Miguel de Icaza&#39;s experience should know better[0].It&#39;s interesting to see the generational difference here. Many of my somewhat-younger (even only by 7-10 years) programmer/techie friends just don&#39;t remember the Microsoft of the 80s and 90s, and see all the &#34;good&#34; they&#39;ve been doing with the open source community in more recent times, and think MS is a pretty good corporate citizen in the tech world.But in reality, MS has just done a great job whitewashing their image[1] in the past 15 years, especially in the past 8 years since Ballmer stepped down and Nadella took the reins. I do believe they&#39;re a better, less anti-competitive company than they used to be. But they&#39;re still the same company in many ways. I think a big part of their &#34;play nice&#34; strategy was born out of necessity, since they heavily dropped the ball in the late 90s/early 00s when the internet/WWW was really coming into its own, and then again in the early/mid 10s when Windows Phone failed miserably. They just lost the clout to do the anti-competitive bullshit they used to pull. But the desire to do all this stuff is still there.[0] It was clear to me that MS intended .NET to be a wholly-proprietary, Windows-only technology until de Icaza and co. built Mono, when MS grudgingly embraced it.  This proprietary extension feels like their standard follow-on of &#34;extend and extinguish&#34;, though it&#39;s coming a bit later than we&#39;d expect.[1] Bill Gates has also done an amazing job rehabilitating his image through philanthropy.  A lot of people forget how his actions at MS probably held back progress in the computing industry for at least a decade (or two?), through forced lock-in and anti-competitive behavior."</p>
