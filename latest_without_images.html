								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Amsterdam local here — in fact, I live in exactly this street. Where the first cartel guy gets subdued is where I get my coffee, and the people that live in the canal houses are my neighbors. (My house may or may not be in the map, would have to play the game to check.)Fun facts:(1) A year or two ago several guys spent days using some sort of device to scan all buildings in our street. They got complaints from several bar owners and tenants as they appeared to be taking photographs inside the buildings, and they wouldn’t explain why. I wouldn’t be be surprised if it was for this map.(2) The footage is hyperrealistic not just graphically, they got the details right with surprising accuracy. Even the garbage bins are in exactly the right place. (It’s also not unlikely that a guy could be subdued like this without people being too surprised, as tourists like to use this district to get wasted 24/7.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Though it does look great, i wish more games focused on actually being fun to play instead of having long cut scenes and micro transactions.Ironically other than the fact that you have to pay per game and that you’re often forced to die, I prefer arcade games. They generally minimize friction to playedit: to clarify, I mean games with good graphics specifically. There are many great games (especially indie) out there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It looks incredible.Although this beautiful recreation is missing the endless tourists aimlessly walking on bike paths and the very loud conversations between Dutch people (their talking volume is what many of us consider yelling, but that&#39;s just normal).Once we get VR headsets that are maybe twice as good as the best now, and we have high quality simulations, the scifi stories of people choosing living in unreality seem more plausible."</p>

A small fine and a promise not to do it any more. This should basically be the end of that company entirely. Instead they just have to point the finger at some low-level managers, fire them, and keep on rolling. I would think criminal charges are warranted for importing 12 and 13 year-olds for labor. The children can&#39;t consent. That&#39;s essentially child slave labor.If Hyundai/Kia drops them, that would at least be a much bigger penalty than the DOL imposed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m bullish on this because mobile (and web) development is ridiculously overcomplicated to a beginner. I think it&#39;s a common misconception that coding/logic is difficult. I find the development setup and deployment to be much more complicated. As evidence, take a look at the impressive workarounds that citizen developers use to make things work in an easy environment like Excel.A keyboard and mouse probably solve most of the complaints in this thread."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I want a token based keyboard with the following propertiesLanguage and syntax awareness. When I’m writing JavaScript - it should provide keys for ‘if’ ‘each’ ‘function’ etc.When I have unbalanced parens, braces etc, it should tell me how many levels deep I am and what context I’m in.Instead of me naming variables it should generate random names and let me declare with a single tap. Provide easy refactoring tools so I can rename them later.On mobile I want to manipulate symbols or the AST directly rather than rely on text input.Take advantage of a keyboard that can display infinite variation and change on the fly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a teacher the basic Replit stuff is great, but their class management stuff is atrocious and unintuitive. For example, under one class I created 9 units with a number of challenges under each unit. You copy that to a new class (Team is what they call it) and all sections disappear). Then if you want to reorganize, even if there are sections, you have to drag and drop, scrolling up or down the page and repeating the drag to get it to the right section.Another thing is when you organize sections there is no drag and drop, but arrows moving boxes up and down.I&#39;ve sent in dozens of issues for various bugs and annoyances, and even dug into the js to point out how to fix things, but after nearly 2 years they are still there."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I used to use Ubuntu for everything and was very happy in the massive Ubuntu ecosystem with a .deb for everything till I was forced to use Snap a few releases ago for installing even some basic utils I used on a daily basis. I then had Snap constantly hang on installs and just break for no apparent reason and waste my time debugging it. It didn&#39;t &#34;just work&#34; anymore.Swapped to Arch and haven&#39;t looked back yet, Arch took me a lot more work to get set up but once it was it&#39;s been pretty invisible, which is how I like my OS to be.I&#39;d probably happily swap back to Ubuntu if I read somewhere that Snap was removed entirely/canceled or something."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The regular as clockwork bi-yearly releases are one of the best things about Ubuntu. Ubuntu is the default supported Linux laptop/desktop env in so many tech orgs.If you use Ubuntu and want to help ensure it works for your env remember to test the upcoming release alphas / betas eg with USB boot stick and file bugs on Launchpad if you notice something broken.(Same goes for other distros your org may use, eg Debian, Fedora etc)Snaps mostly work great, and are a great improvement for keepign up to date sw available for people using LTS releases. This and the security improvements brought by the sandboxing greatly overshadow the sometime teething problems of the system."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s not surprising at all. All of these review-driven P2P marketplace businesses end up with the same problem. After the initial phase of early adopters that offer generally high quality products, a flood of fake or low-quality listing tries to squeeze money out of the platform. These people are not listing their homes on Airbnb, they are trying to make a living by extracting as much money from the platform as they possibly can. They don&#39;t care if they&#39;re banned or reported. They&#39;ll just make a new fake account. Low ratings? No problem, just pay for some fake reviews.The same is true for Amazon and other marketplace business. It&#39;s overrun by Amazon FBA sellers selling cheap low-quality white-labeled Alibaba products. It&#39;s almost impossible to find real brands or high-quality products these days, unless you specifically know what to search for.How to deal with it? Personally I&#39;ve started going back to hotels to be safe. If I do use Airbnb, I do a lot of research on the host and reviews and assume the place I&#39;m getting is 80% worse than what the pictures show.Other examples: App Store app reviews, restaurant review apps and food delivery apps. Fortunately it&#39;s not a big deal if these are scams. It&#39;s just a few dollars. Sucks much more when it&#39;s your vacation rental."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This stuff is incredibly common in short term rental market.  You are scraping the bottom of the barrel on landlord scruples.There was a recent fire in a summer vacation town popular with NYers.
The town requires summer short term rental landlords to get a permit &amp; inspection.
The landlord did not get one.
The landlord also had sketchy kitchen wiring that was probably some sort of DIY and not up to code.
The landlord had removed batteries and hardwiring from 3 smoke detectors.
These are the kind of things the inspector would have found immediately.A family visiting from out of state lost 2 of their 3 children in this fire.Apps like AirBnB create the facade of officialness on what are instead very sketchy markets.  Family probably thought they were doing the right thing going through an app and the landlord must be verified and more &#34;legit&#34;.  Being from out of state they wouldn&#39;t know the intricacies of local town permit&amp;inspection requirements and how to check if the landlord has one, etc.Likewise in my condo in NYC, we had one particular owner who was trying to use their unit as an Airbnb.  Regardless of the local laws which were tightening up at the time, our condo expressly forbid short term rentals, and had language around minimum length of stay and lease approval requirements.  It only stopped when we started fining them $1000 per incident.Stuff like this matters because you buy a condo to live in it and don&#39;t expect the unit on the other side of your bedroom wall to essentially be a hotel room with new neighbors every 3 days, staying up all hours (vacation, yay), dragging suitcases in&amp;out at odd hours multiple times per week.. forever.The building itself takes on a lot more wear &amp; tear, and they put a burden on staff as they think the building porter&amp;doorman are there for them like a hotel concierge and front desk."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If only there was some regulation for such services that would require some sort of standard. You know some sort of licensing by the state. /sThis is what you get when you skirt laws, artificially lowering prices to kill competition and exploit workers. Stop complaining, it&#39;s your own doing for supporting this type of economy. Only because maybe some of those existing laws were cumbersome or outdated doesn&#39;t mean you just go around all of them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’m a programmer with MS.  Like you, diagnosed about 15 years ago, but still doing pretty well.  I feel like I’m starting to notice the gradual decline more and more, despite not having had a serious clinical relapse for about 10 years (some minor ones).Things you can try:
Changing your drugs - maybe going for something drastic like HSCT.Being patient and not panicking - if you’re currently having flare ups your symptoms will appear worse than they really are while there’s acute inflammation happening.  Don’t forget that.  If the flare ups get under control you’ll should see some recovery and improvement.Not giving up - keep pushing yourself as hard as you can, make sure you’re training whatever’s left of your central nervous capacity.  There’s probably still some left.  Keep trying to do as much as you can and you’ll get access to it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Also had it for 15 years, I was sharper in my 20s than now but now and I think age and MS have affected that. I realise I&#39;m at my best when not stressed, well rested and happy. However I&#39;m not always in control of those. Stress is easier to deal with as I talk to my employers about my condition and I avoid anything stressful when possible. I still feel useless some days and have bad brain fog and can&#39;t think clearly, it gives me a lot of imposter syndrome.Im currently moving somewhere else to get better rest. And my happiness is in progress, I tried anti depressants but I get anxiety and I tried CBT but it didn&#39;t work either. I do also swim regularly which helps too but still not enough. Im hoping this move will help. However its gone on for so many years that I think I will seek a professional soon.Covid and the pandemic definitely affected me, I couldn&#39;t walk properly for weeks after recovering from it. I used to do 20min walk every day to recover and just to keep active and get out. My depression got worse (was getting CBT in days before lockdown) but a few friends of mine play regularly online so I got to be social at least and talk about it. To add to this, I also quit my job before lockdown to travel so I was unemployed for a year in pandemic. I remember going to cafes when things partially opened to practise interview questions and did little projects. I finally got a job the next year.I&#39;m still worried I won&#39;t be strong enough to travel one day, my max distance walking is 1.5km, give or take, without a rest, I could go a lot further only a few years ago.I know MS affects everyone differently and it can be a very hidden condition. My life could of been quite different without it but it could have been worse. Im lucky to have found a job coding and the silver lining of the pandemic is wfh. I see it like you have to play with the cards your dealt and whatever you can change for the better then try to. It&#39;s not been an easy road till now but I try and remain hopeful for the future.I know it must be even harder considering your circumstances and your health. I hope this helps to know your not alone at least."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have MS and definitely didn&#39;t know that the secondary progressive form of the disease was just a matter of time.  Now I&#39;m slowly losing the right side of my body after years of being in remission with numbness in my hands being the only symptom.
 There are definitely medical advances.  The one I&#39;m most excited about is nervgen. It&#39;s regenerative without the radiation and terribleness of stem cells.  But it&#39;s only starting phase two trials.
Hang in there, it sucks but the doctors reassure me that it&#39;s a good time to have MS as thirty years ago there were no treatments.
Now there is the walking pill to help nerves conduct and it really works for me. There are also dmts that slow the progression or stop future lesions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I made that image![1]. And this is not the first time it&#39;s been on the front page of HN either[2]. So I&#39;d like to share some context that I&#39;ve not mentioned elsewhere before.My father died from alcoholism in 2004. He made his living writing software (hence why I do too, and why I enjoy HN). But he also, for a short time, taught Astronomy evening classes. I&#39;ve always felt short-changed by the emotional absence and traumatic passing of my male parent. But the continued virality of this image has been some sort of magical glimmer from the depths of the universe that it was still his shoulders that I stood on in order to reach where I am today. Maybe it was the glint in his eyes every time he showed me the latest APOD image[3], and the deep love with which he would explain their contexts. I made this composite image of Andromeda and the moon precisely because of that extra commentary, or rather I should say, extra love, of the night sky that my father gave me. Seeing it here, sparkling in the &#34;night sky&#34; of the HN front page stirs the same kind of wonder I sometimes feel catching those million year old specks of light above my head. Reminding me that though the universe is mostly cold and dark that doesn&#39;t diminish its warmth and brightness.1. https://www.reddit.com/r/spaceporn/comments/1u0dxs/andromeda...2. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=229923843. https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This (or some sort of very similar comparison) prompted me to figure out how to locate Andromeda. And I could not see anything, So I bought a nice pair of binoculars, and perhaps I could see something, but it was impossible to tell for sure. until I went camping in Arizona, I was looking at the stars, I remembered how to find Andromeda, remembered my binoculars. everything had came together and there it was! it looked like a blue mist.But really it was a nearly spiritual experience. Out in the cold Arizona desert, more stars than I have ever seen in my life and you bring up a pair of binoculars to what looks like an empty area of sky and it too is full of stars, And there is this blue mist, the furthest thing you can see with the naked eye(at least with better eyes than mine) with billions and billions of stars contained within. I don&#39;t know, but you feel stuff under those circumstances."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It may be obvious and this may be a bit pedantic, but the “actual size” and “size compared to the moon” part is confusing, as comparing the size of two objects is usually comparing two objects at the same scale.If someone was completely clueless, they would think Andromeda is a teeny tiny galaxy. But it’s actually 110,000 light years wide — quite a bit bigger than the moon. :)The title show just be something along the lines of “Andromeda in the sky if it were brighter, next to the moon”. Or just “Andromeda if it were brighter”.I say this because I’ve seen other “X compared to Y” articles on HN (one compared planets and the sun to the moon, where the moon was a pixel), and these are all at-scale comparisons. So I was expecting something similar here from the title."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Here&#39;s why interrupt is inherently more efficient: as long as both participants are willing to yield to interrupt-denies and counter-interrupts when interrupting, you have shifted the communication mode from:A) Anticipate up front what other person needs to hear and say it allB) Rapid adjustment to ideal info requirements as your model of their knowledge/interest is live-updated.But the trick people seem to miss is that interrupt-denies and counter-interrupts make the whole thing possible.When I&#39;m talking with someone for whom this style is natural, there can be many very rapid small gestures to interrupt, which sometimes are accepted and sometimes are rejected by a small &#34;just let me keep going, you&#39;ll see why&#34; gesture. Each of those gestures takes a fraction of a second (and generally does not actually break flow of speech, just eye contact + a little head motion), and conversations employing them are far more enjoyable because information flow is near optimal.On the other hand, when speaking with anti-interrupt people, I often get so bored it&#39;s hard to pay attention because either 1) they left something out that I wanted to ask about so I can&#39;t follow what they are saying, or 2) I already had a thorough understanding of something they insist on giving a long explanation of."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a strong habit of &#34;autocompleting&#34; people&#39;s thoughts in my head before they&#39;re done saying them. I&#39;m only right maybe ~60% of the time, but it comes with a strong urge to interrupt them and let them know where I think they&#39;re going. This is especially true if I can tell that it will take them multiple sentences to finish their thought. It does not come from a place of &#34;you&#39;re wasting my time, I get it, jeez&#34;, but more from a &#34;I understand the point you&#39;re making and I am eager to hear the next thing you have to share.&#34;What I&#39;ve noticed is that my habit of interruption is received wildly differently by different kinds of people. It drives some people absolutely crazy, and in these settings I&#39;ve learned to be a little more mindful and try to restrain myself from interjecting so frequently. However, for other people, it works wonderfully and we&#39;ll get into a really fast-moving conversation where less redundant information is shared.My theory is that two well-intentioned interrupters can have a pleasant conversation, and two well-intentioned waiters can have a pleasant conversation, but any pairing of an interrupter and a waiter will be disastrous unless both are very mindful of how they participate in the conversation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m surprised no one here has mentioned the power dynamics of interruption.  It is well known in psychology that interrupting anothers speech is a way to exert power.  The boss can interrupt anyone, no one interrupts the boss.  It&#39;s one of several types of interruption:https://www.psychmechanics.com/psychology-of-interrupting/Interrupting someone can say &#34;I am more important than you&#34;.  This can also cause failures to communicate since the boss can change the subject and the interrupted speaker may never get to finish their thought.  I&#39;ve seen projects fail because a boss intentionally interrupted people who were trending in a direction they did not want to go, squashing anyone who was pointing out a major flaw in the bosses plans, which resulted in building things in a bad way and then having the flaw manifest and cause the project to fail.There are other types of interruption though that can be more supportive or more like parallel conversations.  The efficiency of those often depends on the quality of the participants memory and ability to follow multiple threads simultaneously."</p>
