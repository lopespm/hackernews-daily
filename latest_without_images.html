								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been a HN member for 11 years and 11 months to this exact day (I joined Christmas 2009).Since then, I&#39;ve lived in 6 different cities, 5 different timezones and worked on countless side projects. But all this time, HN has always been my most visited month after month.I can always count on this place to keep me up to date with the latest tech trends and read discussions between reasonable people. Thank you all and especially dang for keeping discussions high quality. Especially as the quality of content on the rest of the internet deteriorates in the pursuit of virility.It&#39;s a testament to you all that place feels the same as it did 10+ years ago."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hackernews is simultaneously the most cantankerous and, imho, highest quality response on average public forum on the net. I absolutely love it here and sincerely appreciate this place. I feel like I’ve grown up on this site in so many ways.I am continually humbled by not just the consistent quality of content but also the comments. It’s a testament to the moderators that this site has maintained this level of quality for so long.I am thankful and happy to use thanksgiving as an excuse to express that notion."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was recently in a meeting with a colleague about some recent craziness that just finished. A lot of hard work, not fun, but ended up just fine. Then a few minutes later, I find out her daughter is in the hospital, so she&#39;s been back-and-forth there a lot, and her life is exponentially more crazy than my own. I felt terrible for complaining about my dumb issues. Work&#39;s hard sometimes, but it&#39;s so small in comparison.The upside of the conversation is that I&#39;ve felt extra thankful this year- I have friends/family/coworkers going through sickness, abuse, divorce, coming out of the closet, and more, and it puts my concerns in perspective. My life is far from perfect, but I&#39;m grateful for what I do have.I know very little about any of you personally, but I hope you continue to share your knowledge, wisdom, dumb anecdotes, and opinions both great and terrible."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Im thankful to have a job and a roof over my head and a little bit of savings. Not having to really worry about money still blows my mind now and then.Looking across the street every day in California and seeing the homelessness crisis in full swing is an ever present reminder of what this economy and this society can do to you if you slip up for even a second and / or have even a minor run of bad luck.Working in software isn&#39;t always easy or fun or fulfilling but its still an incredible privilege to be working in this industry."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m thankful for yeast. It’s so, so convenient that we have a non-pathogenic bacteria which will eat pretty much any simple sugar, can be found on the surfaces of most fruits, and is essentially effortless to cultivate, which also does a bunch of useful things like leaven bread and make a bunch of delicious short chain fatty acids (both in bread and on their own, like in marmite) and make alcohol (although that one maybe does more harm than good)!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s the automation that worries me. I&#39;m not too concerned about proper companies using CCTV to record, as it&#39;s well managed and gets deleted unseen, unless something happens. I&#39;m not too concerned about the police pulling those CCTV pictures to investigate a crime either.Things like ring doorbells on the other hand should be cracked down - the number of times I see people in the UK posting pictures of public areas on facebook is shocking, but if they&#39;re just sat there, being deleted unless pulled for a proper reason, that&#39;s fine too.What really does concern me is when things like image recognition come into the picture. A corporation can&#39;t montior me by paying someone to sift through CCTV pictures. They can montior me by using automation to process everything though.This is a good thing, how successful it is remains to be seen."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not a lawyer here but it seems that there are exceptions carved out:In particular, we ask the Commission to prohibit, in law and in practice, indiscriminate or arbitrarily-targeted uses of biometrics which can lead to unlawful mass surveillance.-So long as it is discriminate and non-arbitrary that can be ok then?We have seen so many legal justifications and equivocations to laws from the surveillance state that I now assume legal counsel will always find a way to break the prima facie law.German intelligence broke many German laws with the NSA, while Merkel virtue signaled and decried the NSA (comparing them to the Stasi) and Obama spying on her.https://www.dw.com/en/edward-snowden-germany-a-primary-examp...https://www.dw.com/en/danish-secret-service-helped-us-spy-on...https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/17/merkel-compare..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m generally positively surprised by the coalition-agenda (Koalitionsvertrag) that was presented by the upcoming German government yesterday. Fairly centrist policies and a focus on modernization. There&#39;s a separate question about how much of it will actually be implemented, but the uncommon mix of three fairly different parties seems to have created a sensible equilibrium."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I made https://github.com/msloth/lgtv.js which can control a webos LGTV on your local network. It was in my js beginnings so pretty sketchy and not at all clean. Once I was able to control it I kind of lost interest in making it more tweakable, cleaner interface etc, but there are others that did.At home I now run a small rpi0 with a telegram bot that, among other things, acts as a LGTV command proxy. So on my phone, I now tell my telegram bot eg &#34;movie&#34; which then puts the tv on the right input, sets volume, dims some hue lights and shows a nice float on the TV with a welcoming message.It&#39;s also useful when I can&#39;t find the physical remote, or to send messages like &#34;dinner in 10&#34; (that shows on the TV screen in a float) to a gaming child with selective hearing enabled :)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hope the Software Freedom Conservancy lawsuit against Visio results in an open source distribution for TVs like there is OpenWRT for routers after their last lawsuit. Perhaps the OpenLGTV/SamyGO projects and other folks will join forces on a common distro for smart TVs.https://sfconservancy.org/copyleft-compliance/vizio.html

					<h3><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59380453">90% of Black Friday deals were the same price or cheaper six months before</a></h3>

					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29344709">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It has been interesting watching the concept of Black Friday (and cyber monday) evolve over the past 20 or so years from being mostly an &#34;American big box retailer dumping excess stock&#34; thing to &#34;oh boy its black Friday, time to go buy stuff!&#34; thing. The entire event has basically been undeservingly co-opted by everyone looking to cash in on hype over an event that basically doesn&#39;t even resemble what made it a thing in the first place.Just like how for singles day in Asia, retailers shamelessly just jack prices up beforehand to make their sale prices look like discounts. These events seem more about whipping the naive mainstream consumer into a consumption frenzy than having real deals to be excited about. While those deals still exist, they are like nuggets of gold that you have to sift through the noise to find."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those who use Amazon and want cost perspective on particular items, Camelcamelcamel is a superpower (https://camelcamelcamel.com/)I’m sure one day I’ll find out they make money in all sorts of sketchy ways, but in the mean time it’s a great free website, and I’m continually astounded to see how often retailers play around with the prices they post."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This have been a joke for a few years here in Brazil, we call the day &#34;Black Fraud&#34;  (sounds a little better in Portuguese)The relevant point is that Black Friday is an &#34;artificial&#34; event here: we do not celebrate Thanksgiving Day so there is no need for a the stores to get rid of unsold inventory. It started just ~10 years ago when marketers began advertising it as a sales day."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; All the sensible textbook titles were already taken. Actual joy not guaranteed.Like a lot of people (I imagine) I made it through a CS bachelors program not really ‘getting’ the discrete math combinatorics part. Crypto is an area where those concepts really really matter. It’s great to see this resource available!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Again I complain on the irritating habit of non-descriptive naming of files.book.pdfReally? I&#39;m saving the file for a later review and this name will guarantee I either completely lose the file or will spend more time than necessary to locate it. The other option is to rename the file on saving, which is some work which needs to be performed by each user, instead of being done just once on the source. I think this is just impolite.Here&#39;s a proper name you can copy-paste:Mike_Rosulek_-_The_Joy_Of_Cryptography_(draft_2021-01-03).pdfPS: The short-link-for-verbal-sharing problem is solved via a symbolic link."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like software where you don&#39;t need to spend hours or even days on configuration and it just works out of box. Unfortunately the different syntax is no go for me. I have a bunch of scripts which I can run on my local machine and remote interchangeably. Even if syntax is better I want to learn rather `one syntax` that work everywhere. But that is only one thing that prevents me from trying it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well, no shit, Sherlock!!Everybody who has been renting or has been buying a home in the last 10 years knows this...All the cash that&#39;s been &#34;pumped into the economy&#34; has only fueled inequalities. It&#39;s gone in the pockets of those who were already wealthy enough to secure a loan. And yes, they did buy houses, and bitcoins, and stocks. Oh and then that caused the prices to go up, so whoever forgot to invest started doing it, pumping the early birds&#39; wealth up, allowing them to borrow even more. The whole economical landscape is bubbles everywhere.And now the FED can&#39;t really reverse it. If you start raising rates, and stopping QE, you&#39;re not actually getting the money back from the people you gave it to, you&#39;ll just get a lot of businesses to close.We need to erode all that capital concentration, and the only way to do it without hurting the regular guy is through heavy taxation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"IMO this is the single biggest malaise in society. “Investing” (speculating) in real estate creates nothing of value to society and instead serves only to artificially drive up the cost of shelter, a basic necessity. It also directs capital away from investing in technology and businesses.Due to the zero-sum nature of real estate, it fundamentally breaks the positive sum theory of capitalism. Adam Smith even called landlord’s right “theft”."</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29328761">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t think you can diagnose over-engineering after the fact. Unless you were in the room, or have access to written specs from a meticulously documented team, you don&#39;t understand the conditions under which the code was written.Maybe the company was betting at the time on an integrations marketplace, or a lot of partnerships, so a robust integration platform was built. Then the company moved on to another bet after only writing one or two integrations on the new platform. Nobody over-engineered here. Everything was built to spec. But three years down the line the new dev is going to get assigned a bug in one of the integrations and lament how the code was over-engineered. Hindsight is 20/20.Lots of stories from the trenches including many in this thread make this mistake. The same goes for &#39;tech debt&#39;. If you weren&#39;t there, you don&#39;t know."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing that bugs me is the notion that &#34;Software rewrites are something you should never do&#34;, which is a mantra so often repeated that it has acquired the status of self-evident truth, despite the only evidence being (usually) presented is an example of a web browser from 20 years ago! (Which incidentally spawned Mozilla, so not exactly a complete loss; especially from the POV of society rather than shareholders, but I digress).Having rewritten a bunch of systems (sometimes several times) I can attest that it will not always lead to the death of the company. The trick is of course having modular enough systems that they can be rewritten from scratch in a reasonable amount of time.It can also be a great way to increase the simplicity of the system as typically the old version was designed with a very imperfect understanding of the problem and no operational experience servicing it; further learning were usually crudely patched on top and you often end up in a conceptual hodge-podge where words mean subtly different things depending on the context and translation layers need to be inserted between the contexts etc.Often a (good) rewrite starts by clarifying the conceptual model. I like the saying &#34;clear writing reflects clear thinking&#34;, and in programming there is a lemma &#34;clear thinking produces clear code&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Complexity kills your product - Overengineering is just one instance of complexity - Technical Debt like having state and data all over the place is another one - I quit my last job and I happily blame this article for convincing me to quit: https://itnext.io/the-origin-of-complexity-8ecb39130fc - coordination causes complexity and this killed me - we had everything not once but twice or more in different places - just one example - it&#39;s much more complex but me and my colleagues were grinded between an old codebase that nobody understood anymore and kubernetes, ci, etc.pp on the other side because management sold this without understanding that you need a process and time for digesting and applying the concepts in the team."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Honestly, I never really had that much love for Emacs until relatively recently.  I&#39;ve always dabbled due to it generally having good support for most languages (including esoteric ones) but recently I got into it a lot more due to the fact that many of the new-ish OSS editors but Emacs has always been there and likely will always be there.A few years back I got into Atom quite a bit since it checked all the boxes: extensible, open source, and it was very nice.  Then VSCode killed it.  And it seems more and more that VSCode is taking over, all the while inserting more proprietary code to the point where half the &#39;big&#39; plugins don&#39;t work on Codium, only the proprietary MS distribution.So I got back into Emacs but really worked on my environment.  Stopped dabbling and started just forcing myself to use it.  And it&#39;s honestly amazing.  It checks off every box available in VSCode and more.  And it&#39;s nice knowing that it&#39;ll always be there.  I&#39;m not against proprietary software per-se, but I definitely don&#39;t have a lot of trust in Microsoft."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For people who ask, &#34;why use text-only editors like vim or Emacs, when I can use a full GUI IDE?&#34;:One of the reasons I haven&#39;t seen mentioned much is: I&#39;m a touch typist, and I hate having to switch between mouse and keyboard! I have to take my attention off the screen. Slows me down. Disturbs my concentration.With Emacs, I can work for hours without ever having to hunt for the mouse, or without even having a mouse plugged in. That&#39;s particularly nice for using my Ubuntu laptop on a lap desk, leaning back in my armchair. The best mouse is no mouse at all.Yes, I know many IDEs have shortcut keys for some commands, but the basic assumption with GUI applications is that you have a mouse. Even if you learn the shortcuts, somehow you always end up having to use the mouse for some common task, e.g., to select a paragraph. That&#39;s why I never got to like a GUI IDE, despite having had to use Eclipse for years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"https://prelude.emacsredux.com/en/latest/ and https://github.com/ianyepan/jetbrains-darcula-emacs-theme were the two &#34;game-changers&#34; for me getting me comfortable in emacs."</p>
