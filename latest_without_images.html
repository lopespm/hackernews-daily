								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve heard a lot of engineers complain about engineering managers over the years. I&#39;ve also heard great managers self-deprecatingly say they &#34;don&#39;t do any work&#34;. I&#39;ve seen managers feeling bad they weren&#39;t productive so they resorted to writing code to feel that they were having impact.This post is an example of the incredible impact an engineering manager can have without writing a line of code."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I swear I recall being a fly on the wall and just being in awe; early on in my career just listening to Dave Herman, Luke Wagner, and Alon Zakai discussing asm.js which would one day lead to webassembly. It was very early days even for asm.js, but from how they spoke of it and it&#39;s potential you could tell it would have huge impact on the industry."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Well, it&#39;s something that is slowly backfiring. It&#39;s under the eyes of everyone, and not enforcing such policy will only make it even worse for Amazon itself that eventually will end up selling only non-branded products. Finally it will be only another e-commerce like &#34;ebay&#34; used to be, and something else will replace it. Just enjoy the ride until you can.PS: speaking out of experience, I had one time a talk to a director from an important online shop (top 3 in the country in that specific field) and &#34;this sort of things&#34; was exactly the reason why they chose to use MS Azure instead of AWS. Imagine how deep it can go. And I totally support that.PPS: I don&#39;t understand the downvote. Please, be specific on why you disagree instead of just clicking on random symbols."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thought exercise because I legitimately struggle with this. Is this fundamentally different than Costco using sales data to choose which Kirkland products to launch/sell? If so, how? If not, then why do we not pursue Costco with the same gusto as Amazon? To me this behavior by Amazon seems worse, but I can&#39;t figure out why."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The most interesting part of the HN discussion is not about the definition of what Amazon is doing, but the occasional misunderstanding of how large brick and mortar retail businesses operate at scale (see: buying shelf space/payment dependant on sales/etc).There are lots of folks on here that understand what Amazon is doing, less who understand retail businesses mechanisms.I&#39;m not sure what Amazon is doing is legal (def will vary widely between the eu and us markets), but it is another interesting example of how doing something at scale can be perceived as fundamentally different then when it&#39;s done in a smaller way (especially as it pertains to privacy)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is an excellent example of what I call the Copy-Object-Copy effect.  It&#39;s particularly apparent in frameworks with ORMs like Django.  In Pandas case, devs will do &#39;SELECT *&#39; and use pandas as a sort of pseudo ORM.You run a query to get your data as a bunch of objects, but you&#39;re copying the data over the db connection from the postgres wire protocol into Python objects in memory, which are typically then garbage collected at the end of the transaction, then copy the result to a JSON buffer that is also garbage collected, and then send the final result to send to the browser which has been waiting this whole time.I regularly see Django apps require several gigs of RAM per worker and when you look at the queries, it&#39;s just a bunch of poorly rendered SELECTs.  It&#39;s grotesque.Contrast PostgREST:  100 megabytes of RAM per worker.  I&#39;ve seen Django DRF workers require 50 to 1 memory vs PostgREST for the same REST interface and result with PostgREST being much faster. Since the database is generating the json, it can do so immediately upon generating the first result row which is then streamed to the browser.  No double buffering.Unlike Django, it&#39;s not that I don&#39;t like Pandas, it&#39;s that people way overuse it for SQL tasks as this article points out.  I&#39;ve seen pandas scripts that could be a simpler psql script.  If psql can&#39;t do what you want, resist the temptation to &#39;SELECT *&#39; into a data frame and break the problem up into stages where you get the database to do the maximum work before it gets to the data frame."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Pandas is a very popular tool for data analysis. It comes built-in with many useful features, it&#39;s battle tested and widely accepted. However, pandas is not always the best tool for the job.SQL is very useful, but there are some data manipulations which are much easier to perform in pandas/dplyr/data.table than in SQL. For example, the article discusses how to perform a pivot table, which takes data in a &#34;long&#34; format, and makes it &#34;wider&#34;.In the article, the pandas version is:&gt;pd.pivot_table(df, values=&#39;name&#39;, index=&#39;role&#39;, columns=&#39;department&#39;, aggfunc=&#39;count&#39;)Compared to the SQL version:&gt;SELECT
    role,
    SUM(CASE department WHEN &#39;R&amp;D&#39; THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as &#34;R&amp;D&#34;,
    SUM(CASE department WHEN &#39;Sales&#39; THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as &#34;Sales&#34;
FROM
    emp
GROUP BY
    role;Not only does the SQL code require you to know up front how many distinct columns you are creating, it requires you to write a line out for each new column. This is okay in simple cases, but is untenable when you are pivoting on a column with hundreds or more distinct values, such as dates or zip codes.There are some SQL dialects which provide pivot functions like in pandas, but they are not universal.There are other examples in the article where the SQL code is much longer and less flexible, such as binning, where the bins are hardcoded into the query."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The more I learn SQL, the less I write Python.Although the SQL syntax is weird and so dated, its portability across tools trumps everything else. You finished the EDA and decided to port the insights to a dashboard? With SQL it&#39;s trivial. With Python... well, probably you&#39;ll have to port it to SQL unless you have Netflix-like, Jupyter-backed dashboard infrastructure in place. For many of us who only have much-more-prevalent SQL-based dashboard platform, why not starting from SQL? Copy-n-paste is your friend!I still hate the SQL as a programmer, but as a non-expert data analyst I now have accepted it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;d like to clarify that my code was running only on machines that were otherwise idle. Not many people were in the lab late in the evenings. MPQS processing nodes could be added and removed dynamically, so if somebody needed a computer that was part of my cluster, they could just quit my program and everything would go back to normal.Also, once the number theory professor learned of what I had implemented, he worked out an agreement with the lab manager to give me legitimate access to the machines. :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In 19 and 82 or 3, I worked at Lockheed Shipyard in Seattle, in a sort of tech writing capacity on a Navy ship building project, based on my recent experience in the Navy. The business closed with completion of the ships.We had to fill out lots of forms that documented what we called &#34;analysis,&#34; and we&#39;d often have to change them based on some factor changing. One change could cascade through the whole form.Paper forms. Green see-through plastic letter guides. Whiteout. Lots of whiteout.We had access to a department mini computer, don&#39;t remember what it was. The language might have been Basic-like, but I didn&#39;t know enough to recognize it as such.I figured out how to write and run programs, someone showed me how to print, and I wrote a program that would accept values for all a form&#39;s fundamental values, and cascade those through calculations for the dependent values, and print out the filled in form. You could save it, update a new value, re-cascade, and print it out again. No more whiteout.Part of the calculation involved sorting. I didn&#39;t know anything about sorting, so I implemented what I later learned was bubble sort. Because that&#39;s obviously how you&#39;d do that.The system administer noticed more load when people ran my program. He found me, and told me not to do that again.I learned that there was a thing called a system administrator. He might have given me a better canned sort, don&#39;t remember.I eventually thought it would be a good idea to quit and go to school, so I did.(I took a number theory class, but had to drop it. I don&#39;t have the math nature.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ah yes, good memories. I&#39;m having a really hard time right now remembering the name of that program that blocked access to the Finder; I think it was &#34;Easy&#34;-something. Google fails me on the name too. Breaking it was a hobby.Some school labs had left access to Hypercard available through that program, so you could just pull up Hypercard and make a new stack that would tell the program to quit.The other way to get around it -- or around many other misbehaving programs in the cooperative multitasking system -- was to bring up the programmer&#39;s interrupt like the author describes, and enter &#34;SM 0 A9F4&#34;, followed by &#34;G 0&#34;. This would set memory location 0 to the _exitToShell function in the OS ROM and then resume execution from there, which immediately terminated whatever was in the foreground.The rest of the system would often be a little unstable after that though, so you only had a few moves left before a restart would be needed.To youths with curious mindsets, an anti-authoritarian streak, and seemingly limitless amounts of free time, little restrictions like these only improved our skills. Systems with challenging but imperfect security are a great way to foster new young talent."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s a part in the Foundation series by Asimov where the Galactic civilization has forgotten how their technology works. They have all this amazing technology, things that generate free energy and terraform planets or whatever, and all that&#39;s left are technicians who kind of know that if you push this button that thing is supposed to happen, but they have no idea what the machine is actually doing internally or the physical principles on which it operates.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"At the core of it, the very core of it, tech is waged work. Just like in manufacturing, which was outsourced quite prolifically. Tech isn&#39;t special in this regard.The thing that hasn&#39;t come about yet though is, sales, marketing, accounting can also be outsourced. Dare I say automated. It is at the end of the day, still waged work. Marketing is not an asset class. Accounting isn&#39;t capital ownership. Fabrication is a tool, tech is a tool, social media is a tool.The moment that this sort of stuff gets automated there will be a reckoning on how businesses are built in western society. I don&#39;t mean a saleforce competitor with a slicker UI, I mean completely abstracting away payroll and the like.Imagine for a moment:You could say to anyone, &#34;I like the work you do want to work for me?&#34; either in person, online, even here. They say yes. Now suddenly a pipeline process kicks off, like a CICD for recruitment. You have your budget metrics all in place, the receiver has their negotiation asks, etc. And AI hashes out a negotiation, in browser or on your phones etc. comes up with a negotiation contract, highlights the important bits or deal breakers that need a higher level sign off. &#34;Click &#39;Yes&#39; to work.&#34; Done. Hired. Here&#39;s your onboarding package and account credentials, your paycheck comes in at the end of the month.All the while, the two people at the table or on twitter have just been continuing on with their lives. Nobody talked to HR. Nobody had to manually do filings with the IRS. The business owner never opened a dashboard or logged in to their negotiation.ai account. It is not this easy at the moment. But no rule of physics says it can&#39;t be in the future.Entire classes of work could crumble while people could create in a much more competitive manner."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From DoD &#34;2020 Industrial Capabilities Report to Congress&#34;[1] page 9:&gt; issues confronting our defense industrial base [...] first has been the steady deindustrialization of the United States over the past five decades, including workforce and manufacturing innovation [...] While total manufacturing output has grown during this period, [...] the workforce on which a defense industrial renaissance would depend has become [...] an endangered species.&gt; Together, a U.S. business climate that has favored short-term shareholder earnings (versus long-term capital investment), deindustrialization, and an abstract, radical vision of “free trade,” without fair trade enforcement, have severely damaged America’s ability to arm itself today and in the future.  Our national responses – off-shoring and out-sourcing – have been inadequate and ultimately self-defeating, especially with respect to the defense industrial base.&gt; These trends have had particular impact on the core element of a successful manufacturing economy: the machine tool industry.  Of the world’s top twenty-one machine-tool makers, only two today are American:  Gleason and Haas Automation.  By contrast, eight are based in Japan, and six in Germany.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A couple of frequent mistakes with signin which are usually caused by junior product owners/ux persons not reflecting on what they are doing and blindly copying what they believe is the way to do things.- Having confusing language and poor differentiation between the sign in and sign up form. Symptom, users start filling in the wrong form only to realize their mistake.- Separating the password from the email field with an extra mouse click sucks if you are using a password manager. Doubly so on mobile where using password managers involve a bit of fiddly interactions. Having to do this twice sucks. If you do this, at least have one of the fields in the dom tree but hidden so that it gets filled with one click via your password manager.- Not making the login form password manager friendly my not sticking to conventions for field names for this."</p>

A customer that is happy paying the bill every month but doesn&#39;t use a ton of resources?It reeks of really bad optimization of metrics: do everything possible to increase conversions, at any cost to the rest of the business.

You type your email and it&#39;s already used, obviously.By this point you don&#39;t want to go through the whole process of deleting your browser history to log into your existing account, so you go along with the new account thing and use another email address.Before you know it, you have 5 different accounts and don&#39;t remember which ones you use for which servers.Yes, there is a &#34;use existing account&#34; link, but it&#39;s not prominent, the &#34;What should everyone call you?&#34; textbox with the big &#34;Continue&#34; button are the only psychologically viable option unless you&#39;ve already gone through the whole process of involuntarily creating many accounts."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Great work and even more surprising: a great writeup (writing that as someone who always struggles to document my own work). This really gives me hope to have an usable, native Linux on the M1 machines.I really wished Apple would see, how much benefit this would bring to their platform. Their new hardware is really exciting, the first ARM on the desktop, which doesn&#39;t just compete, but in many aspects beat current x86 chips. A lot of the Linux and tech enthusiast crowd would love to jump onto Apple Silicon. And while they might not bring huge profits by themselves, these are the people who do come up with great new technologies. Better give them a home on Apple devices. It doesn&#39;t need a complete and formal documentation of every aspect, just supporting those projects with a little bit of information would go a long way. A single engineer who would answer questions by those developers might be sufficient. So come on, Apple, do it! :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Well-written apps generally require primitive restart, and it’s almost free for apps that don’t need it.I&#39;m really surprised that primitive restart is forced on in Metal, but they also have a hardware bit for it! Primitive restart makes your whole pipeline slower, because you can&#39;t just chunk your index list when building your vertex packets to send to the work distributors; the possibility of a primitive restart index means you have to linearly scan for it. Though I&#39;m not a hardware guy -- maybe the degenerate tris thing makes it just as annoying in practice.I&#39;d guess that the limitation to force primitive restart on in Metal came from another IHV limitation (maybe old PVR chips?)That said, you really shouldn&#39;t be using tristrips in 2021 anyway, they have poor locality, and are hard to optimize. Index buffers solve the problems that tristrips wanted to solve to begin with.IME, a well-written app should just ignore tristrips / restartable topologies, and just use straight tri-lists."</p>

It is also alleged that Google let their own exchange win, even when someone else bid more!Somewhere, in a parallel universe, people are going to jail and paying substantial fines for this behavior. In this universe, however, politicians don’t seem to think there is a moral hazard in the fact that those of us who work in this industry see what happened and think, “if you get big enough, it doesn’t matter if you get caught.”"</p>
