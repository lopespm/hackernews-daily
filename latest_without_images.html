Then any otter in a hurry could skim through the left column, find topics they liked, and just read that part from the right.Sorry, it&#39;s not really a fair criticism, and I did like the art style - I just don&#39;t like Kafka much because I had to deal with it in places where it didn&#39;t make much sense."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;It&#39;s not even clear who proposed the new law. &#34;The language, inserted without prior public discussion during recent state Senate deliberations on Ohio&#39;s two-year budget, is drawing condemnation from numerous sources. Officials have not said who put the language in the Senate budget document, only that they learned of it for the first time last week,&#34; the Akron Beacon Journal wrote on June 13.&#34;How did we end up with such a gross lack of accountability? That seems more scandalous than the bad idea itself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Fairlawn&#39;s city-run FairlawnGig network has consistently ranked as one of the fastest ISPs in the country, serving residents and businesses in Fairlawn, Akron, and Bath with affordable gigabit Internet services. The slowest service tier delivers 300Mbps symmetrical speeds for $55/month. The municipal network has resulted in more businesses choosing to locate in Fairlawn, and at least 700 jobs can be directly attributed to the network. In recent subscriber surveys, 95 percent of respondents rated FairlawnGig&#39;s service as &#34;very good to excellent,&#34; with some customer testimonials referring to the network as &#34;a life saver&#34; throughout the pandemic.From the article. That is very impressive and a really bad sign for private broadband to be beat out like this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I understand the opposition to another government service on ideological grounds, but the response in Ohio seems merely pro-monopoly and not pro-market. Is there anywhere in the country where state Republicans are looking for ways to increase competition in the broadband market? Everyone uses the internet, I don&#39;t understand why only one party is looking for a solution to this problem."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I would caution against just jumping into this and trying to be a real ISP if your experience is in software development, sysadmin stuff, or something kind of tech industry adjacent but you&#39;ve never worked for an ISP in a NOC environment, as a junior network engineer or similar for somebody else&#39;s medium to large sized ISP. There&#39;s a lot of missteps that can be made without experience.In general I would recommend thinking of starting a small ISP as a depth and breadth of knowledge base you need to develop, similar to how an apprentice electrician is expected to work under some more senior/experienced persons in their field for a number of years before being able to operate independently.I do not want to discourage anyone but I&#39;ve seen a myriad of &#39;oh my god why did they do that&#39; small WISPs with anywhere from 50 to 1500 customers. Going down the wrong network architecture/topology/business plan path can be very costly later on if you&#39;re 100% learning as you go.Overall I think a site like this is a great idea, but the sheer scope of things that would need to be written down in a wiki-like format for everything to start your own ISP, and what systems/subsystems/technologies you will want to be familiar with, could fill thousands of pages if printed in book form. It&#39;s a gargantuan task to make a website that has everything needed to start an ISP from scratch, assuming the reader hasn&#39;t been involved in somebody else&#39;s ISP operations first."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I thought this was going to be a game reliving my experience as the System Administrator at our local dialup internet service back in the 1990s. I wasn&#39;t there at the start, but I ran the thing for 2 years, serving about 200 customers. I wrote the &#34;Internet Installation&#34; floppy disks that people used to install networking on Windows 3.1, and configured dialup icons on their desktop. I was the ONLY technical support they had.I learned that people don&#39;t use the same words we technical folks do, so if you get a support call and ask &#34;Have you installed anything?&#34; the answer they give is no, but, if you ask &#34;do you have any new programs or stuff&#34;, the answer will be yes.Why? - My theory is that they either didn&#39;t know what &#34;installing&#34; was (nobody opened up the computer to put something in), or they themselves didn&#39;t do it.You have to have a very strong ability to route around the person on the other end of the phones preconceptions of the world and get the right answers anyway.If you&#39;re going to be an ISP, you&#39;re going to be on call 24/7/365, and you&#39;re going to see weird shit. More than once we had to deal with people wanting to post adult content for money.... and this was back in the days of dialup.  Who knows what the heck the folks are doing today."</p>

He&#39;s a real gem of a person, and I&#39;m glad his work is getting (rightly) recognized."</p>

Very, very happy with this; works smoothly, lets us use the latest Python and Qt versions and lets us make professional-looking installers that we can distribute."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nuitka is the best python compiler I&#39;ve used. I have tried at least three others and none worked as good as nuitka. And I&#39;m talking about complicated dependencies such as pytorch, selenium, tesseract - that type of stuff."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This has always been the problem with smart contracts. They are infact dumb contacts.To program one you need to think about all the edge cases.

An oracle is basically a server that reports the outcome of an event. And servers can be attacked in ways that systems like Ethereum can&#39;t.So a lot of the hype around Ethereum and its &#34;smart contracts&#34; is really people just misunderstanding the security model. The weakest link is a server in a dorm room or data center reporting a number.Here the oracle is doing the right thing. But it could easily go the other way."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is definitely an example where &#34;character&#34; was the wrong word. We start out OK with bytes being distinct, but by the end we&#39;re talking about how a character is made out of several characters. If we think in terms of code points (Rust&#39;s native char type actually provides here a slightly different thing, a Unicode Scalar Value, which certain types of code point are not, but close enough) clearly a code point isn&#39;t made out of several code points, so we needed a different word.I like squiggle, if you&#39;re a text rendering engine you might want to use &#34;glyph&#34; although you might already need that word for something else. But try to avoid character because that word already has far too many meanings, most of which won&#39;t be what you wanted."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thank $diety for emojis making sure most user facing code ends up handling extended code points correctly, and teaching devs about the multibyte encodings.I imagine in a world without them existing a lot of the non-ascii paths would not be regularly used."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of a blog post that I can no longer remember that discusses how Chinese is a lot of arranging several related kanji into a single character to express a new idea (please link it if you can find it).I would love to see unicode characters to allow for arbitrary combinations beyond those defined using just ZWJ to allow more flexibility (e.g. blizzard could be created by adding like &#34;slowflake x 5&#34; which creates a single character with five snowflakes, without having to create an entirely new character representing blizzard from snowflake + ZWJ + snowflake).As an aside, my favorite ZWJ magic is black flag + ZWJ + skull and crossbones = pirate flag.Also see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blissymbols for more symbol language fun."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I see a lot of people in the comments describe triplebyte as a “market leader” and discuss how good they are. I can’t believe how gullible everyone is especially on a startup forum. Let me spell it out to y’all, nobody pivots and changes their entire business model if they are crushing it. So the implication is that triplebyte are not crushing it. So, this probably has gone the same way as lots of other tech startups. They’ve raised a bunch of money spent it all on ads , distorted the market for a while (usually just the advertising market) and now are on the way out. No matter what fluff or spin they put on it, that’s what’s happening."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"By far the most exciting thing about this announcement is this feature: &#34;Detailed information on what a recruiter did with your application.&#34;I&#39;ve been wishing for something like this for years. Especially for early-career engineers or people from non-traditional backgrounds, this is insanely valuable because it helps you to know avoid wasting time on applications that will never go anywhere; avoid typing in your resume, line by line, into another form after already submitting your pdf. Avoid writing a cover letter to a job that&#39;s already been filled. Avoid applying to a posting that&#39;s really just out there for a company to &#34;gauge&#34; interest, not for filling a real role.If an application is rejected, fine. But getting a follow-up request 7 months after submitting a resume into a black hole is ridiculous, and I think any system that decreases the information asymmetry between the applicant and the employer that allows people to intelligently approach their career search is going to be tapping into something truly valuable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A benefit of Triplebyte to big enterprises not mentioned in Triplebyte’s discussion here: acting as engineering assessment proxy for engineering hiring managers stuck with pathologically risk averse enterprise HR departments.Often enterprise HR is paranoid of honestly evaluating anyone for anything, to the point that many HR teams tell one another and engineering hiring managers that it’s “illegal” to assess candidate abilities on the way in the door, at all.If you think about joining a dev team where no one checked if any candidate could FizzBuzz, you can imagine the workplace environment that can end up with.Triplebyte is able to provide engineering managers with a stack of pre-vetted resumes so an enterprise can interview by its lowest common denominator HR policies, while still having a prayer a team will at least be made of candidates who can code.The value of this to an enterprise stuck in this position is hard to overstate.Hopefully along with expanding the talent pool per this post, Triplebyte can figure out a way to get well paid for this ability to help land actual coders on actual dev teams despite enterprise HR.The need for this is huge.// I see a comment below from a Triplebyte PM about score matching: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27542621 … That would be slick: land candidates that genuinely raise the bar, but aren’t so far ahead as to be speaking a foreign language to the team.  Of course, this would require also assessing the target team, and oops, we’re right back up against that HR policy…"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a former felon, I&#39;ve learned first-hand the fallout from being named in crime stories. The AP has it right in that a lot of it isn&#39;t realized by readers or society.Upon being charged with crimes, I had to make my way through the court system. As a consequence of my actions, the courts punished me. Once I had showed that I was not a serial offender but instead someone who had moments of weakness, lost identity, and subsequently poor judgement, the courts let me go.Once I paid my debts to the court — figuratively and literally — I was free to live my life without the government watching over my shoulder or further being a burden to my future. My dealings with them had a fixed amount of time attached to it. Once that time limit expired, I was free.Society was far less kind, and hardly as forgiving.No, I&#39;m not talking about employment — I am and always have been very gainfully employed. No, I&#39;m not talking about renting an apartment, or getting a loan, or opening a bank account.I&#39;m talking about new acquaintances.As we have seen over the past 5 years, in the minds of many a website is a single source of truth. To a large number of people, simply having a website is enough to give confidence to the reader that what&#39;s written is an absolute and authoritative source. It is only correct, completely unbiased, and contains 100% factual sourcing.When there&#39;s a webpage with dirty laundry on it, it rarely gets updated to say &#34;later, Judge Judy found suspect to be of good character, and they&#39;ve since paid their debts to the court.&#34;No, it just has absolute worst moment on repeat, leaving out all the context and any depth that goes into a legal proceeding. It&#39;s entirely the worst part of a nightmare.I&#39;ve personally had a number of articles written in addition to a 15-second segment on the local evening news. Getting a call from a partner who is sobbing, &#34;my parents Googled you.&#34; is absolutely stomach-turning. Knowing my little sister had to go to school the day after the clip played next day was something I am more ashamed about than I can put into words. Thankfully she was too young for a cell phone and social media was still in its infancy.My partner very privy to my dirty laundry. When they first learned of it they were actually surprised. It didn&#39;t bother them though as they knew who I was as a person and that my days of making mistakes were behind me.Their parents were less understanding. They didn&#39;t know me like my partner did. They just saw a series of mugshots and some local news articles from mistakes I made as a young adult.It wasn&#39;t the first and it wasn&#39;t the last time it happened, either.I have always been transparent and forthcoming with mistakes I&#39;ve made. I&#39;m just as candid with friends as I am here on HN. Hell, my profile even says I&#39;m a former felon!One point does not make a pattern. Many minor crime stories are just a point. That point, on the internet, is a scar, and those who come across them out of curiosity, suspicion, or nosiness re-open the wound.Since my bad decisions, I&#39;ve had success in contacting the authors of the articles highlighting my worst-moment-kept-in-a-non-governmental-database asking if they&#39;d consider removing their article. I mentioned I had completed probation and was doing something with my life, and that the article was hurting me and my relationships with people. They obliged.Edit: This isn&#39;t the first time I&#39;ve mentioned I&#39;m a felon in a comment. I&#39;ve received a surprising number of emails over the years from other felons (or felons-to-be) asking &#34;how did you reintegrate into society?&#34; or &#34;do you have any advice?&#34;. If you&#39;re one of them and reading this, you&#39;re more than welcome drop me an email."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is an interesting (and confounding) topic.On a corollary note, Austin recently experienced a mass shooting in a popular Downton area. 14 people were shot. One died. Another is paralyzed. The local paper of record explicitly declined to publish the description of the suspects as released by the police so as to not &#34;perpetuate stereotypes&#34;. The question I have is, what is the obligation to report the facts of a story, regardless of consequence? My belief is that reporting should report all the facts and let the chips fall where they may. But I also understand that reasonable people can disagree. (In this case, it seemed unreasonable to me as one shooter was still at large.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My interpretation of their intent is they will no longer name suspects in &#34;florida man&#34; style stories. Like, really, nobody needs to know that it was specifically 30 year old resident Pimble McGringleberry who lives on 1234 S Main St, nowheresville, arkansas was the lady who was throwing office chairs off the top of the target parking structure.The person is presumably dealing with the aftermath of whatever caused them to be in the news in the first place. There is no reason to give internet users a rope, or 6 lines by the hand of the person to hang them with.I think this is a positive move and hope to see more of it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I had really bad nausea and pain, went to my doctor, who said I likely had a kidney stone, and the next step was to get an MRI. I was between jobs with no insurance and few funds, so I asked what it cost. The doctor had someone in his office call the hospital and got a quote for $1,500. I got the MRI knowing only that.A month later I got a bill for $3,500. I drove out to the hospital (2 hours) to ask wtf. They didn&#39;t help at all, wouldn&#39;t budge.So I went home and wrote them a check for $1,500, marked as paid in full, with a cover letter explaining my side of it. It worked. They cashed the check and I never heard another word. I&#39;ve done further business there with no problem. It&#39;s well worth pushing back."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I did some research into this for my current employer and the challenges are pretty well laid out here: the penalties are minimal ($300 / day or $~110,000 per year), the data is kept in the invoice or billing systems, which are complex, and the hospitals do not want to share the truly groundbreaking data, which is the per-provider costs.In addition, when you Google for competitors you don&#39;t find a lot of them, but once you start looking at hospital websites you find that quite a few of them (about 50% of the ones I looked at) have at least a partial solution, often provided by their analytics company as an add-on or footnote.It does not appear there is a great market opportunity here unless the penalties increase (which the CMS has talked about vaguely, but hospitals are already asking for relief until after the pandemic)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My wife is trying to work on price transparency at her practice by offering bundled rates for the surgery she does. She has worked with all the various providers - anasthesia, pathology, the hospital etc to come up with a cash rate that she publishes on her website for the surgery. Most of the parties are very open to it but also extremely worried about outliers. Patients that end up costing 10x what was expected due to complications.
For her this is a minuscule risk, but in her negotiations it has been their main worry."</p>
