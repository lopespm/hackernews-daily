								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Daring Fireball [1] has another passage from the article which is illuminating with regards to any promises Apple makes about how it will resist governmental pressure to compromise its products, vis-à-vis Apple&#39;s CSAM scanning tool.&#34;Sometime in 2014 or early 2015, China’s State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping told members of the Apple Maps team to make the Diaoyu Islands, the objects of a long-running territorial dispute between China and Japan, appear large even when users zoomed out from them. Chinese regulators also threatened to withhold approval of the first Apple Watch, scheduled for release in 2015, if Apple didn’t comply with the unusual request, according to internal documents.Some members of the team back at Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., initially balked at the demand. But the Maps app had become a priority for Apple, so eventually the company complied. The Diaoyu Islands, when viewed in Apple Maps in mainland China, continue to appear on a larger scale than surrounding territories.&#34;Apple has, and will, fold to government pressure faster than a lawn chair.1. https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/12/08/the-information..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"the top comments talking about maps, it&#39;s absolutely insane&#39;The agreement included a pledge from Apple to help Chinese manufacturers develop &#34;the most advanced manufacturing technologies,&#34; &#34;support the training of high-quality Chinese talents,&#34; use more components from Chinese suppliers, sign deals with Chinese software firms, collaborate with research in Chinese universities, and directly invest in Chinese tech companies, as well as assistance with around a dozen Chinese government causes. If there were no objections from either side, the deal would be automatically be extended for an additional year until May 2022, according to the agreement.&#39;&#39;Apple vowed to invest &#34;many billions of dollars more&#34; than its current expenditure in China, including on new retail stores, research and development facilities, and renewable energy projects. Other internal documents reportedly showed that Apple&#39;s pledge amounted to more than $275 billion in spending over a period of five years.&#39;what do American citizens have to do to get this sort of treatment? Seems like a broken record at this point, but we truly have been sold at the absolute highest level. It&#39;s one thing to make these deals with a foreign hostile country - it&#39;s another to ask yourself: When&#39;s the last CEO I heard making these same promises to America? Or to any friendly country for that matter? As if the streets are paved with gold everywhere else?It aches my heart to be a young man in this country and see this be our so-called &#39;leaders&#39;. I&#39;m confident the tides have already turned against all this nonsense, though, and I look forward to rebuilding industries of the world with good-hearted men &amp; women"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So...local politicians, in a market where Apple was making money hand-over-fist, were feeling kinda used.  By a huge foreign corporation.  And the they started getting sticky on all sorts of regulatory things that Apple needed.  Until Apple&#39;s CEO promised to do a bunch of &#34;local investing&#34; in their country.How different is this from the 1980&#39;s in the U.S., when Japanese auto makers decided that they needed to start building cars in America, and otherwise placating American politicians and voters with big piles of money?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A very helpful summary from r/rust on the same topic [1]&gt;A few notes for people who haven&#39;t been tracking the Rust-in-kernel situation. Drivers especially have been targeted for a few reasons. First, drivers are isolated, with abstractions that don&#39;t require interaction with the rest of the system. Second, Linux is available on more systems than the Rust compiler has been ported to. Because drivers are inherently system-dependent, it is not an issue to introduce a dependency on rustc on compatible systems. Third, bugs tend to arise more in drivers than other parts of the codebase, so Rust can do the most good starting there.[1] https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/rb50yn/comment/hnmshs..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is an excellent article, a good insight into the particularities of the hardware. I particularly admire the explanation of why the polygons snap to the pixel, and why that&#39;s not the fault of floating-point mathematics but rather the rasterizer itself. One thing the article approaches, but doesn&#39;t really quite get to the bottom however, and which is the crux of all the ps1&#39;s &#39;flaws&#39; is that its GPU was 2-dimensional fundamentally. That&#39;s why things snap to pixels, that&#39;s why the textures do not have a depth component and are thus not perspective-correct, that&#39;s why there is no z-buffer, because it had no z-coordinate. Essentially, every single PS1 game &#39;faked&#39; 3D by using the GTE (which was separate from the GPU) to project 3D points and polygons into a 2D rasterizer. And it worked quite well! For the time.Another thought - I also wrote a similar renderer under similar constraints a while back, just for funsies, and I&#39;m wondering what would have came if I thought &#34;I should write an article about this&#34;. I generally don&#39;t think to write articles over every side project I do, what&#39;s the impulse for when someone decides to detail their work to the internet?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked on the MGS port to PC (from PS1), and I did little restoration trick to remove the &#34;jittering&#34; - I would save into a huge table of float `float gte_results[65536]` - any calculation from the GTE (our emulation) there. For example if after some translation the x was 123.43 - I know that it&#39;ll use only 123, but I would save gte_results[123] = 123.43 - and later when the triangle is drawn (with integer coordiantes, I&#39;ll lookup back as gte_results[123]). So ... it worked kind of :) - https://youtu.be/Fpep7oOGNfU?t=1442"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As an aside, one thing that&#39;s interesting and sad to me about WebGL is that WebGL + modern browsers are significantly more powerful than the PS1 and Nintendo 64, but we haven&#39;t had _anything_ even _remotely_ close to the completeness of an N64 nor PS1 game. Lots of small experiments and impressive demoscenes, but nothing in WebGL that takes advantage of this potential power. Frankly even compared to the completeness of Flash games, there are very few WebGL projects that even come close to that.This article and output would make a great WebGL project, and they could embed real demos of it running right in the site.What&#39;s missing that prevents us from building these types of complete projects in WebGL?"</p>
