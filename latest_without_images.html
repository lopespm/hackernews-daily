								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was the EM for Reddit&#39;s Growth team around this time. I am responsible for / contributed to a few features like the current signup flow, AMP pages, push notifications, email digests, app download interstitials, etc.There was a new product lead who joined with many good ideas, but some of them were dark patterns that I heavily protested. After a few months of this, it was obvious that I was going to be reigned in or let go[0]; I immediately transferred to a different org.Now let me explain the other side of the story. 4 years later, Reddit&#39;s DAU, MAU, and revenue have all grown at ridiculous rates[1]. Yes, power users complain—and still continue using the site—but the casual user does not. These dark patterns have been normalized on other websites.These practices are done because it works._____0: They changed it so I would report to the product lead, which is odd for an EM to report into a product chain and the only instance within the company ever.1: Many friends are startup founders and I&#39;ve been at a few startups myself—a byproduct of being in the Bay Area—and Reddit&#39;s growth numbers are impressive. As a former employee, I am quite happy about my equity growth."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It constantly amazes me how bad Reddit&#39;s interface is, videos either don&#39;t play or randomly start playing despite them not being in the viewport. They run random A|B experiments which add unnecessary components such as avatars next to peoples comments. Random acts of monetization are shoved down my throat at every turn. I honestly think the Reddit team are on a purpose built mission to design the most user hostile forum.I&#39;ve tried browsing Reddit in incognito on my phone before and it wouldn&#39;t let me without installing their app, thankfully old.reddit.com exists. From clicking on a search result to viewing an image post took ~8 clicks. The flow was analogous to:    -&gt; Click on search result 

    -&gt; ending on an AMP page and clicking the bottom sheet exit button to view the post in the browser rather than the app

    -&gt; clicking on the title to view the actual post in the non AMP format

    -&gt; ending up on the actual post and being told I need to view it in the app (which completely removes the point of using incognito)

    -&gt; changing the URL to old.reddit.com which is tedious with a phone keyboard 

    -&gt; finally load the page and click on the image"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve long thought about making a thread like this so I&#39;m happy to see it. Fed up with this actively user-hostile web experience to try and drive people to the app.My main gripe is definitely expanding comments -&gt; First of all, only the top comment will be shown. Then you can tap view more which will load another two. But you cannot open all the comments.Because the &#34;create an account to continue&#34; toast pictured is unclosable on my phone. Meaning not only can I not expand any more comments, but I can&#39;t even go back see other un-expanded comments. I need to refresh.Just an absolute rancid experience all around."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I ran into this last week on my nvidia shield. Here&#39;s a summary of the workaround I found (apologies for not having the specific package names offhand):1. Install a new launcher from play store (I found one called &#34;Basic Launcher&#34; that matches the aesthetics of the default one). This doesn&#39;t solve the problem though, because Google disabled changing the default launcher for some user hostile reason, until you delete the existing launcher.2. Enable development mode by tapping on the build number in settings3. Connect an adb shell to your device4. Remove the built in launcher5. Reboot, select basic launcher when promptedI own a few android TV devices, have recommended them to people in the past, and won&#39;t be purchasing another. I think what happened here should be illegal and shame on whoever worked on this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am hopeful that now that the FTC has a pro-consumer Chair that some of these anti-consumer acts will be curtailed.I would also argue that some of these bad acts could be considered to be false / deceptive trade practices under the various state laws (in the U.S. at least). For example, some people would never have bought a FireTV cube for streaming video if Amazon had revealed that they would be adding advertisements to the consumer&#39;s video-viewing experience.But: how much incentive is there for individuals to file a small claims suit against Amazon for a $79 device? Generally speaking you might get treble damages but not much more unless you&#39;ve had actual damages.And although class action suits are frustrating and should be &#34;fixed&#34; so that those harmed get the bulk of the proceeds (i.e. it&#39;s not okay that consumers receive discount coupons or $10 checks while plaintiff&#39;s counsel receives a disproportionally huge payday) this is one thing we&#39;ve lost by generally not allowing class actions.David v. Goliath is not as effective as 15,000 Davids v. Goliath.Not to even mention the mandatory arbitration imposed on consumers (which do sometimes carve out the ability to file in small claims court).We have cultivated, or at least allowed, a very anti-consumer bias to take hold in U.S. law."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hate to be that guy, but this is exactly why I happily paid for an Apple TV. Yes, it’s $100 more than basic streaming sticks, but I have never had to worry about ads suddenly appearing after an update. This whole space is a race to the bottom with sticks being sold at or below cost because you are the product. For example, Vizio revealing in their first quarterly report as a public company that they get nearly as much revenue from selling ads and viewer usage data than from selling physical televisions.https://www.engadget.com/vizio-q1-earnings-inscape-013937337...A smooth, clean ad-free experience is certainly worth the extra price if you can afford it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In the era when system research is dying [1], the only saving graces are the Nix/Guix for OS management improvement and perhaps eBPF for OS performance enhancement. The Winix OS is a breath of fresh air in term of potential OS directions.Like they have always said, timing is everything and probably this is the project similar to Apple&#39;s Newton project that have many goods in it but just born several years too early.Winix targets RISC architecture and with RISC-V taking off exponentially at the very moment, having RISC biased OS will definitely provide edges and advantages for the platform, similar to x86 quirks to Linux, and Linux taking advantages when x86-32 and x86-64 took off.This year when Linus was asked for the best Linux achievement compared to other OS, Linus has pointed out the innovative Linux based lock-free filesystem [2]. Winix has built-in innovative POSIX compatible in-memory file-system (IMFS) by default.  Imagine an OS with IMFS that&#39;s also natively compatible with the increasingly popular Arrow and TileDB in-memory format.  With Terabyte (TB) RAM computers becoming the norm in the near future this can easily be the fastest OS with the state-of-the-art filesystem around. Fuschia is another latest OS on-the-block but by focusing on the mobile rather than desktop it will probably optimized for the former, unlike Winix.[1]https://tianyin.github.io/misc/irrelevant.pdf[2]https://www.tag1consulting.com/blog/interview-linus-torvalds..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m curious about the hardware it runs on, and didn&#39;t immediately find answers on Google. Could you talk about what hardware is on a usual system and what device drivers need to do for screen, serial port, disk drives, etc.? Does the CPU use floating point?The reason I ask: for the past six months I&#39;ve been dipping my toes in OS development for x86 with BIOS, SVGA and ATA interfaces: https://github.com/akkartik/mu And I&#39;m way out of my depth. I have this suspicion that x86 might be one of the more difficult environments for device drivers, so I&#39;m curious to hear what other hardware looks like."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oh my. Minix1. That predates me and my gray hairs.I at least got Minix 2 with the printed source code in AST&#39;s book. Minix 2 was so annoying on real PC hardware that I had to stick a keyboard repeat rate and delay patch whenever I used it. It was all straightforward and the lab assignments on it were easy because it was built for tinkering rather than efficiency.My uni replaced FreeBSD as the teaching operating system of choice. They also go rid of Oracle DBMS# for Postgres.# Many, many moons ago I nearly got Aaron Swartz&#39;ed. This is because I tried browsing &#34;proprietary&#34; docs using a Java-based internet proxy to bypass IP ACLs from my &#34;off-campus&#34; location. It was clearly located in North Korea. Then, the browsing was so slow (like Tor but even worse), I figured: Why not mirror it locally instead? And, what kind of documentation &#34;toilet-paper&#34; police are going to sit there watching interactively or SNORT monitor what happens to &#34;precious&#34; corporate documentation they forced me to use?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Honest question- what is Google&#39;s exposure here?  Both Youtube and Google (Youtube&#39;s parent company) are blocked in China; those revenue streams were cut off a long time ago.  What does Google have to lose by letting Youtube keep the videos up?I&#39;m sure the exposure exists; I recognize that Googlers aren&#39;t stupid.  I honestly am just curious what that risk is.  Having lived in Shanghai for 5 years, I don&#39;t see China reversing their ban on either company anytime soon, so I&#39;m curious what carrot and/or stick China has left.So far, the one thing I can think of is their physical office presence in Beijing / Guangzhou / Hong Kong [0].  That risk is non-trivial- China could simply swoop in and arrest employees, either specific individuals or en masse (neither would surprise me).

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From the Twitter link:&gt; IME, people in dynamic languages almost never program this way, though—they prefer to use validation and some form of shotgun parsing. My guess as to why? Writing that kind of code in dynamically-typed languages is often a lot more boilerplate than it is in statically-typed ones!I feel that once you&#39;ve got experience working in (usually functional) programming languages with strong static type checking, flakey dynamic code that relies on runtime checks and just being careful to avoid runtime errors makes your skin crawl, and you&#39;ll intuitively gravitate towards designs that takes advantage of strong static type checks.When all you know is dynamic languages, the design guidance you get from strong static type checking is lost so there&#39;s more bad design paths you can go down. Patching up flakey code with ad-hoc runtime checks and debugging runtime errors becomes the norm because you just don&#39;t know any better and the type system isn&#39;t going to teach you.More general advice would be &#34;prefer strong static type checking over runtime checks&#34; as it makes a lot of design and robustness problems go away.Even if you can&#39;t use e.g. Haskell or OCaml in your daily work, a few weeks or just of few days of trying to learn them will open your eyes and make you a better coder elsewhere. Map/filter/reduce, immutable data structures, non-nullable types etc. have been in other languages for over 30 years before these ideas became more mainstream best practices for example (I&#39;m still waiting for pattern matching + algebraic data types).It&#39;s weird how long it&#39;s taking for people to rediscover why strong static types were a good idea."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This principle is how pydantic[0] utterly revolutionized my python development experience. I went from constantly having to test functions in repls, writing tons of validation boilerplate, and still getting TypeErrors and NoneTypeErrors and AttributeErrors left and right to like...just writing code. And it working! Like one time I wrote a few hundred lines of python over the course of a day and then just ran it... and it worked. I just sat there shocked, waiting for the inevitable crash and traceback to dive in and fix something, but it never came. In Python! Incredible.[0] https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a great post.  I come back to it frequently.There&#39;s beautiful clarity in the articulation, and the essence is easy to grasp yet powerful.  It reminds me a bit of Scott Wlaschin&#39;s Railway Oriented Programming (ROP) [0]. As a technique, ROP nicely complements &#34;parse don&#39;t validate&#34;.  As an explanation, it&#39;s similarly simple yet wonderfully effective.I&#39;ve a real admiration for people who can explain and present things so clearly.  With ROP, for example, the reader learns the basics of monads without even realising it.[0]: https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/rop/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The concepts in the article sound foreign to me - they are, since I live in the EU. In Central European countries, most houses are built to last 80-150+ years. People like to use bricks, aerated concrete or specially treated wood that will last for a very long time. There are other systems too, like walls filled with small clay pellets mixed with concrete. Houses built in such a way are quite expensive, usually €300k or more for a typical family home where I live. That leaves some room for prefab (Fertigteilhaus) to be cheaper, contrary to what OP wrote.There are small model cities you can visit where several dozen prefabbers exhibit their current model homes, and if you stick to their plan, you will usually pay less than building on your own. Those are often built on wood frames, but are still quite sturdy and supposed to last at least 100 years. Others are built with bricks or aerated concrete just like individually built homes. Savings are probably achieved by bulk orders, prefab, and a well coordinated team who has built the exact same house ten times already."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great essay. This is a much more sophisticated analysis of construction efficiency than you typically find; most of them basically imply that construction is inefficient because contractors are dumb.One minor comment: balloon framing is not a synonym for light wood framing, it&#39;s a (mostly archaic) version of it. Balloon framing features long exterior wall studs that extend up multiple stories, as opposed to modern &#34;platform framing&#34;, in which the studs stop at each floor."</p>
