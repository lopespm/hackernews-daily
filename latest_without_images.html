								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s even more frustrating, because the game is good. I really enjoyed playing the first 30 levels or so. Good story, good controls, very satisfying gameplay. If I could pay $60 and just have a &#34;classic&#34; Diablo on my phone, I might. But I won&#39;t spend a cent on consumable in-app purchases.It is so sad that &#34;make good game, sell it&#34; model no longer works. It&#39;s all a wonky curve of &#34;free - couple of dollars - hundreds and thousands of dollars&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The thing is - is it necessary to have the best gear to enjoy the game?As a different example - I&#39;m sure it would cost tens of thousands of dollars to max out your characters and gear in Genshin Impact, but I&#39;ve played very enjoyable 100h+ and it&#39;s perfectly fine even if you don&#39;t have the max ascended characters and gear, I have a feeling those are there basically for the wales to spend money on but aren&#39;t necessary for gameplay in any way(well maybe for some crazy hardcore end game content, but as always, that seems to be something 0.0001% of the playerbase enjoys).My point is - the game can still be enjoyable and worth playing even if you can&#39;t get the endgame gear. Is that the case here? I don&#39;t know."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hope more country follow suit of Belgium and The Netherlands and classify loot boxes with a random drop element as gambling, and as such make it heavily regulated and banned to kids. This kind of practices are evidently predatorial and manipulative and should be greatly discouraged."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"My dad was fortunate enough to get into a trial at Sloan for Obinutuzumab for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.  At the moment, after 6 weeks of treatment, the percent of cancerous cells in his bone marrow has gone from 95% to 5%.  The treatment was very intense as it overloads the kidneys on the first few treatments due to the dramatic amount of cells being flushed out.  This is a cancer for which there was not much treatment previously other than extreme chemotherapy which still left little hope for complete remission.   A family friend was also treated for Non-Hodgkins&#39; lymphoma on another drug trial and she&#39;s now in full remission.my uninformed impression is that there&#39;s a lot of new cancer treatments happening now that can turn the tide for a lot of types of cancer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is misleading. Yes, the response rate is extremely high but all of this patients shared a mutation or a group of mutations in mismatch repair proteins (they were all MMR deficient, or mismatch instability high).This effect is shared across many tumors with this feature not only rectal and the FDA approved a drug with the same exact mechanism in 2017 (https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-information-approved-dru...)If I had to guess this is a huge marketing plot to bring yet another extremely expensive drug to the market. What is happening is that different drugs (ie different companies) take the space of a specific tumor (Keytruda for lung, Opdivo for melanoma, Tecentriq for liveer cancer) and Dostarlimab is going to claim the rectal cancer space."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"IMHO, this was not cheating. This is a phenomenon called success.  If you are fortunate (?) to be around in the entrepreneurial world long enough, you will realize that intelligence, hard work, good time management etc are not adequate.  They just qualify as deserving.  There are serendipities that separate those who succeed from everybody else who was deserving. Survivor bias [1]. Calling Eli was your serendipity.  The opposite is also true:  killer asteroids hit the planets of otherwise deserving individuals and initiatives.  I was co-founder of a municipal fiber-to-the-home initiative in 1996.  We had both a winning technical recipe and also a financial engineering recipe. (Extremely rare even today)  We were then fortunate enough to acquire a customer that was a newly minted public company, representing a whopping 65% of our business.  Banker&#39;s dream, but in actuality a big mistake.  Then the double-whammy of fraud by that public company (wiping it out completely before our contract was realized) AND the dot-com crash.  Killer asteroids are real.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Qd3erAPI9w"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One time a company I interviewed with asked me obscure algorithm questions about playing card shuffling. As a former professional magician I knew the optimal answers instantly and could jot them down straight away. They had allocated an hour for answers I wrote in a few minutes. I could have told them I had a massively unfair advantage, but I did not bother.They were visibly impressed and told me I was moving on to the final interview stage right away. I declined, as I hate companies that select for algorithm puzzle skill instead of real world problem solving experience."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I actually cheated on an online assessment for one of my first programming jobs. It was my dream job and really wanted to get into that company. Under the pressure, I just couldn&#39;t figure out the solution to the last challenge which was a recursive algorithm. Normally, I would be able to do this but I just got stuck and in a moment of panic, I StackOverflow&#39;d the question on a secondary device which provided me the exact answer. I typed it in with my own style and submitted the assessment.I got the job, stayed at the company for 4 years with great performance reviews and it shaped my experience as the programmer I am today. I couldn&#39;t imagine where I would be without the experience I gained there."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My rule is: if I get a single notification that I find useless, I&#39;ll immediately disable that notification channel (I&#39;m on Android; I&#39;m not sure if iOS has a concept of channel-specific settings) for that app. Even if the channel can include useful notifications, as the article discusses.If the app doesn&#39;t bother to categorize its notifications into channels at all, I turn off its notifications entirely, and I won&#39;t turn it back on.If something is important enough, I can always manually check on it. My attention is too valuable to me to waste it on useless notifications.I do want more control over my notifications in general. I use Google Apps Script to automatically process/triage my email, and I want to do something similar with notifications. I can probably do so using Tasker, but I haven&#39;t gotten around to it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve noticed this in social networks as well. If you don&#39;t get enough transactional notifications for a while they start making up fake ones like Twitter&#39;s &#34;in case you missed this Tweet&#34;, Facebook&#39;s &#34;[someone] posted for the first time in a while&#34;, all the while lighting up the notifications badge. Leads to a &#34;boy who cried wolf&#34; scenario in which I stop trusting notifications entirely and just ignore them, possibly missing out on actual useful ones.I really wish companies let us turn this kind of thing off, or better yet stopped trying to boost &#34;engagement&#34; numbers by violating your user&#39;s trust."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a pretty good idea on how to fix this (and many similar) problems: &#34;hibernate app&#34; option. Its a new app state where app icon icon has some mark (like being semi-grayed out) and all the background app services are disabled (tracking, promotional popups, periodic wakeups, etc...). The app is only un-hibernated if user explicitly clicks on it, it cannot do it by itself. The app can be hibernated by long-press menu on app icon or notification.So the first time you get an ad notify, you click &#34;hibernate&#34; and you are good. And if it is time to make another order, app is woken up, so you cannot miss notifications by accident.Sure, it is not as good as having separate &#34;show ads&#34; toggle, but it requires no cooperation from app whatsoever,"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Years ago I completed the permanent opt-out for everyone in my household (needing to mail in a paper form is shameful). However, very few unsolicited junk mails since.  For any that get through I call that company&#39;s support line and request removal.  Works ~90% of the time.One cool free feature the USPS does offer is Informed Delivery [0]: 
Every morning around 7am I get an email from the postal service with scanned images of all the mail (face of the envelope) I&#39;m receiving that day.[0]  https://informeddelivery.usps.com/box/pages/intro/start.acti..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another fun thing you can do is return all prepaid response envelopes empty, to increase the cost of the advertising.Marketing mail for the USPS is $13.9 billion of their total revenue of $73.1 billion. (19% of total revenue).The USPS could easily provide a form that let you opt out of all bulk marketing mail.https://qz.com/emails/quartz-obsession/2062562/junk-mail/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There should be DNS for paper mail. Telling everyone where I live just to receive mail sounds insane in XXI.I wish I could get a permanent address such as myname@usps.com and get paper mail directed as needed every time I move. Allowing people redirect paper mail to spam could save USPS billions."</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31628832">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I believe submission title is inaccurate:&gt; This study shows that various mafic rock glasses almost certainly present on the surface of the Hadean Earth catalyze the formation of polyribonucleic acid in water starting from nucleoside triphosphates.&gt; Thus, the prebiotic relevance of this result very much depends on whether nucleoside triphosphates were present to Hadean impact fields.In other words, RNA spontaneously forms on basalt lava glass in the presence of nucleoside triphosphates. These are compounds for which there is no known prebiologic formation process - we only know of nucleoside triphosphates as compounds created by living organisms.Disclaimer: I am not an expert in this area, I just read the article."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the whole RNA thing is a bit over hyped. People like RNA because it looks somewhat like computer code, and our technology is just smitten with computers, these recent decades. And right along with that, it makes for such a painfully obvious way to implement inheritance and natural selection, a way to make genes.But I think our focus is too narrow, we should think bigger than just obvious solutions. Now, it&#39;s great if the early oceans were awash with RNA, but does RNA exploit energy gradients on its own? The idea of all this random RNA just sloshing around, using nothing more than entropy, behaving as genes and inventing all the rest of it, just seems a little cart-before-the-horse.What about metabolism-first? Is fire alive? It has many properties of life but, critically, lacks self regulation and heritability. Burns everything and goes out. Imagine though, a system of enzymes that can assimilate various specific kinds of molecules, and sustain production of those enzymes. Imagine this contained, compartmentalized in some way. Dynamically not much more complicated than simple fire, but crucially, the enzymes can be said to be inherited. These are not &#39;genes&#39; as such, these are the actual machinery. It should be possible for natural selection to act on &#39;life&#39; no more complicated than that. And that kind of system could then take find uses for RNA.(And yes, the enzymes I refer to could be realized as RNA, but acting as the enzymes directly, not merely describing them, and this would confer some major benefits)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a very interesting result. Does anyone know how likely ribonucleoside triphosphates are to be formed in young earth conditions? What is the state of the research on this topic?It seems like this is a pre-print but if it stands up to peer review this would appear to be a big step forward in our understanding of abiogenesis, and would seem to be good evidence for the RNA world hypothesis.I always kind of hoped abiogenesis happened multiple times on multiple worlds, rather than once and then spread through panspermia. This result seems to indicate it could have happened here."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;d appreciate it if they could be more upfront about their language support and what this even does for me. Right now this is: &#34;A better gRPC for Go&#34;. And I don&#39;t know what&#39;s better about it without doing much more research. Apparently proto3 has support for json encoding by default. So they somehow give me a better schema validation. That&#39;s their claim but I don&#39;t see how exactly they do that without going much deeper into it. Meanwhile .proto files are obviously already a schema, so they might be parsing your golang server code to see if it still matches your .proto file. That sounds very brittle to me if true. 
I&#39;m not convinced at all from this post and I don&#39;t see how this works."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Rather than using the Go standard library&#39;s net/http, grpc-go uses its own implementation of HTTP/2. It&#39;s incompatible with the rest of Go&#39;s HTTP ecosystem, so you can&#39;t cleanly serve gRPC requests alongside other HTTP traffic and can&#39;t use most third-party packages.Mostly because grpc-go&#39;s implementation is about 5-10x faster than net/http."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; We&#39;ve got big plans for the Connect ecosystem! Along with Connect in Go, we&#39;ve been working on a TypeScript implementation for browsers. It shares the same design priorities: it&#39;s idiomatic TypeScript all the way down, stays close to the browser&#39;s fetch API, fits neatly into React hooks, and supports both gRPC-Web and Connect&#39;s own protocol. It also produces tiny bundles. We&#39;ve already replaced grpc-web in the Buf Schema Registry frontend, and we&#39;re planning to release connect-web soon â€” stay tuned.i belive this will be huge. biggest blocker for grpc adoption is the really poor js and grpc-web implementations."</p>
