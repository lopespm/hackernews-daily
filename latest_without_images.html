								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The bigger problem, to me, is not around crawling. It&#39;s the asymmetrical power Google has after crawling.Google is obviously on a mission to keep people on Google owned properties. So, they take what they crawl and find a way to present that to the end user without anyone needing to visit the place that data came from.Airlines are a good example.  If you search for flight status for a particular flight, Google presents that flight status in a box.  As an end user, that&#39;s great.  However, that sort of search used to (most times) lead to a visit to the airline web site.The airline web site could then present things Google can&#39;t do.  Like &#34;hey, we see you haven&#39;t checked in yet&#34; or &#34;TSA wait times are longer than usual&#34; or &#34;We have a more-legroom seat upgrade if you want it&#34;.Google took those eyeballs away.  Okay, fine, that&#39;s their choice.  But they don&#39;t give anything back, which removes incentives from the actual source to do things better.You see this recently with Wikipedia.  Google&#39;s widgets have been reducing traffic to Wikipedia pretty dramatically.  Enough so that Wikipedia is now pushing back with a product that the Googles of the world will have to pay for.In short, I don&#39;t think the crawler is the problem. And I don&#39;t think Google will realize what the problem is until they start accidentally killing off large swaths of the actual sources of this content by taking the audience away."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"https://knuckleheads.club/the-googlebot-monopoly/ has actual details.&gt; Let’s take a look at the robots.txt for census.gov from October of 2018 as a specific example to see how robots.txt files typically work. This document is a good example of a common pattern. The first two lines of the file specify that you cannot crawl census.gov unless given explicit permission. The rest of the file specifies that Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and two other non-search engines are not allowed to crawl certain pages on census.gov, but are otherwise allowed to crawl whatever else they can find on the website. This tells us that there are two different classes of crawlers in the eyes of the operators of census.gov: those given wide access, and those that are totally denied.&gt; And, broadly speaking, when we examine the robots.txt files for many websites, we find two classes of crawlers. There is Google, Microsoft, and other major search engine providers who have a good level of access and then there is anyone besides the major crawlers or crawlers that have behaved badly in the past that are given much less access. Among the privileged, Google clearly stands out as the preferred crawler of choice. Google is typically given at least as much access as every other crawler, and sometimes significantly more access than any other crawler."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On a related note, Cloudflare just introduced &#34;Super Bot Fight Mode&#34; (https://blog.cloudflare.com/super-bot-fight-mode/) which is basically a whitelisting approach that will block any automated website crawling that doesn&#39;t originate from &#34;good bots&#34; (they cite Google &amp; Paypal as examples of such bots). So basically everyone else is out of luck and will be tarpitted (i.e. connections will get slower and slower until pages won&#39;t load at all), presented with CAPTCHAs or outright blocked. In my opinion this will turn the part of the web that Cloudflare controls into a walled garden not unlike Twitter or Facebook: In theory the content is &#34;public&#34;, but if you want to interact with it you have to do it on Cloudflare&#39;s terms. Quite sad really to see this happen to the web."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s always surprised me that we haven&#39;t seem more attempts at co-op like models in spaces like this, and I&#39;m happy to see it.Uber/Lyft strike me as thin businesses in the value that they actually provide both to riders and drivers. Yes, they were responsible for some initial innovation, but now the cat is out of the bag, and the concept could absolutely be applied in a business structure that is more profitable and friendly to the people actually delivering the services.Getting initial traction with riders, and adequately investing in trust &amp; safety strike me as the two hardest parts up front. On the flip-side, they should benefit from less regulatory scrutiny, and less pressure from investors vs. the heavily funded players like Uber &amp; Lyft.I&#39;m rooting for them and hope to see this go somewhere."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is doubly ironic and amusing if you think about how Uber/Lyft were &#34;disrupting&#34; the existing markets. Well, market forces are at work: if Uber/Lyft provide no additional value over drivers&#39; work (and treat drivers as disposable assets), they themselves will get &#34;disrupted&#34; and the drivers will get rid of them :-)Happy to see this happening, and I wonder how this will develop."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hope this takes off. Ride-hailing apps always seemed like a model that was extremely conducive to a cooperative, worker-owned model. I would gladly (and will try to next time I&#39;m in NYC) use this service over Uber or Lyft. Power to the drivers!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Absolutely blown away by the number of things you can do from a web browser these days. All of this would&#39;ve been unimaginable a mere 10 years ago, right around the time when Google Chrome was in its infancy (or just out of it, to be precise) and the web browser market was still dominated by Internet Explorer, with Opera, Firefox and Safari (back when there was a Windows version of Safari) taking up small slices of the market share.Another cool site to check out: https://coveryourtracks.eff.org -- a great tool to see how unique your browser&#39;s &#39;fingerprint&#39; is and how well it protects you from trackers and other annoyances online."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s so sad that such amazing features are often abused more than they are actually used. It&#39;s always a cat and mouse game with the browser vendors and ad makers.Like web push notifications and popups are two really useful features but the amount of abuse they have had to endure is amazing. Every shitty site from newspapers to reddit to facebook must show a dark screen and ask me to subscribe to web notifications before i can see anything.Then there are hidden APIs for which no permission is needed, like trapping of the back button (where a site gains access to my browser&#39;s back button and won&#39;t let you go back) and page close button (where it shows a popup asking you to confirm you want to leave)."</p>

Especially considering that I&#39;m on a desktop that thankfully doesn&#39;t have such things."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think the conclusions miss the mark slightly and focus on a symptom of good bosses: they care about tasks from a state of understanding what is required to do them well, they have empathy for the challenges, and respect for the talent in completing them. Obviously the easiest way to get to this perspective is to experience it first-hand, hence the correlation between those who could do the job and being good managers of the job, but I don&#39;t see this as a requirement, just a common path.I also don&#39;t see this a refutation that we shouldn&#39;t hire good engineers into management, rather we shouldn&#39;t do this blindly and as the single criteria. My best managers were all top quartile engineers but probably not top 5-10%, because they also cared about the non-technical requirements that a good manager needs to cover, and this inevitable consumes focus, effort and time that your best engineers don&#39;t want to allocate.I&#39;m a relatively new engineering manager (~3 years) and wrote about the traits of a good development manager from my perspective here:https://www.codeleadmanage.com/articles/20200204-four_qualit..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was personally taught by the store manager of a supermarket how to sweep the floor and of course that built respect for him and the organization.  (e.g. he knew how to do every little task like sweep the floor,  cut meat in the deli,  bake bread,  etc.)The (now retied) director of the art museum at Cornell could be seen out in his suit passing out pamphlets for an exhibition together with students promoting clubs and concerts.Go to the exhibition and he&#39;ll personally give a talk about the art that will help you appreciate anything from a suit of Samurai armor to Mark Lombardi&#39;s conspiracy diagrams.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The more junior you are, the more likely it is that not only can your boss do your job, they can do it better than you can. The more senior you become, the less likely that is to be the case.How many CEOs could do all of the CFO, COO, CTO, and General Counsel&#39;s jobs? Zero.How many programming team leads can do the junior programmer&#39;s job? Basically/hopefully all of them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the most fascinating breach analyses I&#39;ve ever read.Reading between the lines, I sense the client didn&#39;t 100% trust Mr. Bogdanov in the beginning, and certainly knew there was exfiltration of some kind.  Perhaps they had done a quick check of the same stats they guided the author toward. &#34;Check for extra bits&#34; seems like a great place to start if you don&#39;t know exactly what you&#39;re looking for.Their front-end architecture seemed quite locked down and security-conscious: just a kernel + Go binary running as init, plain ol&#39; NFS for config files, firewalls everywhere, bastion hosts for internal networks, etc.  So already the client must have suspected the attack was of significant sophistication.  Who was better equipped to do this than their brilliant annual security consultant?Which is completely understandable to me, as this hack is already of such unbelievable sophistication that resembles a Neil Stephenson plot.  Since the author did not actually commit the crime, and in fact is a brilliant security researcher, everything worked out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Superb work. The &#34;who&#34; of attribution is more likely related to the actual PII they were after than any signature you&#39;ll get in the code. Seems like a lot of effort and risk of their malware being discovered for PII instead of being an injection point into those users machines. I rarely hear security people talk about  why a system was targeted, and once you have that, you can know what to look for, inject canaries to test etc."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I also like that the boat is stuck, but not for the same reasons.A stuck boat in general is not usually a big deal, but this particular stuck boat is giving visibility to how fragile and interconnected everything is. Of course we &#34;know&#34; that, but we often don&#39;t see the extent of it until a disaster happens.A system&#39;s capacity got stretched. For a while this worked fine, but safety margins became smaller. It was just a matter of time before an accident like this would happen. And there is no redundancy (on this part of the canal).So I like this stuck boat because it shows where &#34;the system&#34; has weaknesses. The system extends of course into many areas. Trade, finance, engineering, probably politics, etc.Unfortunately, due to greed (oops, &#34;efficiency&#34;) we will always be running systems at, or slightly beyond capacity so accidents/disasters like this will continue to happen.I also like that the boat is stuck simply because it is an example of how quickly the world can &#34;unite&#34; in peaceful discussions around an absurd situation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Was this article written with GPT3? It sure reads like it....This is what Shortlyai spat out for me:I like it that the boat in the Suez canal is stuck,
I really do. I can&#39;t help but feel good about this, 
Not for myself or because I know someone aboard, 
But just because it&#39;s so nice to see orders being reversed. 
Such a long process for me to travel back and forth, 
Sometimes with a visa and sometimes not. It would be great if they could shake things up back home.
I like it that the boat is stuck.I like how the people onboard are still sending their messages, 
And I&#39;m sure many of them are thinking that if they wanted to, 
They could get off the boat and walk around in Ismailia or Port Said, looking for a job. It&#39;d be great to be able to find work in Egypt, but not everyone would think it&#39;s worth all that effort. Plus if they did go ashore there might be an investigation so even if they did a little work for someone on board they might still get into trouble. I know that things will eventually calm down back home but first we&#39;ll have a few good years where people can travel freely and without much hassle."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is what I like about engineering... The problem is there, right in front of you. It can be a very difficult problem, but at least it&#39;s right there, you can see it and measure it and talk about it without debating the underlying facts of the problem.Edit: I&#39;ll rephrase... I like that the problem is tangible. It may not always be obvious. :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Housing cannot both be a good investment and affordable by definition unless new supply outpaces demand.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The average 30-year mortgage rate in 2000 was 8.05%. Given a $2500/month target payment and 20% down, someone could buy a $423,870 house.The average 30-year mortgage rate in 2020 was 3.11%. The same $2500/month payment with 20% down buys a $730,892 house.Ignoring down payments (which differ greatly between the two examples) and other expenses like property taxes, the 2020 mortgage rate allows someone to buy 172% as much house as they could in 2000. This doesn&#39;t translate perfectly to rental prices, but property affordability via low mortgage rates is heavily correlated with increasing rent prices.Not a perfect comparison, but it shows how much mortgage rates are driving the housing price boom. Scary to think what&#39;s going to happen when (if?) rates start going back up.Source for historic numbers: http://www.freddiemac.com/pmms/pmms30.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For housing, a lot of people in tech seem to come down firmly in the &#34;build, baby, build!&#34; camp to increase supply. I think demand should also be suppressed. Specifically, I think there should be a policy barring people from owning more than, say, two housing units. Our society should not support parasitic landlords buying up huge swaths of housing then renting it out to people for the right to half their monthly paycheck.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; One weird inconsistency I’ve noticed is that hair color is done via ZWJ, while skin tone is just modifier emoji with no joiner. Why? Seriously, I am asking you: why? I have no clue.Mainly because skin tone modifiers [1] predate the ZWJ mechanism [2]. For hair colors there were two contending proposals [3] [4], one of which doesn&#39;t use ZWJ, and the ZWJ proposal was accepted because new modifiers (as opposed to ZWJ sequences) needed the architectural change [5].[1] https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2014/14213-skin-tone-mod.pdf[2] https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2015/15029r-zwj-emoji.pdf[3] https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2017/17082-natural-hair-color.pd...[4] https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2017/17193-hair-colour-proposal....[5] https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2017/17283-response-hair.pdf"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fantastic post that builds up knowledge along the way. A fun case where this type of knowledge was relevant: when creating emoji short links with a couple characters (symbols), I made sure to snag both URLs: one with the emoji (codepoint + `U+FE0F`) and one with just the symbol codepoint.Another thing worth calling out: you can get involved in emoji creation and Unicode in general. You can do this directly, or by working with groups like Emojination [0].[0] http://www.emojination.org/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article is great, but there is one slightly misleading bit at the start:&gt; The most popular encoding we use is called Unicode, with the two most popular variations called UTF-8 and UTF-16.Unicode is a list of codepoints - the characters talked about in the rest of the article. These live in a number space that&#39;s very big (~2^23 as discussed).You can talk about these codepoints in the abstract as this article does, but at some point you need to put them in a computer - store them on disk or transmit them over a network connection. To do this you need a way to make a stream of bytes store a series of unicode codepoints. This is an &#39;encoding&#39;, UTF-8 and UTF-16, UTF-32 etc. are different encodings.UTF-32 is the simplest and most &#39;obvious&#39; encoding to use. 32 bits is more than enough to represent every codepoint, so just use a 32-bit value to represent each codepoint, and keep them in a big array. This has a lot of value in simplicity, but it means that text ends up taking up a lot of space. Most western text (e.g. this page) fits in the first 127 bits and so for the majority of values, most of the bits will be 0.UTF-16 is an abomination that is largely Microsoft&#39;s fault and is the default unicode encoding on Windows. It is based on the fact that most text in most language fits in the first 65535 unicode codepoints - referred to as the &#39;Basic Multilingual Plane&#39;. This means that you can use a 16 bit value to represent most codepoints, so unicode is stored as an array of 16-bit values (&#34;wide strings&#34; in MS APIs). Obviously not all Unicode values fit in, so there is the capability to use two UTF-16 values to represent a code-point. There are many problems with UTF-16, but my favourite is that it really helps you to have &#39;unicode surprises&#39; in your code. Something in your stack that assumes single byte characters and barfs on higher unicode values is well known, and you find it in testing fairly often. Because UTF-16 is a single value for the vast majority of normal codepoints, it makes that worse by making it only happen in a very small number of cases that you will inevitably only discover in production.UTF-8 is the generally agreed to be the best encoding (particularly among people who don&#39;t work for Microsoft). It is a full variable length encoding, so a single codepoint can take 1, 2, 3 or 4 bytes. It has lots of nice properties, but one is that codepoints that are &lt;= 127 encode using a single byte. This means that proper ASCII is valid UTF-8."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We used this a couple times at Sandstorm back in the day. At the end of the interview the candidate would play Factorio cooperatively with the team for a while.I think it is remarkably effective at identifying the kinds of skills and personality traits that a software engineer actually needs to have in day-to-day work. You can find out if someone is self-directed, how fast they work, whether they produce clean designs or spaghetti code, whether they are good at cooperating or tend to go off on their own, etc. Some people will just sit and watch and do nothing unless instructed... that&#39;s bad. Some people will build stuff, but with obvious efficiency flaws and &#34;bugs&#34;... also bad. Some people identify what needs doing and get it done effectively but without trying to be perfect... that&#39;s good. Factorio essentially compresses real-world work patterns into a shorter time period, giving you the chance to see how someone works in the space of a couple hours. I don&#39;t know anything else that does that.But, obviously, it&#39;s problematic. A person who has played the game before will have a big advantage. A person who doesn&#39;t play video games at all will have a big disadvantage. For these reasons, I don&#39;t think I could seriously recommend this approach be adopted more widely.But then, I don&#39;t know of any approach to interviewing that I think is fair. Everything has problems:* Regular interviews bias towards people that are charismatic, not effective.* Coding interviews bias towards people who can code under pressure with someone looking over their shoulder, which is almost nothing like real-world coding.* Puzzle-y algorithms questions identify people good at clever solutions but that&#39;s hardly what most people need to do day-to-day when coding.* Take-home assignments bias towards people who have lots of free time, and still don&#39;t really tell you how that person works with others.* Looking at GitHub history biases against people whose lives are too busy to code in their free time (e.g. maybe they have kids) and who weren&#39;t lucky enough to have a previous job that touched a lot of open source.* Looking at past work experience misses brilliant junior programmers coming out of college.* Don&#39;t even think about using ML for this, that doesn&#39;t solve biases, it just hides them in a black box.It seems like there&#39;s no right answer here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Please don&#39;t. Better, I&#39;ll remove the please and go JUST DONT FUCKING DO IT.Hiring is broken because most people hiring aren&#39;t good at it and the people working in tech are pretty much idiots (I&#39;m focusing more on SV-startup, 5hour discussion about aeropress, put people down because they chose vim or emacs - people kinds). From &#39;cultural&#39; fit interviews (who the fuck cares if you are a sikh or an atheist, whiskey drinking or think alcohol is evil? You are hired to do a job, not much more). This &#39;i have my social life at work, so I want people I can hang out with&#39; shit has got to end. I work remotely for 10+ years and I can see in interviews/meetings the people that seem to base their identity and life around work, and the ones that actually are well rounded people that don&#39;t care about which coffee grind size you use on your morning crap of joe.I have been a professional boxer and dabbled with MMA/Grappling. I can say most things in the article can apply. So.. at the end of the interview just get them in gloves and duke a few rounds? I would be sued out of existence, but for some reason, between take home assignments, 10h whiteboard drilling and whatever the fuck is hip now (leetcode or what not), interviewing is broken because people are idiots. I have been interviewing people for the last 5 years. If in an one hour talk that is semi technical, you can&#39;t understand if the person knows what the fuck they are doing or not, then the problem is you, not the whiteboard or the take-home or the paid assignment. Just admit most people interviewing others for technical positions have not fucking clue or training, BUT, hey, they are smart people from Standford or MIT, so &#39;how hard can it be&#39; and we get the clusterfuck that it is now"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good lord, this is an awful idea. I&#39;ve played a ton of Factorio, and I&#39;m a decent engineer, and while the skillsets are similar conceptually, the actual execution and mechanics of them are very very different. Factorio involves a lot of care with spatial layout, tricks to optimize loading the conveyer belts, ensuring that the right ratios of pre-cursors are sent, etc etc.You could get a candidate who perfectly understands design patterns for programming, because they&#39;ve studied programming and know how to program using programming languages and programming tools, but they don&#39;t translate that very well into the spatial environment of Factorio. Debugging and optimizing in Factorio again are conceptually similar to doing so in a programming language, but the actual techniques and patterns available to do so are very very different, and you have to learn them. Most of us do not figure these things out from scratch by ourselves.As others have pointed out, it also is begging for a monoculture. Plenty of people who are good at programming don&#39;t give a shit about video games, and will either do poorly in this interview, or will skip it altogether. The result would be hiring one type of person, and not having any other skillsets on your team. Even as someone who would do well in this interview, I would run screaming, as I do not want to work in a monoculture."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Nice introduction. A good ramp-up from basic splitting to ranking.It does need to be said that when Lucene had a set of features this small, it was also pretty tiny. And, if those are the needs, one could still download it and it will probably run on modern JVM:https://archive.apache.org/dist/lucene/java/lucene-1.4.3.jar                2004-11-29 14:13  316KIt is a bit bigger of course, but that&#39;s because it already had stemmers, multilingual support, multiple Query Parsers including phrase, RAM and Disk directory implementations and a bunch of other advanced features one can easily see by unzipping the jar file."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I went down this rabbit hole some ten years ago, and somewhere along the line I discovered SQLite has an FTS engine (up to version 5 now, I think) and just started using that instead. Massive performance for tens of gigs’ worth of text content on a single core."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Neat! One production ready python library I love to use in this space is https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/ It is quite mature and can handle a good amount of data well!
It offers topic modeling too and can b helpful to find similar documents also."</p>
