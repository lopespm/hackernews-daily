								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not entirely defending things but observing that if you are of a view that IPR is basically absurd, &#34;stealing&#34; it may be equally absurd, but rational.After you&#39;ve stolen it, it&#39;s still &#34;there&#34; except for the exclusivity.Chips will still exist, fab lines will still run. Profits have tanked, sure. Innovation is probably stifled but that&#39;s an opportunity loss.There&#39;s a long history of stealing IPR at the state level around the world. States do this, private individuals do this, assets get seized everywhere from time to time.&#39;Sovereign risk&#39; has always to be factored in to any business venture, anywhere. Nobody can possibly have been investing millions in China mainland without knowing this risk going in. At this point, &#34;outrage&#34; is part of the negotiating tactics. Outrage won&#39;t really stop this happening here or anywhere else. Bilateral consequences might? What Chinese assets will somebody seize?The German petrochemical and drugs sector was economically robbed postwar WW1 and WW2 and personally I think somewhat rightly so. Bayer made cool drugs, but also helped the nazi party. Russia and America both took things as expropriation. Postwar, but.. does war make this IPR and asset claim really that much better?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If the current course continues this seems likely to lead to a bifurcation of the Arm ecosystem - presumably with Arm customers outside of China competing with incompatible products exported from China based on Arm China designs.I don&#39;t have any insight into the quality of the Arm China team but isn&#39;t one possible outcome that there is strong competition between the two ecosystems. So we could be in an Arms race (sorry!)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Apple agrees to make sure the search results in the App Store are based on objective criteria.I cant help but laughed when I was reading it. What were they doing before that?I thought the most important part was the next bit,&gt;The settlement, which must be approved by Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, comes as Apple is awaiting a ruling in a separate lawsuit, brought by Fortnite developer Epic Games, which seeks to force Apple to allow rival in-app payment and store options.&gt;The same federal judge is hearing the Apple-Epic case and a ruling could come at any time.My guess is that the way things are going in these cases are not in Apple&#39;s flavour. And for all the court case I followed over years Apple tends to be the favourite in court. Rightfully or not. ( Some of the Judge are very clearly biased ) But Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers was clearly trying to get to the bottom of things. And asking some very hard questions.Is this enough? I am not sure if Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers is easy to please either. And let&#39;s not forget this is US only. EU are grinding their teeth. Then there are South Korea and Japan. And China is surpassingly quiet in all of these.Phil Schiller was right, if Apple were to ever change its fee structure, that it should do so “from a position of strength rather than weakness”.     It was unfortunate Steve passed away soon after that email."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Developers can communicate directly with customers about alternative payment options. Customers have to consent and be given the right to opt-out.This is a huge step forward (though it falls well short of the ideal case) for iOS development. Having the ability to tell customers about other, often cheaper, payment methods removes a substantial barrier for some apps that have high-priced subscriptions.Positive as this change is, there is still a lot of ground to be won here. I&#39;m fearful concessions like this will work as legal currency in the Epic case, instead of momentum pushing ongoing shifts in app store policy. Can someone with more legal understanding weigh in on that?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Congratulations.
It&#39;s not easy! But it can be done. It depends on what your priorities are. Here&#39;s my tips from the time our new baby was born.#1 Set aside time to work
This is the important part, you can&#39;t &#34;work when you&#39;re inspired&#34;. Set aside the 2-3 hours you need per day. At the time I had a full-time job and the baby was born. My partner at the time was a stay-at-home-mom, which helped a lot. But I had duties to be with the baby in the evenings -- feedings, etc. I watched a movie or series with my partner after the baby was sleeping, THEN I went to work when my partner was sleeping.#2 Constraints are important
Because of the minimal amount of time (few hours per day) you have to spend it wisely. In this case, I had a strong to-do list with few distractions. I would work on that list and try to finish a few items (completely) every night.#3 No distractions
No social media was consumed. No YouTube, no instagram, no twitter, tv off. Back in those days these services were just starting anyway, so things were kind of &#34;new&#34;.#4 Motivations
Biggest motivator was my family. Living in New York City was not easy in a nice apartment and a family to support. I knew my side project HAD to work and it DID because I had NO choice. Even with an almost 6 figure job, it would not have been able to do everything, even in 2004.At some point, you have to balance out things. You CAN&#39;t spend all your time with your family.And you can&#39;t spend all your time with your job.You have to have some time for each one. And where people fail badly, is when they spend quantity instead of quality time with kids or work.Believe me, its best to spend less, but QUALITY time with your kids, rather then a whole lot of random time.Your mileage will not vary."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; there is an important distinction between “working hard” and “maximising the number of hours during which one works”.  In particular, forcing oneself to work even when one is tired, unmotivated, unprepared, or distracted with other tasks can end up being counterproductive to one’s long-term work productivity, and there is a saturation point beyond which pushing oneself to work even longer will actually reduce the total amount of work you get done in the long runWorth highlighting, for those of you that are skipping through."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve held for a long time that you must know the rules quite well before you&#39;re &#34;allowed&#34; to break them, and I think this reinforces my opinion on that.Additionally, I think the obsession over &#34;intelligence&#34; and &#34;natural ability&#34; is vastly overstated, in general.  It absolutely helps, and it compounds, to be smart, but a person who &#34;works hard&#34; is infinitely more valuable to their colleagues than a smart person who doesn&#39;t, and tries to rely on raw intellect.My problem, and I wonder if others have this issue as well, is how hard it is to know these things intellectually, and also apply them to my life.  I just cannot, for the life of me, maintain a &#34;work hard&#34; mindset.  I&#39;m still trying, but I very often fail at this, and its frustrating because I know how valuable it is to being good at what I do."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If there&#39;s anyone I&#39;ll listen respectfully to about the value of hard, diligent work, it&#39;s Terence Tao.Reminds me of Richard Hamming talking about his professional envy of John Tukey:One day about three or four years after I joined, I discovered that John Tukey was slightly younger than I was. John was a genius and I clearly was not. Well I went storming into Bode&#39;s office and said, ``How can anybody my age know as much as John Tukey does?&#39;&#39; He leaned back in his chair, put his hands behind his head, grinned slightly, and said, ``You would be surprised Hamming, how much you would know if you worked as hard as he did that many years.&#39;&#39; I simply slunk out of the office!From &#34;You and Your Research&#34;: https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wonder if this will be good or bad for the competitiveness of China if they are able to enforce it.The company I work in now has no problem competing with Chinese companies working 996, despite us working 7.5h days and having way more vacation days. I believe part of that is that working longer hours doesn&#39;t necessarily make you more productive, as has been discussed in tech communities for a while now.The thing is, to be productive with shorter working hours requires a very different culture. The company I work in now has a very flat structure, and people are encouraged to work on side projects that can improve productivity, and there&#39;s a focus on continuously improving methodology. The last company I worked for was Chinese-American (based in US, but 99% Chinese working there), and it was the exact opposite. Decisions on what to work on was made top-down and results were mainly achieved through brute force. Although since we worked in a somewhat independent office in Europe we ended up with a hybrid system.So the question is, will a shift away from 996 lead to a shift in work culture that increases productivity, or will they just work fewer hours with the same culture?That seems to be the problem for the CCP in general. They want to make improvements, but they don&#39;t really get to the root of the problem. They crack down on after-school tutoring for instance, but they don&#39;t change the Gaokao system, so tutoring will just go underground."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a Chinese myself, I&#39;ve been through a lots of this kind of paper reading club. And yes, you read the law you then you roughly know what is illegal. And clearly, those people in the reading club can read paper text in it&#39;s literal means, so that&#39;s a cognitive pass, congrats!However, let&#39;s don&#39;t forget that you cannot form labor union without blessings from the party. Let&#39;s also don&#39;t forget that in China, company can fire people really easily, they just hide those unfair or even discriminatory reasons under the table, no one will help you because helping people is too costly.There is a labor union in China of course, The labor union, called ACFTU, or All-China Federation of Trade Unions. I don&#39;t remember when was the last time they actually sued someone/company, maybe never.Personally, I don&#39;t think those paper laws and paper institutions are actually there to serve the general public. So I don&#39;t even care what they&#39;ve said, nothing will change for the better."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I once had a chinese colleague who came to europe for a few years. She always thought we were lazy for working so short and every argument i brought up about mental health and work efficiency was met with a: &#34;but it works for us&#34;.What i did not understand back then is the absolute replaceability of personel in the chinese market. You work long and hard or tomorrow someone else does it.Not only is this a big reason of the economical prowess of china in my opinion, i fear that this work-ethic will come back sooner or later to europe to &#34;stay competitive&#34;.In the face of bankcruptcy or market pressure... managers tend to make irrational and/or unethical decisions. And they will find a way to circumvent the laws.
I am also sure that chinese companies will find a way to circumvent the 996 ruling here."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I worked at Facebook for some time, and did a bunch of data work. We had this culture of building something, looking at the results between the experiment groups, and then choosing the statistically more successful one -- i.e. a newsfeed algorithm that had better engagement.This sounds great at first, and certainly is straightforward if you want a promotion. But behind the scenes some of us had this thought that our observations only amounted to short-term gains. Although we had small long-term experiment holdout groups, the truth is they were rarely reviewed because it was unsexy.My current thinking is that features like the echo chamber effects from Facebook&#39;s algorithms, Snapchat&#39;s snap streaks, and clickbait like this, all serve to optimize short-term engagement. Yeah, I want to watch that sexy new show or keep my streak going or have my opinions validated. But there&#39;s a diminishing return on clickbait, hollow articles isn&#39;t there? I can only fill up so much time with garbage like that before I&#39;m bored. I can only like so many posts before I feel like they&#39;re all the same. And once my snap streak is broken I hate snapping.The data/engineering/product loops at tech companies favor boosting short-term metrics; The employees are incentivized to do so and this is what they measure, so this is what they build. That&#39;s why we end up with features like this. That&#39;s why Snapchat fell off. That&#39;s why Facebook fell off. And that&#39;s why Netflix feels increasingly stale (despite there being a lot of quality content if you dig)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is why I quit my Netflix subscription.The algorithm seems to have picked up the fact that I like watching SciFi and Zombie movies, so my Netflix homepage was this dark place filled with Sci Fi and Zombie movies.One problem with this is that Netflix only has a handful of good SciFi and Zombie movies, and I&#39;ve seen them all. So the homepage was filled with movies I&#39;ve seen already, or the dime-a-dozen copycat movies that just rehash some ideas from popular movies in a slightly different way.The much bigger problem is that even though I like watching Zombie movies, I actually enjoy lots of different movies. But somehow the Netflix algorithm only ever shows me this one genre.So I cancelled my Netflix subscription, and went back to occasionally renting a film on iTunes or Amazon. I watch less now, but I end up watching more diverse and more interesting films."</p>
