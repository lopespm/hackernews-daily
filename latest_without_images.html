					<h3><a href="https://twitter.com/senatecloakroom/status/1503797632745025542">US Senate votes unanimously to make daylight savings time permanent</a></h3>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;d kill for a peek into the parallel universe where it was permanent standard time that was likely to get adopted and see how much effort went into researching the ill effects of that choice to convince people with enough FUD to keep daylight time switching going.Here&#39;s the thing: If you&#39;re a proponent of permanent standard time, you should be in favour of turning off the switching no matter what. Even if it means daylight time. Because you know what? Your local time zone is changeable. You can lobby to change it. If permanent DST really results in the entire country turning into sleep deprived zombies having spontaneous heart attacks as they arrive at work and crashing into children going to school, then there&#39;ll be pressure to change it -- but we will have at least already started the process of eliminating the worse thing: changing twice a year."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m surprised at the number of commenters who think permanent DST is favourable to night owls and bad for morning people.I think it&#39;s night owls and delayed-cycle teenagers attending school who will suffer most under permanent DST.In the Winter, permanent DST means everyone has to get up an hour earlier for work or school&#39;s clock time, relative to the sun which regulates their body rhythm.Someone pointed out virtually nobody sets when they wake by the sun.  Fair enough.  But the sun does affect how well and how long they sleep, how restored they are, how they feel when they wake, and energy and concentration through the rest of the day.Night people already struggle with getting up early enough for clock-time social expectations.  As it&#39;s a struggle already, getting up an hour earlier is going to be harder for them.  (If the sun makes no difference, why is it already hard?)Research (e.g. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30691158) suggests that overall, health will suffer, sleep will be shorter, and educational attainment in teenage years will reduce.  Even brain development may be adversely affected.But there will be more shopping (economic activity), so that&#39;s ok."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I guess I&#39;ll be &#34;that guy&#34; and say even though it&#39;s a disruption I feel a bit sad for the loss of the switch between standard and daylight time.Yeah it&#39;s annoying, but I never found it devastatingly so and it&#39;s almost like an extra 2 holidays, I would occasionally get an extra hour once a year (and also lose an hour). I feel a bit sad knowing my child won&#39;t get that feeling of dread having to go to school one hour earlier and that boost of going to school one hour later. It feels like the world is become more practical in so many ways, but with it we lose some flavor.I also love seasons and dislike places that are the climate year round for the same reason - it&#39;s a little extra something that breaks up the monotony. At least every time-shift you know that half a year has passed. I really imagine a lot of people will become very nostalgic to having to change clocks throughout the house and then eventually it&#39;ll die off and become a completely forgotten relic of the past."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wow, pretty big sale! Big congrats to Chris.Interestingly, DigitalOcean has a knack for acquiring these technical dev sites, in 2019 it acquired Scotch.io[0] which was one of the better technical web development sites out there.Fun fact about Scotch, the founder (Chris Sev[1]) sold the site to DO, joined their team, and later managed to broker a deal to 301 redirect a lot of the pages to his new project Better.dev[2].Absolute genius.[0]: https://www.digitalocean.com/blog/scotch-io-is-joining-digit...[1]: https://twitter.com/chris__sev[2]: https://www.better.dev/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is part of a broader trend. Last year, Balaji Srinivasan tweeted about the idea of SaaS companies buying media companies – https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1374363031417753609 – and as an observer/operator in this space, I&#39;ve heard about a lot of conversations going on behind the scenes with larger companies expressing an interest in smaller media companies (including my own - I value autonomy too much but for the right multiple.. :-D).Consider Hubspot buying The Hustle, Robinhood buying MarketSnacks, Stripe&#39;s various acquisitions (like IndieHackers), Insight Partners bought The New Stack.. and this is all happening in the developer space too. Subscription based companies with high cashflow but high customer acquisition costs will continue to buy attention-based companies with relatively low acquisition costs because, frankly, the owners of the latter are generally quite happy with &#34;modest&#34; (&lt;$40m, say) exits that the former can easily cover."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hope they keep the site as it is, css-tricks.com has been consistently one of the best, if not the best CSS site around, to the point that I search there for a particular topic before going to general purpose search engines, and you&#39;ll frequently find Chris&#39; original articles copypasta&#39;d by &#34;content marketers&#34; anyway. I guess the big time push for CSS3 with ever-changing responsive requirements and new UI idioms of the 2000&#39;s and 2010&#39;s is behind us, as witnessed by css-tricks&#39;s forum with contributions from other world-class experts having closed down last year or so. Could be worse than DO for sure."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wish I understood how people can say &#39;this will result in so much more weird boilerplate garbage code&#39; as it solves a problem that has resulted in an absolutely ludicrous amount of weird boilerplate garbage code. You&#39;re not trading off generic code vs non-generic code. Problems are generic. For solving generic problems, you&#39;re trading off the generic code that best expresses them, for codegen, dynamic downcasting, or Ctrl-V. The first two are not simpler (in the Go way) than generics, and the third is an antipattern in every programming environment."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Generics is the big news, but the fuzzing support is amazing too.  I added a fuzz test to an app I have in about 5 minutes. It was no harder than adding a normal test.I expect to see a huge boon in users of fuzzing techniques which will benefit projects across the board."</p>

				<div class="story__comments">
					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30682137">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think beyond the obvious large sports stadiums, local high schools are among the worst offenders. New tax levies for &#39;schools&#39; almost always pass despite much of that spent on new sports fields meant for the exclusive use of sports teams that constitute only a very small percentage of the student body population (not to mention the overall population). Meanwhile, the school will not even have safe ways for children to ride bikes to school and bus service cannot even be properly maintained."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The financials on this are settled. Sports stadiums are an awful financial investment.  However, running a government is not all about making sound financial investments.  Sometimes it is about pooling resources to provide a joint benefit to society.  Other times it is about trying to price in externalities to allow the market to do its work.  These two issues are not as settled as the investment angle and are almost never discussed.  Sports teams provide utility to people in the region, including people who never pay a cent for a ticket or merchandise. How do you quantity that value and should the government compensate the sports team for that value?  I don&#39;t know the right answer, but I would like to see some economists at least engage with that aspect of these decisions.Also the only way to stop these gifts to private companies is likely with a new federal law banning them. It is simple game theory. These businesses will go where the profit is. Any city or state that refuses to pay will lose out until every city or state refuses to pay.  The best way to force that is with a federal ban."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What really upsets me about public stadiums is when the locals can&#39;t even watch the game.  Take the Rose Bowl in Pasadena.  That stadium is 100% publicly funded by the taxpayers.Since 2011 the Rose Bowl game on Jan 1 has been on ESPN.  So two colleges, the majority of which have been public schools, play in a public stadium and the locals can&#39;t even watch for free.I think at the very least they need to make a law that says all events that take place in a publicly funded stadium need to be broadcast on a free local channel that reaches all of the taxpayers who paid for the stadium."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is the kind of stuff that probably makes some people’s job down the pipe easier and at the same time undermines the Western civilization.Make no mistake, no US citizen outside of the political class benefits from this or other atrocities. The exact same goes for the surveillance programs.Losing the moral high ground degrades the whole society.The whole anti establishment movement rallies around stuff like this. The lefties and the right-wingers will be after  different things but they will be able to come together on the hypocritical stance and corruption of the current system. It unites enemies against you who think that the most important thing is to bring down the current horrible governance and figure out things later."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; “Ammar fabricated the information he provided when undergoing EITs,” it said. “He later admitted to his interrogators/debriefers that he was terrified and lied to get agency officers to stop the measures … Ammar also explained that he was afraid to tell a lie and was afraid to tell the truth because he did not know how either would be received.”Which is pretty much all you need to know about torture."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am sure after learning this all Americans will take to the streets and after a massive protest the government will defund CIA and prosecute everyone responsible for the related crimes. Right?And if that doesn&#39;t happen, European companies will cancel American accounts, IKEA will close shop here, GOG will refuse to sell games in US, etc, etc. Right?Because, as I&#39;ve learned on HN in the last two weeks, all citizens are responsible for what their government is doing, regardless of their knowledge or level of support for the practice."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I lived in Dharamshala (home to the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan government-in-exile) for 3 months a few years ago. My partner at the time went back to the US to visit family, and I didn&#39;t want to leave Asia so I went there since I had some interest in Buddhism at the time, too.In random book stores, I met actual monks who had served time (in China) as political prisoners. One of which had also written a book about it. It was kind of funny to walk in into a book store, see these two guys drinking tea and then get pulled into a conversation out of curiosity. But, as for the stories themselves, probably not that funny. Some of the people (monks, mostly) had physical scars and their stories were anything but fun.I also went to their offices (a modest distance away from the Dalai Lama temple, but very walkable) and got to speak to senior officials there. I asked them basics questions like, &#34;What do you think is the future for Tibet?&#34; and they were very accommodating.We had tea, laughed and talked life. At first they thought I was a journalist, which was hilarious since my approach was very blunt but curious at the same time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d encourage people to read the letter that Thich Nhat Hanh sent Martin Luther King on the self immolation of Vietnamese monks:
https://plumvillage.org/about/thich-nhat-hanh/letters/in-sea...That letter started a correspondence between the two that led to MLK speaking out against the war in Vietnam."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article is poignant and worth reading.This young man chose to die for his beliefs.“The self-immolation of young Tibetans like Tsewang Norbu, who seems to have it all, lays bare China’s claim that the spate of self-immolations that have engulfed the Tibetan plateau since 2009 is triggered by psychological and livelihood issues.China continues to hatch strategies to win the hearts and minds of the new generation of Tibetans in its Sinicization project, but the self-immolation protests by young Tibetans like Yonten and Tsewang Norbu expose how China’s ill-intent strategies in Tibet is deeply hurting young Tibetans.To prevent self-immolations and save lives, TCHRD calls on China to halt its Sinicization programs and uphold the human rights of Tibetans to protect and promote their culture and language, and freely exercise basic freedoms including freedom of expression and freedom to practice one’s religion or belief.”"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Awesome! A huge amount of work must have gone into this.I did some playing around with VGA graphics from the Pico when it first came out (wrote a simple library to produce SNES like graphics, wrote it all up on my blog https://gregchadwick.co.uk/blog/playing-with-the-pico-pt6/). It felt like Doom should be doable but I figured you&#39;d need an off chip RAM expansion interfaced via the PIO. Clearly not.The Pico really is a very fun board to play around with.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s cool, it&#39;s Doom in a completely self-contained cartridge size. Would it be possible to just hook up a cartridge like this to a monitor (through e.g. usb-c) directly?Also if the RP2040 is just $1, does this mean we should be able to get e.g. Doom on cheap handheld single-game devices like the old Game &amp; Watch and similar machines? I remember spending hours on these &#34;racing games&#34; or 12-in-1 Tetris LCD machines from the toy shop. How much does a small (2-4&#34;) color OLED or backlit LCD cost these days? Actually, what is the cheap handheld market looking like these days? I had a boggle at the local toy shop&#39;s website, VTech is still going for it but mainly with baby toys it seems, and those Tetris handhelds are still the same from 20-30 years ago, they cost just €3,99 these days. I&#39;m also seeing some products from a company called Wonky Toys, and miniature Atari arcade cabinets."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"First things first: I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything wrong with the design based on the screenshots. At least, nothing stands out as being so unusable that users would flee for your competitor.As for &#34;Gen Z preferences&#34;, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s enough to go on here to prove that. I&#39;m over 35 and have watched user interfaces go from the the fun, colourful and UNIQUE designs of the 2009-era iOS apps to the hyper-corporate, boring af grid system that&#39;s &#34;Apple Approved&#34;. Android is similar, w/ Material Design. I think they have a new one now that replaces MD, but I can&#39;t be bothered to look it up.You&#39;re creating a video speed dating app. Dating is supposed to be FUN. Why design it like Zoom? Have you used trivia apps like QuizUp? You&#39;ll notice how different the design and dynamics are compared to most apps that are designed to render text/image data in specified fields.Also look at TikTok/Douyin for an example of unconventional app design. They could have just copied Instagram, which is blandness personified. But they went with an unfamilar style that nonetheless took off.

You are different&#34;.Thinking about it further, I actually think this is a super clickbait way to get hits and link clout?
