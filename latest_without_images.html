								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;connect to an existing node&#34; is going to be amazing.I imagine two interesting uses for this.1. producing reports.  Connect a livebook session to your system in prod, run a livebook (which pulls data from DB eg), then get back a report.  User engagement, cloud resources consumed, p90s, or an incident report...2. manual database intervention.  Suppose you need to manually make a batch of changes to the DB.  It would be very cool if you could run a livebook inside of a sandboxed checkout (a temporary transaction) and write your db changes, then write your code that verifies that the db is in a state that you want it to be in.  If you mess up your code, then you just terminate the transaction without committing.  Then when you&#39;re happy with your notebook, you run it once with a commit at the end, and then save your notebook immutably in your records so that you can keep track of what you&#39;ve done.I think for intervening in prod, it would be very cool if someone could figure out how to extend erlang distribution over websockets so you don&#39;t have to figure out complicated mechanisms (open up ssh port, forward encrypted epmd, e.g.) to get into your system in prod"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, this is great.The fact is can connect to existing nodes also makes it can also be great for operation and administration - instead of building an awkward admin panel, you can just having a collection of scripts.The Elixir community is insanely productive. Also, the Elixir system is impressively pretty balanced - productivity-wise like Rails, concurrent-wise like Erlang, and continuously brings novel yet practical ideas to life in a robust manner!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m pretty excited about this. I&#39;m admit I was skeptical when I saw a similar LiveView based notebook a couple months ago, and wondered why not just make a kernel for Jupyter.But with the idea of real-time collaboration I get it. And with the momentum of Jose and team behind it, I think there&#39;s real promise here, especially once they figure out widgets and charts, which they have an open issue for.I program in Elixir at work, so I usually have an iex shell open, but lately I&#39;ve been using a LiveBook and it&#39;s great.And I love the new Mix.install in Elixir 1.12 demonstrated here. Using a hex package in an adhoc way was a real shortcoming in Elixir before. Shows the power of having this thing developed by the language team."</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26854073">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Why is this bad? As the Electronic Frontier Foundation explains in their post “Google’s FLoC is a terrible idea“, placing people in groups based on their browsing habits is likely to facilitate employment, housing and other types of discrimination, as well as predatory targeting of unsophisticated consumers.All of this has been happening with tracking cookies, fingerprint tracking, pixel tracking and so on. And will continue to happen.I find it so bizarre it took Google to talk about phasing out 3rd party cookies and replacing it with a much lesser technology in the face of FLoC, for people to suddenly be all up in arms about it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am hopeful that this will help get rid of FLoC but I worry about two things. One, this will end up being treated like the &#34;no track&#34; headers. That&#39;s just totally ignored after IE (was it IE?) enabled it be default. That gave all the trackers a reason to just ignore it and track everyone. I don&#39;t know if that exact same thing can happen here, but something similar maybe? The other thing I worry about is that FLoC 2.0 or whatever might replace it, will be worse.&#34;Kill it before it lays eggs.&#34; but do we worry about what evolves from this if it dies?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve not been following this proposal closely I did findhttps://github.com/WICG/floc&gt;Tracking people via their cohort&gt;A cohort could be used as a user identifier. It may not have enough bits of information to individually identify someone, but in combination with other information (such as an IP address), it might.Whose purpose is:&gt;A FLoC cohort is a short name that is shared by a large number (thousands) of people, derived by the browser from its user’s browsing history.I wonder if it&#39;s possible to define a large enough number X that people are OK with the idea. (Cookies are effectively &#34;1&#34; and nothing is &#34;3,010,000,000&#34; ie on the internet)Could the cohort minimum size be configurable?Given the IP address can be known today: what&#39;s the existing accidental &#34;FLoC proxy&#34; or &#34;How unique are you online?&#34; Or &#34;online finger print&#34; (something I&#39;d not thought of before: my timezone can significantly narrow down who I am)

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Take a binary array of length N, where N is in the hundreds to thousands range. Choose 2% of the bits to set to 1. Now you have a &#34;sparse array&#34;.Now, you want to use this sparse array to represent a note in a song. So you need every note to consistently map to a distinct* sparse array.However, you also want to be able distinguish a note as being in one song or another. The representation should tell you not only that this is note A but note A in song X.How might you do that? Well some portion of the ON bits could be held consistent for every A note and some could be used to represent specific contexts.Stable and variable bits of you will.Now if you look at two representations of the note A from two songs you&#39;ll see they&#39;re different. How different are they? Well you could just count the bits they have in common or not, or you can treat them as vectors. (Lines in high dimensional space) Then you can calculate the angle between those two lines. As that angle increases its easier to distinguish the two lines. They won&#39;t ever get to full &#34;right angles&#34; between them because of the shared stable bits, but they can be more or less orthogonal.That&#39;s what&#39;s happening here. The brain is encoding notes in a way that it can both recognize A, but also recall it in different contexts.*But not perfectly consistent, we use sparse representations because the brain is noisy and it&#39;s more energy efficient. Pretty close is good enough in the brain and you can encode a lot of values in 1000 choose 20 options."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This really would have been harder for me to understand had I not taken linear and abstract algebra courses a few years ago. That area of maths reused common words like &#34;rotation&#34; but with more generalized definitions, which made it was jarring and confusing to hear and take in at the time. When someone said the word &#34;rotate&#34; my mind as if by reflex was already trying visualize a 3d or 2d rotation even when it made no sense for the problem at hand. Being an English speaker my whole life I thought I understood what a rotation was or could be but I didn&#39;t.Same goes for what&#39;s being alleged here: Is there even a way to visualize this that makes mathematical sense?
What will be the corollaries to this discovery simply as a result of what the mathematics of rotations will dictate?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Something to keep in mind though is that in a high-dimensional space, approximate orthogonality of independent vectors is almost guaranteed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Really nice! When I was in college we had all sorts of online systems that automatically graded assignments based on how close to the correct answer your supplied answer was. I think it&#39;d be nice if in the future there was more of an overlap between science classes and programming classes (almost like a freshman / junior level scientific computation class) where instead of approaching problems from a pure theoretical perspective, we involved these types of computational approaches in parallel. Personally I have found that while I often know how to perform various theoretical computations, it&#39;s faster for me to just throw together a quick script to approximate the result (e.g. what&#39;s the expected value of the product of two gaussians?)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It is already mentioned in Project Lovelace&#39;s About page, but people who like this and Project Euler may also like Rosalind, which is a programming problem site focused on bioinformatics and adjacent algorithms."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like the eclectic selection of problems. I wish I had seen something like this when I was growing up; a manageable set of problems with the hint of depth.It’s easy to snipe a nerd, but nerd sniping a non-nerd.. That’s gold.FWIW:
- No margins on the side on iPhone in portrait.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I feel like I&#39;ve seen this cycle a few times now. Around the 2010-2013 time Firefox was pretty popular and the browser wars had cooled down a bit, various standards had progressed to the point where the web was mostly the same for Firefox users and Chrome users.Then Google Docs, Drive, Voice and a few other apps with the addition of Chromebooks started to appear and all of the sudden a few key features stopped working for Firefox. Probably the most important teachable moment was just how few features it takes to flip users.Maybe we&#39;ll see Firefox regain browser share are users dump Chrome. Edge even has a shot at this point - a strange irony bringing us full circle.I guess the real question is how long until we iterate on this loop again? What will compel users to jump back into the embrace of &lt;insert not yet but eventually evil company&gt; versus the relatively consistent arms of Mozilla.Also, FWIW, Mozilla isn&#39;t innocent either. Despite being very much _less scummy_ they have still upped their scum factor a bit over the years. Let&#39;s not forget they are quite happy to trade millions of dollars to make Google the homepage for their users. While nowhere near as egregious they have some tracking happening (&#34;experiments&#34;), they aggressively push their Firefox Accounts stuff, appear to be selling spots on the homepage tabs, etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Don&#39;t use Chrome and don&#39;t use other browser based on Chromium either. As long as Google&#39;s engine has 85%+ market share, they can just unilaterally do whatever they want to the web.Use Firefox if you actually want to fix the web."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is just a rant and not very helpful for anyone that gets redirected here. I can’t really see anyone that care about their visitors doing this.Do as the good old times when we showed a banner to IE users below a certain version, and suggest better alternatives."</p>

I know there are techpress blogs that pump out articles like this, but there doesn&#39;t seem to be an authoritative compendium of such tech anywhere on the net. I could curate this by hand with 3 hours of free time and some Red Bull I suppose.The reason I want this is because we seem to be swimming in innovation, but nobody to aggregate and make sense of it all, and `join-the-dots` of all this tech so we can make even bigger leaps with it.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For anyone actively managing investment portfolios, a deep understanding of the Kelley criterion is very important. For example, it is common practice to use &#34;Half Kelly&#34; to size positions, but most sources only provide a hand-wavey intuitive explanation. Thorp&#39;s paper[2] quantifies the benefits for any fraction of the &#34;full Kelly&#34; bet and its implications.  In addition to Poundstone&#39;s book [1] I strongly recommend Ed Thorp&#39;s highly readable paper[2].[1] Poundstone, William (2005), Fortune&#39;s Formula: The Untold Story of the Scientific Betting System That Beat the Casinos and Wall Street,
[2]https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090320125959/http://www..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Kelly himself ended up using 1/n for his own personal portfolio management.Gerd Gigerenzer has a lot to say about how harmful this model has been to finance and the world, because it creates &#34;false certainty&#34;.https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26325425 has further discussion."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Many here are correct that the Kelly criterion is relatively useless compared to standard portfolio management techniques for a basket of assets.However... I will say that it&#39;s incredible useful when deciding on more high risk bets based on binary outcomes which is not something portfolio managers would dream of doing for their clients. Consider a long dated call spread on the SPY that goes out to 12/2023.Say you think the SPY will be over $600. Today, for $140 of risk, you stand to make $1,860 if you&#39;re right if you buy a $570 call and sell a $590.This is exactly what Kelly was made for.The proper strategy, IMO, is to find a comfortable allocation for trades of this sort as a portion of an overall portfolio (Say 1-2%), then of that percentage use Kelly to allocate capital to different bets of this nature to lower the variance.So sure, Kelly isn&#39;t useful for portfolio management writ large, but for managing a portfolio of binary trades, it&#39;s a useful metric."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve thought about this since last year, and I can’t understand how this proposal has been able to survive this long. First of all, the EU is very pro-business, which means it should be pro-encryption. Second, the structures of its governing bodies does not make it very prone to populism. Based on what I know from this Kurzgesagt video: https://youtu.be/h4Uu5eyN6VUIs this all some hidden plot to turn the EU into a totalitarian state?
