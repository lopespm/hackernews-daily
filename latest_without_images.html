								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Goal-oriented work, creativity and motivation definitely have a difficult relationship.In programming, I learn the most things simply by experimenting at home on my own. I&#39;m thinking about switching jobs, so I wanted to learn some new frameworks and concepts to help with that, and I decided to make my personal projects a bit more &#34;professional&#34;. Use continuous integration, focus more on web stuff, build and automatically deploy containers and so on.Big mistake. I don&#39;t want to spend my leisure time fighting with tools, debugging build processes that break all the time, make sense of docker&#39;s tagging system and so on. I don&#39;t mind programming all day, because I love programming, but I do mind working all day.So I let it go. I&#39;ll come up with my own tools. They won&#39;t be great, but I&#39;ll have fun making them. And then it&#39;ll feel nice using them. And then I&#39;ll work on whatever excites me.Once in a while someone will ask me &#34;how do you know all these things?&#34; and my answer has always been &#34;I don&#39;t know that much, I just randomly got interested in this particular topic and decided to play around with it&#34;. Over the years/decades, that adds up!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you pay a man a salary for doing research, he and you will want to have something
to point to at the end of the year to show that the money has not been wasted.In
promising work of the highest class, however, results do not come in this regular
fashion, in fact years may pass without any tangible result being obtained, and the
position of the paid worker would be very embarrassing and he would naturally take to
work on a lower, or at any rate a different plane where he could be sure of getting
year by year tangible results which would justify his salary.The position is this:
You want one kind of research, but, if you pay a man to do it, it will drive him to
research of a different kind. The only thing to do is to pay him for doing something
else and give him enough leisure to do research for the love of it.-- Attributed to J. J. Thompson by Lord Rayleigh, c. 1940"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;The diagrams and the whole business that I got the Nobel Prize for came from that piddling around with the wobbling plate.&#34;This shows the extreme importance of blue sky thinking and allowing people to follow their whims sometimes rather than not starting something unless it fits into existing research goals and funding.  This breakthrough all lead from an observation that had no apparent use beyond fulfilling a whim and to have fun with it.I try to live my life by the ludic principle of &#39;playing&#39;. It&#39;s honestly been the lifeblood that&#39;s fueled me, kept me sane at work and allowed me to do OK in my career. All of my best ideas at work and in things like making music came from this spirit I&#39;m convinced."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"UML&#39;s promise was that that with detailed enough diagrams, writing code would be trivial or even could be automatically generated (there are UML tools that can generate code).  It was developed during a time when there was a push to make Software Engineering a licensed profession.  UML was going to be the &#34;blueprints&#34; of code, and software architects would develop UML diagrams similar to how building architects create blueprints for houses.  But as it turned out, that was a false premise.  The real blueprints for software ended up being the code itself.  And the legacy of UML lives on in simpler boxes and arrow diagrams."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The reason we stopped with UML and other front heavy planning methodologies is that what we planned was always wrong.Software projects always used to go massively over budget, were delivered late, and usually didn&#39;t meet the customers requirements anyway.It turns out that customers don&#39;t know what they want, or at least can&#39;t articulate it properly to business analysts.By delivering early and often, we&#39;re not only releasing value to our customers early and often but we&#39;re getting feedback, allowing us and the customers to go on a journey of understanding their needs.Also, it turns out that engineering teams know better how to develop a piece of software than architects.We solve the complexity problems by breaking a project down into (as he says) &#34;pizza team&#34; size components and focus on defining the interfaces between those components, rather than go into the weeds of how information flows within the code. This leads to other complexities, of course, but they don&#39;t lead to the same sort of delivery problems that large, monolithic designs have.All in all, a switch away from a design heavy approach has improved delivery, value to our customers, and enabled staff to be more productive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"UML really died because modern software development is less like designing an aircraft than it is a research program to design a new kind of aircraft. To the programmer, the plafroms they are going to build on are so vast and complicated, that their behaviour is not fully known to the programmer. So to design a specific application, the programmer has to performa series of experiments on the platform to determine the manner in which it will have to be used to support the objectives of the application. When those experiments are complete, the programmer can then spend some time in design, but for the most part programming-in-the small is akin to conducting research and then doing a little desing. For large systems, someone has to do design, but the best way of doing such design is through whitepapers, and large scale experiments and possibly simulations and analysis. UML isn&#39;t particularly useful, beyond establishing a common vocabulary for diagrams -- a task that can be done more simply and informally."</p>

					<h3><a href="https://blog.reverberate.org/2021/04/21/musttail-efficient-interpreters.html">Parsing Protobuf at 2+GB/S: How I Learned to Love Tail Calls in C</a></h3>

				<div class="story__comments">

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A very interesting trick! In my opinion, the big takeaway here is that if you are willing to write your C code in tail call style, you can get a lot of control over which variables are stored in machine registers. In the x86-64 ABI, the first 6 function parameters are guaranteed to be passed via registers.Obviously, this is architecture-specific. Other architectures may use a different calling convention that ruins this kind of manual register allocation. I&#39;d imagine that it would be bad for performance in 32-bit systems, where function arguments are passed via the stack.--------&gt; I think it’s likely that all of the major language interpreters written in C (Python, Ruby, PHP, Lua, etc.) could get significant performance benefits by adopting this technique.I know that at least Lua and Python use &#34;computed gotos&#34; in their inner loops, which also helps the compiler generate better code. The architecture-dependent nature of the tail-call trick could be a problem here. Some of these interpreters also need to work well on 32-bit systems."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s a related Zig proposal: https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/8220Relevant section pasted here:&gt; Other Possible Solution: Tail Calls&gt; Tail calls solve this problem. Each switch prong would return foo() (tail call) and foo() at the end of its business would inline call a function which would do the switch and then tail call the next prong.&gt; This is reasonable in the sense that it is doable right now; however there are some problems:   * As far as I understand, tail calls don&#39;t work on some architectures.

     * (what are these? does anybody know?)

   * I&#39;m also concerned about trying to debug when doing dispatch with tail calls.

   * It forces you to organize your logic into functions. That&#39;s another jump that
     maybe you did not want in your hot path.

See also https://dino-lang.github.io/learn/dino.pdf, section 3.1 &#34;Byte Code Dispatch&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Scheme has had tail calls as a basic idiom (some call it Proper Implementation of Tail Calls; others call it Tail Call Optimization) forever, and I keep them in mind any time I&#39;m implementing anything nontrivial in Scheme.There&#39;s no special syntax -- there&#39;s just the notion of tail positions, from which tail calls can occur. For example, both arms of an `if` form are tail position, if the `if` itself is.  And if you introduce a sequencing block in one of those arms, the last position in the block is tail position.  (A specialized IDE like DrRacket can indicate tail positions, and DrRacket will even hover arrows, tracing the tail positions back to the top of the code.)When implementing a state machine, for example, a state transition is simply a function application (call) to the new state (optionally with arguments), where the the called function represents a state.  It&#39;s satisfying when you realize how elegant something that used to be messy is, and you can imagine it being very fast (even if your Scheme implementation isn&#39;t quite up to getting as fast as a C or Rust compiler that can recognize and special-case tail calls.)(For the state machine example, compare to more conventional approaches in C ,of &#34;state ID&#34; variables, `switch` statements on those, and record-keeping for additional state.  Or doing it in data, with state ID being index into arrays, again with any additional recordkeeping.  Or lots of function calls when you didn&#39;t really need the time overhead and stack usage of function calls with full returns.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To me, it doesn&#39;t matter how powerful the iPad is if the software experience is subpar. Multitasking is cumbrous enough that it might as well not exist, multi-display setups can only mirror at a fixed aspect ratio, it lacks multiple user profiles requiring a family to be under a single user, and the few apps that take advantage of the keyboard/trackpad are nowhere similar to their desktop counterparts.Take Excel for example. Try right-clicking on a cell or dragging down a formula, and you&#39;ll see that it only picks it up a fraction of the time, and you have to click multiple times with gesture-like latencies in between to get it to work."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&lt;3 RustThe only thing I find difficult in Rust is lifetimes of e.g. &#34;String&#34;s in data structures, e.g. in Scala I have:    case class CustomerSale(name:String, item:String)

and because of GC I don&#39;t have to think about life times, copying etc. - data gets removed after a request or when nothing is used any longer.In Rust it is  struct CustomerSale{
    name: String,
    item: String,
  }

which rarely works that simple. I need to think of the life times of name and item, e.g. when I get them from a database, and I don&#39;t want to own it, or if I want to copy them or have &amp;str etc. And in web frameworks in Rust there is no notion of request life times which would make things much easier."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The amount of energy Microsoft is pouring into these front-end efforts is pretty incredible. A more recent development that has me very excited is Blazor Desktop:https://medium.com/young-coder/blazor-desktop-the-electron-f...&gt; This leads to the second difference — in a Blazor Desktop app hosted in WebWindow, there’s no built-in web server. Instead, it’s pure .NET all the way down. And while we haven’t seen exactly how this will be implemented, it offers the chance to simplify the hosting model quite a bit. If everything comes together just right, it will be like using Electron without needing to learn Node.I honestly believe this model is going to revolutionize front-end development. The productivity uplift of not having to fuck around with JSON APIs alone is worth the price of admission. We already use Blazor (server-side) for several of our webapps. I have been able to implement things in 4 hours that would easily have taken 4 weeks if I had to argue with other developers about the shape of a JSON blob on the wire. Need a projection involving 3 collections to produce a table? No problem. It&#39;s literally 3-5 lines of LINQ in your razor file. With a &#34;proper&#34; JSON API, you would probably have to fetch 3 different resources to the client or develop a special unicorn method for each unique projection."</p>

This is demonstrated by existence of companies which sell lacking components that should otherwise have been included with WPF: Telerik, Infragistics, Syncfusion etc. Heck, creating a Report with out-of-the-box WPF is an unforgettable nightmare.I, for one, would prefer that Microsoft, instead of pumping all these half-finished &#34;cool new toys&#34;, ships stable, performant, feature-complete software. We either have to buy 3rd party components, or write our own components from the ground up. Sure, they provide a Button or a Combobox, but good luck if you need anything slightly more complex, like a searchable GridView, autocomplete Combobox, Charts etc."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Whenever this comes up, I think of this quote from The Practice of Programming by Brian W. Kernighan and Rob Pike [0]:&gt; As personal choice, we tend not to use debuggers beyond getting a stack trace or the value of a variable or two. One reason is that it is easy to get lost in details of complicated data structures and control flow; we find stepping through a program less productive than thinking harder and adding output statements and self-checking code at critical places. Clicking over statements takes longer than scanning the output of judiciously-placed displays. It takes less time to decide where to put print statements than to single-step to the critical section of code, even assuming we know where that is. More important, debugging statements stay with the program; debugging sessions are transient.I found this lines up with my personal experience. I used to lean on interactive debuggers a lot, and still enjoy using them. They&#39;re fun and make for good exploring. But the act of figuring out where you want to print really makes you think in ways that interactive debugging cannot. I find the two forms really complement each other.[0] https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/index.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Personally, I think my biggest reason for using print debugging is.. it works.In C++ I often find the debugger doesn&#39;t find symbols on projects built with configure/Make. If I have a Java Gradle project I have no idea how to get it into a debugger. Python debuggers always seem fragile. Rust requires I install and use a &#34;rust-gdb&#34; script -- except on my current machine that doesn&#39;t work and I don&#39;t know why.I&#39;m sure in each case I&#39;m sure I could get a debugger working given enough time, but the only error I&#39;ve ever had in print debugging is failing to flush output before a crash, and it&#39;s never been hard to search for &#34;how to flush output&#34; in whatever language I&#39;m current using."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the point about seeing the state over time is a great one.But also I want to nitpick because the title is one of my “favorite” pet peeves: “The Unreasonable Effectiveness of ...” thing is now used (as in this article) by people who are trying to say that something is remarkably or surprisingly effective, but that’s not what the original essay was about at all!“The unreasonable effectiveness of the mathematics in the natural sciences” was a philosophy of science piece whose thesis was that there is no reasonable (rational, provable) basis for the degree to which our math abstractions and syllogisms happen to correspond to the physical universe.It is self evident that they do in fact correspond super well, but the original piece was about how weird and spooky that actually is, if you think about it at all. Math is super effective, and there is no reasonable basis that we yet know that it should be so effective. It’s unreasonably effective.It’s such a perfect title for that piece, and it feels dirty or diluting when it’s just used to mean “remarkably effective.”"</p>
