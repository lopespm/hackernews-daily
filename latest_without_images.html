								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Naturally, large range uncertainty increases the ambiguity of position, but the relative position of the satellites also matters. If they aren’t well spread, the exactness of calculated location also suffers.(see the excellent example in OP)Fun tidbit, the resulting error is known for the system in closed form as Geometric Dilution of Precision, and is a 3x3 (edit: or 4+x4+ if you are estimating bias or quantities like time, thx brandmeyer) matrix that depends on all the locations of the visible sats, and your position relative to them.GDOP is a general relationship for any estimator based only on the equations used to derive something from sensor remote sensor measurements. It&#39;s possible to derive GDOP for any sensing system using the Fisher Information Matrix (which is the inverse of GDOP). Some minor caveats apply, but in general this is a useful trick.FIM is worth learning if you want to get into sensing &amp; estimation. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher_informationAnother fun thing: FIM can be derived a number of ways, and appears if you simply ask (mathematically) &#34;What is the most likely position of the gps sensor given sat locations&#34; as the hessian matrix of the system that you use while answering that question using e.g., convex minimization.All of sensing &amp; estimation is just mostly convex optimization."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is very nice. Very clear, and the 3D interactives are excellent at guiding the explanation.One thing that I thought was a little confusing was right at the beginning, when we were estimating the position of the figurine and there was an area of uncertainty shown by the yellow circle.It isn&#39;t clear how you&#39;re estimating position, and why we have an area of uncertainty. At first I figured it was going to explain it using triangulation (measurement of angles) but there&#39;s no reason triangulation wouldn&#39;t be exactly as accurate as the tape measure method on a 2D surface, so wouldn&#39;t explain the area of uncertainty.The description merely says:&gt; Just by using these three reference points we can relate the figurine’s position in the environment to an approximate placement on the map as show with the yellow shape on the right.I worry that having this ambiguity so early on might put some people off from reading the rest, because they figure they don&#39;t understand that and so won&#39;t understand the rest of it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s so depressing that – at some point in the future – I&#39;m going to want a really clear and precise explanation of how GPS works and the likelihood that an internet search directs me to this excellent, clean, and ad-free blog is essentially nil."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s wild how Microsoft has been able to vertically integrate gaming.They now own the distribution (Xbox Cloud Gaming, Xbox Game Pass), the games (Call of Duty, WoW, Starcraft + what they owned before), the OS (Windows, Xbox), the hardware (Xbox, many PCs), and the back end compute (Azure). The only thing they&#39;re missing, the network bandwidth, is mostly a commodity anyway.That&#39;s a heck of a moat."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"With these kind of acquisitions, other companies are going to find it very hard to compete with Game Pass.I think we&#39;ll look back in 10 years and wonder why antitrust regulators did nothing, but it may be too late by then."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hate to see a monopoly in the gaming industry. Controlling the content will prevent any competition both in gaming consoles and in PC gaming. Forget about gaming on Linux or any new platform. Forget about sony&#39;s PlayStation and Nintendo. We are going to see the real face of Microsoft. What do you think Microsoft will do next? Buy unreal engine and unity and have control over the content and the tools to make them? We NEED open source game engines (Godot, Bevy) more than ever."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This shows that the articles by those who uncovered the plans were right [e.g. 1] - even though this is a political campaign paid for by the UK public (via the Government), and developed and coordinated by the Government, they have big logos of community groups and charities at the bottom and minimises the Government&#39;s involvement -&gt; &#34;According to the [M&amp;C Saatchi] presentation, the push will appear to be  the result of grassroots action and children’s charities, while downplaying any government role.&#34;The whole thing is just a pile of emotional manipulation, while compeletly ignoring the far, far greater number of legitimate uses of end to end encryption, and the actual dangers to everyday people of personal information being stolen, accessed, leaked, etc. if it&#39;s banned! Extremely dirty tactics.1. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29955893"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They&#39;re framing it as a choice between child safety and encryption. I think everyone on HN knows how utterly stupid that is, so I won&#39;t belabour the point.However, what offends me, and I don&#39;t see mentioned enough, is that the UK government is exploiting the real suffering of children to destroy something that protects us all, children and adults alike. They do not speak for those children or their families. They&#39;re exploiting them and their trauma for political gain.If I was in the U.K., this would be enough to forever turn me off the ruling Conservative party. It&#39;s disgusting. They have no morals. It&#39;s not just that they&#39;re lying -- every political side lies all the time, sometimes out of necessity. It&#39;s that they&#39;re re-victimizing the very kids they claim to be protecting. And they appear to be proud enough of that fact to promote it in this way.I will never vote for a politician or party that&#39;s OK with that, no matter what their other policies may be."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We should be a bit less naive about what this play really is. There is a talking point I&#39;ve observed in some of my more progressive circles that &#34;nerds aren&#39;t the good guys anymore,&#34; as managerialists see principled people who demand facts, evidence, logic, and reason as an obstacle to their maintaining control of &#34;The Narrative,&#34; which is whatever absurdity authorities and their toadies use to demonstrate their alignment.This campaign has nothing to do with protecting children - especially given the UK establishment&#39;s veritable tradition of both organizing and covering up industrial scale sexual abuse - and it is nothing more than hate speech designed to cast aspersions upon and isolate technologists as part of a broader political effort.The Rolling Stone article from earler this week said, &#34;The Home Office has hired the M&amp;C Saatchi advertising agency — a spin-off of Saatchi and Saatchi, which made the “Labour Isn’t Working” election posters, among the most famous in UK political history — to plan the campaign, using public funds.&#34;I would encourage HN readers to recognize this campaign is only nominally about encryption, and mainly it is about politically attacking the credibility and reputations of civilian technologists, and by conflating your expertise with abusers this M&amp;C Saatchi agency has produced literal hate propaganda against you. (just following orders, surely!) I&#39;d recommend people to not underestimate what this is."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This type of &#39;update&#39; is one reason I tend to stay away from so-called &#39;smart&#39; devices.If part of the product I&#39;ve paid for is software, and the company can update it without customer consent at any time, then I can&#39;t rely on the product&#39;s features. Period.I experienced this myself on the PS4 version of Terraria. I bought a hard-copy of the game. I mastered the controls, and loved them. Terraria was updated one day, and the controls were all changed, completely. Total rip-off. I liked the game I bought, but it was replaced without my consent.My feeling is that this behavior should be illegal for purchased products."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The method to get into &#34;God Mode&#34; is the same, except now it prompts you for a code.  Someone has figured out how to calculate it and actually created a website to generate codes for you.http://getresponsecode.comApparently the algorithm is very simple according to Reddit
https://old.reddit.com/r/nordictrack/comments/ozkp8v/privile...&gt;long responseCode = new Random((long) Integer.parseInt(iFitCode)).nextInt(999999);It&#39;s not a perfect workaround, as it resets on the next boot, but I&#39;ve seen that people are installing apps such as Taskbar which float overtop the iFit app and start on boot, allowing you to still launch your apps like Netflix etc even without God Mode enabled.It&#39;s only a matter of time before Nordic decides to block this method as well. We should also be looking into how to block updates to these devices."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Jeeze, I will stick with my modular solution: an ipad on a music stand. This is compatible not only with any commodity treadmill, but also bike trainers, ellipticals, and making vroomvroom noises on the motorcycle when it&#39;s too icy to actually ride. I could also swap out the ipad for a laptop, non-ipad tablet, or a collection of cute succulents should I desire it.snark aside, I&#39;m a bicycle guy and I really like that we have an ecosystem of bluetooth trainers and apps that all work pretty well with each other. Simulating hilly courses is actually really useful and has made me a better rider, so it&#39;s not like I&#39;m advocating being a total luddite. While I prefer to ride outdoors in the sun, my area in Iowa is extremely flat and the only difficulty comes from the wind, and I find the new toys are a lot more fun than a dumb trainer with a sufferfest DVD. I don&#39;t really know much about the treadmill scene but I hope you guys have access to similar stuff."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This would be more fun in a blog post. Twitter is a fucking horrible format for a complex analysis of special relativity.That aside, my favourite quirk from relativity is this:  &#34;The more you move in space, the less you move in time.&#34;

Like relativity in general, it sounds simple enough, but it&#39;s consequences are profoundly shocking. (That is, if you take the time to understand it, and don&#39;t leap to the conclusion that you know relativity better than Einstein or Penrose ;)Take the case of two people on Earth, one stationary and one travelling past in a car. They each have a different reference frame, and a different set events which make up their present. Now imagine that there is an alien government in Andromeda debating a possible invasion of Earth. In the reference frame of the person on Earth who is moving, the debate is still going on. But, in the reference frame of the stationary person, it is a day or so later in Andromeda, and the invasion fleet is already on it&#39;s way! In nature there is no absolute reference frame we can call base reality, and both observers reference frames are equally valid. Then the outcome of the invasion debate is a foregone conclusion. How can there be any room for free will in the deliberations of the alien government? This is the crux of the Andromeda Paradox and the Reitdijk-Putnam-Penrose argument.BTW:  &#34;Notice that neither observer can actually &#34;see&#34; what is happening in Andromeda, because light from Andromeda (and the hypothetical alien fleet) will take 2.5 million years to reach Earth. The argument is not about what can be &#34;seen&#34;; it is purely about what events different observers consider to occur in the present moment.&#34;

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rietdijk%E2%80%93Putnam_argume...More info
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_of_simultaneityEdit: If you know of any serious alternatives to the 4D spacetime/ block universe theory then I would love to read it. Rescuing free-will from the jaws of spacetime would be cool!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"In the topic of special relativity, I wholeheartedly recommend recently published &#34;Unusually Special Relativity| by Andrzej Dragan (https://www.amazon.com/Unusually-Special-Relativity-Andrzej-...). It starts from basic high-school mathematics but covers many paradoxes and puzzles. Some might challenge ordinary students, who know the formula but didn&#39;t stretch their minds on &#34;what if&#34; questions. It includes cases where velocity is higher than the speed of light - as there are a few caveats on &#34;nothing can travel faster than light&#34;.Also, this &#34;velocity addition for v&lt;&lt;c&#34; is covered in the first chapter.I read its draft almost 20 years ago (back then, it was a collection of notes in Polish) and didn&#39;t find anything remotely close to it in English. Later, I had the pleasure of attending his course.Also, Andrzej Dragan is a notorious individual, primarily known in photography (https://andrzejdragan.com/). To the point that there are posts on &#34;how to Draganize a picture&#34;."</p>
