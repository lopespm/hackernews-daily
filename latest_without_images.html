								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am an IP litigator, and I have dealt with patent trolls repeatedly. I have taken these kinds of cases pro bono in the past for small companies (including through the EFF attorney referral list, https://www.eff.org/pages/legal-assistance), and I know that others have as well.There are definitely low-cost and pro bono (free) options out there for very small businesses. The EFF attorney referral list is a good place to start.I&#39;m also happy to talk it through with you if you&#39;d like more specific information - my contact information is here: https://shawkeller.com/attorneys/andrew-e-russell/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been through similar situations.  The &#34;find a lawyer&#34; comments are less than helpful, since you probably don&#39;t know where to begin and most lawyers will happily take your money without necessarily having an expedient path to resolution for a small one-person company.  So here&#39;s what you do:Write to each of your competitors, explain the situation and ask for a referral to their lawyers.  You&#39;d be surprised how many are more than willing to make a referral against a troll Also search around for any other attorneys who have filed against this troll and contact them as well.  They should all be willing to do an initial call for free.You are trying to find an attorney who has a successful blueprint for dealing with this particular troll, ideally this particular claim.  If the attorney is able to leverage their prior work or knowledge, your costs are greatly reduced.  Also, if the troll has unsuccessful experience with a particular attorney they may just give up.  Good luck!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You have to talk to a lawyer.  No one other than a IP attorney experienced in dealing with patent trolls will be able to give you accurate advice on this.Also you should add &#34;[ask HN]&#34; to the beginning of your post.edit: A good way to find a lawyer is to talk to good lawyers you have worked with in the past.  They will not be able to help you themself if they practice in a different area, but will likely have referrals for someone who does."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Damn, this is such a GREAT idea.
I&#39;ve messed up repos a few times, and it&#39;s never good.
It&#39;s always -- &#34;what&#39;s the magic want I have to wave now&#34;?The truth is, while we use git every day, most people really don&#39;t understand how it works.There I said it. And I&#39;m not ashamed.I don&#39;t really know how Git works. And I think I&#39;m not the only one.What does &#34;git reflog&#34; or &#34;git reset --hard ....&#34; do? What are the implications?We don&#39;t really know.I feel stupid. But hey, at least I&#39;m honest."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m sorry, but how many bits of git&#39;s UI do we have to force users to manually replace before we realize that the entire problem is git&#39;s UI?Between the tone deaf responses here about &#34;using a GUI client is the problem,&#34; to the tone deaf responses of &#34;you just have to learn it&#39;s internal architecture,&#34; it should be obvious what the problem is. The problem is not just being able to undo a mistake (though that&#39;s certainly one of the problems). Git is an incredibly user-hostile experience, and someone needs to fix or replace it. Can we just say it out loud and stop pretending that the problem is the literally thousands of users who have problems using it?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"When the stock goes from 200 to 3500 in 10 years, and consistently goes up and to the right, you won’t find too many of the workers complaining no matter how bad the job conditions are. I have a friend up in Seattle who is suffering, to the point of being hospitalized for mental health issues, but refuses to leave.So HR and leadership believe that their system “works” but it’s really that their employees are willing to put up with straight up torture. They are deluded into thinking that their metrics and PIP plan work well because their best employees are staying but it’s really just the stock price.If the stock price starts to drop for whatever reason. All the best employees will leave in droves. That’s what I saw at Uber post IPO."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had joined Amazon as my first job out of school. I was super excited and would not mind working the long hours as the project was interesting. I enjoyed working with my team and manager. Just near the end of the year, my manager quit. The new manager ran my performance review and assessed that my performance didn’t meet expectations. I was not put on PIP. Instead, there would be a development plan that I had to complete. I was shocked and tried hard to not cry during my review. I had never been told earlier that there were any issues with my performance.This review crushed me. It destroyed my confidence in my programming abilities. To be fair, I had made some mistakes during my first year at Amazon - had fewer commits and SLOC compared to my teammates. Being on a work visa meant I could not quit immediately. I had to endure working there for almost a year before I got a new job.I took me quite some time to gain back my confidence. To this day, my time at Amazon makes me dread performance reviews."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"An open source network, either regional or wide area, would be a very big deal for many areas. Being 4G compatible is nice, but even if it uses a different band (e.g., less stringently controlled WiFi bands) a mesh network would enable a lot of projects.On the technical side, current SDRs are cheap and very capable. Unfortunately, for this to take off one needs a large network effect and should the technology take off it is easy for various three letter agencies to compromise, for example by inserting their own nodes. And as some uses are likely to be sketchy &#34;because terrorism/pornography&#34; is all the justification they will need."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a current Amazon employee I can confirm this is no longer the case or only applies to such a select few pieces of software that it doesn&#39;t actually mean what you think it does. The amount of day to day stuff that is relied upon that runs on greasemonkey scripts and web scraping is insane. API&#39;s for a ton of things don&#39;t exist or are have heavy gatekeeping. (eg. contact x to get onboarded to our API and they just ghost you). Of course you can get a high level leader to tell you to use a proper API in a mailing list email thread where you are trying to get help to solve a problem but they will not actually help you get working API access, all talk no action. A perfect example is there is this basic CRUD app that I rely upon and I see the current maintainer is working on all these feature requests, the problem for me is that the site has a ton of AJAX and takes like 20 mouse clicks to get retrieve basic information. So I  open a ticket / feature request just to get a basic REST API for the reads and they politely tell me I am an idiot and close the request. So much pointless work is created at Amazon from lack of API access."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"How far does this principle scale? I&#39;ve heard of this strategy and thought &#34;that&#39;s kinda cool.&#34; Amazon is obviously successful in its domain, so it would be easy to assume some causality.And yet, there&#39;s another big tech company, fruit symbol I think, that has played the long game of continually fine tuning the interaction points to make the integration of their parts more than the whole. They get credit for attention to detail, leveraging their integration and their ability to move in ways they do because of their thorough integration across their whole hardware/software stack. They&#39;ve recently been in the press because of just how much they were able to tune their integration to the problem with their first desktop computing chip. Again, we credit their success with some causality due to this strategy, which (to me) is very different than the Amazon strategy.Is it because Amazon is a cloud company and Apple is a hardware company that they have these different approaches to product development and each enjoy success? Or at the end of the day, are these &#34;do it this way&#34; less responsible than we&#39;d like to believe?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked at a company that read the Amazon memo virtually straight after it was published and decided to copy it. The CIO at the time predicated every system&#39;s teams&#39; bonus on it.No API, no bonus.What followed was 18mths of people building enterprise messaging systems and &#34;buses&#34; of various types. Hundreds of pages of documentation on APIs was prepared and released.I think 2 API&#39;s with maybe 40 methods actually went live.There were no bonusesMany people leftThe people who stayed were unhappyIt never happened, everyone quietly forgot about it after 18 mnths.The CIO stayed for another 3 or 4 years - he only left when a new CEO came in due to internal promotion. The new CEO used to run one of the P&amp;L&#39;s/business units and hated the CIO with a passion.So... it&#39;s not the API mandate that made the difference at Amazon."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think the biggest problem with Twitter is that we can’t determine a denominator. Twitter knows, but we don’t know.100 people tweeting about how this guy is bad might be indicative of a general consensus or might just be 100 people out of a billion Twitter users. People then interpret it as general consensus and pile on.We know the numerator but since we don’t know the denominator of people who didn’t comment, or disagree, or never saw, or don’t care. So we can’t figure out a ratio and many people assume the denominator is the numerator and the ratio is 1.“The world won’t do business with this guy, I better fire him” doesn’t make sense if it’s just a very small ratio as who cares if 100 people are upset and 1,000,000 customers don’t care.I wish Twitter had some ratio of who viewed vs who acted. Or had downvotes or something. Currently, people assuming that a few commenters is everyone is doing bad things.This coupled with there’s always someone or a small group who holds an opinion so putting too much weight into a few commenters is not smart. Yet frequently done."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve fortunately never been cancelled (I don&#39;t think I even have enough of a footprint or visibility for that to happen).From everything I&#39;ve observed, the absolute worst thing you can do is apologize to the people attempting to cancel you. It&#39;s just pouring gasoline on the fire.These people will never say &#34;oh, you learned from your mistakes, I guess I&#39;ll back off&#34;. Most of them don&#39;t really care about the truth, they care about signaling. So an apology only vindicates them.As far as I can tell, the thing to always keep in mind is if you wait a few days these things always pass pretty quickly. The internet has a very short attention span. As long as you never give those people a confirmation that you did something you regret, you&#39;re much better off in the future.Of course you should privately apologize and make amends for things you&#39;ve done wrong; but those things are always more effective privately and personally done anyway."</p>

Or in a workplace context. There were apparently no criminal charges. No EEOC complaints filed.[1] No abusive workplace charges.[2]So he acted like a jerk in social situations. It&#39;s grounds for being, say, thrown out of a nightclub.
