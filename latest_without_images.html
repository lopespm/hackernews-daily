								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From the source:
&#34;The high rate of magnesium deficiency now postulated [5,6,7,8] can be attributed in part to a steady decline in general magnesium content in cultivated fruits and vegetables, a reflection of the observed depletion of magnesium in soil over the past 100 years [11,12,13]. A report to Congress was already sounding the alarm as far back as the 1930s, pointing out the paucity of magnesium, and other minerals, in certain produce [14].&#34;The easiest of those references to link to is https://journals.ashs.org/hortsci/view/journals/hortsci/44/1... :&#34;Three kinds of evidence point toward declines of some nutrients in fruits and vegetables available in the United States and the United Kingdom: 1) early studies of fertilization found inverse relationships between crop yield and mineral concentrations—the widely cited “dilution effect”; 2) three recent studies of historical food composition data found apparent median declines of 5% to 40% or more in some minerals in groups of vegetables and perhaps fruits; one study also evaluated vitamins and protein with similar results; and 3) recent side-by-side plantings of low- and high-yield cultivars of broccoli and grains found consistently negative correlations between yield and concentrations of minerals and protein, a newly recognized genetic dilution effect. &#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I understand this seems mostly to be about soil depletion. I&#39;m curious more generally if vegetables are also less nutritious because they are selectively bread for high water content and size. For example, its appeared to me for years that you vegetables you get on a Subway sandwich must have almost no nutritional content. They are all way paler than you&#39;d normally see, and super watery.Thinking about it, I suppose the vegetables may get that way from growing in poor soil, and Subway et al just buy those ones because they&#39;re cheaper"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This post for info purposes only having worked with the Amazon app store team and does not reflect my opinions at all, I haven&#39;t spent time thinking about if it&#39;s good or bad:The resigning stuff is because they alter the apps to fix dependence on Google play apis and gsuite apis. Developers were not interested in rebuilding their apps for fire and other devices without those apis baked in and this was a good solution to ease uptake for fire/Amazon app store.Also note that ms will control this android os, so they already control the signature verification method. They could do this without you knowing very easily by just with something like carrying a second sig and hash of what they modified and the original partial sums from the original app. Google and amazon or any os supplier can.Signature verification is only as strong as the verifier code.Glad to burn karma to put data out there."</p>

On the other hand, even if they allow for the app developer to keep its signature, Microsoft is still probably very capable of gathering data and telemetry through their Android implementation.Either way, and until it becomes illegal to collect data without explicit consent, I’m pretty sure we’re screwed…"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As an American Jew who grew up with a distorted and racist world view in regard to Palestine this just feels like history repeating itself. The troubles that face Israelis have always been amplified over those of Palestinians in my experience. That control of the narrative led me to be actively racist for most of my life while thinking I was not and also morally superior. This kind of censorship has a body count, and it lets war crimes happen in clear view while the on lookers think they are doing the right thing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A few years ago, criticism of Israel&#39;s policies started being called anti-antisemitism.[1] That made it OK to censor criticism of Israel.
Israel&#39;s policies got more divisive under 12 years of Netanyahu, and there&#39;s more reason to be critical of them.  Those two trends are in collision.[1] https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/criticism-of-israel-is-anti-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have some Arab friends who are very active on social media. It doesn&#39;t surprise me that the sheer volume of their political posts triggers all kinds of anti-spam mechanisms.I have also occasionally tried researching the background of the claims made in some of the posts. Most were highly misleading or completely made up. So Facebook&#39;s campaign against misinformation might have something to do with the described removals. That being said, I still see tons of posts every day and don&#39;t have the impression that the platforms are hiding many of them. Even open calls for violence usually stay up.The issue of alleged censorship aside, I am not convinced that this type of social media activism is beneficial for society. It would be great to have an open discussion on the many issues in the Middle East, but this doesn&#39;t really happen there. Most posts are straight up propaganda and and it appears to be taboo among Arabs on social media to even consider the Israeli point of view. Like the author of TFA, they even reject the term &#34;conflict&#34; because it might be thought to imply that both Israelis and Palestinians can have legitimate interests."</p>

				</div>
				<div class="story__comments">
					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27632835">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The Aha moment for me came when I was watching Chef Jean-Pierre&#39;s video on the topic. His terminology is unfortunate, he uses &#39;caramelizing&#39; to refer to what we call &#39;browning&#39;, but otherwise he&#39;s taught me more about cooking than any other YouTube chef.There are two steps to caramelizing onions. Cooking, and browning. Cooking, that is, making them soft enough to eat, is what takes the most time. Most of the time when you use onions in a dish, they&#39;re browned first, then they finish cooking with the rest of the dish.But when you make caramelized onions by themselves, if you don&#39;t spend the time to cook them properly, they won&#39;t have the right texture, even if the flavor is close. Since texture carries flavor, browned onions just don&#39;t taste the same as caramelized ones.So Jean-Pierre separates the process of making caramelized onions into two steps. Cook the onions by leaving them tightly covered in a pot on very low heat, they poach in their own liquid. Leave them at least 45 minutes but since the heat is so low it&#39;s almost like sous vide where you can cook them as long as you need.Finally, you brown them in a skillet to desired color.Video for the interested: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o-u7zjlShQ"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"After reading a lot of recipes and watching pictures/videos from same authors I learned that the description of browning is very subjective to the author.Very few recipes actually required onions browned through (as in entire volume) and if they actually do, the author will for sure mention it. Onions that are completely browned have very overpowering sweet aroma that is undesirable in most recipes except the ones that are built around it (like, famously, french onion soup or various caramelized onion dips).Vast majority of recipes actually require the onion to just get little hints of being gold in places or some gold just on the surface of it. That is enough to add flavor that will distribute once you add some liquid to it.From my experience most cooking book authors seem to be testing their recipes. Many times I have been frustrated by being unable to get the desired effect only to find some missing technique that the author very likely did not think important enough to mention or maybe difference in ingredients or measuring methodology.I have learned to prefer books that describe the methodology used by the author (for example how they measure things, how they make broth if they use one in recipe, etc.)I have also learned to search the book for a recipe that I already know and figure out if it agrees with my experience and if I would be able to make the recipe from that description.Another important point is that usually you need to understand particular cuisine from which the recipe comes to be able to make it faithfully. Every cuisine is a little small system of thinking about how to choose, process and combine ingredients. Recipes tend to be silent on a lot of stuff that is completely trivial to natives of particular cuisine.For example, I have been practicing Italian, Indian and Thai cuisines for the past 20 years. I can make Italian, Indian or Thai dish on a pinch from whatever I can find in my fridge and pantry but I still can&#39;t make convincing Creole dish even if I tried.(edit)If you are asking for best books for beginners, I suggest to skip books and rather research the recipe on Youtube. Watch couple of people doing the same thing -- this is going to provide much more valuable information than you could ever read in a book. This mostly because having visual reference of how it actually looked when the person was cooking it will give you immediate feedback when you are getting something wrong.It is still my preferred way of learning new kinds of dishes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author points out that you can caramelize your onions properly over the course of 40 minutes while preparing other components, washing dishes, etc.But that doesn&#39;t make for a nice tight recipe the way &#34;Stir onions over medium heat until caramelized, about 10 minutes&#34; does. Some people are going to read &#34;Meanwhile, caramelize onions over medium-low, about 40 minutes&#34; and think &#34;Oh boy, what a complex and loooong recipe, forget it!&#34; Inexperienced cooks may not be comfortable leaving the onions unattended, and if you get caught up in the football game you could end up burning them and wasting half an hour&#39;s work.So if you lie and say ten minutes, people are going to do one of two things:* Cook the onions for ten minutes and use them however they turn out. The recipe might be kind of disappointing, but I bet if you did the rest right, it&#39;ll taste pretty decent in most cases. Lots of people are bad cooks, too, so properly caramelized onions may be the least of their worries anyway.* Keep cooking until the onions are done properly. I end up doing this sort of thing all the time anyway, when a recipe says things like &#34;cook chicken breasts to 165 degrees, about 3 minutes on a side&#34; and other nonsense (you&#39;d think boxed macaroni and cheese would at least get it right but even at sea level it comes out inedibly hard if you boil for the lower end of the recommended time). The recipe comes out right and if you know to do this, you&#39;re probably already used to the fact that recipes lie so you&#39;re not much bothered.In short: the incentives probably weigh more toward making the recipe look quick and easy. When your readers are skimming over half a dozen recipes online, you don&#39;t want to be the long and complicated-looking one."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The Cuban vaccine is neither a vector vaccine nor does it work with mRNA technology.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I strongly dislike Haskell&#39;s focus on theory. Just show me examples on how to get things done and then the concepts will become clear. The Haskell and mathematics communities too often act like ivory towers that humans have to become enlightened to understand, and that simply is not how my brain is wired. I&#39;m not sure of there have been any studies on the usability score of languages, but I think that Haskell would come out very, very poorly. There&#39;s a reason why python is so popular."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"After years of seeing people try to understand abstractions like a functor from the definition first, I’ve started to think it’s the wrong way to do it.This post helps on some of these points, like explaining that e.g. functors are not always containers.I’d love to see someone try taking it further: just hashing out lots and lots of substantially different examples, showing how they are similar to each other, and progressing into higher level transformations, before finally showing the definition of a functor, and how it maps to each of those cases. Forget monads. Can we just start with functors and see how far we get with that?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"5 years ago I hit a burnout point and took a year off work. It was a huge perspective shift. I realized that my day-to-day of a rushed commute to work, a stressful and distracting office, thimble-deep coworker relationships and a life completely orientated around doing the above was an insane waste of my short time on Planet Earth. I reoriented my life around family, remote work, flexibility and balance. My quality of life has hugely improved and there is no turning back the clock.When I saw what the pandemic was doing to nearly every professional office worker, I figured it was just a matter of time before the resignations started flooding in. Everyone had a whole year &#34;pause&#34; to reevaluate if their lives were organized around their goals, and for millions, the answer was no. There&#39;s no putting this genie back in the bottle."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The first guy in the article is a dev. There&#39;s never been a better time to find work as a dev. Jobs are handing out more money with more flexibility than ever seen before. On top of it all, if your firm wants people back in the office soon, now is the time to do loads of remote interviews so that you can keep being remote.I was interviewing recently and almost everyone is at least partly remote, with a huge number of 100% remote. Even people that I know don&#39;t like the idea are bending and giving two or three days remote.On the restaurant-type work, I&#39;d say a bunch of people have been given a breather from the treadmill, and they&#39;re using it to look around. I see this as mostly positive, but it does suggest that a lot of people are completely swamped, working all the time, spending everything. The little bit of credit they got from the pandemic payment has unlocked a great reckoning with the labor market. Previously if you didn&#39;t like your job, you were screwed. Somehow find time to interview/upskill, or somehow jump the gap with your savings."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m one of these. I&#39;m an allrounder software dev in his late fourties, &#34;lured&#34; into a non-software middle management position by the promise of money and stability a few years ago.In practice, the money has never materialized because our sector took a big hit and much of that promise was tied to incentives based on the company&#39;s success. I can&#39;t really blame anyone for this, but that&#39;s strike one as far as job satisfaction goes.Second strike, I love writing code, and I don&#39;t get to do that a lot anymore. I&#39;m listing these &#34;pre-existing conditions&#34; because I believe it&#39;s common for us quitters to have other areas of dissatisfaction that hadn&#39;t been enough to drive us over the edge by themselves.Third strike, while my company does not support WFH after Covid, I did get to experience at least a partial WFH program, and it was absolutely wonderful. There&#39;s a problem though: I would absolutely like to continue working from home, but I also want to work on my own projects, on my own terms, on my own schedule. A traditional full time job is not compatible with that.So I put in my notice for the end of this year, to allow current company projects to come to a conclusion and/or hand them off. I want to stress that for a man in my age group, with no significant savings or other safety net, this is extremely scary. It&#39;s just that this Angst is outweighed by the thought of staying on the treadmill hoping for an eventual reward that may never come and seeing the little time I have left drain away."</p>
