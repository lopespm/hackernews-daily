								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A lot of comments seem focused on the incentives to apple and what&#39;s motivating the change. All fair questions. To me, though, it feels like just a radically different approach this year.2016 macbook felt like leadership got in a room and said &#34;okay, let&#39;s make a list of all the sexy things we can think of that would make the macbook unique&#34;. This netted things like thin-beyond-practicality, touchbar, removing all the ports, etc.2021 macbook feels like leadership got in a room and said &#34;okay, let&#39;s make a list of all the top things everybody is complaining about most.&#34; And they just fixed everything (well, most things) on that list one-by-one."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"AFAIK, replacing the battery on the previous generation meant replacing the top part of the body, to which the battery was glued. That included replacing the keyboard and the touchpad (not 100% sure if the old keyboard and touchpad could have been kept; maybe they were replaced just because of the damage done to them by the expanding batteries). At the same time, the previous generation had battery problems and keyboard problems (as pointed out in sub-comments), which meant many were replaced for free even out of warranty (as it happened to me due to faulty battery).I suspect someone at Apple realized how much would have been saved if only the battery was not glued to the case.Edit: mentioned the keyboard problem, which would result in replacing the battery too it seems."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’ve never understood the value proposition for Copilot.In terms of difficulty, writing code is maybe on average a two out of ten.On average, maintaining code you wrote recently is probably a three out of ten in terms of difficulty, and maintaining code somebody else wrote or code from a long time ago probably rises to around a five out of ten.Debugging misbehaving code is probably a seven out of ten or higher.GitHub Copilot is optimising the part of the process that was already the easiest, and makes the other parts harder because it moves you from the “I wrote this” path to the “somebody else wrote this” path.Even during the initial write, it changes the writing process from programming (which is easy) to understanding somebody else’s code to ensure that it’s right before accepting the suggestion (which is much less easy).  I just don’t understand how this is a net time/energy savings?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Copilot is crazy. The other day, I was writing a Python function that would call a Wikipedia API. I pulled from the internet an example of a GET request, and pasted it as a comment in my code.  # sample call: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&amp;format=json&amp;list=geosearch&amp;gscoord=37.7891838%7C-122.4033522&amp;gsradius=10000&amp;gslimit=100

Then I defined a variable,  base_url = &#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?&#34;

Then, like magic, Copilot suggested all the remaining keys that would go in the query params. It even knew which params were to be kept as-is, and which ones would come from my previous code:  action = &#34;query&#34;  # action=query
  format = &#34;json&#34;  # or xml
  lat = str(latitude.value)  # 37.7891838
  lon = str(longitude.value)  # -122.4033522
  gscoord = lat + &#34;%7C&#34; + lon
  ...
  api_path = base_url + &#34;action=&#34; + action + &#34;&amp;format=&#34; + format + ... + &#34;&amp;gscoord=&#34; + gscoord

As a guy who gets easily distracted while programming, Copilot saves me a lot of time and keeps me engaged with my work. I can only imagine what it&#39;ll look like 10 years from now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve been using this for weeks and it blooooows my mind. It comes up with crazy recommendations, just yesterday I wrote this big ass logic to do something, then I wanted to move that code to a function so I wrote the function name and I kid you not copilot suggested a one-liner that worked…  the thing is so useful and I’m not writing simple code (writing cryptographic code). And when it’s not doing that at the very least it provides auto-completion to lists where a counter has to increase and things like that. It’s just baffling, I don’t think I’m that directly impacted by AI, or at least this is the first time where I’m like “wow, AI really is changing the world RIGHT NOW”. Half-joking: can’t wait for it to just write my code.Also if this feature would be paid tomorrow, I think I would pay for it. It’s really noticeable when I don’t have copilot enabled now.Oh and, autocompletion doesn’t work with markdown files because of markdown plugins I think? But this is another level of insanity: when I’m writing english it figures a lot of the sentences I want to write. Makes me question if I’m just a deterministic individual with no choice."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Ok, I can see the lopsided lawyers marrying lawyers, but how is it that software developers are so lopsidedly marrying other software developers when something like 90% of them are male?I guess pretty much every female software developer marries a male software developer which works out to the 12% number?Makes me sorta want to see a breakdown by sex. aka &#34;male software developer has a 6% chance of marrying a software developer vs female software developer which has a 95% chance of marrying another software developer.&#34;OTOH, its not as pronounced with nurses which have a similar problem in reverse."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Many anecdotal guesses are validated by this data. Doctors and agricultural workers are the obvious standouts, but I see a few more too.Us programmers stick together. Quite a high rate of marrying within the community. Lawyers show a similarly high number.A criticism of the study, is that it does not normalize by how many of these professions are in the general population. So, it appears as though software analysts don&#39;t like intermarrying. However, the truth is that there simply aren&#39;t enough of them around, they are simply more likely to run into software engineers, so that&#39;s whom they marry most.IE. This study captures P(running into a profession) x P(preference for that profession). I would love to them model P(running into a profession), so that we could get the much juicer preferences of each group for various professions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In case anyone is wondering about the size of the effect, https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/wildlife-... has the numbers. Before the war, 2-4% of female elephants were tuskless. Now 32% of newly born ones are.So it&#39;s a significant change, but it&#39;s not like this property was coming out of nowhere. It started off about as common as humans having green eyes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is this actually evolution or just selective breeding?By killing elephants with tusks the poachers are favoring elephants with the no-tusk gene.This isn&#39;t a lot different than killing a dog that bites sheep, which is how we bred herding dogs.  Or a wolf that eats your baby, which is how we domesticated dogs.This trait already existed so it certainly wasn&#39;t &#34;engineered due to mass poaching for ivory&#34; as claimed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I like the idea. Some thoughts:- Center the code samples on the page. So that your not unintentionally one over the other due to differences in viewing angle and vision ability.- Make all the fonts equal in height regardless of font point. Knee jerk reaction will be to go with the font that is closest to a persons normal preference.- Hide Font names and size/points.- Light theme and other color options.- Other programming language options.- jiI1l0O test. I like to see those characters that can often be too similar in shape shown together.- Controversial, throw in some non mono-spaced fonts."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m not the original author, however, ages ago I invented what&#39;s now being called &#34;acoustic camera&#34;.  (Specifically, the SOTA on the math side for precision, accuracy.)The resolution is fine enough that with COTS parts, I can record my signature simply by sketching it out with my fingernail on a table.Every few years I dust this off and play with it, wondering if there&#39;s some application or other way to &#34;turn this into money&#34; (an increasing concern in the coming months...&lt;tiny&gt;PLZ HIRE ME&lt;/&gt;), but I&#39;m not a &#34;product guy&#34;.I&#39;ll answer some questions about the technology, but would really love to know if anyone here has advice on somehow using this achievement to pay rent.  :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"One application for those that I think might be interesting is to record a scene and retain all of the raw audio. On playback, allow people to click on parts of the image and use beamforming to focus on that part of the audio.Does anyone know if the array used here supports timestamped samples and/or clock sync to support multiple arrays?  Or is it a single 16-channel stream?Having done some very primitive dabbling with this stuff, the DSP programming is always the most interesting part to me.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting. Usually my critique for products like this is something along the lines of &#34;great, but how are you going to access your data from the internet?&#34; Typically the answer to that is you need some sort of tunneling service like ngrok to get around port forwarding, CGNAT, firewalls, etc. I maintain a list of solutions here[0]. The problem with most of these services is that they&#39;re targeted at developers and aren&#39;t something the average user should have to mess with.In this case, the PiBox is being offered by KubeSail[1], a company which specializes in services like tunneling (they&#39;re already on the list mentioned above). It will be very interesting to see if they can bundle it in such a way that people don&#39;t have to worry about how the tunneling works. Extra points if they make it easy for users to buy/use their own domains.[0]: https://github.com/anderspitman/awesome-tunneling[1]: https://kubesail.com/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m looking for something like this, but cheaper and for 3.5&#34; drives. USD$250, plus shipping to Australia puts that just too high for what it offers.I own Synology NASs, but adding an expander for that is expensive. (AUD$800)The ODroid-HC4 looks promising, but their &#39;toaster&#39; case design for it is awful, leaving the drives exposed and unable to put two atop each other.Ideally what I&#39;d like is:- 1-2x 3.5&#34; SATA drives- Gbit NIC- Enough grunt to run some kind of clustered filesystem (gluster, ceph, whatever)The idea being that I could start a cluster with say 3x of these devices, and then as my storage needs grow - add more.They don&#39;t need to have stellar IO, but enough to keep up with plex."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recently did something like this myself with an RPi 4 and an external drive over USB to replace Google Photos (with PhotoPrism). For tunneling (and custom domain) I used cloudflared which works surprisingly well: https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared. I wrote about it here: https://domh.dev/blog/replacing-google-photos-with-photopris...That being said, I love that someone is working on making this stuff easier to do, it was finicky to get it setup myself. I would be backing it if I hadn&#39;t just done it already.I wish Kubesail all the best and I hope they succeed."</p>
