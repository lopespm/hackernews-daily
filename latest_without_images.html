								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I highly recommend checking out his YouTube channel [0]. He&#39;s an _incredibly_ thoughtful person and provides good lessons in staying focused and keeping scope down.I consider him a mentor and his approach to software is something I really resonate with. He has a keen focus on software quality but understands he can&#39;t make everything perfect in one sitting. This approach helped me get away from decision paralysis in my projects and at work.This isn&#39;t even mentioning how much I&#39;ve learned about software in general from his videos. Whether it&#39;s debugging kernel bootstrap assembly, porting doom, writing a live feedback GUI editor, implementing syscalls, to messing around with the dynamic loader. He&#39;s really got a video for it all.And he tackles each video with such clarity and careful consideration. I really can&#39;t speak higher of the man.[0] https://www.youtube.com/c/AndreasKling/videos"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hey Andreas (assuming you&#39;re still reading these threads) I&#39;m so happy to see you reach this point with Serenity. I remember seeing your project pop up here (early 2019 I think?) and just being absolutely blown away by the undertaking. What I love most about the project after following it since though is you&#39;ve really shown it&#39;s absolutely doable, not only by you or superstar programmers but by folks willing to put the time in, and along the way made so many others realize this whether they contribute to Serenity or not. Your YouTube videos are absolutely great and there is just something about it all (probably the &#34;under one roof&#34; philosophy) that makes showing the &#34;adding/fixing this little piece&#34; so much more consumable. In short, thank you for doing all of this for not only yourself but everyone else now involved with the project.Anyways I always told myself I should chip in for all of the great content over the years and so now I&#39;ve joined your Patreon - here&#39;s to hoping more are able to as well and you can continue living the dream!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"THIS IS SOOOOO INSPIRING.With all the FAANG and the Leetcodes and promotions and L6 - L7 TC and all of this nonsense, true hacker spirit and the fun of just building cool stuff with technology has gone from the hacker space. In fact, the hacker space is actually shrinking.Projects like these and people like Andreas Kling, are a beacon of hope and light during these troubled times.May more people be inspired with this and commit to the path of a true hacker."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Directly via bailouts and indirectly via inflation, COVID was the biggest wealth transfer to the rich in history."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Covid has got me thinking about the government’s role in social welfare.Providing social welfare through money allows for people to misallocate the money or skim off the top of the money. For the vast majority of people their covid stimulation money did not go into their pockets, it went to their landlord or their mortgage holder resulting in a massive wealth transfer from public funds to banks and those who own land.I think the government should directly supply the basic needs of its citizens instead of using money as an intermediary for supplying social welfare. Money is only a means to an end for obtaining the basic necessities to live: you cannot eat a dollar bill for nutrition or sleep under a dollar bill for shelter. Government provided housing and food should be available to any citizen — no questions asked. At that point you can get rid of all welfare programs since the government is directly supplying the basic necessities for those in need.People would still be incentivized to work in order to obtain luxuries which are not supplied by the government: a private house, travelling, a car, etc.Stories like this further affirm that handing out money is not a good way for the government to provide welfare."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The title is almost underwhelming in severity (which is a refreshing break from sensationalistic headlines),“[€28m in bonuses] even after taking three billion euros in loans last year, and 100 million euros in State aid including 65 million from the Netherlands. The company also let go of thousands of people during the coronavirus pandemic.”Booking.com isn&#39;t alone engaging in these practices. Many corporations seem to defend these payouts, by suggesting that these executives have gracefully managed the organisation during the pandemic distress. Such statements aren&#39;t very reassuring, because they feel more like sound bites of opinion, rather than arguments that can be debated and examined.How many jobs could they have saved with 28 million euros?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; The internet transport ecosystem has been ossified for decades now, and QUIC breaks out of this ossificationBut it&#39;s still just a layer on top of UDP, and still implemented at the application, like in the past. So how is the ossification broken?Every app has to implement it itself rather than calling a syscall and letting the OS deal with its complexities (same as for TLS, making fewer apps implement it without a lot of extra work). Which also increases context switching. In the future more protocols will be built on top of QUIC, expanding the user-space stack, increasing fragmentation of application-space IP stacks. And are network cards now going to start implementing it?It&#39;s painful to watch us stride headlong into the future depending on band-aids because surgery is too complicated."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Have previous protocols (TCP, UDP, etc) been in widespread use before their respective RFCs?The QUIC Wikipedia page[0] makes it sound like a substantial amount of traffic, due largely to Facebook, Google, and the Google Chrome browser, uses QUIC already.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Apple&#39;s chat.db has an esoteric schema owing to the fact they never designed it from the ground up and instead kept adding new columns and tables with each macOS release. This makes their queries super complicated with multiple joins.Once you have the schema figured out, it&#39;s dead easy to build a third-party client that works better than the official one. Even search works great with a simple LIKE query but Apple re-indexes all messages leading to your CPU going over 1000%: https://twitter.com/KrauseFx/status/1396433852126670852Source: I built a third-party desktop client for iMessage at https://texts.com and reverse engineered the complete sqlite structure."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Author here: the gist is that it&#39;s practically impossible to scroll to the beginning of an iMessage chat, and that&#39;s the only way to get to the beginning of a conversation. These old conversations take up several gigabytes of space, yet there&#39;s no good way to search them (because search for old messages is unreliable).This aspect of the iMessage user experience has remained untouched for a decade, despite everyone&#39;s chats growing longer. Searching for particular iMessages sucks because the results miss the broader context of the conversation (a single message is not useful when you want to reread a conversation).(Also just noting, as the post author I created a title better-suited to HN&#39;s 80 character limit.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My sister was having a problem where she was taking all the iCloud storage for our family because she keeps sending videos to people but couldn&#39;t figure out a way to efficiently delete them. I had to write up a Python script (https://gist.github.com/saagarjha/615dee3c04e226b44828e910a5...) to scrape the iMessage database for large attachments, and then print out the text to messages around it so that you could search for it and jump to around that place in the chat history and then delete the files from there. It&#39;s kind of insane how hard it is to manage old messages :/ I feel like Apple didn&#39;t really prepare for Messages coming in from iCloud meaning that every device had every single message you&#39;ve ever sent, and now it&#39;s really hard to get through them without reading the database manually…"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There’s a question as to why that fake consensus emerged. But I think the more troubling question is: How did people let the original story of what Tom Cotton even said go so badly awry? Essentially Cotton said something that was then transformed into a fake claim of a Chinese bio-attack, then the fake claim was debunked, and then the debunking was applied to the real claim with little attention paid to ongoing disagreement among researchers.I think this part of the text really sums up everything I hated about reading the news and social media in 2020. Each site seemed to be funneling you into a single source of truth and way of not only thinking, but FEELING about an event. I don&#39;t like being reminded of corporate sponsored social movements if I open facebook/google/amazon/twitter. I don&#39;t want my app reminding me to vote/get vaccinated(I did both btw) every time I open it without a way to dismiss and select &#39;I already did, stop reminding me.&#39; I don&#39;t want reddit creating a central sub-page for discussing [Current Event] within the narrow bounds of what their moderators think is acceptable. I don&#39;t like non-dismissable context text on twitter and under youtube videos that are often off topic and triggered by bad speech detection that simply take you to a link dump of regular news articles. I don&#39;t like the idea that there&#39;s an oligopoly on &#34;truth&#34; and &#34;credible sources.&#34; No amount of branding will convince me that &#34;fact checkers&#34; are any more objective and impartial than regular newspaper columnists; fact checkers are what editors are supposed to be. There&#39;s no academic rigor to fact checking, and the reality that so much casual skepticism on a variety of topics was suppressed and equivocated with being a flat-earther is sickening."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reminder that Facebook and Twitter banned users for talking about the lab-leak theory. Youtube accounts also got demontized/banned."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hate how it feels like there&#39;s such a &#34;collective narrative&#34; for everything now days with the internet.Whenever I talk to people about recent news stories in real life it feels like everyone is just repeating talking points they read online.Its like we&#39;ve been absorbed into the internet consciousness and talking to a person is like talking to &#34;the internet brain&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m not necessarily worried about climate change per se. It will result in hardship for many, for sure. Temperature changes will render some areas uninhabitable, it will cause mass migration, and probably destabilize the world politically.What am more worried about is the direct wholesale destruction of the biosphere. There are absolutely bonkers numbers about extinction, ocean acidification, runaway permafrost melt that actually could choke out a majority of people.Worse still, these effects aren&#39;t easily solvable by stopping emissions, or blocking out the sun with mylar sheets, or any of the &#34;low hanging&#34; technological fruit -- the stuff that could be solved with today&#39;s space technology or electric car tech.In order to actually solve these &#34;deeper&#34; problems, we will need an absolutely massive bio-engineering effort that is probably only possible with some kind of entropic breakthrough.Evolution is basically hyper-organization, a point of locally super low entropy that only happens by hundreds of millions of years of energy expenditure. When a species dies, it&#39;s not those individuals, it&#39;s every one of those individuals that ever lived that dies. All that concentration of local entropy, destroyed forever. It&#39;s like using every GPU on planet earth to train a hyper-smart GPT-4, for many human lifetimes -- and then hitting rm -rf on the weights."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Climate change is real, we are warming up and should/can solve this, but I&#39;m skeptical that apocalyptic narratives help the cause.&#34;A senior U.N. environmental official says entire nations could be wiped off the face of the Earth by rising sea levels if the global warming trend is not reversed by the year 2000.&#34;https://apnews.com/article/bd45c372caf118ec99964ea547880cd0"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We&#39;re definitely going to go beyond 2ºC in the coming decades.Even if a miracle happened and we stopped all human emissions today, current GHGs in the atmosphere will keep trapping more heat for some decades. This is known as climate inertia or climate lag.Another aspect I don&#39;t see frequently mentioned are feedbacks. Again, even if we stopped all emissions today, self sustaining climatic systems will keep adding more heat to the atmosphere (methane, etc) or the sea (Arctic ice melting).We&#39;re currently at aprox 36 billion tonnes of carbon emissions per year [1] only counting fuel burning. It would be a miracle if we could even reach 50% of that in our lifetime, which was aprox the emissions from the 70s.[1] https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I feel like I must be living in an alternative reality from the Twitter deriders in this thread, I&#39;ve had almost the exact opposite experience. I&#39;ve made more friends and acquaintances on Twitter than any other social network. It&#39;s also easily the most intellectual social network. (If that sounds crazy, really compare it to the others. They&#39;re either not intellectual or [youtube] not really social.)If you care deeply about something, you will find other people on Twitter. If you work in public, people will find you. Someone right now I met from Maine is currently drawing up the plans to teach me to timber frame a structure I just got approved. About 20 people I met from twitter have been over my house (for dinner, etc) at different times. Far more people read my work because of Twitter.If you don&#39;t use it as a political mouthpiece it&#39;s incredible and there&#39;s nothing like it. And that&#39;s really up to the user."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My main issue with Twitter is that you follow people, but those people have different interests. So I may follow @JohnSmith because he’s a known dev in the JS community and tweets about JS, but he also tweets about his country’s politics, what he ate at lunch, and engage in heated debats about pineapple on pizza I don’t care about.Twitter recently introduced topics, so that you can follow one topic that aggregates lots of tweets from various people.
This is not what I want: I’d like to follow @JohnSmith, but only for the JS content.As someone who tweets, I’d like some sort of kafka-ish topic queues: I would post tweets about JS in the JS queue, and tweets about Italian food in that other queue, so that people could follow the queues they want. In the end I don’t tweet on either topic because I’m afraid I’ll deceive people who followed me for the other content."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a reasonable twitter following (between 5-10k followers) and have recently realized that I needed to remove the app from my phone and only occasionally check it from time to time on a laptop. I&#39;m considering giving it up all together.I&#39;ve struggled a bit with this decisions since I&#39;ve made a fair number of real friends through twitter (people I keep up with in real life after) and come across a lot of interesting books, papers etc.But I&#39;ve come to realize that despite its benefits, twitter is ultimately toxic to your mind. I&#39;ve seen far too many people I care about slowly dissolve into a fever of dopamine fixes as they slowly contort their personality into a stream of memes and rants looking to gain followers.I always tried to fight the urge to post stupid shit just to grow followers, but anything genuinely nuanced or thoughtful you post will have virtually zero engagement. This is fine in isolation, but it leads all conversations to eventually degrade in to a miasma of garbage thinking that is just a mix of groupthink, rage and memes.The final straw for me was finding myself angry about the vague opinions of people I don&#39;t really care about at all. This same type of thinking is what got me to drop facebook entirely years ago."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is great and I wish this mentality was pushed earlier on reddit.There was a golden era of reddit right before the great Digg migration. Excellent comments, diverse opinions, and really great back and forth being shared of individual&#39;s experiences in almost every single subreddit.Today, it&#39;s definitely harder to find good commentary and exchange. It&#39;s also super heavily astroturfed by political groups in all the subreddits (on both sides) to try to influence the general groupthink narrative/consensus. It&#39;s so disgustingly obvious but doesn&#39;t seem to be an issue for the team.Maybe I am just getting old. I guess what I&#39;m try to say is nothing will beat simply Google searching a topic and typing &#34;reddit&#34; afterwards to query some super insightful and awesome 5+ year old forum post on whatever the content is."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"People keep saying how great Reddit is, but I tried signing up to a bunch of my &#34;Niches&#34; and all the posts where just low quality junk; for example every other post in the 3dprinting subreddit is just &#34;MY FIRST PRINT!&#34; or &#34;I BOUGHT A THING!&#34;  and for some reason people think it&#39;s cute so they upvote it.  EDC?  here is another picture of my gun!  Tech reddit; &#34;here is a link to a medium post that you can&#39;t see unless you subscribe!&#34;.And the rest of the posts are just people re-asking the same questions over and over because they can&#39;t be bothered to search.Reddit is just a fire hose of low quality content."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I did to improve my reddit experience:1. unsubscribe to all the big default subreddits, like askreddit, funny, etc (don&#39;t worry, you can still check them out if you want).2. go to r/all and use the filter feature to block the most annoying content or popular stuff that you absolutely don&#39;t care about. I blocked politics subreddits, some memes, anime, communities for popular youtubers, some of the worse default ones. Just look at the current /r/all listing and block whatever you don&#39;t care about that appears in the first few pages, refresh and do it again a few times. I go back every once in a while to repeat the process.3. subscribe to specific things you care about. smaller communities are better, some of the large ones are better moderated than others.4. favorite a few (3-4) subreddits that are about things I want to check often.My home feed is mostly tailored to my interests, even if there&#39;s some fluff. Smaller subreddits I don&#39;t check often and appear there. Then I check my favorite subreddits for specific things, and there&#39;s r/all for the popular stuff.I find that general topics like tech, music, sports are usually bad, but more specific, not necessarily niche, are better (a sub about a specific framework, maybe, or about your hometown, favorite band, or favorite team). Moderation style helps a lot."</p>
