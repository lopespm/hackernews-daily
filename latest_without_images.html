								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I worked at eBay, we had a bonus program based on company revenue.  It was around 6% of your salary max and managers got around 25% max based on the same formula.  For the first few years, you could count on getting a max bonus every quarter.  To the point where most everyone who worked there had always gotten one.And the one quarter, we didn&#39;t get the max bonus.  In fact, I don&#39;t think we got it all.  People screamed and yelled and were pissed.  At the company all hands they spent a lot of time explaining that bonuses weren&#39;t guaranteed.  Some of the lower paid folks were actually crying about not making critical payments because they counted on the bonus.  Morale went way down.  People left because of it.Stories like this are one of the stated reasons Netflix doesn&#39;t do things like bonuses or any sort of variable comp.  Because once you get one once, you feel entitled to it in the future, and it feels like a loss when you don&#39;t get it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of my first job as a developer, age 21. I haven’t shared it before, so here goes...There was a ‘crunch’ coming up at work (i.e. IMHO, bad planning) and so the boss offered everyone a bonus if they performed well.However, the older employees warned me that the criteria for such bonuses were often ill-defined. I therefore pushed for clear achievable objectives. These pre-agreed objectives were promised, but never provided.Anyway, we all work hard, some more than others, but we met all the deadlines.Then comes bonus time, and they propose that I be given 30% of the maximum bonus. I explained that I felt this was entirely unreasonable, as I met all my deadlines. No other objectives were set, and therefore I felt I deserved the full bonus.They didn’t agree, and we went three rounds of meetings with more and more people in the meeting. Each time they tried to convince me what I was asking for was unreasonable.At this point I should add that I had seen this boss (CEO, small company) be what I would now call abusive. Verbally abusive to junior staff members, and insulting members of staff behind their backs. So my loyalty was, well, absent.So on the third round of weirdly manipulative meetings, we come to an impasse. So I explained that I still stand by my request, and I pulled out my letter of resignation.At which point there is a long silence. My boss puts his head in his, and the other two people in the meeting (another boss, and my coworker) looked surprised, to put it mildly.After collecting his thoughts, my boss asks: what is to stop me threatening to resign every time I don’t get my way? To which I calmly explain that he didn’t have to pay (Ie. I could just quit).After a bit more stunned silence, the boss relents, and agrees to give me the full bonus.I wait until the bonus is in my account then I hand in my notice anyway. Abusive bosses don’t get loyalty.The best part is, the coworker in the meeting also didn’t get the full bonus, despite working much harder than me. He’d only asked her into the meeting to try to guilt/manipulate me. So not only did the boss have to give me the full bonus, he had to do the same for her too.After that I went freelance. And 15 years later I can say it was the best decision ever."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I see a lot of comments bemoaning performance-based bonuses, but consider the following:&gt; I remember being in shouting matches with our signal integrity team about among other things, how many capacitors we needed. These tiny devices evened out the power of the system, but they wanted far too many to be added to allow the design cheap and easy to build&gt; Meanwhile I was waking up at 4AM on most days, in full-stress-insomnia. Sometimes I would just give up on sleep and go into work at that early hour, and while there, sometimes run into other stressed-out engineers who also could not sleep. I had shaved as much time as I could possibly get off the schedule, and a little cost. A $25K bonus was out of the question at this point, but $10K or more, still in the running.&gt; Because manufacturing, as discussed, was not on the secret bonus program, did not even know it existed, and had very little incentive to speed up the rework. As far as they were concerned the project was slightly ahead of schedule, so why rush the job and make another mistake? More time ticked by. They actually did make another mistake anyway, and mounted incorrect rams a second time, which I remember being really mad about.&gt; Meanwhile, our sister project had managed to minimize their cost target and beat the target schedule of their project, such that each member of that team received the full $25,000.Sounds to me like the bonus program was working exactly as intended. OP got into shouting matches with other stakeholders to trim overly cautious expenses. He and his teammates voluntarily worked far outside regular working hours. Both him and his sister team succeeded in delivering a successful project ahead of time, with lower costs, and were ultimately tripped up only by the incompetence of other teams that had minimal bonus incentives.I&#39;ve noticed a huge difference between orgs where people have skin in the game, and orgs where people don&#39;t. People with skin in the game, have a real fire under their ass. It&#39;s inspiring to see how much they are able to get done, and how quickly. At orgs where people don&#39;t have skin in the game, I spend half my time sitting in meetings, discussing what doc we should write next, what format we should use for the doc, and when to schedule the next meeting to review that doc. It&#39;s as though people are more interesting in impressing one another and putting in facetime, rather than actually getting stuff done. In fact, I&#39;ve noticed that people often add a net-negative value to many projects - their urge to add their 2 cents and make their impact felt, results in goalposts getting constantly shifted and launches getting continually delayed.Is it possible for a badly designed bonus program to produce disastrously bad results? Definitely. But there has to be a better way to give people more skin in the game, when it comes to doing their job as effectively as possible."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For background context around telecoms for anyone reading this, there is an underlying difference in how telecoms networks are designed and architected - in the Telco world, links between networks were predicated on trust. Originally, telecoms networks were run by national level quasi-government operators, one per country. You interconnected with other &#34;known entities&#34;.Even now, you likely have 3, 4 or 5 national mobile operators in any one country. They negotiate their own roaming agreements in order for you to get roaming access. It&#39;s all driven by these kinds of relationships predicated on trusting other networks.In IT, we are rapidly moving towards zero trust (due to the internet), but circuit switched (legacy) voice is still all designed to be sent over private circuits between operators who trust each other.The legacy protocols (see SS7), used to route calls between operators are functional, but also lack access control and authentication, as it&#39;s assumed only trusted parties are on the network and able to use them. Those assumptions are no longer valid, and there&#39;s a huge challenge in dealing with this - hence SMS and call interception and rerouting attacks to steal 2FA tokens etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My assumption is that all intelligence services in all countries would love to have access to fully compromised networks. They spend all their time thinking about how to access information, so they would be fairly incompetent not to consider this.Does that mean that all systems are compromised? No, because there are risks associated with tapping in to these systems. Partly it depends on if they have access to the systems, but mostly on the possible blow-back if they get caught.Example: Swedens FRA (NSA equivalent) could in theory ask Ericsson (a Swedish company), to install a backdoor. But, Sweden has a fairly free press, and there are good chances that someone would leak this information. If it got leaked it would be a major scandal that could go as far as toppling the government and destroy one of Swedens most important export companies. Its very risky, and its a risk no one wants to take, so the parts made in sweden are probably not compromised.China, on the other hand has almost no risks associated with adding backdoor. No free press, hard suppression of whistle blowers, and since most foreign intelligence services already assume the equipment is compromised, there is no real reputational damage either. I assume they are all compromised, why wouldn&#39;t they be?The US is somewhere in between.Sometimes companies are compromised by intelligence services, but much more often I think its employees. Why try to change Tim Cooks stance on privacy, when all you need to do is find one Apple employee, willing to take a sack of money to &#34;do their country a great service&#34;?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Since the early 2000s at least, most billing has been outsourced. This works by sending all Call Detail Records (CDRs) to a third party, often from Israel or China.This is quite misleadingly written: telcos are not shipping reams of CDRs to some cubicle farm in Haifa or Chongqing.Yes, almost every telco outsources its billing software to other companies, notably Amdocs (founded in Israel, now HQ&#39;s in the US).  However, billing info is some of the most sensitive data a telco has for both privacy and commercial reasons, so that software always runs in a closed environment from where it cannot dial home.  Historically that&#39;s been on-prem, it&#39;s slowly moving to the Cloud but even there it&#39;s going to be firewalled off very carefully."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"What&#39;s more concerning to me is the cryptocurrency market as a whole. Perhaps there is an argument to Bitcoin being a kind of &#34;digital gold&#34; even if it is all but useless as a currency. But events like Dogecoin hitting a $50B market cap are very unsettling to me.I used to take part in &#34;Dogecoin Socks for the Homeless&#34; events. It was wonderful, everyone was trying to make something good out of what we all knew to be a meme. I am shocked now to look back on those wallet addresses which once held ~$1,500 and see they&#39;d be worth $285,000 (had I held). Of course, it might be that I&#39;m just angry I wasn&#39;t the one to become rich, but the mania right now is really, seriously, insane.Many people who are FOMO-ing in thinking this will make them millions with a few hundred dollars invested will be hurt when the &#34;number go up, number go down&#34; cycle turns to &#34;number go down.&#34;"</p>

					<h3><a href="https://jonatron.github.io/webgl-fingerprinting/">Are top websites using WebGL for fingerprinting?</a></h3>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some of these are probably fingerprinting but the Twitch one isn&#39;t (I worked on the video system at Twitch for a number of years).&#34;player-core-variant-....js&#34; is the Javascript video player and it uses WebGL as a way to guess what video format the browser can handle. A lot of the times mobile android devices will say &#34;I can play video X, Y, Z&#34; but when sent a bitstream of Y it fails to decode it. WebGL allows you to get a good indication of the supported hardware features which you can use to guess what the actual underlying hardware decoder is.This is sadly the state of a lot of &#34;lower end&#34; mobile SoCs. They will pretend to do anything but in reality it just... doesn&#39;t."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sorry, but this is nonsense, as presented.There is zero evidence any of these are being used for fingerprinting, which is defined as building up an entire set of capabilities to uniquely identify a user.Essentially all of these seem to be attempting to identify the graphics card, and all of these could be related to feature detection for an embedded video player, for example. Feature detection is not fingerprinting.Fingerprinting is pretty easy to confirm, because it collects a large combination of data points (fonts installed, canvas rendering quirks, etc.) and either reports or hashes them all together. (That doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s easy to find the code that does the fingerprinting, but once you&#39;ve found it it&#39;s quite obvious what it&#39;s doing.)It is deeply irresponsible and misleading of the author to claim fingerprinting without looking for that type of combination. And slapping &#34;No claims made about accuracy&#34; at the top of the page isn&#39;t an excuse."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As I&#39;m repeating myself too often regarding this: the statistical norm is to be trackable. Every browser that isn&#39;t will get flagged.Privacy does only exist if you seem to look exactly like any other person visiting the website.That is why user agent, web apis, asset loading order and behaviours, http stack behaviours, tcp fingerprints all have to look like they came from the Browser Engine you&#39;re trying to identify with.If you don&#39;t, you&#39;re watched. It&#39;s as simple as that. Don&#39;t kid yourself into safety if you think that the Content-Security-Policy hack of adblockers work to prevent tracking and fingerprinting. Sure, you send less data, but less data means more obvious than the norm.As there was not a single concept that could fix this (in regards to looking like another Browser) I started to build my own &#34;web filtering browser&#34; [1] that is able to emulate fingerprinting, and sticks them to specific domains and their originating uncached CDN requests so that if you have the same IP for the same website, they cannot correlate it to ptevious visits.The most effective way to not get tracked is to not visit the website. And I think that there&#39;s a huge potential in offloading traffic to peers that have the same URL already in their caches. Peer-to-peer Browser Caches would fix so many issues on their own, I don&#39;t understand why nobody is doing that. To the end user it doesn&#39;t matter where the assets come from, as long as the website is rendered in the same way afterwards.[1] https://github.com/tholian-network/stealth"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love Squarespace. I find it to be as close to the perfect mix of flexibility, usability and beautiful defaults that I&#39;ve ever seen in a website builder. I can hand off management of the site to someone with almost zero technical skill (my 70 y/o father with almost no technical knowledge manages a Squarespace site I built him!) and when I look back in 2 years the site will still look pretty good and will still work on mobile. Chances of the site being hacked are much much lower than on Wordpress. Prices are reasonable. The layout engine is exactly what I want, it looks nice on all devices and can handle most layouts, which is a totally worthwhile tradeoff for the few times that something just doesn&#39;t quite look the way I want it to without custom css.I know people say this stuff:&#34;You can&#39;t transfer your site away&#34; - I know, but I can build a reasonable site in ~2 days, so the tradeoff is worth it and the sunk cost is lower&#34;But I want a fully custom design&#34; - Yeah, fair enough, there is a cap on the high end of design with it but I think that cap is pretty high, especially in 7.1&#34;But it is making the whole internet look the same!&#34; - Not really, between colors, photos and sections in 7.1 I just don&#39;t think this is true. If you use unsplash for all of your photos then maybe, but if you are doing that you are probably too small to care, worry about that when you hit 2MM in revenue&#34;But Wordpress is user friendly too&#34; - No it isn&#39;tAs I write these I think that maybe it is just the perfect thing for my subset of clients (SMB), so read this from that perspective.

It&#39;s good, it&#39;s fast, it&#39;s productive, it&#39;s well supported, battle tested and documented for decades with a huge pool of devs. And many companies already use it and the tooling is excellent.But those are not sufficient reasons for me.Python is older than Java, well supported, battle tested, documented with a huge pool of devs. But it&#39;s way better for high level stuff, data mangling, scripting, gluing, and for most web dev stuff.If I want a distributed system or something with a lot of I/O, Erlang and Go will always be better than Java. Sure, they are less widespread, with all the stuff it implies, but for such a nice need, I will pay the price hapily: my goal is optimization for the use case. Same for stuff that needs to go fast or have a small footprint, I&#39;m not going Java if I can go Rust.If I want to have fun, Java is out of the loop. Better sharpen my inner weirdness by fighting with some exotic lisp. Why try productive ? I wanna enjoy myself, not run a business.So Java is not a bad choice. It&#39;s an excellent tech. I just don&#39;t have a use case for it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This post from &#34;an ignorant computer science undergrad&#34; is pretty silly, so allow me to get a little silly in response.I think if Java&#39;s new features are an attempt to woo new developers, Java comes off pretty tragically, like the old guy in the club, trying stay relevant by showing off how it just got up to date with ideas that hit the mainstream ten years ago.  Whoa, check out these record classes!  Fresh stuff over here!  I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any significant audience for this (a few &#34;ignorant computer science undergrads&#34; aside,) and I doubt that&#39;s what Oracle is shooting for.I think what Java is really doing is reassuring people who committed to it long ago that it will take care of them.  Java is not the old guy in the club; it is the middle-aged guy dressing up and taking his wife out for a night (or half an hour, depending on her arthritis) of dancing at a jazz bar.  It&#39;s doing its honorable best to show the people who committed their lives to it that it understands they still need a little bit of excitement now and then, and they don&#39;t have to sacrifice their dignity to some cad at the bar at the country club to get it.They don&#39;t really want to leave Java.  Java understands things about them that nobody else ever will.  All Java needs to do to keep them is love them enough to keep doing its best."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I haven&#39;t been coding as long as most (about 10 years) but I&#39;ve had phases of Java, Ruby, Python, JS, TS, ObjC, etc.If I go onto my GitHub and try to get any of my old projects running I am extremely confident that the non-Android Java  ones will still work. All of the other ones will probably have &#34;rotted&#34; over the years and send me down a day-long rabbit hole looking for old dependencies or build systems.There&#39;s something to be said for that amazing stability. I can&#39;t think of another language where you can find some .edu page from 2001 with a link to a library (.jar) that does what you need and you can actually use it in a modern application."</p>
