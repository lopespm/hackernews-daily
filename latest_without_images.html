								<p class="story__comment_others">"I checked out the user supplied examples.On the Appalachian Trail map the Title of the Legend is &#34;Bathymetry&#34;. Something tells me that is not right. Global warming must be a bigger problem for the east coast than I had been misled to expect.The map of community solar proposals also has a problem in the legend. All the line sizes for the transmission capacity players are identical in the legend even though they are graduated sizes on the map.In addition, there actually end up being two map legends as you can see in the Appalachian Trip planner. The first one is tied to the base map and the symbology fits for the base map. You need to zoom in to see any Campground or Trailhead points since they are features common to the National Parks along the route. The second one is the user added note with Planned Stops and Estimated Date.Points associated with the second legend (or note or whatever) are all you see at the initial scale. This might be confusing for some users who would expect all map layers to belong to one legend so this should be clarified.With these in mind, it would pay off for them to examine their Legend tools so that they can become legendarily good because right now they serve as a perfect example of how not to do a map legend. They are supposed to convey useful information that aids visual interpretation of map features and layers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Doesn&#39;t look like the author knows what he is talking about. His point about early stage startup should not use K8S is fine. But the next advice about not using a different language for frontend and backend is wrong. I think the most appropriate advice is to choose a stack which the founding team is most familiar with. If that means RoR then RoR is fine. If it means PHP then PHP is fine too. Another option is to use a technology which is best suited for the product your are trying to build. For example, if you are building a managed cloud service, then building on top of K8S, or FireCracker or Nomad can be a good choice. But then it means you need to learn the tech being used inside out.Also he talks about all of this and then gives example of WhatsApp at the end. WhatsApp chose Erlang for the backend and their front end was written in Java and Objective-C. They could have chosen Java for backend to keep frontend language same but they didn&#39;t. They used Erlang because they based their architecture on Ejabberd which was open source and was built with Erlang. Also WhatsApp managed all their servers by themselves and didn&#39;t even move to managed cloud services when they became available. They were self hosting till FB acquired them and moved them to FB data centres later on (Source: http://highscalability.com/blog/2014/2/26/the-whatsapp-archi...)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I agree entirely.I like to call what the author is referring to as, &#34;What-If Engineering&#34;. It&#39;s the science of thinking you&#39;ll be Google next week, so you build for that level of scale today. It involves picking extremely complicated, expensive (both in compute and skilled labour) technologies to deploy a Rails app that has two features. And it all boils down to, &#34;But what if...&#34; pre-optimising.It happens at all levels.At the individual unit level: &#34;I&#39;ll make these four lines of code a function in case I need to call it more than once later on - you know, what if that&#39;s needed?&#34;It also happens at the database level: &#34;What if we need to change the schema later on? Do we really want to be restricted to a hard schema in MySQL? Let&#39;s use MongoDB&#34;.What&#39;s even worse, is Helm and the likes make it possible to spin up these kinds of solutions in a heart beat. And, as witnessed and evidenced by several comments below, developers think that&#39;s that... all done. It&#39;s a perfect solution. It won&#39;t fail because K8s will manage it. Oh boy.Start with a monolith on two VMs and a load balancer. Chips and networks are cheaper than labour, and right now, anyone with K8s experience is demanding $150k + 10% Superannuation here in Australia... minimum!https://martinfowler.com/bliki/MonolithFirst.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I lean conservative in my tech choices but I just don&#39;t see the big issue with Kubernetes. If you use a managed service like GKE it is really a breeze. I have seen teams with no prior experience set up simple deployments in a day or two and operate them without issues. Sure, it is often better to avoid the &#34;inner platform&#34; of K8s and run your application using a container service + managed SQL offering. But the difference isn&#39;t huge and the IaC ends up being about as complex as the K8s YAML. For setting up things like background jobs, cron jobs, managed certificates and so on I haven&#39;t found K8s less convenient than using whatever infrastructure alternatives are provided by cloud vendors.The main issue I have seen in startups is premature architecture complexity. Lambda soup, multiple databases, self-managed message brokers, unnecessary caching, microservices etc. Whether you use K8s or not, architectural complexity will bite your head off at small scales. K8s is an enabler for overly complicated architectures but it is not problematic with simple ones.&gt;Did users ask for this?Not an argument. Users don&#39;t ask for implementation details. They don&#39;t ask us to use Git or build automation or React. But if you always opt for less sophisticated workflows and technologies in the name of &#34;just getting stuff done right now&#34; you will end up bogged down really quickly. As in, weeks or months. I&#39;ve worked with teams who wanted to email source archives around because Git was &#34;too complicated.&#34; At some point you have to make the call of what is and isn&#39;t worth it. And that depends on the product, the team, projected future decisions and so on."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have witnessed something quite similar. During the flash-floods in 2021 in Germany, locals in the Ahr region absolutely rose to the occasion. Farmers were evacuating people in head-high water with their tractors during the night, local restaurants were already providing hot food and water the next morning wherever they could reach, pharmacies were loading whatever they had available on ATVs to somehow get much-needed medicine down precarious mudpaths. Local construction companies were already clearing rubble and building emergency bridges out of it. One Excavator was just basically standing in the middle of the river and ferrying people and rescue partys across. The local racetrack basically just organized everything while politicians were still playing the blame game. When our local firebrigade was officially pulled back from active duty because we lost one of ours during rescue operations in the first day, basically everyone just went down again and just tried to do whatever was possible. Absolutely stunning what people will do when they are face to face with disaster. I freely admit that I was crying like a little girl when I first saw the endless columns of Bundeswehr, THW, Fire Brigades, Farmers, basically everyone who could just streaming to help people they never met but were neighbors and friends for me.Sorry for the rambling, but I am still not emotionally disconnected enough from it to concisely talk about it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; And the most unusual thing about all this is: None of this is unusual. At least not within the national tapestry that is The Great American Small Town.It also isn&#39;t unusual in the cities. Humans are wonderful and terrible everywhere. It reminds me of the 30 Rock episode where Jack and Liz go to Georgia to find a new comedian in touch with the &#34;real America&#34; and Liz keeps insisting that all Americans are real Americans and there is no &#34;real America.&#34;The acts of people after 9/11 in NYC remind us of the good in humans just as this small town inspires us.As Mr Rogers said, &#34;When I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me, &#34;Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For some reason this reminded me of the Ray Bradbury story, &#34;The Town Where Noone Got Off&#34; which is a dark little story indeed about two men and a small town on a railroad line.  This one is a bit more positive.However, it turns out this whole incident was apparently due to the lack of a railroad crossing guard system of any kind at the intersection.  The most basic system has flashing lights warning of oncoming trains, and even that wasn&#39;t present.https://www.kwch.com/2022/06/30/amtrak-derailment-places-spo...In that respect it&#39;s also a story about the poor state of American infrastructure."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Given some of the people here might run their own servers, the self-hosted alternative is to have something like Sonarr PVR for newsgroups and torrents, alongside a tracker indexer like Jackett, and then Plex for the frontend. In this combination, you &#34;subscribe&#34; to TV shows and select movies on the Sonarr system, and then the downloading is taken care for you even when new episodes arrive. These will then appear on Plex which is refreshed by the pipeline automatically. The system integrates with private trackers and is capable of maintaining your seed-ratio if that&#39;s important.I recently fell into this rabbit-hole while trying to organise my music. For music there is Lidarr, which also ID3 tags your music and reorganizes it into folder structures. This is convenient since organizing anything using Plex is a nightmare."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I became a single parent when my daughter turned 1 year old. When she got old enough we&#39;d go fishing, bicycling, swimming, and hiking a lot. We&#39;d also go to a used book store twice a month (on pay day) so she could pick out a few books to read. She loved doing that.She had no interest at all in learning how to code or gaming but she loved helping in the garden and in the kitchen prepping and cooking meals.When she got to Jr. High she wanted to join the &#34;Cheerleader&#34; squad so there were a lot early morning rides to school I had to make, and lot&#39;s of Basketball games I attended until she graduated, but I had a lot fun cheering along with them.During those years I setup a campsite on our property so her and her friends could go hang out there. I&#39;m sure they had more fun than most parents would approve of but they never got into any real trouble, the police were never called, and no one got hurt bad enough for the parents to call me. For the most part all those parents knew exactly where their kids were and what they were doing. And that I was close enough to deal with anything that came up. But there were never any serious issues.She&#39;s 37 years old now, still loves to hike, backpack, swim, fish, garden, and cook, and most important, she still likes to hang out with me!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My son is 12 y/o, and he&#39;s into Minecraft.Yesterday he discovered the server mc.openredstone.org. He spent all day yesterday and about one hour today, and he ended up building a 4-bit adder.On this server players learn how to build logic gates, and mix them so they eventually build CPUs. It&#39;s fully gamified, so beginners are called &#34;students&#34; and more advanced players are called &#34;builders&#34;. To become a &#34;builder&#34; you need to pass some trials. The &#34;builders&#34; probably have their own challenges (not sure, my son is still a student), in any case, they behave like teachers. So a student will find a builder who will give them instructions, and guide them through more and more complex designs.So, yesterday my son had no idea what XOR or NAND is, and today he already built a 4-bit adder, and has dreams of building an ALU.I&#39;m quite excited to be honest. By the way, I&#39;m not in any way connected with whomever put together this Minecraft server. I don&#39;t even think it&#39;s a for-profit thing, as far as I can tell, it&#39;s fully non-profit."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Might be off topic but a nugget from having two girls (5 and 11). Kids don’t care about budget or how much things cost. We have toys we’ve spent hundreds of dollars on only to have the near free to free one be a hit. I say this to make sure you know your employment status likely only effects your kids if it effects you. Or said differently, to the extent it effects you it will effect them.Kids will generally have fun with anything you show a degree of interest in. The copper pipe plumbing example in this thread is a perfect example. A simple Task became a life long activity for the kid. They will remember it forever and tell someone in the future “this time I welded with my dad”… they won’t remember that time my dad didn’t hire a plumber.Things off the top of my head that have been a hit - 
Planting plants 
Fashion design 
Basic coding activities or contests 
Shooting
Anything that requires safety procedures 
Lawn work (but make it fun or set a timer)
Writing a story where they write some of it, you add in silly bits, they write more , repeat till laughing out loud. 
Both my girls super in to etiquetteBest of luck buddy and squeeze these years for as much as you can."</p>

Please, please, don&#39;t write it off until you&#39;ve read the book.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Do 1 task a day, no matter how small it is, do it consistently for a week or two. Then every other day you do 2 tasks for a month, and you start working up to a point where you feel you do what you can within your limits and get joy from that 1 (or 2) items you can scrap off.If you live with family focus your tasks maybe on easing their life, pull out 10  weeds out of the garden, take out the trash, fix a squeaking door. Small but attainable things.Chronical pain is a mess, it&#39;s relentless and it&#39;s always there, it doesn&#39;t go away, but you learn to deal with it. Focus on the pain initially, learn what pain you have and focus on it. I learned to focus on it and make a mental note (do not know how else to say) that it&#39;s not worth paying attention to, and I get by without medication. It&#39;s not always easy and there are days where you want to cry and cry and just fall asleep so you do not have to feel it.
It&#39;s normal and accept that not all days will be the same and successful.It&#39;s a tough hill you are up against, but all shall pass and all will be well in the end. It&#39;s unbelievable sometimes, but all shall pass. Remember that.Good luck, don&#39;t falter, reaching out is the first step!"</p>

I don&#39;t know your exact situation or your disabilities, but if you can deliver pizzas to at least keep your head above the water, do that. Having gone through YC you&#39;re obviously also a bright and intelligent person, how many different companies have you tried consulting for? Some companies could be more understanding than others of your situation, in which cases making 1500 a month shouldn&#39;t be a huge problem in this industry.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I sure wish Starlink supported IPv6. They&#39;re a brand new ISP planning for millions of customers and decided from the start they couldn&#39;t get enough IPv4 addresses for everyone. Fair enough! But we&#39;re stuck with Carrier Grade NAT and it is a drag.On Starlink it&#39;s impossible to host a server socket directly, which makes any peer to peer networking a PITA. Geocoding IP addresses doesn&#39;t work so I have to bend over backwards to convince, say, Youtube TV that I&#39;m in the Sacramento metro and not LA where the POP is. Also the shared IP addresses seem to trip a lot of DDOS protection; I fill out 10x as many CAPTCHAs on Starlink as I do on my other ISP. And I sometimes get random network stability problems; a few weeks ago Starlink screwed something up so no one could keep a persistent connection up more than a few minutes. Seems to be fixed now, but I bet it was their CGNAT system.I realize half the world lives with CGNAT. It&#39;s not unusable, at least web browsing works more or less. But IPv6 would solve all these problems. A little surprised that a new ISP created in 2021 wouldn&#39;t have IPv6 support as one of their launch features. There&#39;s hints they are trying to get it working but it&#39;s not an official thing now.

If 20% of users want to be able to do something in TypeScript that the language doesn&#39;t support, they either can try to get the change into the core language, or live without it (or fork it). If it changes, it&#39;ll change for everyone using TypeScriptBut in Clojure (lisps in general), you don&#39;t have this restriction, so modifying the language for your own need, becomes a lot easier. Lots of work on Clojure is simply done in libraries, as it&#39;s possible and doesn&#39;t impact the core of the language, which everyone shares."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As much as I respect Rich Hickey, it&#39;s hard to say anything positive about this. It has basically nothing to do with open source. It&#39;s entirely specific to how he chooses to run his own projects.Open source is not a gift in the sense that you &#34;get what they give you&#34;. You are entitled to the source code. You are entitled to modify the code. You are entitled to distribute your modifications.Are you entitled to be part of the development process and to state your opinions about how things are going? Yes...if those are the rules of the project. The thing is, that has nothing to do with open source, it&#39;s always project-specific, so the full post largely doesn&#39;t make any sense as a comment on open source."</p>
