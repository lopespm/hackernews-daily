								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So spammers have latched onto your search engine because they are getting useful results.  They are able to systematically discover websites built on certain platforms that allow users to post content containing links, which they can target for link spam.  It is very difficult to fight this on a technical level because there is an entire industry built around blackhat SEO, with all kinds of softwares and services dedicated to thwarting your defensive efforts.  Even Google struggles to keep up with this.However, they are also systematically feeding you their footprint lists.  I imagine you could put together a footprint blacklist pretty quickly, and just stop returning results for any obvious spam queries like those containing &#34;powered by wordpress&#34;.It&#39;s not a very elegant solution I&#39;ll admit.  It won&#39;t stop the bots from trying, and you may have to circle back periodically to add new footprints as they surface.  But it&#39;s a potentially quick and easy way to stop rewarding their efforts, and the blackhat world is pretty used to burning out their resources so hopefully they will figure out it&#39;s a dead end and move on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Since everyone in this thread wants to jump down OP&#39;s throat about the quality of his web site, another interesting search engine is millionshort.com, which allows you to filter out the top N web sites from the results of your search. It&#39;s a great tool for looking past sites with good SEO; all you have to do is fiddle with the value of N.For example, searching for &#34;electronic music box&#34; as /u/ajnin suggested, with the top 100K web sites removed from the results, filters out the following:&gt; These 23 sites were removed from your results:&gt;     alibaba.com (1 result removed)&gt;     aliexpress.com (1 result removed)&gt;     allaboutcircuits.com (1 result removed)&gt;     amazon.com (2 result removed)&gt;     apple.com (1 result removed)&gt;     bestreviews.com (1 result removed)&gt;     ebay.com (1 result removed)&gt;     etsy.com (2 result removed)&gt;     facebook.com (1 result removed)&gt;     instructables.com (2 result removed)&gt;     lightinthebox.com (2 result removed)&gt;     lumberjocks.com (1 result removed)&gt;     mapquest.com (1 result removed)&gt;     reverb.com (1 result removed)&gt;     twitter.com (1 result removed)&gt;     wikipedia.org (1 result removed)&gt;     yelp.com (1 result removed)&gt;     youtube.com (2 result removed)And the top result ends up being https://midiguy.com/."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This made me curious to try that search engine so I typed &#34;electronic music box&#34; (first thing that came to mind). As far as I can tell none or the 10+ pages of results include all those 3 words. I mean, you might not have any relevant sites in your database (likely if there are only 1000 sites or so as another of your blog posts imply), and I understand you want to show some result to the user, but if I want irrelevant links I might as well go to google.com..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So this one is a tough one for me, because Yuri has certainly spent significant time with Julia and I think he&#39;s a very competent programmer, so his criticism is certainly to be taken seriously and I&#39;m sad to hear he ended up with a sour opinion.There&#39;s a lot of different issues mentioned in the post, so I&#39;m not really sure what angle to best go at it from, but let me give it a shot anyway. I think there&#39;s a couple of different threads of complaints here. There&#39;s certainly one category of issues that are &#34;just bugs&#34; (I&#39;m thinking of things like the HTTP, JSON, etc. issues mentioned). I guess the claim is that this happens more in Julia than in other systems. I don&#39;t really know how to judge this. Not that I think that the julia ecosystem has few bugs, just that in my experience, I basically see 2-3 critical issues whenever I try a new piece of software independent of what language it&#39;s written in.I think the other thread is &#34;It&#39;s hard to know what&#39;s expected to work&#34;. I think that&#39;s a fair criticism and I agree with Yuri that there&#39;s some fundamental design decisions that are contributing here. Basically, Julia tries very hard to make composability work, even if the authors of the packages that you&#39;re composing don&#39;t know anything about each other. That&#39;s a critical feature that makes Julia as powerful as it is, but of course you can easily end up with situations where one or the other package is making implicit assumptions that are not documented (because the author didn&#39;t think the assumptions were important in the context of their own package) and you end up with correctness issues. This one is a bit of a tricky design problem. Certainly adding more language support for interfaces and verification thereof could be helpful, but not all implicit assumptions are easily capturable in interfaces. Perhaps there needs to be more explicit documentation around what combinations of packages are &#34;supported&#34;. Usually the best way to tell right now is to see what downstream tests are done on CI and if there are any integration tests for the two packages. If there are, they&#39;re probably supposed to work together.To be honest, I&#39;m a bit pained by the list of issues in the blog post. I think the bugs linked here will get fixed relatively quickly by the broader community (posts like this tend to have that effect), but as I said I do agree with Yuri that we should be thinking about some more fundamental improvements to the language to help out. Unfortunately, I can&#39;t really say that that is high priority at the moment. The way that most Julia development has worked for the two-ish years is that there are a number of &#34;flagship&#34; applications that are really pushing the boundary of what Julia can do, but at the same time also need a disproportionate amount of attention. I think it&#39;s overall a good development, because these applications are justifying many people&#39;s full time attention on improving Julia, but at the same time, the issues that these applications face (e.g. - &#34;LLVM is too slow&#34;, better observability tooling, GC latency issues) are quite different from the issues that your average open source julia developer encounters. Pre 1.0 (i.e. in 2018) there was a good 1-2 year period where all we did was think through and overhaul the generic interfaces in the language. I think we could use another one of those efforts now, but at least that this precise moment, I don&#39;t think we have the bandwidth for it. Hopefully in the future, once things settle down a bit, we&#39;ll be able to do that, which would presumably be what becomes Julia 2.0.Lastly, some nitpicking on the HN editorialization of the title. Only of the issues linked (https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/41096) is actually a bug in the language - the rest are various ecosystem issues. Now, I don&#39;t want to disclaim responsibility there, because a lot of those packages are also co-maintained by core julia developers and we certainly feel responsibility to make those work well, but if you&#39;re gonna call my baby ugly, at least point at the right baby ;)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Everything has correctness issues somewhere. Julia ships an entire patched version of LLVM to fix correctness bugs in numerical methods. It has its own implementations of things like software-side FMA because the FMA implementation of Windows is incorrect: https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/43530 . Core Julia devs are now the maintainers of things like libuv because of how much had to be fixed there. So from those three points, that clearly points out tons of cases where Python, R, etc. code is all incorrect where Julia isn&#39;t.I think what&#39;s interesting about Julia is that because the code is all Julia, it&#39;s really easy to dig in there and find potential bugs. The standard library functions can be accessed with @edit sum(1:5) and there you go, hack away. The easier it is to look at the code, the easier it is to find issues with it. This is why Julia has such a higher developer to user ratio. That has its pros and cons of course. It democratizes the development process, but it means that people who don&#39;t have a ton of development experience (plus Fortran or C knowledge) are not excluded from contributing. Is that good or bad? Personally I believe it&#39;s good in the long run, but can have its bumps.As an aside, the author highlights &#34;for i in 1:length(A)&#34;. I agree, code should never do that. It should be `eachindex(A)`. In general things should use iterators which are designed for arbitrary indexing based on iterators. This is true in any language, though you&#39;ll always have some newcomers write code (and documentation) with this. Even experienced people who don&#39;t tend to use arrays beyond Array tend to do this. It&#39;s an interesting issue because coding style issues perpetuate themselves: explicitly using 1-base wasn&#39;t an issue before GPUs and OffsetArrays, but then loop code like that trains the next generation, and so more people use it. In the end the people who really know to handle these cases are the people who tend to use these cases, just like how people who write in styles that are ARM-safe tend to be people who use ARM. Someone should just run a bot that opens a PR for every occurrence of this (especially in Base), as that would then change the source that everyone learns from and completely flip the style."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am a long-time member of the Julia community and had a discussion with the author about these issues a long time ago – but did not give feedback on the post. Let me first state that Yuri is a great person and was a valuable member of the community. He pushed the boundaries of the language and produced some very nice packages in his time. His concerns are genuine and should be respected and discussed in that context.Also, let me say that encountering these kinds of bugs is not something I have had experience with. But, I tend to be very conservative with my usage of libraries and fancy composition.If I had more experience with programming language theory and implementation, perhaps I would have a better name to describe the source of the issues described. My attempt is to call it “type anarchy”. The way I see it, there is not a clear way to assign responsibility for correctness. In the case of the array used in the post, is it the fault of the implementer of the `sum` function (without a type signature, as it should be) or implementer of the data structure? I am honestly not sure. But as Julia breaks news ground with its type system and multiple dispatch, this could very much be an open question."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Parag apparently lost his patience with superficial and misleading claims about Twitter spam (like this analysis) and posted about it today.You can see it here (https://twitter.com/paraga/status/1526237578843672576).Noteworthy highlights:* Twitter estimates its &lt;5% number from human analysis of multi-thousand user random samplings of mDAU* Twitter allows that number to remain so high to avoid introducing friction like captcha into real users&#39; experiences* Twitter uses all sorts of internal private data in its analysis* Parag says you cannot get a reliable indication of bot/not bot without this internal private dataHaving just finished building a Twitter analysis tool, I agree with Parag that the Twitter API doesn&#39;t provide sufficient clarity to make decisions about spam. This article&#39;s analysis doesn&#39;t hold up - just because you can name several features you&#39;re going to use to generate a spam confidence score about an account does not mean that spam confidence score will have any precision."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t think this post means as much as people are acting like it does.The indicators of being a spambot they have in their post seem VERY iffy to me. &#34;Not tweeting in the past 120 days&#34;, &#34;Location set to a non resolving location&#34;, &#34;Small number of followers&#34;, &#34;default profile image&#34;, &#34;No URL in bio or non-resolving URL in bio&#34;, &#34;Not on many lists&#34;, &#34;tweets in a different language than the person they&#39;re following&#34; - Those all seem like extremely weak signals to me. My profile matches 6 of those, and I&#39;m a human. I would like to see them hand-verify a subset of their results and see if their algorithm matches reality.Also note that they define &#34;active&#34; differently than Twitter. They define &#34;active&#34; as having tweeted recently. Twitter gives spambot numbers as a percent of monetizable daily active users. I wonder if Twitter&#39;s given bot numbers are low because bots don&#39;t typically lurk or load ads. I can believe that the total bot count as a percentage of users or as a percentage of recently-tweeting-users is higher than 5%, but that only 5% of daily visitors seeing ads are bots."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;We undercount active users whose accounts are protected, accounts that view tweets but don’t send any, and accounts that log in and engage in other ways beyond tweeting (like favoriting or adding profiles to lists).&#34;My markup. If I understand correctly, not having a public tweet is a marker for being a spam account. Isn&#39;t that kind of a lot of people? I know from other forums that there&#39;s a large ratio between lurkers and active posters.Given that you need an account to customise your timeline, and, these days, pretty much for just reading a tweet, there may be loads of real reader accounts that never post and never bother customizing their profile."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Nothing wrong with p2p. But often it&#39;s simply overkill. Skype started out as a p2p thing. But ultimately, video calls became a commodity where orchestrating them centrally proved to be good enough. I can make video calls with meets, facebook, whatsapp, signal, slack, etc. Not a big deal. I even still have Skype somewhere and it still works even though they ripped out the p2p bits ages ago.I&#39;m not sure what web3 is other than a label that people started slapping on the collective efforts of people vaguely doing anything with or depending on some kind of block chain thingy. IMHO it has very little to do with the web and little or no relevance to end users.From a technical point of view, I don&#39;t see anything wrong with having a distributed store of ownership of stuff. There are all sorts of useful and valid uses for that. The problem is all the hyena&#39;s with dollar signs in their eyes floating around any companies active in this space. It&#39;s hard to see the forest for the trees because of this. Doing anything with a blockchain almost automatically buckets you with the fraudsters, utopians, and other people plaguing this space.Most of the companies in this space are a combination of naive, fraudulent, or misguided. With a few notable exceptions where you might squint and see some potential of some actual economic value. But most of them are obvious duds. I actually briefly used Stellar for some actual applications. Great tech. Mostly works as advertised. Not that expensive to use. Etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ll just leave this here [0]I don&#39;t disagree that the concentration of web architecture into the hands of a small number of big corps is a bad thing. I just don&#39;t see the solution being a purely technical one. There are market forces and reasons for that consolidation: efficiency in terms of power; production, acquisition, and deployment of expensive equipment; high-availability of services, operations and staff, etc. I don&#39;t like that a third of the Internet goes down with aws-east-1 like anyone else but the factors that enabled this situation are no conspiracy.We need economic incentives to enable smaller players to build on widely deployed infrastructure, fair competition laws, etc.We could use more edge-computing power with low-power equipment. Make it easy to deploy small-time data-centres on low-power, off-the-shelf hardware. Incentives that align with the economic value they bring so that they&#39;re not fighting on the margins left by large monopolies.Instead we&#39;re supposed to switch over to a &#34;P2P&#34; system built on funny machines evaluating user code. As many chains have tried to formally verify their smart contracts it&#39;s becoming increasing clear that the proofs, when they can be achieved, are so complex that the underlying system probably has more errors in it than we can count. Probably great for departing folks from their money but the folks running this stuff often don&#39;t even understand programming let alone proofs and verification.And then the stuff that actually gets built with it... slow, terrible UX, that it is... is just garbage anyways. Axie? I don&#39;t think anyone in web3 actually plays the game. It looks boring as all hell. And it&#39;s incredibly expensive to get started in it. They literally pay people to play it for them and they just watch spreadsheets for number to go up.And none of this &#34;distributed web&#34; works without the Internet as it exists today anyway. I&#39;m not interested in promises of potential. We don&#39;t drive on potential bridges.Maybe some part of the community is built by idealists but their dreams are poisoned. The world we live in right now is already pretty terrible in some parts. We could be fixing those instead of building another dystopia.[0] https://web3isgoinggreat.com/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was reading https://danluu.com/sounds-easy again today, and when reading this article I was reminded of a particular section:&#34;Everything we&#39;ve looked at so far is a technical problem. Compared to organizational problems, technical problems are straightforward. Distributed systems are considered hard because real systems might drop something like 0.1% of messages, corrupt an even smaller percentage of messages, and see latencies in the microsecond to millisecond range. When I talk to higher-ups and compare what they think they&#39;re saying to what my coworkers think they&#39;re saying, I find that the rate of lost messages is well over 50%, every message gets corrupted, and latency can be months or years&#34;Dan goes on to say: &#34;When people imagine how long it should take to build something, they&#39;re often imagining a team that works perfectly and spends 100% of its time coding. But that&#39;s impossible to scale up. The question isn&#39;t whether or not there will inefficiencies, but how much inefficiency. A company that could eliminate organizational inefficiency would be a larger innovation than any tech startup, ever.&#34;Communication scales extremely poorly compared to code and large organizations require a very different skillset than small companies. The author seems like someone who just loves writing code as opposed to wanting to deliver maximum business value (As defined by the company), so it makes sense he dislikes big companies.There are also good and bad big and small companies. A well run big company is still going to have a large amount of communication overhead vs a small company."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"All these meetings, reports, plans and apparently useless things, provide insurance to the different stakeholders of the project. Projects fail in many ways, and you need everyone to feel safe. That&#39;s why you need to document things a lot, in order to say “this was explained in section 3.2.1 of the manual” when the other team doesn&#39;t correctly  use your tools. And this is true for everyone, the finance guys, the product guys, the programmers, the marketers, everyone. Providing insurance to everyone is very expensive, but it makes the large organization stable. If everyone worked like cowboys in an small company, then the large company would disappear in a large fire of infighting.I never worked in a large company, but I work in academia, and we academics are also working on insurance a lot. The funding bodies want us to detail all expenses and justify all the changes in the plan, because they don&#39;t want people to say that the public funds are mismanaged. This is just an example. We also write tons of useless papers, to justify that we are productive with this money. This makes research very difficult. If you really want to do science, you should become rich and do it from home, like Nassim Taleb does, but in Academia we must work on all this insurance stuff, like in corporate world.That&#39;s how things are."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The issue the author is talking about, in my view, is caused by the natural lifespan of corps tending towards bloating middle-management. (Very hard process to fight).At the start the founder group are rutheless productivity-chasers. Then the corp expands to include the its-just-a-job group. Everything ticks along well, and at some point, the rutheless can&#39;t manage the group. So they hire followers to listen to their orders and thereby manage others. In this sense middle management is really &#34;corporate following&#34;.Now you have the its-just-ajobs, rutheless-productives, rutheless-leaders, and leader-followers.When the corp grows too far the balance in these populations is thrown way off (by, often, the shortsightedness of the real leadership in balloning middle-management to cover for them).At this point all the meaningful decisions are still held by the exec, but middle management are now so large they have to &#34;find something useful to do&#34;, which is regulate all the meaningless decisions.At this point most of the ruthelessly-productive leave, and you&#39;re left with the justajobs, leader-followers and the few clueless productives who&#39;ll destroy their mental health trying to grapple with it all."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I mean that was the expected outcome and now people are like “proof of the expected outcome!?!”Following months of outcry about the unsustainable nature of Terra Luna, Do Kwon through his foundation tried to partially collateralize the stablecoin with bitcoin, with a goal of buying up to $10bn of bitcoin. He got $3-5bn (at the time, price changed a lot), and this prolonged the confidence system for one additional month.And then it imploded and sold the collateral, of course it was partial collateral so it failed to do anything in a bank run.So it doesnt matter whether we get records from exchanges or not. Nothing different would happen. People want to see Do Kwon have more reasons to have charges against him, but there’s no need to attribute it to malice, everything can be explained by incompetence already."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Can you sell the Russian business without violating the sanctions?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a surprisingly well-written, engaging corporate statement. Most statements are pretty bland and purely to the point but after reading this I thought I was reading news coverage of their exit not their own statement."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It seems that McDonald&#39;s closed stores that operated directly under their control. As a result, only stores in westert part of Russia were closed (in Moscow, Saint-Petersburg). The stores in Siberia (i.e. Novosibirsk) and in Moscow airports continued operating as usual, as they are working under franchaising. Even the mobile app continued functioning.So not much is going to change, I think. Hell, McDonalds is even open in DNR/LNR &#34;republics&#34; under the name &#34;DonMac&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have tried to train my two cats with just these words:1. &#34;Let&#39;s go&#34; - morning meal2. &#34;Upstairs&#34; - I am going to bed3. &#34;Dinner&#34; (plus clink bowls together) - evening meal4. &#34;Lie Down&#34;and their names.Emerald, who prefers being upstairs, definitely responds to &#34;Upstairs&#34;: she charges upstairs when I say it. Jade remains enigmatic and skeptical: that seems to be her nature. But if she is in the mood for a tummy rub, she will respond to &#34;Lie Down&#34;.For me, the great charm of cats is that it is impossible to tell the difference between &#34;No, I don&#39;t understand you.&#34; and &#34;I understand you perfectly well, but I plan to ignore you completely until I feel like responding&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have two cats, a young male (perhaps not coincidentally, a colony rescue?) and a very elderly female. When I let them outside, if I call them to come in, the younger will find the older and herd her to the door. He then vigorously resists coming inside himself. He&#39;s also very vocal, and his tone of voice will change depending on whether he&#39;s happy to see me and wanting pets or if I&#39;m ruining his stalking and spying or he doesn&#39;t want to come inside (the other just ignores me and does whatever she wants)."</p>
