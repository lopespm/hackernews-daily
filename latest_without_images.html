								<p class="story__comment_others">"They really need to stop requiring SVPs or higher to show non-green status on the status page, as other HNers have revealed in last week&#39;s AWS post. It&#39;s effectively not a status page, and they could probably be sued if it can be demonstrated that X service was down but the status page showed green (since the SLA is based on status page). Should be automated and based on sample deployments running in every region and every service. And they should use non-AWS instances to do the sampling, so they can actually sample when, say, we experience the obligatory black friday us-east-1 outage every year."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Neat project! Setting up your own DNS server for a throwaway domain is definitely a pain, especially if you&#39;ve never done so and use anything other than PowerDNS really, so this is useful for messing around with.I do hope the author has set some limits on the DNS configuration you can freely enter. One annoying trick DDoS spammers will use is that they will set up DNS records that are as large as possible to use for their botnet&#39;s amplification attack, so allowing them arbitrarily large requests on your domain may be problematic and may cause nasty complaints against your domain. I&#39;d recommend anyone running a free subdomain service (or something super cool like this!) to consider this in their configuration. We can&#39;t have nice things because of these bad people :("</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This tool is so neat! One thing I&#39;ve learned from it is my ISP (sonic.net) seems to be doing queries to _.example.com. For instance:$ dig @50.0.1.1 nelson.lily6.messwithdns.com aResults in two queries being answered by the messwithdns server. One for nelson.lily6.messwithdns.com as expected, but also one for _.lily6.messwithdns.com.Any guesses what that naked underscore query is for? Not every nameserver does it (Cloudflare, Google, Quad9, and Adguard all don&#39;t). But Sonic isn&#39;t the only one that does.I&#39;ve asked on Twitter and the best guess right now is it has something to do with RFC2782 or RFC 8552. But those are about using _ to make unique tokens that aren&#39;t likely domain names, things like _tcp or _udp. What would a naked _ mean?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is awesome.But I wish a service existed that made domain names easy enough to use that the average person could manage them. IMO you shouldn&#39;t have to learn DNS and TLS in order to securely use a domain name. If I want to sign up to have Fastmail host my email, why do I have to manually copy and paste a bunch of DNS records? Fastmail already knows exactly what records need to be set. I should be able to OAuth redirect over to my domain registrar and approve giving Fastmail control over a subdomain of my choosing, and Fastmail should be able to use a simple open protocol to update the records."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From the top of the article:&gt; We want to thank Citizen Lab for sharing a sample of the FORCEDENTRY exploit with us, and Apple’s Security Engineering and Architecture (SEAR) group for collaborating with us on the technical analysis.This reminded me that NSO went after Citizen Lab on multiple fronts. They even tried to use a spy to talk to JSR (https://www.johnscottrailton.com) and make him say controversial things, which could be later used to malign Citizen Lab. Darknet Diaries covered this incident recently: https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/99/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is mind boggling. NSO used a compression format&#39;s instructions to create logic gates and then from there &#34;a small computer architecture with features such as registers and a full 64-bit adder and comparator which they use to search memory and perform arithmetic operations&#34;, all within a single pass of decompression. Combine this with a buffer overflow and you&#39;ve got your sploit."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a real shame that the people who came up with this exploit are working for NSO and not on solving P = NP or something. I&#39;m sure if we got them and the ones working on crypto at NSA in a room together, we&#39;d have it and clean unlimited energy in a week.I often feel sad thinking about how many brilliant engineers are dedicating their time to helping governments spy on people or other governments."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The one about using print/console.log/whatever lol.I&#39;ve always done this, never have I used a library for this, because:  - running manually? &gt;myapp.log 2&gt;&amp;1
  - using systemd? use journalctl
  - using docker/kubernetes? capture automatically the stdout/stderr of your containers and pipe them through logstash or something

Real question: why would an application need to know where its logs go? This is not in the business perimeter, but the ops perimeter. Am I wrong?EDIT:Most responses are about configuring logging level, output format, etc... This can be done with a print-based approach without sending a request to an external service (which would need to trust you and your inputs).Example: Python&#39;s default logging module.Still, thank you for your insightful answers :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I spent this weekend removing Elasticsearch usage in our project. Just earlier I saw that our API wasn&#39;t responding, and was wondering how the hell someone with log4j got to us. Turns our AWS West 2 was down.If it weren&#39;t for the fear of DDOS attacks, I&#39;d put every webservice in a physical server in a basement somewhere and be done with it. I&#39;ve been fighting this whole year to simplify and reduce the number of dependencies we use, but it&#39;s such an exhausting battle as it goes against the grain of the industry right now, and everyone almost actively works against you: build now, someone else may pay this technical debt."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Author here. I am seeing a lot of comments about how the graphs are not anchored at 0.  The intent with the graphs was not to &#34;lie&#34; or &#34;mislead&#34; but to fit the data in a way that was mostly readable side by side.The goal was to show the high level change, in a glanceable way, not to get in to individual millisecond comparisons.  However, in the future I would pick a different visualization I think :)The benchmarking has also come under fire. My goal was to just to put the same site/assets on three different continents and retrieve them a bunch of times.  No more, no less.  I think the results are still interesting, personally.  Clean room benchmarks are cool, but so are real world tests, imo.Finally, there was no agenda with this post to push HTTP/3 over HTTP/2.  I was actually skeptical that HTTP/3 made any kind of difference based on my experience with 1.1 to 2.  I expected to write a post about &#34;HTTP/3 is not any better than HTTP/2&#34; and was frankly surprised that it was so much faster in my tests."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What’s great about HTTP 1.1 is it’s simplicity. I mean, you can explain it to a complete newby and have that person write a functioning implementation in a few lines of shell script, all in one afternoon.In fact, you can probably figure it out by yourself just by looking at what goes across the wire.And yet, it runs the whole modern world. That’s beautiful. I think simplicity is underrated and it’s something I really value when choosing the tools I use."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am a little confused about the test methodology.The post clearly explains that the big advantage of HTTP/3 is that it deals much better with IP packet loss. But then the tests are done without inducing (or at least measuring) packet loss?I guess the measured performance improvements here are mostly for the zero round-trip stuff then. But unless you understand how to analyze the security vs performance trade-off (I for one don&#39;t), that probably shouldn&#39;t be enabled."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"On the surface this looks nice, until you start using 3rd party componentsand the defaults they assumed for the component are overwritten because the default is changed.It&#39;s no coincidence that we use classes to explicitly apply styles, I don&#39;t think this library is a good idea.It&#39;s the same issues as changing native prototypes in Javascript, stuff depends on the defaults to be exactly as specified.Explicit &gt; Implicit
Stuff magically working is great until you need to make an exception."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wish more front-end stuff was oriented this way.
This is how I want front-end coding to be:
  Rattle off what I need, semantically,
and then by default it will be styled and presented in a sensible way.
  Then later, if our company stylist want our apps to 
look a particular kind of fancy, he can configure some styling
that will apply to all.This is also why I hate Windows WPF so much:
If you just add a label, a field, and two OK/Cancel buttons to a form,
it will look horrendous by default.
  Only if you manually or deliberately set up some styling for it,
will it start to look sensible.I want gui frameworks to look sensible out-of-the-box,
without cluttering everything with piles of boilerplate crap."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s incredibly disturbing to me how little much of the HN crowd seems to understand how these systems like CSAM actually work.  I&#39;m not talking about the tech or programming.This is a fast track tool to putting anyone in jail for the most despised crime a person can commit.  The tool has no oversight, no transparency, no counter, no clear your name, no real usage definitions other than relentless spying on the &#34;protect the children&#34; fallacy.Most people don&#39;t understand how life destroying a false accusation is once the government paperwork is started.  At that point like it or not you are basically considered guilty by all the agents of the governement by default.  Their jobs are to prosecute not eliminate false positives.  Once you have been on their radar your life will never ever be the same.  And since it is CP related you will not even get helpful people willing to touch it with a 10ft pole cause of fear they may be implicated.  CSAM is a dastardly and effective way to establish a totalitarian rule by fear of life in jail, nothing more."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This case reminds me a bit of the big stink with the Daraprim price hikes and Martin Shkreli being dumb enough to be the public face of it. That worked out pretty bad for him but also bad for everyone else, because now we had a guy to blame for it, instead of asking the harder questions like &#34;why aren&#39;t drug prices regulated?&#34; Utilities must go to the public utility commission to raise rates so why is the same not done for drugs? The federal government stockpiles oil in case of shortages, why is it not responsible for ensuring that drug production is continued?The maddening thing about the Apple CSAM scanning controversy is that I still have no idea which legislation Apple is complying with, and it&#39;s difficult to find out any reporting on that aspect. US? UK? EU? Clearly there is/are some government organization(s) with teeth long enough that Apple is not willing to go to court again as was the case with the San Bernandino shooter. Point is, whether or not Apple has been dishonest about this whole thing, they are still just a distraction."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So far all the comments are predictably negative and imply that Apple will at some time in the future attempt to covertly implement the feature in secret.Another take would be that they took on-board the extensive public criticism, and changed their minds."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I built multiple systems using vector search, one of them demoed in a search engine for non-commercial content at http://teclis.comRunning vector search (also sometimes referred to as semantic search, or a part of semantic search stack) is a trivial matter with open-source libraries like Faiss https://github.com/facebookresearch/faissIt takes 5 minutes to set up. You can search billion vectors on common hardware. For low-latency (up to couple of hundred milliseconds) use cases, it is highly unlikely that any cloud solution like this would be a better choice than something deployed on premise because of the network overhead.(worth noting is that there are about two dozen vector search libraries, all benchmarked at http://ann-benchmarks.com/ and most of them open-source)A much more interesting (and harder) problem is creating good vectors to begin with. This refers to the process of converting a text or an image to a multidimensional vector, usually done by a machine learning model such as BERT (for text) or ImageNet (for images).Try entering a query like &#39;gpt3&#39; or &#39;2019&#39; into the news search demo linked in the Google&#39;s PR:https://matchit.magellanic-clouds.com/The results are nonsensical. Not because the vector search didn&#39;t do its job well, but because generated vectors were suboptimal to begin with. Having good vectors is 99% of the semantic search problem.A nice demo of what semantic search can do is Google&#39;s Talk to Books https://books.google.com/talktobooks/This area of research s fascinating. For those who want to play with this more, an interesting end-to-end (including both vector generation and search) open-source solution is Haystack https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"People say google search is terrible these days, but I find the opposite.I can vaguely describe in a sentence the gist of an article I&#39;ve read, or an image, and the proper result will usually be in the first page.Of course, it doesn&#39;t always work, sometimes there are &#34;hash collisions&#34; so to speak, but I don&#39;t think the old algorithm would have been more successfully either, since if I knew the exact keywords to use, I wouldn&#39;t need to start with a vague description in the first place."</p>
