For example, there will generally be higher &#34;2D mass density&#34; in the center.Consequently, it is possible that the scientists &#34;drawing icebergs wrong&#34; are actually right and it just looks/&#34;behaves&#34; wrong in 2D.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am deeply, deeply romantic about programming. I consider it an act of self-actualization.But answering the question literally, I am not representative of everyone in the industry, and that&#39;s a good thing. It&#39;s easy to feel romantic about your vocation when you have a number of reasonable options for achieving modest financial security, and you thus had the privilege of choosing the one that most closely matched your idea of self-actualization and self-identification.Not everyone in this economy has the same set of choices. For many, programming is the lowest-risk way to put a roof over their head and feed their family. We can make up little myths about how we romantics are obviously more passionate, work harder because it&#39;s our dream, are more deeply engaged, and so on.But in the end, I think we&#39;ll find as we look around that those of us who feel romantic about something that is also an excellent way to make money at this particular place in time and space have won a lottery of sorts, and are definitely in the minority.That&#39;s not a bad thing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While I don&#39;t disagree with the article, this quote better sums up how I feel about programming.&gt; The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of the imagination... Yet the program construct, unlike the poet&#39;s words, is real in the sense that it moves and works, producing visible outputs separate from the construct itself... The magic of myth and legend has come true in our time.-Fred Brooks, in The Mythical Man-MonthIn deference to the counterpoints in this thread, a lot of the &#34;poetry&#34; we actually encounter seems to have been written by Vogons."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Seeing as i&#39;m not as jaded yet as many of the other commenters here towards programming, maybe I can give my views.I understand what the author&#39;s getting at pretty simply, it&#39;s pretty awesome to write some words...lots and lots of words...and you create &#39;something&#39;.It&#39;s sort of the same romance that say would surround something likeA carpenter that builds homes from start to finishOr a mechanic that builds super cars in their garageI think it&#39;s that same thingThe lone programmer hacking away building something awesomeUnfortunately, like the &#39;romance&#39; of most things, the reality isThat carpenter&#39;s working on a crew of 100 people building yet another cooking cutter townhouseThat mechanic works a day job at a shop and spends more time paying bills and dealing with customersAnd...that programmerThey&#39;re part of a team debugging some server code somewhere that a bank or accounting firm relies on or somethingSometimes though, I find it helps just to stop and think of things romantically from time to time, even if you&#39;re disillusioned.By the time I left my prior job, I was kind of fed up with it. But even then there was two ways I could look at it.I could be&#39;A CNC programmer in a granite shop making countertops and fireplaces for rich people&#39;Or&#39;I turned mountains into high end furniture using large machines in a trade that stretches back to the farthest history of humanity.&#39;Looking at it the second way helped on those days you just really didn&#39;t want to be there."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"throughout my 20+ year career in biology I was repeatedly reminded of what I call &#34;the protein bias&#34; where DNA and RNA are treated as boring molecules that just exist to support proteins.  I was an RNA researcher for a while and it&#39;s an absolutely fascinating molecule and over the years people have built up more and more evidence that RNA influences biology in deep ways that aren&#39;t fully appreciated.It&#39;s funny about the magnesium in the article- getting the Mg concentration right when working with delicate nucleic acids is absolutely key to good results."</p>

Just running a simulated mind through a deterministic &#34;Red&#34; (ie: torture) script to prep it for the work you need it to do is frightening.Jeph Jacques of QC fame did Alice Gove which was a good Banks like comic. https://www.questionablecontent.net/alice1.htmlI also read quite a bit of Kris Schnee&#39;s work https://www.amazon.com/Kris-Schnee/e/B00IY1HDDY his earlier Thousand Tales novels I think deal with early brain scanning issues well.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">" Brave Help Article https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018121491-Wha...In which they, themselves, say (and always have been saying): &#34; If your personal safety depends on remaining anonymous, we highly recommend using Tor Browser instead of Brave Tor windows. &#34;Also this is a known issue, see https://github.com/brave/brave-core/pull/7909"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I respect Brave&#39;s efforts to make Tor accessible to the masses, but it also puts people at risk. There&#39;s lot of people with not a great deal of technical knowledge who are aware of Tor and might see it as a means to bulletproof privacy, unaware that using it through Brave on an OS like Windows 10 could easily expose them.Brave does present some kind of warning to users when opening an incognito tab. It just doesn&#39;t make the risks clear enough and will mostly be ignored.I&#39;m not sure what solutions there are for this. Perhaps shipping Tor as part of a regular browser isn&#39;t a good idea. In fact, I&#39;d say Tor should&#39;ve never been tunnelling generic protocols and instead had its own protocol for sharing information. That&#39;s another conversation though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is why you should always stick to the Tor Browser. See for instance the Tor Browser Design Doc (a bit outdated but still has a lot of info) for how much work they put to make sure that it stays as private as possible https://2019.www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design"</p>

So it had to download ~3gb to update the OS, just to wipe itself.That&#39;s just bonkers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So this means modern macs essentially have 4 copies of OS X installed? One regular, 2 recoveries, and whatever runs on their management controller(Bridge OS? Does that still exist on M1 macs?) and the touch bar.Seems to work out fine for them if it creates resilience and makes code-sharing/interoperability easy."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Psychedelics are not without risks, but the risks are for me a deal breaker when they are illegal.There are too many ‘designer drugs’ out there with unknown properties that are sold by misrepresenting what they are.LSD25, psilocybin, MDMA, DMT these are drugs with known risks and side effects, and there has been legitimate investigation into their benefits. It would be great if we could legally continue to gather data.So far, it seems these substances are arguably much less dangerous than many illegal substances. I would be in favor of legalizing all of them.Decriminalizing seems to be a necessary step in that direction, but it doesn’t allow for quality control. Legalization allows for real and enforceable disclosure about what I might be putting in my body.I hope we get there someday.Edit: and possibly less dangerous than some legal substances."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just want to give a shout out to Rick Doblin, the founder of MAPS, who has been fighting this fight since at least 1990.He, like myself, is an alum of New College, a non-traditional college in Sarasota.  He graduated I think the year before I matriculated, but his presence was well known on campus and his house was a legendary house he rented out to a few students every semester.To be clear, MAPS already existed back then, he was already working to get psychedelics (and entheogens such as MDMA) incorporated into therapeutic modalities.Back then the idea of legalized psychedelics seemed like a pipe dream.  To see his dreams begin to come to fruition 30 years later must be one of the most satisfying things a person can accomplish in his life.My hat&#39;s off to Rick Doblin.  What a mensch."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Off-topic, but I wonder if decriminalizing all drugs will kill the cartel profits. From what I can see, they make a ton of profit due to the illegality(risk-profit) and this big profit is how they became so powerful. Food for thought I guess."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; This classic passive-aggressive apology — “I felt awful that I had let down so many people in my effort to be loyal and learn from EA” doesn’t exactly ring out with contrition — isn’t even internally consistent; if the development team loved their game so much, why was Origin’s management forced to devise stratagems to keep them from going home out of the fear that they wouldn’t come back? Nevertheless, it does contain a fair amount of truth alongside its self-serving omissionsUgh - those omissions are not self-serving. The reality (which we all see) is that the dev team f*cking hated the game, probably gave up on quality, and everyone knows it.  But saying so is an attack on the people Garriott screwed when he screwed up; the omissions are of other people&#39;s contributions to his faults, not his faults themselves.The apology was _incredibly_ well-written: it highlights all of garriott&#39;s mistakes, in detail, and places the blame squarely on his own shoulders: he could say &#34;EA is evil because they enforce business discipline,&#34; but instead said &#34;they did their job as a business, and I didn&#39;t so mine as a creator.&#34;If anything, this was probably _too_ self-blaming (we all know EA would just replace him if he didn&#39;t bow down, accomplishing nothing). But don&#39;t criticize him for failing to throw his team under the bus.  Knowing very little, I&#39;d love work for this guy, based on that apology alone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Pagan was pretty bad. I was one of the superfans at the time, I had played every Ultima on my Apple II and then my PC. I was one of the first people to beat Ultima VI and still have my award certificate from Lord British which I got in the mail. I spent late nights tweaking my autoexec.bat and config.sys to get Ultima VII to run properly. Pagan was unplayable on release, it was actually impossible to across the stones leading across an underground river without falling in. Later they released a patch which fixed the most glaring issues and I completed the game, but it left a sour taste in my mouth.What REALLY killed Ultima was the absolute state of Ultima IX. Also released in an unplayable state, the patches rolled in. Finally after about two months, it was playable but as one progressed in the game, incongruities almost immediately popped out. The lore had been changed, sometimes substantially. And this wasn&#39;t the worst thing - it became clear after not too long that the game wasn&#39;t done at all. This was later admitted by an Origin team member who released the real plot, and later on people attempted to fan-patch the game to make it more like it had been planned originally.Of course, EA is to blame for all of this, but Garriott shares this blame for allowing them to take too much control away from his organization and okaying the releases before they were ready.http://hacki.bootstrike.com/english/nitpicks.htmHacki&#39;s page is still THE internet resource for the pissed off former Ultima fan."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It only killed the franchise if you don&#39;t count Ultima Online, which is probably one of the most important games in video game history."</p>
