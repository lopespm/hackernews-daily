								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reddit r/Sysadmin user that claims to be on the &#34;Recovery Team&#34; for this ongoing issue:&gt;As many of you know, DNS for FB services has been affected and this is likely a symptom of the actual issue, and that&#39;s that BGP peering with Facebook peering routers has gone down, very likely due to a configuration change that went into effect shortly before the outages happened (started roughly 1540 UTC).
There are people now trying to gain access to the peering routers to implement fixes, but the people with physical access is separate from the people with knowledge of how to actually authenticate to the systems and people who know what to actually do, so there is now a logistical challenge with getting all that knowledge unified.
Part of this is also due to lower staffing in data centers due to pandemic measures.User is providing live updates of the incident here:https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/q181fv/looks_like..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a great write-up, but one thing I don&#39;t understand is why the effect of withdrawing the BGP prefixes was instantaneous (if I understand that correctly), but it&#39;s taking hours (so far) to re-announce the prefixes.  Why would it take so long to flip the switch back the other way?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Those short TTLs that FB likely has on its DNS records probably bit it in the ass today. If it had longer TTLs, caching would have helped it. Curious though that recursive resolvers won&#39;t serve an expired cached record when they can&#39;t reach the authoritative server. (I know that unbound can be configured to do so, but not sure about others.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is anyone else kinda put off by how Cloudflare keeps interjecting themselves into this situation? First with the Twitter posts and now this blogpost. They&#39;re a passive observer, not involved in this event, and yet they keep putting themselves in the middle of it.Cloudflare staff are not Facebook staff, they do not know how things actually went down to trigger the events that transpired. They are essentially doing glorified bikeshedding, and providing an explainer of how BGP works that can be gleaned by reading virtually any introductory text on it, and using it as a marketing opportunity."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A few hours later another programmer came up with the prototype of a much faster terminal renderer, proving that for an experienced programmer a terminal renderer is a fun weekend project and far away from being a multiyear long research undertaking.I have no idea if this is the case here, and I suspect it might not be, but pretty much every time I&#39;ve seen a developer complain that something is slow and then &#39;prove&#39; that it can be faster by making a proof-of-concept the only reason theirs is faster is because it doesn&#39;t implement the important-but-slow bits and it ignores most of the edge cases. You shouldn&#39;t automatically assume something is actually bad just because someone shows a better proof-of-concept &#39;alternative&#39;. They may have just ignored half the stuff it needs to do."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In case this isn&#39;t clear, RefTerm is:1. Faster in every case tested2. More fully-featured, including i18n3. Easier to read and maintain (see for yourself)4. Shorter5. Using existing libs, aka interops well...So none of these typical hand-wavy dismissals apply:1. &#34;Is it really faster for edge cases&#34;2. &#34;He probably didn&#39;t implement certain features like Arabic and Chinese&#34;3. &#34;Businesses just wants enough&#34;4. &#34;Businesses just wants enough&#34;5. &#34;It probably makes some closed-world assumption&#34;The performance of RefTerm didn&#39;t come from some big tradeoff; it came from using the right perspective and keeping things simple.Sure, past a certain complexity threshold, you&#39;d have to work for extra perf, but from my observations, folks who immediately jump to the wrong implicit conclusion that &#34;good perf must have required compromises&#34; got conditioned to think this way because the software they work on are already (often unnecessarily) complex."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yup, this. Something I&#39;ve been ranting about[0] for a while: there is no technical progression ladder. The Senior-&gt;Principal-&gt; ... path seems to be a faux-management track, with all the managerial responsibilities and little of the authority. Software is shitty in big part because it&#39;s mostly written by juniors, as almost anyone who has any clue moves over (or gets pushed over) to managerial or faux-managerial roles.I&#39;ve been thinking about a more charitable interpretation of this recently. Another thing I rant about[1] is that tools we use for programming are not expressive enough. It takes too much work to say simple things, the coding feedback loop is ridiculously long. So how this connects? In a way, junior programmers can be seen as a Mechanical Turk version of a Sufficiently Smart Compiler - it lets the more experienced people skip some of the tedium with the tooling and deal with higher-level concepts, which get translated to actual code by an army of juniors and interns. Except, this doesn&#39;t work that well - the coding feedback loop is even slower.--[0] - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27417462[1] - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28568053"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am pretty sure I read something similar before. Probably from Benedict Evans or somewhere else.I think the most important issue from these email isn&#39;t the lack of Alternative App Store, IAP, or 70/30 split. It is that Apple Execs has Zero understanding of how other business works especially with respect to Internet or Software Services. They continue to think Netflix as a physical product ( As they often like to compare Physical Software distribution before App Store ) that is being continuously sold with recurring revenue like staples or other commodities.Not to mention Netflix knew Apple were doing AppleTV+. Directly competing with them. I love how Apple complains about testing IAP as not OK as in we deserve our 15%.So Reed made the decision to stop IAP. And reading all the emails from Apple execs, Eddy Cue often seems to be the culprit.Steve From D5&gt;You know, because Woz and I started the company based on doing the whole banana, we weren’t so good at partnering with people. And, you know, acatually, the funny thing is, Microsoft’s one of the few companies we were able to partner with that actually worked for both companies. And we weren’t so good at that, where Bill and Microsoft were really good at it because they didn’t make the whole thing in the early days and they learned how to partner with people really well.And I think if Apple could have had a little more of that in its DNA, it would have served it extremely well. And I don’t think Apple learned that until, you know, a few decades later."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Tech companies that reach monopoly scale (like Apple, Facebook, Amazon) should have to disclose all their agreements and honor a &#34;Most Favored Nation&#34; clause giving all companies the same pricing and access as the best negotiated agreement with any one company.  This is the most reasonable way I can think of without breaking them up to prevent them picking winners and losers as new opportunities emerge.  If you have a better plan I&#39;d be glad to hear it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem here are not the special deals, saurik commented he cut special deals in the Cydia store occasionally the last time this topic came up. The problem is that there is no alternative to Apple when it comes to publishing software and content on the iPhone and that makes these kind of deals unfair."</p>

Most comments here seem to be referring to a strawman version of the study.Abstract:&gt; We investigate what data iOS on an iPhone shares with Apple and what data Google Android on a Pixel phone shares with Google. We find that even when minimally configured and the handset is idle both iOS and Google Android share data with Apple/Google on average every 4.5 mins. The phone IMEI, hardware serial number, SIM serial number and IMSI, handset phone number etc are shared with Apple and Google. Both iOS and Google Android transmit telemetry, despite the user explicitly opting out of this. When a SIM is inserted both iOS and Google Android send details to Apple/Google. iOS sends the MAC addresses of nearby devices, e.g. other handsets and the home gateway, to Apple together with their GPS location. Users have no opt out from this and currently there are few, if any, realistic options for preventing this data sharing.That is the extent of the data sharing unless the user allows more."</p>

This assumes no use of iCloud, which would siphon much more data than described in this article.  It&#39;s also necessary to disable Siri on-device search (e.g. &#34;Learn from this app&#34;) and Spotlight indexing of in-app content (per-app setting for &#34;Show app in Search&#34;), including E2E encrypted messengers like Signal and Wire.For phones, the only mitigation is a lifestyle change to switch from always-reachable to scheduled availability windows or the always-async workflows of pre-mobile computing.  A faraday bag can deny realtime telemetry, even if it&#39;s cached for relay when connectivity returns."</p>
