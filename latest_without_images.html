								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In my experience, the output from GPT-3, DALL-E, et al is similar to what you get from googling the prompt and stitching together snippets from the top results. These transformers are trained on &#34;what was visible to google&#34;, which provides the limitation on their utility.I think of the value proposition of GPT-X as &#34;what would you do with a team of hundreds of people who can solve arbitrary problems only by googling them?&#34;. And honestly, not a lot of productive applications come to mind.This is basically the description of a modern content farm. You give N people a topic, ie &#34;dating advice&#34;, and they&#39;ll use google to put together different ideas, sentences and paragraphs to produce dozens of articles per day. You could also write very basic code with this, similar to googling a code snippet and combining the results from the first several stackoverflow pages that come up (which, incidentally, is how I program now). After a few more versions, you could probably use GPT to produce fiction that matches the quality of the average self published ebook. And DALL-E can come up with novel images in the same way that a graphic designer can visually merge the google image results for a given query.One limitation of this theoretical &#34;team of automated googlers&#34; is that what they search for content is cached on the date of the last GPT model update. Right now the big news story is the Jan 6th, 20201 insurrection at the US Capitol. GPT-3 can produce infinite bad articles about politics, but won&#39;t be able to say anything about current events in real time.I generally think that GPT-3 is awesome, and it&#39;s a damn shame that &#34;Open&#34;AI couldn&#39;t find a way to actually be open. At this point, it seems like a very interesting technology that is still in desperate need of a Killer App"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The intention behind it is pretty good. Best of luck to them.I wonder if I can donate computing power to this remotely. Like the old SETI or protein folding things. Use idle CPU to calculate for the network. Otherwise the estimates I have seen on how much it would take to train these models are enormous."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Serious question: is there a warez scene for trained models yet?(I don&#39;t know how the model is accessed - are users of mainline GPT-3 given a .pb and a stack of NDAs, or do they have to access it through access-controlled API?)Wherever data is desired by many but held by a few, a pirate crew inevitably emerges."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"HR is not your friend and your company is not your family.Regardless of intent there are commercial realities that exist within the context of a company that may never be present in a non-work relationship. This has varying degrees of impact on the nature of the relationship itself and may not present itself until you are at your most vulnerable.I find that a collegial environment with shared goals and responsibilities can be equally rewarding as non-work relationships even if we all have some level of underlying self-interest at heart. Our day-to-day interactions can also be made more pleasant if we are not constantly reminded of the at times competitive, zero-sum, structure of professional engagements.At a team level your colleagues may be your friends but one shouldn&#39;t conflate professional relationships with personal ones."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really don&#39;t enjoy the tone here. The derision with which it speaks about managers, like they are either evil or incompetent, is unfair in my experience.(my) Managers are just people. They have a task, they do their best to get that task done. Sometimes they decisions that seem bad to me. Often that is because I misunderstand their goals. Sometimes, it is because I know something they don&#39;t, and something they couldn&#39;t verify if I told them. And other times, they just made a mistake, or weren&#39;t told the relevant information by me or others.Indeed, sometimes their goals are somewhat self serving. But often it just has to do with wider business goals than what I am working at. I am grateful for them keeping an eye on those. Leaving me to worry less about the biggest of pictures. That however, doesn&#39;t mean I should just bog down on the small picture of my work, and deem everything that seems bad in that context as stupid."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Performance reviews are a joke because almost nobody knows how to measure anyone else&#39;s effectiveness. They are just a continuation of the same popularity contests you thought you left behind from middle school, high school, and maybe even your college/university days.This has a bit of truth. In my experience climbing up the ladder is so disconnected from actual reality. There’s quite a bit of a buddy buddy / quid pro quo system that goes on when it comes to promos.There are people who do the actual work and take it 99%, and others who stitch the last 1% and take credit for all of it. Our Industry loves rewarding for features over things that customers actually care about. I’ve seen many feature promos in my life. One year later we’d have to kill the whole feature because it’s not worth the maintenance cost.One of my managers believed folks who write python and JS are not real programmers, C and go programmers faced hard problems therefore they are more real. There was also the unconscious bias that women can’t lead projects so opportunities weren’t given to them. Over time women kept leaving. Over time really stellar frontend engineers kept on leaving.It also baffles me how much energy is spent on hiring people, vs mentoring and fostering them so they grow and are promoted."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The issue with estimates are expectations. While nobody acknowledges it, you&#39;re not actually asked for an estimate, you&#39;re being asked for a quote.The difference is when you&#39;re asked for a quote, you&#39;re asked how much you will be charging, with the expectations that you&#39;ll be willing to eat into your own margins to give a lower quote. That&#39;s why it&#39;s a negotiation, where you negotiate how much extra effort, time and headcount you&#39;re willing to give, how much tech dept you&#39;re willing to take, etc., for the privilege of getting their business.If you see it for what it really is, you&#39;ll see that it works pretty well actually. The business gets more out of you for less to them. It was never about having an accurate timeline or helping with planning or prioritizing, and always about negotiating a better contract with the dev team.Now keep in mind that the &#34;business&#34; in this case is a person who need to report that through their amazing prowess of administration and management, they personally managed to get X feature out during their last review cycle at Y cost with impact Z. This person will not need to deal with developer satisfaction, retention and performance. They will not need to deal with the impact the lower margins they pushed for had on the next feature delivery, or the continued maintainance of the systems. And if the dev team had to lower the quality too much in order to meet the quote they put out, that will be 100% their fault, the &#34;business&#34; will know not to use them for their next contract, or they&#39;ll expect the dev team to take on fixing all the issues at their own expense once more."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s unfortunate that this HN thread has been reduced to the generic discussion about software estimates when the article is specifically talking about research done on the topic of software estimates.According to the article, proper research remains a struggle due to outdated datasets from before modern agile methodologies, and that the modern datasets from industry are hard if not impossible to gather.If industry is truly interested in improving software development and estimation, their data should be anonymized and made available to researchers for analysis."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If someone can conclusively teach inexperienced programmers good approach to estimates (methodology) + help embed this into sales process of a software house-type company, I know some folks who&#39;d love to have this :)My own experience has been this: people make estimates, client has expectations based on some variant of those, and something later happens but so much change is introduced during the actual software development, that there seems to be no sane way to compare what happened with original estimates. (new features, changed features, lots of new information, market shifts/product vision shifts, quality assumptions change, etc. etc.)But at that point nobody cares! People go on with further projects, and no data is ever collected.Nobody learns.When f*ckups happen, i.e. a gross over- or under-estimate, this is often not shared with the broader organization (ashamed/afraid sales people/PMs/devs say nothing/hide it/sugarcoat it). Client walks away.Sometimes project is severly underestimated but usually not just because of the software part. Again, no decoupling and estimation of contributing factors is done.It&#39;s insane."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Trying to code and listening to music falls under cognitive functions. Naming a variable while listening to your favorite songs&#39; lyrics may result in cognitive overload. You are more likely to name a variable after the singers/songs name than what the variable is supposed to reflect (true story).This point in the article lost me pretty quickly. My flow state is drastically improved by music, and I have never ever named a variable after the song name or song artist I&#39;m listening to in my life.Edit: Nor have I ever seen a variable named after a song name or artist.Edit2: NotoriousViewController. TheWeekndTimer. RedHotChiliPointers. Now I want to name my variables like this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Rarely have I read an article with such a perfect balance between a premise I agree with an examples I do not. But I think this illustrates something important: what constitutes a context switch is not universal. It depends on what parts of a task you need to think about.In the kitchen, from long practice, I do not have to think about prep, technique, or washing up. There are no decisions I need to make for those tasks. They take very little attention. This frees me to spend my focus on the more abstract goals of what I want to cook, and for me it is not a context switch to wash a bowl while an onion is sauteeing. I can certainly cook while keeping the kitchen clean more efficiently than I could cook and then clean it. But when I was first cooking, it was a context switch to go from chopping an onion to chopping a carrot. Both tasks required my attention and focus."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve recently been assigned a course to teach where I need to mark lots of assignments. These assignments have 12 short answer questions and each student must do them.Slowest part about marking these is having to context switch for each question. So I&#39;d mark Q1 , then Q2 etc for one assignment, then go over to the next one and start back at Q1.I figured this was super inefficient since I needed to have the answer and context of the question in my mind and keep switching.So I wrote a program to parse all of the questions from all of the reports and present them to me in question batches. So now I see all of Q1 one after the other for each student&#39;s and mark those. Then once all of the Q1&#39;s are done, I mark all the Q2&#39;s. After all the marking is done, I run that through another program that then formats that data to each student so it&#39;s back onto their individual report plus any comments or deductions.I find that apart from saving the time to have to open tonnes of docx files, now it takes maybe 5 mins to mark everything."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"That was a fun read. I wish the author mentioned how much he was trying to sell the service for. It could have been $59 a month or $599 a month and with doctors you could potentially expect the same answer.I&#39;m not a psychologist but some of the author&#39;s quoted text came off extremely demeaning in written form. If the author happens to read this, did you really say those things directly to them?For example, Susan (psychologist) was quoted as saying:&gt; &#34;Oh sure! I mean, I think in many cases I&#39;ll just prescribe what I normally do, since I&#39;m comfortable with it. But you know it&#39;s possible that sometimes I&#39;ll prescribe something different, based on your metastudies.&#34;To which you replied:&gt; &#34;And that isn&#39;t worth something? Prescribing better treatments?&#34;Imagine walking into the office of someone who spent the last ~10 years at school and then potentially 20 years practicing their craft as a successful psychologist and then you waltz in and tell them what they prescribe is wrong and your automated treatment plan is better."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article&#39;s thesis seems to be that medical professionals are not incentized to provide the best interventions, and as a result, wouldn&#39;t pay for this service. However, what the author fails to mention is the competitors in this space that are successful, such as Up To Date, which provides really high-quality research trial data: https://www.uptodate.com/homeRather than building a product that informs medical professionals about effective interventions, I wonder if the creator would have had more success if he deeply explored what sources of information these medical professionals pay for now - do they pay for anything at all, such as UpToDate, and don&#39;t want to pay this because it&#39;s an additional expense? If the creator found which sources people are using, the creator could sell this database as a feature for these partners and widely disseminate this data through partner channels rather than creating a competing source of information. It seems to be a case of this being a good instance of a B2B2C model, where selling this service to other businesses that sell directly to medical professionals could be more viable than trying to sell directly to them.Alternatively, if the creator wanted to sell to patients, rather than medical professionals, the blueprint here is all of the consumer reports companies, such as Wirecutter, which is one of the New York Times&#39;s most popular services. Here, again, a &#34;Wirecutter for medical interventions&#34; could be quite successful, and you could sell this service to media companies that provide consumer reports as a service that would bolster these companies.It&#39;s bad the creator wasn&#39;t able to find traction, as getting more medical data into the hands of consumers could have a huge postive impact over time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember reading this the last time and it was posted and I still think the core failure is that the author didn&#39;t actually recognize the issue he was solving. He thought the problem was choosing the most effective medicine when the real problem was decision fatigue looking at endless shelves of things that all seem to do the same thing. Those two problems sort of look the same, but the latter cannot be resolved by selling the tool to doctors in their offices.The tool should have been designed (IMO) as a consumer tool, either a kiosk at CVS/Walgreens/pharmacies to assist with OTC med selection or possibly as a website with ads/referrals. I would absolutely choose a pharmacy over another as a result of them having something to help through that process, especially when I have a headache."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was a foster kid for 11 years. My social worker and foster parents were likely the only reason I am still here. My social worker would visit his children weekly-- even on weekends and did whatever it took for us. Still, he was just one man. I still talk to him regularly. During one discussion, I asked him about the other kids that I remembered. There were only two of us left.
I think people forget about the trauma foster kids deal with. First, the reason kids went into care. Second, the separation of the kid from their families. My experiences showed me that this trauma, combined with an institutional care system does not equip most kids to function in society."</p>

All on drugs, homeless, many in prison, spent time there.

Literally Pulling her drunk biological dad out of a ditch, to realize that they were dragging her down.She does aight these days.Foster kids can be helped, but  you really need multiple strong families or support groups dedicated to the task.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think something else that would be of interest would be doing this for drug prescriptions: compare the cost that my employer, the NHS, pay for a compound and those that Americans pay for the exact same compound. This is easy on my end at least -- prices and prescription guidance are released in the BNF / British National Formulary annually and are all made available in public. I have never understood the US system of &#34;co-pays&#34; and found the whole thing very confusing.For a few &#34;popular&#34; random examples that I think HN might have heard of: one branded Epi-Pen is £26.45; Naproxen (the NSAID painkiller) is £4.29 / 56 pack; and omeprazole (PPI used to treat gastric reflux) is £0.84 / 28 pack.A more expensive example might be the cystic fibrosis &#34;designer drugs&#34; lumacaftor with ivacaftor -- 112 tablets are £8000 (to be prescribed by a specialist, if the patient has the genotype to respond to it -- a total annual cost of about £26k). The US equivalent is $379,780 [1].(NB: The price you pay as a British patient is usually £0, unless you are a working-aged and working English person -- at which point it is £9.15 per item [independent of its cost] or a fixed &#34;all you can eat&#34; prepayment certificate that works out at about £8.83/month -- which is what I have.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Careful abusing these tricks. Over 10 years ago I decided to implement an RC4 (arcfour) cypher to generate pseudorandom noise for a test program.The algorithm looks like (from wikipedia):  i := 0
  j := 0
  while GeneratingOutput:
    i := (i + 1) mod 256
    j := (j + S[i]) mod 256
    swap values of S[i] and S[j]
    K := S[(S[i] + S[j]) mod 256]
    output K
  endwhile

Being a smartass 1337 coder (and declaring intermediate variables always being a bit of a bother in C89) in my implementation I decided to implement the swap using the xor trick:   s[i] ^= s[j];
   s[j] ^= s[i];
   s[i] ^= s[j];

I then ran a few basic test vectors, everything seems to work fine.A little while later I noticed that the output of the cypher was weird, the longer it ran the more zeroes I would get, eventually getting only zeroes.The keen reader will already have spotted the problem: whenever i and j happen to be equal instead of doing nothing the code sets the entry to 0 (since x ^ x == 0 for any x).And that&#39;s the story of how I never used this trick ever again.In general it&#39;s always better to write clear, concise code and let the compiler optimize it. If it turns that the code is performance critical and the compiler doesn&#39;t do a good enough job then you can see if the smart solution is worth it.And if you fail an interview because the interviewer expected you to know how to find a duplicate in an integer list by using xor then you probably dodged a bullet anyway. What a silly trivia question."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A fun party trick not mentioned here is reducing storage in a doubly linked-ish list:  Normally each node stores 2 pointers:  struct Node {void * prev;void * next}The trick is to use only 1 &#39;pointer&#39;, storing prev XOR next:  struct Node {void* xored;}While traversing, you remember not only the current position, but also where you came from.  So forward traversal goes: next= current.xored XOR previous.  Backwards also works: Node 
 * previous=(Node * )current.xored XOR (Node * ) next.The first and last node can use 0 as previous or next node, or you make a circular list.  You do have to store a pointer to the first and last node, as usual.I&#39;ve never seen this used in the real world, which is probably a good thing.  It also plays hell with garbage collectors like Boehm, as they can&#39;t derive the 2 used adresses.UPDATE: And of course wikipedia knows everything: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_linked_list"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As mentioned in this article, x ^ x == 0. Fun fact, this is frequently used by compilers as a &#34;cheap&#34; way to zero out a register.In addition, there are comparatively few cases in programming where we XOR. Sure, it happens in things like games quite a lot, but the main use is actually _cryptography_.Between these two facts (more like hints really), I managed to reverse engineer the bulk of a piece of malware I was given to analyse in a an internship. I was handed the malware, a copy of IDA Pro, and given a few days to see what I could find. All I could remember when presented with a wall of hex encoded machine code were the hints above. I looked for XORs of different values, assumed it was crypto, and extrapolated from there. Found a routine happening three times in quick succession and guessed it was triple-DES. Then I guessed that writing your own 3DES from scratch was unlikely, so googled for crypto libraries and happened to find one that nearly matched (I think an earlier/unmodified version), and worked my way up tagging the operations until I got to the purpose, exfiltrating various registry keys and browser history to [somewhere].It was a fun exercise, and therefore these facts will stay with me for far longer than they are accurate I&#39;m sure!"</p>

However it looks infinitely more simple and respectful of the eye integrity than current keratoprosthesis, and, if it really acts like a scaffold for native corneal cells and allows a colonization and the obtention of a satisfying corneal surface, it could be a game changer.

country) of corneal graft indications originates from pathologies coming from the inner layer of the cornea (corneal endothelium). Posterior lamellar graft (DMEK) allows today to change only the thin cellular layer which is pathological, with an usually quick recovery. Even the best performing keratoprosthesis won&#39;t replace this procedure, because we care to preserve the eye&#39;s integrity as much as we can.It is interesting to remember that corneal transplantation is a very special topic because the cornea is not vascularized, meaning less rejection. There still is, of course, but the outcomes as usually good. Keratoprosthesis are today indicated when previous grafts where rejected, when the other structures of the eye are healthy, and when the vision is extremely low. This allows to gain a few years of very low vision before, usually, losing the eye due to infection or high ocular pressure.The technology presented has the potential:
- to replace current keratoprosthesis and lower the threshold to decide to perform the procedure : yes, almost sure if the device is well-tolerated
- to replace perforating keratoplasty (full corneal replacement, unfrequent today) where the cornea is damaged in its entirety: maybe, highly uncertain for the moment. That would be an incredible step forward, a revolution in our practice.
- to replace anterior lamellar keratoplasty, where the anterior wall of the cornea is replaced : highly unlikely
- to replace posterior lamellar keratoplasty, where the cornea lacks transparency because of inner layer cellular dysfunction: almost impossible.I would also like to raise awareness on the topic of eye rubbing. The eye surgeon community progressively discovers the highly harmful consequences of vigorous and daily eye rubbing. A few teams (mine, notably) even think that it is the single trigger for keratoconus. You will find a nice illustrations of what a rubbed eye looks like in MRI I by googling &#34;don&#39;t rub your eye&#34; (this is me in the MRI ;-) and more explanations here : https://defeatkeratoconus.com/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am a recipient of a dual cornea transplant because of a condition called:   Fuch&#39;s Cornea Dystrophy.In 5-20 years I&#39;ll need it again.I&#39;m not in as bad of shape as the person in TFA.  I&#39;m damn lucky, but to be honest, I&#39;m miserable.  I remember what it was like to have lazer-sharp vision.  Now I can&#39;t work with electronics anymore.  My soldering iron is gathering dust.  I can&#39;t do 30% of my job.  Hell I have to assemble PC&#39;s by feel.  I can&#39;t see the writing on jumper connections, and spend a lot of time taking a picture of a thing and then magnifying the image just trying to figure out what goes where.It&#39;s a shame I am not a mechanic, bolts are much bigger then jumpers.  Working by feel is a fucking bitch."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Keratoconus sufferer here. This looks really cool. I&#39;m probably not going to need a corneal transplant at this point (since my condition appears to have stabilized with age) but I&#39;m definitely going to follow this. Even with correction the acuity in one of my eyes is very bad (like, can&#39;t read 16 point font at arm&#39;s length bad). Since this method takes the tissue rejection concern out of the equation I wonder if an &#34;elective&#34; corneal transplant might be an option down the road."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I gotta say, recent events have left me shaken to my core.  I thought I believed in free speech, to the point where I started a company dedicated to providing privacy and communications products that were not subject to control by any central authority (that turns out to be very hard!)  But watching the events of the past few years unfold I am no longer convinced that this would really make the world a better place.  I always thought that in the end cooler heads would prevail.  But we&#39;ve now done the experiment in a big way and the results seem overwhelmingly negative to me, to the point where they present a credible existential threat to civilization, on a par with climate change.Maybe someone here can talk me down from this new position.  But the evidence seems pretty overwhelming to me right now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;In 2010, DNA sequencing company Complete Genomics said that &#34;an interruption of services by Amazon Web Services, on whom we rely to deliver finished genomic data to our customers, would result in our customers not receiving their data on time.&#34;Gaming company Zynga warned about how its AWS foundation could quickly vanish when it filed the prospectus for its initial public offering in 2011.&#34;AWS may terminate the agreement without cause by providing 180 days prior written notice, and may terminate the agreement with 30 days prior written notice for cause, including any material default or breach of the agreement by us that we do not cure within the 30-day period,&#34; Zynga said.AWS can even terminate or suspend its agreement with a customer immediately under certain circumstances as it did in 2010 with Wikileaks, pointing to violations of AWS&#39; terms of service.&#34;Wonder if they can cancel their government contracts so easily.When people debate the merits of &#34;on-prem&#34; versus AWS on HN they rarely focus on the contract terms."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The thing is, you&#39;re always going to dependent on someone in the mainstream economic world if you want to have a web presence in North America. Even if you run your own servers, you&#39;re at the mercy of your hosting provider, your ISP, your DNS registrar, and even browser level things like Google Safe Browsing. Any of these can be major points of failure.So yeah, not using AWS would avoid being dependent on AWS, but you&#39;re going to depend on someone. In this sense, inclusion on the internet ultimately has a political dimension. I think that&#39;s just how it is — we live in a society with politics.(I&#39;m omitting commentary on Parler in particular because I have no sympathy for them in this or any other case.)"</p>
