								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s weird, I&#39;ve never considered myself a &#34;royalist&#34; but this news has affected me quite strongly. I just burst into tears unexpectedly on hearing this news and I don&#39;t quite understand why I feel so very sad. I guess I have grown up and lived my whole life (as a Brit) seeing and hearing the Queen, singing &#34;God save the Queen&#34; etc, and this news made me suddenly feel very old, very nostalgic, with the sense that all things pass in time, which makes my heart ache deeply."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; From commoners to heads of state, the queen has been known to smooth over embarrassing situations with a gentle quip or two. According to Blaikie, at a Buckingham Palace Garden Party, a woman was chatting with the queen when her cell phone embarrassingly started ringing. “You’d better answer that,” the queen told her. “It might be someone important.”&gt; Then there was the notorious incident that occurred during Charles and Madame de Gaulle’s state visit to Buckingham Palace. “Somebody asked Madame de Gaulle what she was most looking forward to in her retirement, which was imminent,” Blaikie writes. “Not speaking English much at all, she replied, ‘A penis.’ Consternation reigned for some time but it was the queen herself who came to the rescue. ‘Ah, happiness,’ she said.”https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2021/08/behind-queen-elizab..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I gotta admit that it is a bit weird to see british royalty being so heavily privileged that they even get special moderation treatment here on HN to protect them (?) from any negativity, or rather stop negativity about them.I&#39;m not keen on the idea of using this submission to flame the Queen, I obviously agree with the general rule of avoiding flamebait, what I mean is that other HN submissions on the deaths of people certainly didn&#39;t get this special treatment. It is also not at all enforced in both directions when looking at the obviously and comically over the top positive comments of low quality which contain no real substance.Edit: I used the wording &#34;stop negativity&#34; which might be misleading, since (as far as I am aware) no comments are being deleted. What I&#39;m talking about is moderation giving out a lot of warnings and keeping a closer watch on &#34;flamebait&#34; violations than I&#39;ve ever seen before on any submission."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Co-founder here, thanks for posting!Let me add some context:Many people add &#34;Reddit&#34; to their search queries to find authentic product reviews. We fine-tuned a BERT model to extract product mentions from over 4 million Reddit comments and posts with Named Entity Recognition (NER). The result is a list of the most popular products across many subreddits.No platform (including Reddit) is resistant to fake reviews and spam, but we think it&#39;s happening less frequently here for various reasons:- Redditors and other forum members are more interested in boosting their ego by showing their depth of knowledge on the topic (and correcting others on the topic), whereas corporate websites are more interested in raking profit by displaying (potentially) dishonest information.- Enthusiasts in subreddits are pretty good at spotting dishonest or fake content, which results in immediate downvotes. The whole karma system helps with trustworthiness.- Most subs are moderated well and spam gets removed quite quicklyThat being said, good fake reviews are technically almost impossible to detect, even with sophisticated network analysis of the reviewer&#39;s profile.Looria is still in Beta and we&#39;re working on improving our classification, summarization, and sentiment analysis. Let me know what you think!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is great, but the sentiment analysis is way off. Take these &#39;negative&#39; reviews for the Staples Hyken office chair:&gt; For months i was waiting for the Staples Hyken Mesh chair to drop to a good price. I pulled the trigger at 150ish, received it really fast, and set it up right away. I actually really love the chair, totally worth it. Perfect size for me and i can sit in in for 12+ hours just fine.&gt; I personally haven&#39;t found the thinks to be more comfortable than other chairs, I&#39;d rather go with a staples Hyken. Also, I see these go for much less. This looks like a V1. I sold one like that for $200 in Virginia.&gt; Hello all, I went on a deep plung into chairs over the weekend to find a good new chair (instead my junky racer/gaming chair that hurt my back and neck. I ended up finding the Staples Hyken and Staples Dexley. I went to store and tried them both out. I really liked the Hyken way more than the dexley....In the small number of negative reviews I&#39;ve looked at it seems like around half of them are categorised incorrectly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Do not trust product recommendations with a focus on affiliate links to Amazon.I only checked best Laptops. There wasn&#39;t a single Laptop which was not listed on Amazon. Case closed for me.However, I would really like to build this myself or have an open source alternative. Seems like a good idea to search for product recommendations like this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a great article but the best part is an off hand link to a book review of A Square Meal: A Culinary History of the Great Depression [1] which includes choice quotes like&gt; The writer George Jean Nathan claimed that before the 1920s, there existed only eight basic sandwich types: Swiss cheese, ham, sardine, liverwurst, egg, corned beef, roast beef, and tongue (yes). But by 1926, he “claimed that he had counted 946 different sandwich varieties stuffed with fillings such as watermelon and pimento, peanut butter, fried oyster, Bermuda onion and parsley, fruit salad, aspic of foie gras, spaghetti, red snapper roe, salmi of duck, bacon and fried egg, lettuce and tomato, spiced beef, chow-chow, pickled herring, asparagus tips, deep sea scallops, and so on ad infinitum.”I ordered it off Amazon right away only to immediately realize, to my horror, that the hardcover version I had chosen would not arrive until Saturday, a full fortnite after my aspic of foie gras, salmi of duck, and the $5 esp32-wroom dev kits that were part of the same order.What is this, the 1930s? Civilization is seriously going down the drain.[1] https://slimemoldtimemold.com/2022/04/04/book-review-a-squar..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This seems to be a major epidemic nowadays. I suspect that mechanistic, meaningless, purely mimetic pursuit of success has some pretty negative consequences on society. I suspect it might explain why so many people are interested in engaging in politics (or company politics) and zero-sum value extraction schemes instead of just adding value... They&#39;re not interested in the process at all, only in the outcome; financial success and social approval from authority figures.Many people are spending most of their lives doing stuff that they don&#39;t want to do, so of course they tend to look for shortcuts instead of trying to do things the right way. They have no intrinsic pride in the work they do; it&#39;s all about status, money and power. As people have become more free in their personal lives, on the career-side, we&#39;ve never been so constrained."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I would like to remind all the readers of this post that the united states government used to try to use LSD as a mind control drug.  They (IIRC it was the CIA) got into all sorts of shenanigans, dosing people (including CIA officers) without their consent.  Some people died and other people&#39;s lives were affected very negatively.  This was back in the 1950s- a time at which American had little or no conception of the concept of a &#34;psychedelic&#34; at all.Also, the Grateful Dead- whose parking lots were famous as large scale drug distribution sites- went from being counterculture to establishment in some ~25-30 years (the &#34;house band&#34; of the Clinton administration).We apparently live don&#39;t live in the strangest timeline, but it&#39;s definitely the trippiest one."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I learned back in 2008 that you never, ever attach a review to your real name.Any review, negative or neutral, runs the risk of damaging AirBnB, too many negative reviews might have the effect where AirBnB has to address the allegations, when it&#39;s much easier to just keep making money off of the bad host and ignoring negative experiences.I feel less likely to rent an AirBnB because of this article, simply by the fact that there is more than one negative review placed off-site.They don&#39;t want to deal with it; you are just a number, always have been.  DO NOT post negative reviews with your real name"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Though I didn&#39;t get banned, I had a similar experience with Airbnb recently.Booked a hotel. When we got there, it was abandoned! Host unresponsive. Clearly a scam. Reported it to Airbnb, and after some back and forth we got our money back (pretty quickly tbf). We naturally left a bad review, warning others.But then the host left us a bad review, despite never even meeting us or interacting with us in any way! We complained to Airbnb and of course, they &#34;saw nothing that violates their review policy&#34;... Diabolical.I am sure that that listing is probably still up."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is very similar to an Einstein quote:&#34;How strange is the lot of us mortals! Each of us is here for a brief sojourn; for what purpose he knows not, though he sometimes thinks he senses it. But without deeper reflection one knows from daily life that one exists for other people -- first of all for those upon whose smiles and well-being our own happiness is wholly dependent, and then for the many, unknown to us, to whose destinies we are bound by the ties of sympathy. A hundred times every day I remind myself that my inner and outer life are based on the labors of other men, living and dead, and that I must exert myself in order to give in the same measure as I have received and am still receiving...I have never looked upon ease and happiness as ends in themselves -- this critical basis I call the ideal of a pigsty. The ideals that have lighted my way, and time after time have given me new courage to face life cheerfully, have been Kindness, Beauty, and Truth. Without the sense of kinship with men of like mind, without the occupation with the objective world, the eternally unattainable in the field of art and scientific endeavors, life would have seemed empty to me. The trite objects of human efforts -- possessions, outward success, luxury -- have always seemed to me contemptible.My passionate sense of social justice and social responsibility has always contrasted oddly with my pronounced lack of need for direct contact with other human beings and human communities. I am truly a &#39;lone traveler&#39; and have never belonged to my country, my home, my friends, or even my immediate family, with my whole heart; in the face of all these ties, I have never lost a sense of distance and a need for solitude.&#34;-- Albert Einstein"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I approve (of both the release and the name).I see plenty of folks in here lamenting this release at all - in the hopes that the lack of it will push folks to Firefox.  It won&#39;t.  Those who care about this are already on Firefox, and frankly - Firefox isn&#39;t going to be the answer here (to be clear, this is opinion).I&#39;m also not thrilled at manifest v3, although for very different reasons than the adblocking limitations - I do lots of extension development, and I think the service worker approach taken is a bad mistake, forcing a distributed consensus model onto extensions without understanding the limitations that model imposes given how often extensions span multiple js contexts (across tabs/frames/content_scripts/windows/etc).Frankly - the environment is also still riddled with bugs... everything from docs that are wrong, to serious issues like a service worker not activating on simple, basic, required events (like chrome.action.onClicked, which is literally about as basic as it gets for extensions).Overall - my first impression of the manifest v3 upgrade was fairly neutral (it&#39;s not really solving any of my pain points, and it requires a lot of changes to support - but it seemed functional).  My opinion after porting several large extension projects to the space is... bad.  It&#39;s a bad set of changes as implemented in chromium right now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just so I understand correctly: This version removes *all* of the features that read or modify a user&#39;s data, so as to abide by the &#34;&#34;stated intent&#34;&#34; of MV3, rather than taking full advantage of all of the actual MV3 APIs? For example, this commit removes the &#34;scriplet injection&#34; and cosmetic filtering features, which AFAIK work perfectly fine on MV3?    if broad &#34;read/modify data&#34; permission is to be used, than there is not much point for an MV3 version over MV2, just use the MV2 version if you want to benefit all the features which can&#39;t be implemented without broad &#34;read/modify data&#34; permission.

Huh? But ... the &#34;read/modify data&#34; permission isn&#39;t getting removed by MV3? I don&#39;t understand how this follows. This is like saying &#34;Google implemented all of the same things we could do in MV2 in MV3, so we went ahead and removed all of the features anyway&#34;. I don&#39;t see any way to interpret this as anything except cutting off your own nose to spite the face of Google. It certainly doesn&#39;t seem to be a good faith attempt to reproduce the features of uBlock within the new technical framework of MV3."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"this is actually a clever way of hurting Googleif gorhill simply refused to release UBO for manifest V3 then someone would, and release something similar without the negative branding(plus eyeo crapware &#34;ad blocking&#34; extensions would gain market share)this way the users are being reminded that on Google&#39;s platform you&#39;re getting an inferior blocker"</p>
