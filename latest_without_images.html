								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Probably relevant for the HN crowd: there&#39;s a bunch of very geeky next gen fitness guys that keep up with the cutting edge of fitness research, and occasionally expand it themselves. If you&#39;re reading them, this kind of thing is being discussed for years, with new studies just moving the odds a bit in favor of the current hypothesis. Yes, they&#39;re very Bayesian, explicitly so.A few names/links, pick and mix as you will - they&#39;re all good:https://mennohenselmans.com/high-resistance-training-frequen...http://www.lookgreatnaked.com/fitness_articles_by_brad_schoe...https://macrofactorapp.com/articles/https://rpstrength.com/team-member/mike-israetel-phdProbably not the best links for each, but it&#39;s morning and I got work to do. Should be enough to get you started tho."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Incidentally I&#39;ve been doing this the past three months.I have an athletic background and I tend to go full-on workouts etc. But I decided to take it easy this summer, stopped training in general but I would set an alarm every 30 minutes and take short brakes (2-5mins) from work.In that time I do a few pushups and a couple exercises with the kettlebell. Nothing fancy or tiring, I stop just before I feel any type of resistance or &#34;burn&#34;.This happens 5-8 times a day. On weekends I do none of that.Of course It&#39;s anecdotal but my body has FOR SURE changed. It&#39;s like when I did two times a day workouts.Of course I&#39;ll go back doing full workouts because I enjoy them. But anybody who dislikes devoting big chunks of time just for workouts should definitely experiment with micro workouts."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A think a lot of the reigning wisdom in the fitness world is created by serious strength trainers, for serious strength trainers. They aren&#39;t wrong, and their advice will become useful to you if you also get seriously into strength training. But for people starting from neutral, the advice in this article is better than anything your most enthusiastic gym friends will tell you about protein intake or leg day or training to failure. Just workout specific muscles several times a week and you will get stronger and bigger muscles over a few months, regardless of diet."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I worked at a company where this was an issue at one point (granted this was one situation among a lot of employees).  A manager was pretty much dismissive of everything anyone of a lower caste did / wouldn&#39;t communicate with them effectively.HR absolutely struggled with the issue.  The HR folks tasked with dealing with discrimination issues largely had spent their time constructing company wide emails and classes that revolved around white folks discriminating against others / concepts of privilege, absolutely froze when faced with a discrimination issue outside that stereotype.Long story short legal eventually was the brave one and decided that yes it was discrimination and the manager in question was asked to move on.  The folks he refused to work with were compensated and their status in the company (pay scale, etc) was corrected.As one of my Indian college&#39;s observed about the manager in question &#34;If he was white this would have been dealt with sooner.&#34;Credit to my Indian coworkers who really pushed this issue with HR and made legal act in the end.  They wanted nothing to do with this kind of  behavior."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"”Recently, talking about the incident to the New Yorker, Tanuja said, &#34;A number of e-mails got sent to my VP, to the head of HR, to our chief diversity officer, to our CEO directly, claiming that the talk was creating a hostile workplace, that people felt unsafe, that the speaker was not qualified to speak on the topic and several other allegations.&#34; She also claimed that in tech companies, including Google, discrimination based on caste was rife and that tech company needed to talk about it.”Congratulations America. Now the ”felt unsafe”, ”hostile environment” etc. woke newspeak is used to protect the asses of the people who want to discriminate while victims get smoked out by these useless clowns that are called ”diversity officers”."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Out of curiosity, for Indians working in America, how hard is it to hide your caste or pretend to be of another caste altogether?Is this something that comes up in conversation among Indians? Do names tend to correlate to you caste? And if so, do people change them as a way of hiding their family caste?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My 2c (not exhaustive for what you want to do, probably):1) Get some statistics/probability basics. It&#39;s full of people (you can see a lot of analyses on Kaggle) that &#34;do machine learning&#34; but make very silly mistakes (e.g. turn categorical data into a float and use it as a continuous variable when training a model).2) take a look at traditional machine learning approaches. Nowadays you&#39;re swamped by DL (a lot of good suggestions on this thread, I won&#39;t chime in), and you miss the fact that, sometimes, a simple decision tree, or dimensionality reduction approaches (e.g. PCA or ICA) can yield an incredible value in a very short time on huge datasets.I had written a fairly short post about it when I finished my georgia tech path https://www.franzoni.eu/machine-learning-a-sound-primer/3) It can take a lot of time to become effective in ML, effective as in, what you _manually create_ is as effective as picking an existing trained model, fine tune it, and use it. This can be frustrating: low hanging fruits are pretty powerful and you don&#39;t need to understand a lot about ML algorithms to pick them up.4) Consider MOOCs or online classes. I took Georgia Tech OMSCS, I can vouch for it and some classes force you to be a data scientist and read papers as well, and you can have &#34;real world&#34; recognition and discuss with your peers, which is useful!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I work in ML - I might make 3 buckets for ML careers right now:1. ML/DL Researcher2. Data scientist - 20/80 engineering vs modelling3. ML Eng - 50/50 (or 70/30) engineering vs modellingPeople suggesting working in engineering to support ML are right that there&#39;s a lot of demand, but it&#39;s not what you&#39;re asking for.Becoming an ML/DL researcher working on novel techniques or new models will be hard without academic research experience. Few companies are big enough to support true research, and the ones that are have a very high bar even for people with PHDsWhat I call &#34;data scientists&#34; apply math/ML to real problems. The people I see here have a quantitative background like physics/math/CS. Often they have more general quantitative skills that go beyond ML. People like this will might work on things like fraud where an eng pipeline exists and small improvements in the model are valuable.There are more of these roles than &#34;true research&#34; and they exist at small companies because it&#39;s applied. You can get into this with demonstrated evidence in side projects + a convincing background, but professional education might be the most sure way.Finally - there&#39;s a lot of demand for engineers who can do both modeling and the requisite engineering. A model is a small part of what goes into a production ML feature - you need a data pipeline, automated retraining/prediction, a place to deploy the model, monitoring on eng stats + data stats, and the usual application backend/frontend to do something with the results.You might be able to get into this with some demonstrated experience in side projects assuming you&#39;re a SWE already, and depending on your standards for where you want to work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Can I suggest a longer, but (I think) better route?Try the Data/ML Engineer route. Instead of going directly into ML, try to work as a “supporter” of those doing ML. There’s a HUGE gap there, specially if you’re a good programmer.There are a lot of people in the “pure” ML space, people with science background, with phDs, etc.But there’s not enough people to support them: taking their models to producing, building their pipelines, etc.If you get into Data/ML engineer, you’ll be working with these people and learning from them.It’s a longer route for sure, but I think it can yield the highest success rate."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I can provide some details regarding the times things did break that I mentioned in the article.* In September 2014, X broke, and I created an `/etc/X11/Xwrapper.config` file with the lines `allowed_users = anybody` and `needs_root_rights = yes` to get it to work again. I don&#39;t remember and don&#39;t have notes on why that helped. It sure does sound like a pretty terrible hack. I don&#39;t have that Xwrapper.config file anymore, and I also don&#39;t know when I deleted it.* In June 2017, audio stopped working, but all I had to do was add my user to the `audio` group.* In May 2018, X broke a second time. This time I downgraded the `xorg-server-common` and `xorg-server` packages. A few weeks later, I ran another system upgrade, and this one went fine.These weren&#39;t the only problems, but they were the most disruptive. Generally, things like TrackPoint driver updates changing how the cursor responds or Firefox changing its UI have been far more annoying than Arch Linux issues :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I always reinstall from scratch although I could just Debian &#34;dist upgrade&#34;.  My thinking is this: if, ten years ago, I somehow missed a security patch or some 0-day owned my machine before it was patched, then I&#39;d potentially have been copying / dd&#39;ing / rsync&#39;ing a rootkit for ten years.By installing from scratch at every new stable (or unstable) release, I get rid of a lot of potential security issues.Now as an anecdote: ten years with the same install is nice but...  I&#39;ve got a dedicated server at OVH with 3400 days of uptime.  You read that correctly.  Nearly ten years of uptime.  Once in a while I give temporary ssh access to people here and there just so they can type &#34;uptime&#34; and see.  Kids: don&#39;t try this at home.  Yes, it&#39;s insecure (although there&#39;s a firewall and only the SSH port open).  No, it doesn&#39;t do much nor is it very useful.  But it&#39;s fun to think I own one of the computer in the world with the biggest uptime.I plan to kill it once it reaches ten years \o/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I stuck with Ubuntu (eventually Kubuntu) for many years because I thought it was the best for a no-fuss distro for folks who wanted things to just work (TM). I was afraid of things randomly breaking and interrupting my daily work. One day I eventually bit the bullet and installed Arch instead. The experience has been phenomenal, and if anything it feels more stable than Ubuntu. I was underestimating my own Linux knowledge, and it really isn&#39;t difficult to setup/configure at all if you have a reasonable understanding of how Linux works. The initial installation can be done by just following one of the many YouTube videos that break down the process step by step - you may even learn something if you don&#39;t already know it. I can&#39;t ever see myself going back."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So they went from scaled down Concorde configuration :https://www.airway.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Boom_Ov...to a very scaled down Boeing 2707-300 configuration :https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_2707(that tiny fin tho...). While reducing cruise speed to 1.7 mach.
I see no visible changes to deal with the sonic booms problem.
So operation would be like Concorde I suppose, subsonic (or hi-subsonic) over land and
Supersonic over ocean only. Unless the super-rich manage the regulation to change.EDIT : ah yes :) &#34;2x FASTER OVER WATER&#34; and &#34;20% FASTER OVER LAND&#34;...Also : Maybe good to remember that 18 airlines had once placed orders for Concorde, with only the 2 national carriers flying it in service eventually. And that The Boeing 2707 was ordered by 27 airlines before the program being canceled…"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Overture is being designed to carry 65 to 80 passengers at Mach 1.7 over water — or twice the speed of today’s fastest commercial aircraft — with a range of 4,250 nautical miles. Optimized for speed, safety and sustainability, Overture is also being designed to fly more than 600 routes around the world in as little as half the time. Flying from Miami to London in just under five hours and Los Angeles to Honolulu in three hours are among the many possibilities.Probably will be very expensive but it&#39;s exciting for future possibilities"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;American has paid a non-refundable deposit on the initial 20 aircraft.I guess that&#39;s not nothing given how these sorts of contracts usually give the big name brand company lots of outs if the speculative company goes bust, but by bragging about it without specifying the amount, I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s a low amount."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think the analysis has some good points, but the author is lacking a bit of networking skills, so I’m not sure how trustworthy this can be. Two yellow flags:* vpn gateway address can be different from public vpn exit address. What is the surprising part?* I don’t know what pings  your “uncloaked” public ip address, but still, when using a vpn, you’re using your own ip address to connect to the gateway. So, there’s no real leak - it would be a leak if some packets went  _through the vpn_ to 99.99.99.99, because an observer could spot the strange ip and determine it’s the uncloaked source address.Anyway: who can tell what an iphone or ipad can do?

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was developing VPN client for one of the popular VPN provider in the past for iOS and the solution was quite simple - enable on-demand VPN for 0.0.0.0/0In this case, iOS will always wait until connection to VPN is established before sending any packets out.Without on-demand, VPN may leak.If I remember correctly, leaks occurred mostly after waking from sleep but before the tunnel had chance to be set up. Or in similar situations. Anyway, on-demand option solved all of them."</p>
