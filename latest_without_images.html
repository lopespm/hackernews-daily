								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I may believe almost all of this is overblown and silly, as like a matter of cryptographic research, but I&#39;ll say that Matt Topic and Merrick Wayne are the real deal, legit the lawyers you want working on something like this, and if they&#39;re involved, presumably some good will come out of the whole thing.Matt Topic is probably best known as the FOIA attorney who got the Laquan McDonald videos released in Chicago; I&#39;ve been peripherally involved in some work he and Merrick Wayne did for a friend, in a pretty technical case that got fierce resistance from CPD, and those two were on point. Whatever else you&#39;d say about Bernstein here, he knows how to pick a FOIA lawyer.A maybe more useful way to say the same thing is: if Matt Topic and Merrick Wayne are filing this complaint, you should probably put your money on them having NIST dead-to-rights with the FOIA process stuff."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If anyone is curious, the courtlistener link for the lawsuit is here: https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/64872195/bernstein-v-na...(And somebody has already kindly uploaded the documents to RECAP, so it costs you nothing to access.)Aside: I really wish people would link to court documents whenever they talk about an ongoing lawsuit."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The same people tend to have trouble grasping that most of the vulnerabilities exploited and encouraged by NSA are also exploitable by the Chinese government. These people start with the assumption that Americans are the best at everything; ergo, we&#39;re also the best at espionage. If the Chinese government stole millions of personnel records from the U.S. government, records easily usable as a springboard for further attacks, this can&#39;t possibly be because the U.S. government made a policy decision to keep our computer systems &#34;weak enough to still permit an attack of some nature using very sophisticated (and expensive) techniques&#34;.I&#39;m not sure if I understand this part. I was under the impression that the OPM hack was a result of poor authn and authz controls, unrelated to cryptography. Was there a cryptography component sourced somewhere?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Please now also improve search results without quotes. When I query a b c (without quotes) I want results exclusively containing all 3 words, not just one or two of them. There&#39;s a reason I typed it.Next, remove content thieves like Pinterest entirely from the index.Next, invest in recency + relevancy over just page reputation. A huge amount of high value recent content is written but it keeps losing against much worse old content which only ranks because it&#39;s old. As the typical example: the 15 year old Stackoverflow jQuery answer.Invest in location awareness. Including location in your query gives laughable results.Find a way to down rank sites gaming particular categories with shady tactics."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is fascinating. Not because of the content of this article, but because it&#39;s the first glimpse behind the Google Search curtain that I&#39;ve ever seen in an official Google post. You rarely see details about search explained. Or maybe I&#39;m just ignorant.Even that bit about &#34;don&#39;t&#34; being turned into &#34;don t&#34; was interesting. Again, not because I was amazed in any way. More so because Search has been so mysterious for many years."</p>

I’m working from a hotel right now, so I can easily imagine it. Folding flat would offer protection from scratches in a bag/backpack and take less space. Would be hard pressed to fit a 17” portable monitor in my bag, but if it folds in half that’s more tenable!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think Musk&#39;s counterclaims are more interesting than Twitter&#39;s response. Here&#39;s the summary of the five counterclaims:* Twitter committed fraud by lying to the SEC about the mDAU numbers with the intent of inducing Musk to buy Twitter at an inflated price. No, really, this is the allegation (see paragraphs 202-206).* Count 2 is that Twitter committed [Texas fraud statute] by lying when it offered its shares. It&#39;s shotgun-pled, so I don&#39;t know which specific statements are supposed to be wrong, but I&#39;m imagining it&#39;s basically the previous count recast under a different statute.* Count 3 says that Twitter broke the contract by failing to provide information.* Count 4 says that Twitter broke the contract by instituting a hiring freeze. [not gonna fly, especially when Musk admitted that Twitter gave him warning of what it was doing and Musk didn&#39;t respond. Did I mention that Musk&#39;s answer admits far more than I would have expected?]* Count 5 is pretty please declare that Twitter lying about mDAUs is a materially adverse event that is cause to break the contract.I still can&#39;t get over the banana-pants insanity of the first count... arguing that Twitter lied about its numbers for years specifically so that someone would buy it at an inflated price?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; &#34;To the contrary, Musk forwent all due diligence—giving Twitter twenty-four hours to accept his take-it-or-leave-it offer before he would present it directly to Twitter&#39;s stockholders,&#34; Twitter wrote.Bot/spam account analysis is just trying to do PR spin. Musk has no legal standing to use any of that to back out of the merger.&gt; The five-day trial is now scheduled to begin on October 17So we will see about 2 more months of PR campaigns from Musk and Twitter about the case."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find it rather ridiculous and in bad faith that Musk is harping on the bot issue for 2 reasons.First, it wouldn&#39;t matter anyway. He signed away any and all rights to due diligence in the agreement.And secondly, it&#39;s completely impossible for any outside analysis to determine the number of active users on Twitter because most active Twitter users don&#39;t tweet or interact in anyway. They just read tweets and those users see ads, which makes them monetizable users."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m not terribly surprised. In my experience the calls for more housing from the wealthy and business class are disingenuous; more often really a call for more apartments to be built exclusively in neighbourhoods dominated by the poor and working class and a continued ban of apartments in the low density single family home areas that the wealthy business owning class live in.Often this is called the &#34;Grand Bargain,&#34; that new housing can be allowed, but only if it is constrained to a tiny area (which becomes increasingly dense), while the bulk of single family homes are left untouched.The challenge for voters is to discern between those that are calling for more housing that are genuine YIMBYs, that want to build more housing for everyone more equitably, everywhere in all neighbourhoods, and those like Andreessen, which merely want to continue on with Grand Bargain thinking, and want to continue the status quo by which the poors live as far as possible away from him."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fun fact: the town of Atherton is also singlehandedly responsible for delaying and almost derailing Caltrain&#39;s electrification project, because the electric poles needed would, and I quote, &#34;compromise the quaint character of our neighborhood&#34; (shock horror).https://www.almanacnews.com/news/2017/12/21/atherton-battlin...And of course: &#34;Other speakers protested the aesthetic and safety impacts of the taller, and heavier, poles, saying they would also reduce property values.&#34;The town also voted to close their own Caltrain station, because they clearly don&#39;t want the kind of riff-raff who use public transport there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve served on a city Planning Commission, and I can say categorically that you never truly know who someone is until the city tries to re-zone the property around their house.Being fair to Andreessen and his family, they likely bought their house knowing that the property was zoned single-family residential, as was the entire neighborhood, and that it&#39;s relatively difficult to change land use policy. That is, until the Legislature of the State of California decided it knew better than every incorporated city, and wrote a housing density law that superseded local zoning regulations.I&#39;ve always been surprised that tech billionaires don&#39;t spend money influencing State Senate/Assembly races. Maybe that will change."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Roomba / iRobot is years behind the Chinese companies. We just got an Ecovacs X1 Omni - a mopping vacuum bot with actual rotating mop scrubbers, AI vision obstacle avoidance, LIDAR mapping, and most importantly fully automated water fill &amp; mop pad cleaning at the base station. We fill a clean water tank &amp; empty the dirty one about once a week. Floors are spotless - huge difference from static cloth mopping bots.Meanwhile, iRobot still hadn’t figured out how to make an effective stand-alone mop bot, much less an auto fill station or combined bot that actually works. Roborock and Ecovacs products launch in China 6-12 months before their US launch. By the time Roomba has a decent mop bot, the X2 or X3 will probably be out offering integration with home plumbing to avoid any manual intervention for months at a time.EDIT: commenters are asking what works offline from Roborock / Ecovacs. For the self-cleaning-mop generation like the X1 Omni:- Roborock obstacle avoidance is local, but works better with cloud.- Roborock can be controlled by a local home automation server without internet access.- Ecovacs obstacle avoidance requires cloud.- Ecovacs control requires cloud.I remembered these stats from a Youtube video that I can&#39;t find; probably in my partner&#39;s history since we watched reviews on the TV together.I picked the X1 Omni over the Roborock because it has superior mopping performance on tile floors, but I think both would be good options. It seems like Roborock is more privacy compatible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I mean not trying to start a flame war, but everyone is
praising how great roborock is but the reality is, most of  Xiaomi/Roborock technology is stolen/reversed engineered from Neato. Chinese robot vacuum would not even be close to their current capabilities if it wasn’t for the LiDAR on the XV11. If you look at the tear down from the first couple gen, the PCB and components were exactly the same compared to Neatos. (I owned both Neato and Roborock vacuums)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wonder if Amazon actually cares about cleaning robots, or if they&#39;re after the data roomba collects? https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/28/16055590/roomba-wont-sell..."</p>

					<h3><a href="https://technicallychallenged.substack.com/p/my-favorite-iphone-feature-was-removed">My favorite iPhone feature was removed, long live its subpar replacement</a></h3>

					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32352186">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I had a feeling this was gonna be about 3D Touch just from seeing the title.It was definitely one of my favorite features, and Force Touch isn&#39;t a drop-in replacement.With 3D Touch anywhere on the keyboard, you could apply pressure to start moving the caret (text cursor) around, but what was even more useful was being able to apply a little bit more pressure to start selecting text with incredible precision.With Force Touch, you can long press on the space bar till you get haptic feedback, then you can move the caret around freely. However, if you want to select text, you need to use a second finger on the keyboard after you start moving the caret around, but honestly it&#39;s an absolute mess to use; try it out, I can guarantee you won&#39;t be able to select what you were planning on.However, as much as I miss it every time I fail to accurately select text on iOS, I don&#39;t mourn its loss. Force Touch is adequate. It&#39;s just not a replacement, and seems a shame it was probably removed to reduce costs and hardware complexity, all at the cost of regression."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yeah, missing this 3D Touch.The input experience (or AI supported typing) is getting worse and worse for me on the iPhone. Especially, if your are using different languages in parallel. For me it is my mother tongue German and my most second language English and sometimes using Spanish. In an (for me) unpredictable way, there are words replaced to &#34;correct&#34; typos. But, independent of the used keyboard language, which is completely ignored for this auto-correct, it replaces it with German word, when I write English and sometimes with English words when I type German. Then this forced touch was helpful to select the letters/word to re-write it correctly to make the sentence meaningful. But now, this whole selection process is completely broken (for me). Since the removal of force touch, when I try to go to a specific spot, it selects parts of the sentence in a completely (for me) unpredictable way. Then I have no chance to un-select anymore, so I have to replace the whole. The experience is getting worse and worse.I think peak iOS was in the past."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Maybe I’m in the minority here but I really did not like the feature and many people I tried to explain the feature to were confused that it existed.. “no no don’t tap the screen, you need to PUSH on the screen to make it do the action”.. and I would get a look like “huh?? Push on the screen? Why what’s that gonna do..” people saying pushing hard on the screen is intuitive seemed to live in a different bubble of people than I interacted with.."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This looks absolutely fantastic. If you&#39;re interested in the technical details currently available, check out the about page[0] on the official MoonRay site, or this presentation from SIGGRAPH 2017[1]. I&#39;m particularly excited for the HeatMap render pass, seems like a really practical way to identify what&#39;s bogging your scene down. Not to mention the gorgeous volumetric rendering this engine is capable of (see How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden Realm[2]).Really impressed that Dreamworks is making this move. They&#39;ve made some of my favorite films of all time (the Dragons franchise genuinely changed my life and is a major part of why I love filmmaking, film scores, and 3D rendering) and I&#39;m glad to see they&#39;re doing this.

One of said client is the government, and it is asking them to buy some very specific equipment, knowing fully well this equipment is only sold in Israel.However, the Emirates cannot trade with Israel, and refuse to pay for any equipment labelled as coming from this country. Calling one of the officials, they asked for a solution. They told them to ship everything first to the UK. There, they should unpack every single object, and package them again with different country labels. Once the box has passed custom, nobody will raise the topic about the equipment origin.And so this is what they do."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love the idea of this, and I disagree with others about the price being too high. If you&#39;re in the US/Canada/UK and planning to spend even a couple of hours per month using this to further your skills and career, then the value of your time investment will exceed your cash outlay on the subscription.That being said, I wonder whether you&#39;ve considered offering a student discount for bona fide students? You could do this via sites like Unidays or StudentBeans. You can rely on their process for verifying students, instead of just accepting anyone with an edu email address (which are sometimes available to alumni).I&#39;m sure some of the folks doing online CS degrees at WGU and Georgia Tech would be interested in this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Price point I feel is too high for specifically what it is offering.A general point I would make.In education: cost is a barrier of entry - a smaller ask might yield far more results from people in disadvantaged situations able to scrabble up ladder. A rising tide raises all ships.You are doing work creating the material and course work - I&#39;m not saying release stuff for free. but $80/mo is something to bat an eye at for a lot of people that would otherwise be interested in this.I would price it at $40-60, with maybe an intro month at $20. the $60 price point is a video game: which fits in my mind as roughly the value you seem to be offering per month. but I don&#39;t actually know how much time each course takes - thus the range from $40-60.that&#39;s just my two cents."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This looks very promising, I think it could be a great resource for companies that want to invest in training their developers, but don&#39;t have the resources to build a curriculum themselves.&gt; What new courses should we add?The courses you have already are good, but are quite low-level. To broaden the applicability perhaps you could also try something like &#34;build a REST API that matches this OpenAPI schema&#34; (getting persistence working properly could be an interesting challenge). Going further, I wonder if it&#39;s possible to do a course like &#34;build a web app that does X&#34; (Realworld or TODOMVC are possible values of X), using browser automation to test. This is probably very hard without manual review. (Scoped broadly enough, this could be solved with a server-rendered framework or a client-side framework.) Common engineering/craftsmanship problems here are authentication, persistence, navigation, performance tuning, perhaps log-wiring, etc.More generally, I&#39;m wondering if there is a good open-source option as a competitor / baseline comparison? As others have noted, Leetcode is one common source of study exercises, but it&#39;s quite annoying to work with as you need to submit code in the browser rather than using your IDE. I&#39;d love to see a repo with exhaustive test cases for the things you&#39;re building; for example low-level algorithmic exercises like &#34;exhaustive tests for binary search tree&#34; or higher-level &#34;build a git client&#34; like CodeCrafters offers. Being able to step-debug through failing test cases is always going to be more realistic training than the Leetcode workflow."</p>
