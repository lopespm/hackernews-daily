I did that with the free plan recently in CloudFlare in a similar situation and it worked perfectly (of course on a much smaller scale)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked on an ad-blocker a few months ago. I made the decision to have the filter-list files hosted on our own domain and CDN (similar to what Adguard  does with their  filters.adtidy.org).This was done for 2 reasons:1- Avoid scenarios like this where you ship code (extension  in this case) that is hard to update. Then make that code depend on external resources outside of your control.2- Leak our users&#39; IP addresses to each random hosting provider.So the solution was simple: Run a CRON once a day then host the files ourselves. Pretty happy with that decision now."</p>

Instagram is not of, and never will be of interest to me.Edit: 2nd suggestion / feature request: add ability to &#39;pin&#39; columns to a position.3rd suggestion / feature request: ability to add scoped google columns, I would love a column that has `site:stackoverflow.com` prefixed to all searches in the 2nd column."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very smooth!I&#39;d appreciate being able to create custom search profiles (like Brave Goggles).If I&#39;m searching for a famous person, I might want Wikipedia, Goodreads, Twitter, Instagram, [music streaming service(s)], Twitch, and YouTube results.If I&#39;m searching for medicine, I might want Wikipedia, PubChem, MedLinePlus, and Examine.com results.If I&#39;m searching for a question, I might want StackExchange, Reddit, Quora, and Consensus.app results.With my regular searches, I might prefer a different search engine than Google, a different microblogging website than Twitter, etc. Maybe I&#39;m boycotting Instagram and don&#39;t want those results to show at all?What sources does the news tab use? Maybe it&#39;s extremely biased? Let the user decide! Maybe I want different news source profiles (one for serious, less biased sources; one for satire; one for local news; etc.)?What about localization? FASS.se is a popular medical database in Sweden, so I&#39;d like for those results to be displayed in my medical search profile.It would also be cool if the results in the Google column automatically filtered out the results available in the other columns. I mean, since I already have the Wikipedia results in its own column, I don&#39;t need the Google column to hand me a Wikipedia link.I&#39;ll stick to Brave search for now, but it&#39;s a cool tool!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s very good (will definitely consider moving). Some user feedback:1) Dark Mode please2) Toggleable websites; I saw that the websites I was seeing were black-circles in the panel below the search box. I instinctively tried to click on youtube to not see youtube box. It would also be nice to have a global panel where users can choose if they never want to see a certain website.But these^ are just me being super picky. Overall, a great UX."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Switching every individual and organization I can to Brave in the buildup to Manifest V3 launching.Encouraging 3rd party patching tools to adopt it or the organizations I work with will leave them as a client.Chocolatey already supports Brave in its packages for Windows.Feels a lot like the days when Chrome came out and I championed it over Internet explorer and Firefox. Yeah, we all make mistakes, sorry Firefox.Anyway, Brave seems like a great option to keep extensions alive that can actually block ads/trackers.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This should be required reading for this article:https://profmattstrassler.com/2022/09/09/protons-and-charm-q...Virtual particles do not necessarily have an invariant mass. That&#39;s why you can find examples of typically huge particles inside protons.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"As I understand it, the reason Feynman diagrams in quantum electrodynamics (where the primary entities are electrons and photons) can be used to calculate properties very accurately is that the electromagnetic coupling constant (1/137) results in the higher-order terms in a series eventually vanishing away to nothing, while with the strong force the coupling constant is &gt;= 1, so the higher-order terms have to be included, leading to things like infinities (or at the very least, ratios of very large quantities with correspondingly large uncertainties).The strong force is a bit confusing, as it binds boths quarks with the proton and neutron, as well as binding the neutrons and protons into atomic nuclei, over short ranges (accounting for the upper size limit / stability limit of the largest nuclei).  Mesons are the force-carrying entity that bind the neutrons and protons together, but gluons are the force-carrying entity that bind the quarks together, as per this wiki article:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_interactionIs it the case that theoretical strong-force calculations have just hit a dead-end and there&#39;s no way out in sight, due to the coupling constant issue?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t disagree with any points but they missed a big one.  If at all possible, include some application (or attempt at a globally) unique error code on each of your errors - i.e. YCOM-HN-9021.  When you provide a clearly googleable string you can help your users independently resolve the issue and you can also set up google alerts on the string - if you roll out a new feature that took 3 months to develop and a week later google tells you that YCOM-HN-9021 is up 9000% you probably broke something.  If at all possible make yourself open to client communication but most users won&#39;t reach out about an error - users have very low trust in customer care in the modern world (and it is, honestly, often more trouble than it&#39;s worth) and are more likely to turn to reddit/technical forums for a solution.  It is extremely advantageous to try and track these users."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ll add a few for developer-oriented messages.* Say what the program was trying to do.* Make the message unique and searchable.* Make it detailed.* FFS, include the filename or whatever else the program is having trouble with.* If possible, include the source code location.* If possible, include useful contextual information.* Quote strings. Once in a while, some unexpected whitespace sneaks in somewhere and this can be hard to figure out.Eg, don&#39;t just abort with &#34;Open failed: NOT_FOUND&#34;. Abort with &#34;job.c:2105 Failed to open job description file &#39;/var/spool/jobs/125.json&#39; when processing job #5 for user &#39;alice&#39;: NOT_FOUND&#34;.This way I don&#39;t have to strace the damn thing to try and figure out what&#39;s it looking for, and know which user it was for, so I don&#39;t have to dig around and try and figure out which entry in the database might contain the wrong information.Also, context-free, generic error messages are awful. A large enough codebase may be impossible to search for some very common keywords.If possible, googleable error codes are great to have, but they shouldn&#39;t replace the error message.  It&#39;s ideal if you can search the source code and instantly find where the error message originates."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"20 years ago I was working on Acrobat at Adobe. I was mostly the &#34;Windows guy&#34; but also worked and tested on the Mac.When I tried to install Acrobat on my Mac, I got this message:&#34;Your hard disk is too small&#34;My what is too small?!Later, on Windows I got this unexpected popup:&#34;You are not here&#34;WTF?I searched the code for that string and found it in a function named &#34;CantHappen()&#34;. This function was called in numerous places where the programmer thought there was no possible way for the code to get to that place. But of course CantHappen() did happen.As I looked through the code I found many other messages that were bizarre and incomprehensible and sometimes downright offensive.So I started a project to go through all our messages and make them more clear and informative - and even better, when possible to not have the message at all but just take care of the situation.The underlying cause of these bad messages was twofold:1. Programmers never got raises for writing great error messages or finding ways to avoid them in the first place. We were just rated on how much work we got done.2. We did have a product designer who was supposed to specify all user-facing messages. But the designer mainly considered the &#34;happy path&#34; and didn&#39;t think about edge cases. It was left to developers working under time pressure to handle those."</p>

					<h3><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33256168">Ask HN: Am I getting older or did typing on the iPhone become unbearable?</a></h3>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When the iPhone launched, Apple talked a lot about how the typing system worked.What I remember is that it sounded like pretty simple lookups. As you typed, the software compared your word to, essentially, a weighted dictionary to guess what you were going to type next.If you typed “b” it was flummoxed. But if you typed “behav” it knew the next letter was almost certainly going to be “e” or “i” (for behavior). It may have been more complicated than that, but probably not much. It was 2007 and the phone CPU was not powerful.One interesting thing I remember is that they said the phone enlarged the touch targets for highly predicted next letters. For example it would be easier to type an “e” than a “w” after you had typed “behav”, because the tap boundary expanded around the “e”. Cool stuff!And if you did type behavw and hit space, it would autocorrect to behave.At some point I recall Apple announcing that they had switched autocorrect to a full machine learning implementation. Rather than a simple deterministic look-up, it was trained on a huge corpus of text, and reads the whole chunk of what you’ve written so far to make predictions. Everyone does this now, it’s how they deliver the (incredibly annoying and stupid IMO) one-tap suggestions for email and text replies. “Thanks!” “Noted.” “I’ll get right on that.”In my memory, that’s when typing got a lot more annoying on iPhones. The quality of suggestions went either down or weirdo or both. For example it just tried to sub-in “Quaker” for “quality” in the previous sentence. Why??"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, thank you for posting this, I was just thinking this!Most people here focus on autocorrect, which isn&#39;t such a big problem for me since I&#39;m used to having it off.But what the hell is wrong with the cursor placement? It is so incredibly broken, it has a mind of its own, and never goes to where I mean to put it.Simply tapping on text puts it in the wrong places, but holding and dragging cursor or holding and dragging on the spacebar to move it also works terribly, somehow it never does what I need it to.Selecting text is just as terrible.It&#39;s also impossible to put the cursor in the middle of a word. WHY NOT? Just put the cursor where I tap! It is so easy to do on Android.I find it much easier to type and move cursor on my Galaxy S9 than on my iPad mini, despite the iPad having a much bigger screen."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been using iPhone &gt;10 years and cannot agree more. One example: from iOS 7 (that flat UI), I began to make much more frequent typos than ever before. Before that, I didn&#39;t make much typo before the update even without looking at the keyboard but not anymore after the update. What I heard is that Apple did extensive studies on usability of virtual keyboard when it&#39;s launching iPhone and as a result keyboard visual on the screen was intentionally off from the actual layout based on actual typing patterns. And for some reason it seems they scrapped that idea, or at least changed it significantly. Don&#39;t know why. Maybe I&#39;m an outlier and everyone else is happier with the change.But this is just one example; almost every 2~3 years, I&#39;ve experienced a noticeable level of degradation of my typing accuracy, though not as much as the iOS 7 change. I wonder if there&#39;s anyone else whose experience matches to mine."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This advice is going to be hated by a lot of people but.. care less.You’re in an industry that values your skills and seems to always have demand. Whether or not that’s true in the future, it certainly is today, so the best thing you can do is put yourself first and worry less about work
as a whole. Especially if it’s not your own company.Spend more time on you, on activities with friends and family, on hobbies. If you don’t have particularly healthy hobbies, maybe start some.  Getting away from your work more and more will make it all the more bearable.These days work is close to the bottom of my list of concerns, which sounds really bad - BUT - I find I’m more productive than I’ve been in years because I’m not worrying if something takes longer than expected or is bigger than I realised. I can just enjoy the problem solving and shipping without the stress.If you’re burned out this badly I’d suggest it’s your soul’s way of telling yourself “hey this isn’t working for me”. As someone who has been to some pretty messed up depths with the anxiety monster, I’d heed that voice. Life isn’t long enough to stay stuck in a rut like this for any amount of time at all."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I found that just moving teams and dropping a load of baggage made a huge difference and a huge improvement.I also found that regular physical exercise outside (running for me) is a game changer and totally allows your brain to disconnect.Finally, don&#39;t guilt trip yourself on your free time.  There is nothing you &#34;should&#34; be doing on your spare time.  Want to code?  Fine.  But do you really?  Want to just veg out and watch Netflix?  Also fine.  Want to do some &#34;junk food&#34; gaming?  Do it. Hang out with friends family and loved ones?  I encourage that. Don&#39;t pressure yourself about open source projects or side hustles etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Can you afford a sabbatical?The term has roots in &#34;seven&#34;, just like Sabbath, so with 14 years in the industry, you&#39;ve skipped one.I think a solid half-year off every seven to ten years is an excellent practice for intellectually demanding labor.What makes it a sabbatical is that it&#39;s a change of pace which furthers your career. I&#39;d love to take a sabbatical and just work on building stuff, personally: from soldering, to designing boards, probing them, writing firmware, I&#39;m a rank amateur, and I&#39;d love to level up for awhile, while free of the burden of justifying my salary in the process.It could be painting, there&#39;s a popular author who wrote a book about the connection between painting and hacking, can&#39;t remember his name but his stuff gets posted here all the time.What it isn&#39;t, is a vacation, or a convalescence. It sounds like you haven&#39;t hit &#34;can&#39;t work&#34;, just &#34;sucks to work&#34;, which is a blessing.If you can&#39;t afford it, that&#39;s understandable, there are ways to get some of the benefit from a new job, but &#34;relieved of the burden of delivering value&#34; is an important factor.I&#39;ve known people who pushed &#34;sucks to work&#34; until it became &#34;can&#39;t work&#34;, and they don&#39;t all make it back to the profession, a bit less than half in fact. Whatever you do, I urge you to take burnout seriously, because at the limit it&#39;s a serious medical condition which can cripple or kill you."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Before the pandemic and surge of remote work, a lot of us complained not just about going to the office, but that the office itself was pretty crappy. The open plan creates an environment of high distraction, low privacy, and physical discomfort. Whether or not people wanted to listen to music or anything for hours at a time, they were pushed to do it just to drown out a constant background noise of words that are highly salient in your problem domain. You&#39;re probably constrained to the desk or chair set up that your office manager picked. The bottom line is you&#39;re spending a lot of time in an environment about which you may have zero input or control.At home, I can work in silence if I want. If I want background noise, I can play music on a stereo or turn on the TV in the next room. When my back hurts, I can lie down on the sofa, or stretch and foam roll in a way which would be conspicuous in the office. I can be barefoot all day if I want. I can snack on the food that I like enough to buy, without broadcasting the pretention of bringing my own food to the micro kitchen. I can eat healthier lunches than the office catered food.  Even without considering commuting, or the amount of time spent in synchronous interactions, just being able to control my own space is sooo much more comfortable. I injured my back this year, and taking care of it has been so much easier at home than it would have been in open plan hell.A bunch of that stuff is nominally compatible with being &#34;in the office&#34; -- just give me a private office, with real walls, the ability to buy my own furniture, etc. But tech long ago decided that engineers get cubicles or open plan desks, that the way you know we&#39;re working is seeing that we&#39;re looking at screens rather than seeing our actual output, that a clean modern spaceship aesthetic is more important than workers being able to control or customize their workspace. Is it that we don&#39;t value the office, or that the office has been created by people who don&#39;t value us?"</p>

And now some companies decide: Hey let&#39;s contractually enforce a 9 hour continuous workday where all our workers will be locked in a big ugly building that we build just for that purpose (Btw. at least one of the 9 hours will be unpaid because this is where people will have lunch. Also we won&#39;t reimburse anyone for their traveling expenses or their time spent during the commute).Now read again the arguments you wrote to support this new idea."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I always saw tech as the field where a disproportionally large amount of people truly love what they do.You do confuse &#34;loving what they do&#34; with &#34;being at the office&#34; and &#34;socializing during slack time&#34;. I do love my job but I do hate socializing with people, which is definitely not my job. That is why I&#39;m working in IT, I don&#39;t have to socialize beyond the bare minimum to be successful. I think IT attracts introverts like me, and I do suspect we are the majority (but I have only anecdata for that).&gt; I know that &#34;the office&#34; is a bad place for a lot of people. [...] But shouldn&#39;t we rather work on fixing those things instead of making them bearable by just turning off a camera in a Zoom meeting?Things have gotten worse and worse around the office. Small one- or few-person offices gave way to cubicles, which gave way to open-plan offices, which gave way to open-plan seat-lottery not-even-your-own-desk offices. No amount of pushback changed this direction in the slightest. Meanwhile noise and interruptions got worse and worse, where in my private office people knocked politely before entering or were kept out by the DND sign, nowadays the seat lottery puts me next to a loudmouthed marketing phone-drone, who when not screaming into the mic drones on about his awesome sales statistics and his new yacht. At least the boss can&#39;t easily walk over anymore and breathe down my neck because the seat lottery put him somewhere else usually. Any and all things that have been tried to fix this are band-aids and lip-service. It only got worse and worse.WFH is great, finally a step in the right direction. I do have no sympathy for the extroverts, because they got us into the aforementioned mess."</p>
