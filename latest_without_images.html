								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; sometimes probably best just not tell project manager and do it 80/20 way. easier forgive than permission, project managers mind like butterfly at times overworked and dealing with many grugs.In my experience, I have to fight to keep my devs from over engineering their solutions and just get something going.I&#39;d love to work with a dev who&#39;s happy to think about how to most quickly deliver value and who&#39;s willing to help with the cost-benefit analysis for each suggested feature.Problem is, for that, you need a developer who cares about and deeply understands the use case/the product. Many of the devs I&#39;ve had to work with were more interested in building pristine codebases with clever abstractions and ability to scale to unnecessary numbers of users or bytes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Microservicesgrug wonder why big brain take hardest problem, factoring system correctly, and introduce network call tooThat made me laugh. The microservices madness of the past decade is now starting to settle down to more mature understandings, but there are still a lot people biting off large testing, operational, and data transactionality/ reporting costs.People often don&#39;t recognise beforehand the magnitude of extra complexity &amp; associated productivity costs.I&#39;ve seen companies architecting 50 microservices with 50 separate datastores when they actually needed 5 midi services.. Then lose half their productivity trying to work with all this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I was half my age, OBS was unfathomable. I was shooting video on digital 8, editing in Final Cut Pro 4 which was the new hotness, and trying but failing to use DSS on my college network. Actual streaming at scale required a massive server and a massive license from RealNetworks. If I wanted to do anything with animation, it was all $$$$$ software. This all took place in a shared lab at my college with stuff I could never afford on my own.Today, people at that age are making lucrative careers out of streaming then doing the things they love out of their bedrooms using OBS. Blender has enabled all kinds of amazing creators, from animation to video editing to 3D printing and even (basic) architecture. Kicad makes EDA! approachable.  My teen son has been able to dabble in all of the above in his spare time without spending a dime.I’m in awe of the power of free software and the amazing engineering work that has enabled these projects to be good enough for real professionals to choose first. I hope we see Godot achieve world domination in gaming,  GIMP in graphics, and Libra Office + Collabra in productivity. The people who have given us these tools deserve the highest accolades."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those who haven&#39;t tried it, you can mount the output of OBS as a camera, which can be used as input for something like Zoom.  So you can add graphics, multiple angles, switch between different views, etc..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Self-promo:In case anyone is interested in controlling OBS remotely, you can use OBS-web: https://github.com/Niek/obs-webIt&#39;s not a full reimplementation of the UI, but offers the most often used controls so you can manage a livestream from e.g. a tablet or phone."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m one of the authors of this. Happy to answer any questions.One of the fun technical details is that, when enabled on a machine (tailscale up --ssh), the userspace tailscaled process takes over all TCP port 22 packets after the WireGuard decryption and doesn&#39;t even feed them into the kernel over TUN. We use gVisor&#39;s netstack to handle the TCP connections in-process.So it doesn&#39;t matter whether you have other processes (or iptables rules, etc) that would prevent the Tailscale SSH server from binding to port 22. This lets people gradually use Tailscale SSH over time without messing with their system one.The Tailscale SSH server currently only runs on Linux but there&#39;s support in git main for macOS too but it&#39;s not super well tested yet and not included in the sandboxed GUI builds currently."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been having trouble adopting Tailscale. As so many others say, relying on another identity provider is unfortunate - I, too, worry what happens when Google decides to lock me out because some algorithm decided my account is fishy.The biggest blocker has been the issues with the Android client. I&#39;m either hitting https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/issues/915 or https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/issues/4611, but neither issue appears to have a fix coming soon. Whenever I am on my carrier&#39;s network, my phone&#39;s internet stops until I disable Tailscale - that&#39;s just a show stopper from using TailScale.So instead of developing this SSH feature, I would have preferred to seen them work on their bug backlog.In the meantime, I&#39;m experimenting with ZeroTier. While it doesn&#39;t have the ease and cool magicDNS+LetsEncrypt feature, I think I&#39;ll survive with something more reliable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m very interested in Tailscale for both personal and business use-cases, but I&#39;m rather put off by the stark centralization of offered identity providers: Microsoft, Github (Microsoft), Google, okta (?). What are the chances that Tailscale would offer authentication using decentralized/self-hosted identity providers like Ory ( https://www.ory.sh/ )?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I hesitated a little bit before deciding to purchase and go through the book. Had already read many glowing reviews then, but was not sure if the choice of language (Java) for the first half of the book would be a hindrance (it&#39;s not the stack I am most familiar with).Decided to buy it anyway, primarily because the two implementations of the toy language piqued my interest (most other books only go through one implementation).Boy was I glad I did.Writing is superb, end-of-chapter challenges are instructive, code samples are meticulously and beautifully done. Here and there I also encountered references to other languages (e.g. had a brief detour to Lua internals [1], thanks to a side note), which I have enjoyed too.Went through the first half twice: first using Java as it is written and then secondly implemented the interpreter in Rust (my initial fear turned out to be unfounded). Currently going through the second half.So if you&#39;re reading this, thank you, Bob :).[1] https://www.lua.org/doc/jucs05.pdf"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Without a doubt one of the best technical books I have ever read.To me, it was a missing piece of the big puzzle of &#34;how do computers work&#34;. I read many a book to answer this question, and came away with three books:- CODE by Charles Petzold explains the CPU- Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces by Arpaci-Dusseau explain OSes- Crafting Interpreters by Robert Nystrom explains programming languagesMasterfully done."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love this book! My only gripe is that I wish it was a whole series, no, a whole genre of books. We need more hands on, code first books that take you through 1-2 extended projects where you can type along and get working code at the end. These books should have CS theory, but still be fundamentally focused on implementation. It&#39;d be really fun to have one of these for a more functional compiler (type checking, code generation, optimization), for a language service (query based compilation, concrete syntax trees, language server protocol), for databases, operating systems, and so on. Ideally they&#39;d be a cross between an O&#39;Reilly book and a SerenityOS stream"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My reaction to this is that it&#39;s an effort to keep users within the &#34;walled garden&#34; of Twitter, which is not the best thing for those that write.Recall the story with Medium - yes, you get broader reach with less effort, but at the cost of giving up control of your content.I know that I am talking with an overly developer-focused lens (a-la &#34;you can reimplement Dropbox in a weekend&#34;), but self-hosting blogs outside the &#34;walled gardens&#34; is not super complicated even for non-power users. Ghost has existed for years and is a very user-friendly experience. Want to be a bit more technical - go the static site route.It might be a lost battle to convince the majority of the social media audience of this (after all, can&#39;t beat the convenience and the cost of $0), but I really do not see this as beneficial to those that deeply care about their long-form writing accessibility and sustainability.Twitter already has login walls to just read tweets, so I&#39;d imagine the same is likely to apply to long-form content as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While it&#39;s all well and good to launch new features, I think Twitter should improve their existing service and I&#39;m referring to low hanging fruits.I don&#39;t understand the rationale behind cutting me off while I&#39;m scrolling through Twitter simply because I&#39;m not logged in. Twitter can still display Ads to me irrespective of whether I&#39;m logged in or not. In fact cutting me off means I leave Twitter which means I don&#39;t see the Ads they&#39;re selling which in turn means less Ad money for them.Even when logged in, Twitter will display the new message/note icon. When I click on it to read the notification, it turns out to be Twitter telling me to turn on notifications. Now normally, once you have read the message, the &#39;new&#39; message/note icon is cleared. Instead Twitter displays it again almost immediately and this then goes on for the next few hours before they stop.If they can&#39;t fix these simple things, why would someone want to read longer content on Twitter. They would still get cut off again as Twitter is doing for existing tweets"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When things like these happen, a rehash of ancient internet idea presented as new again, makes me feel very sad, like the internet is old and dying or sth. I understand it&#39;s all about UX etc now , but i wish twitter&#39;s competitors did not just copy but instead tried to make their audience a little bit smarter. If the UX is not dumb-proof, you might not get hordes of users, but at least the ones who are there will have a bit of brains."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I managed to give up fags over four years ago after 30 odd years of smoking around 20+ a day.  I&#39;m still quite surprised that I managed it but in retrospect I did a mental job on myself - you have to be hard but in the end it wasn&#39;t quite as bad as I thought it would be.  If I can, you can but you need to find your strategy.Initially I thought that I&#39;d transition to e-fags and climb down from there.  Nope.  You are trading one habit with another - it doesn&#39;t matter if a e-fag cloud is better for you it is still not good and keeps you tethered to smoking.  I think it would be quite easy to go back to tobacco if you &#34;allow&#34; yourself to vape as a transition.I rapidly realised that once I started down the abstinence route I had to be very hard with myself.  It wasn&#39;t actually that bad in the end.  I came up with two mantras that I repeated to myself in my head whenever I really wanted to smoke:  they were - &#34;I don&#39;t want to smell&#34; and &#34;I don&#39;t want to die&#34;.  They are pretty self explanatory.I did and sometimes still have dreams about smoking.  It is a very insidious habit.  I was a smoker for 30 years so it is obviously still a part of my life at age 52 but it is fading and I rarely have to say my mantras these days.I had another strategy too, which helped in the short term:  I started my give up, in the early afternoon of day one (Easter 2018 as it turns out) and had a very long lie in on day two.  That got me to over 24 hours with minimal stress.  I then progressed to a series of time based targets:A day (tick), two days ... a week ... two weeks ... (tried a drag on daughter in law&#39;s fag - no thanks) ... a month ... two months (weird dreams) ... six months ... etc ... four years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Important to remember that combustible cigarettes are terrible and e-cigarettes are a slightly less terrible alternative to those. In a world where cigarettes are  so terrible however, e-cigarettes end up saving billions in health care dollars and quality of life.Of all the e-cig players, Juul (which is now majority owned by Altria) is the most reputable one — by far - they have by far the best technology, quality controls, compliance and regulation teams, etc.Unfortunately before Altria acquired Juul it was a terribly ran company. People spend a lot of time discussing the chronic youth issues but the reality is that Juul never wanted to sell to youths or anything of the sort — they were just _so_ incompetent at operations that they couldn&#39;t do anything.They set fire to hundreds of millions of dollars on totally ridiculous projects plainly stupid ideas:* A modular supply chain project with the idea that they could use manufacturing as a carrot for regulatory laws — this team was 50-100 people and had tens of millions of dollars in budget. Never did anything.* All manner of vanity innovation projects: new battery technology, next and next and next generation projects, dozens of flavours, absurd marketing campaigns, rebrands, a $250k custom typeface, the list goes on.* Hired McKinsey and Bain because the executive team (who were all ex-management consultants) wanted the company to move fast ....* My personal favourite Juul story (ok I have a bunch) was that the company was so incompetent they didn&#39;t do headcount planning — You could just hire as many people as you wanted if your random (often incompetent) VP was okay with it. Juul had 50-100 VPs so it was sheer chaos.It got so bad that Altria had to step in and install their own CEO and axe all of the existing executive team (and lay off thousands of random employees) to try and right the ship. Altria are a very legit operational business — you may not like them but they know how to work with the FDA within strict regulation guidelines. If Juul is removed from the market despite Altria taking over they&#39;re truly fucked.In my time at Juul I have never worked with so many incompetent people. 
It was quite impressive but also incredibly depressing as someone that joined because the idea of creating a connected device vaping product to help switch Americans off combustible cigarettes was very compelling."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The worst thing about this was that openoffice was starting to get some name recognition before oracle killed it, and this whole debacle intentionally or unintentionally turned that name recognition into a weapon against LibreOffice.Ideally they should have given LibreOffice the OpenOffice name, but even if they had just said &#34;openoffice is dead&#34; then it would have been easy for people to find libreoffice.Unfortunately, by taking over the OpenOffice name and absolutely refusing to admit that development has ceased, Apache has caused tons of confusion that has massively harmed libreoffice, because for years people who had heard about &#34;openoffice&#34; would see the terrible, out of date, insecure pile of junk being distributed by the Apache Foundation and not realize that the actively developed LibreOffice was available.In the case of linux distributions it was less of an issue since they just switched to LibreOffice, but I wouldn&#39;t be suprised if there are windows users who are still downloading OpenOffice (and possibly taking one look at it and giving up and switching to Office 365).Apache should have killed OpenOffice years ago but at the very least they should take it down and honestly apologize for fucking this up so badly.Even ignoring the harm to LibreOffice it&#39;s just irresponsible for Apache to keep distributing OpenOffice when they can&#39;t even make new releases to simply apply security patches for years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Apache has a few good projects and so much abandonware it’s very difficult to know which to avoid entirely.At this point I think Apache has about 15 different data streaming/queueing/event processing systems."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s what I suggested as a goal for OpenOffice, in September 2016 which is now six years ago, as a response to Apache officer Jim Jagielski (&#34;jimjag&#34;) who thought this was going well:[[[ I urge you, or the Apache board generally, to look at the facts, and not get yourself into the mess of trusting AOO project members&#39; gut instinct that everything is fine or that the board&#39;s oversight is the problem and you should just stop looking. For sure, it is possible that they&#39;ll actually manage to turn this around. But there are already AOO people convinced they&#39;ve done it, and there were six months ago, when in fact as you know they were in deep trouble already. Their feelings about this aren&#39;t going to be objective. If in say, three months, there&#39;s no measurable evidence that AOO is back on course then regardless of what is said by the handful of AOO people, retirement is the right choice.For example, shipping AOO 4.2 in 10 weeks at ApacheConEU. That&#39;s not crazy. Libreoffice goes from feature freeze to release in 10 weeks. A healthy AOO development community should be able to do it, or come so close as to leave no-one in any doubt. ]]]https://lwn.net/Articles/699680/Again, I wrote that in September 2016. Did Apache in fact ship OpenOffice 4.2 at that year&#39;s ApacheConEU? No they did not. OK, so when did they finally ship the &#34;imminent&#34; OpenOffice 4.2? Never.Here&#39;s what the most recent quarterly summary from the Apache OpenOffice project to Apache&#39;s board said about version 4.2, &#34;An alpha and/or beta release is planned for the next quarter&#34;. That sounds optimistic doesn&#39;t it? Well, sadly that&#39;s also what it said in January 2020. Huh. Who writes this stuff? Funny, it&#39;s Jim Jagielski, the same guy I was addressing six years ago.Try to avoid caring whether people are incompetent or liars, you will find it difficult to tell which is which, so if you ensure you can treat both the same you needn&#39;t distinguish. In this case I needn&#39;t worry about whether Jim was too stupid to know what the problem was in 2016 or just didn&#39;t care."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This stifling of competing ideas, say a growing number of scholars, is a big reason why there is no treatment for Alzheimer’s. (The four approved drugs have no effect on the disease, providing only a temporary memory boost.)Those who championed the amyloid hypothesis truly believed it, and thought that focusing money and attention on it rather than competing ideas was the surest way to an effective drug.Or maybe the real problem is the excess emphasis on finding a drug in specific that can be commercially monetized. A single drug for a single cause of what is likely a complex process.Amyloid and another protein (tau) accumulate in the brain due to sleep deprivation.  Helping people get a good night&#39;s sleep -- without drugs -- would likely help, if only to stave it off in those at risk.The problem is it won&#39;t create any razzle dazzle &#34;unicorn&#34; companies and newly-minted zillionaires.One of the researchers in the article found that herpes simplex infection promotes the accumulation of amyloid. Her research was not irrelevant to the amyloid hypothesis.  It was only irrelevant to an agenda to find a drug to treat amyloid."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"FTA, contradicting the headline (emphasis mine):&gt; Despite being described as a “cabal,” the amyloid camp was neither organized nor nefarious. Those who championed the amyloid hypothesis truly believed it, and thought that focusing money and attention on it rather than competing ideas was the surest way to an effective drug.This discrepancy indicates part of the problem: the investigators narrowing the search for causes honestly believe in what they&#39;re doing.The NIH review panelists really believe they&#39;re safeguarding the NIH budget, and the Pharma execs really believe they&#39;re wisely allocating their R&amp;D budget."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is no better way to get shut out as a scientist than to disprove the career-making findings of the important people in your field. One of the side effects of this is the “discussion does not match the results” paper. It’s routine to read papers where the discussion blatantly contradicts the papers own results. What is happening is the authors are disclaiming their own findings in order to get past hostile reviewers, betting that astute readers will notice the contradiction, ignore the discussion and draw their own conclusions from the results."</p>

The usefulness of it cannot be overstated.Doesn&#39;t even matter if its used anywhere in the deployment chain; simply having the ability to pull up a replica of almost any *nix environment on my laptop in mere seconds, using it for tests, and then throwing it away resetting it again in mere seconds is beyond awesome, no matter if what I&#39;m working on then goes into a huge complicated deployment chain, or is shoved onto some on-premises, zero-abstractions, baremetal server.And how is it all configured? Plain text files. How is it controlled? Command Line. Meaning I can script it every way I want, using the tools I already have and use. Doesn&#39;t get in the way, doesn&#39;t demand that I work around it...it works with me and my tools in the same way they already work together.Oh, and of course, good bye and good riddance to the days when I had to install and configure local RDMS for tests.
