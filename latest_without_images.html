								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I built out a simple &#34;technology access&#34; solution for my late grandma about five years ago.  It was just some simple scripts running on a raspberry pi. The scripts would fetch emails from a gmail account, extract the attachments, and display them on loop. The subject line of the email, sender and the date were overlayed on the image.The advantage over those IoT picture frame products was that I could use any display I wanted. A cheap 32&#34; TV was perfect. This was key as her vision degraded.  The approach also allowed anyone in the family with email to send her photos, no proprietary apps or accounts required.She passed away mid-Covid and I didn&#39;t get to see her in her final 6 months, but she always bragged of her &#34;picture machine.&#34; I think she was the envy of many of her fellow nursing home residents!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are so many beautiful UI hints with this.1) The shape of the microphone positively urges the user to lean forward and talk into it. Compare to a modern smartphone where it&#39;s not at all obvious where the microphone is.2) The giant red button next to the microphone positively scream &#34;press me to talk&#34;, and it&#39;s obvious that the red LED will light up when the button is pressed. Removes any &#34;is this thing on&#34;? thoughts.3) The patch panel is quite genius, it&#39;s obvious how to target the desired recipient. One might quibble with the plug systenm, but using the large style plugs is a great choice for unsteady hands. These plugs have more leeway if not plugged all the way in than micro style plugs.4) The recipients are all in a line, and due to the design, one of them is always selected. That removes any &#34;did I select someone&#34;, sa I sometimes experience when sharing on my phone to some social network.5) What&#39;s more, the last selected recipient is persistent, even in the event of a power cut.6) Thermal printer is genius.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This should not come as a surprise, and it was largely predictable from the outset.The flu has a base reproduction number (R0) less than 2 (https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/coronavirus/2020/12/07/covid-19...).  Covid has an R0 in the vicinity of 2.5 (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scena...).In the meantime, public health measures like masking and distancing will work against both viruses.  If people become reluctant to socialize because of covid (whether or not there be legal restrictions), they will also not spread the flu.As a broad conclusion, if public health measures reduce the effective reproduction number of Covid to about 1 (stabilizing exponential growth), they will also reduce the effective reproduction number of the flu to something substantially below 1.  Since the flu would have also had a low baseline prevalence in the summer of 2020, it is no wonder that we failed to see a flu season.There&#39;s really no need for conspiracy theorizing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was just commenting to a co-worker my entire family hasn&#39;t been sick since the pandemic started.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"If I caught the flu, how would the government/scientists studying this stuff even know I got it? If you&#39;re anything like me you probably just take some time off and get over the illness without ever seeing a doctor or taking a flu-test. How do they measure such things? I suspect they use some elaborate statistical model to try and generalize the results to the whole population."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Google is saving $1 billion per year because of COVID-19, not because employees are working from home. This is literally mentioned in the article, but the headline is twisted (for clicks no doubt):&gt; During the first quarter, Google parent Alphabet Inc. saved $268 million in expenses from company promotions, travel and entertainment, compared with the same period a year earlier, “primarily as a result of COVID-19,” according to a company filing.Even if they hypothetically continue the WFH setting for all employees indefinitely, other costs will still creep back up once the world starts getting back to normal. They will still hold conferences (and send employees to conferences). Team events and corporate retreats will still happen. Launches won&#39;t be digital-only. Advertising will pick back up. None of this is related to whether employees are at their desks in the office or not."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google may save $1B this year on the P&amp;L, but I can assure you that a large cohort of employees are vastly less effective (especially parents!).  Time will tell how wfh pans out in terms of long-term enterprise value creation, after confounding variables (i.e. COVID) are removed.Source: A lot of my Googler friends are itching to get back into the office -- whether parents or people whose social lives centered around work.Ninja Edit: Google has already announced their return to work plans, which involves substantially returning to physical office spaces.  From early April: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2021/04/01/google-wan..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Always remember:  numbers without context are meaningless. Google had 180bn revenue in 2020.In normal circumstances , even with much more WFH, they&#39;d still pay for regular company get togethers. They&#39;d pay for more satellite offices. They&#39;d pay for conferences because making cross industry connections and promotion is important.These savings don&#39;t mean much. Even more so if they lead to a potential dip in efficiency (not arguing that&#39;s the case, mind you) or reduced employee retention. Less personal engagement leads to less attachment to the company.The effects of that are barely visible after a year."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Is it just me, or is it really obvious that Wout won?https://i.imgur.com/g78YNla.pngEach pixel column is a specific point in time. I added a few landmarks: when the front of the wheel passes the camera view, when the axis of the wheel passes the camera view, and when the end of the wheel passes the camera view. Blue for the top biker (Wout) and green for the bottom biker (Tom).Every single event happened earlier for Wout. Both wheels are the same diameter. Therefore, the entire period where the wheel intersected the camera view, Wout&#39;s wheel was ahead. Including the exact period where Wout passed the actual finish line.If Tom would have passed Wout, you would expect that the bottom wheel would be more &#34;squeezed&#34; such that the end of Tom&#39;s wheel would have passed the camera line earlier than Wout. Same for the other landmark (centre of wheel).You can add more landmarks if you want (e.g. approximate when the wheel passes for 25% and for 75%), but it should be clear by pure margin that Wout had the lead for the whole duration where the front wheels passed the camera view. Pretty much all the computation in this article was unnecessary.Amstel gold made the good call, though I agree that it was probably more luck."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used to work with these line-scan photo finish camera systems (we used FinishLynx) timing track meets.This error is pretty comical to me because aligning the camera is the first thing we do after putting the camera up and looking at their images, it&#39;s pretty clear it wasn&#39;t aligned properly. The cameras can auto-align, but we didn&#39;t trust it and manually aligned it, but I&#39;m wondering if maybe the event organizers auto-aligned and didn&#39;t bother to check? The cameras are mounted on a motorized base that can move in 3 dimensions with very fine precision [0]. In the OP, you can see the event organizers have a black line across the finish on a white base. In order to manually align it you just have someone run back and forth across the line and move the camera with the computer until you pick up the very left edge of the black line, which is very clear because you can see the ground change from black to white in the image (or vice versa depending on where you start).We also used to always put a white piece of wood behind the line so that the images would always have a white background. This makes it so much easier to detect the edge of a torso when clicking on a person to indicate their time. In the OP, if their camera was aligned correctly, red would&#39;ve been a tough background color. Also a black line is questionable. I would&#39;ve had a white line on black base for the same reasons.[0] https://www.finishlynx.com/product/accessories/camera-mounti..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a arguably better, higher level writeup at https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/making-sense-of-the-controve... which concludes:&gt; The black line is a visual approximation of the placement of the finish, but the image from the photo finish camera is the true arbiter of the result – not the other way around. It’s technical and it’s a bit confusing, but it’s clear-cut and the riders and officials are playing the same game with the same known set of rules.&gt; According to UCI regulations, the photo finish verdict is final, because the finish line is what the photo finish says it is.Which makes most of the detective work here sadly pointless.Pidcock probably didn&#39;t need to tweet his take, in the same way he didn&#39;t need to post that ridiculous bogus 5k time! https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/the-column-..."</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26982309">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I totally agree this is a very balanced review of the affair.The fact that &#34;kernel maintainers ... are overworked and do not have the time to properly review every patch that passes through their hands&#34; is not a situation created by the group of researchers.If the Linux kernel is so crucial to the real world industry, and the kernel team is so distressed at their work, this is a problem need to be seriously addressed. Proactively punish the whole UMN does nothing to address the real issue here.If the team is so distressed at this tremendously important work and they constantly feel they are on the edge of collapsing, may be you really really really should ask for outside help and even demand more contributions from the big techs.Nobody should overwork, especially those work on something so crucial to the whole industry.Edit: I just read a line from the Rust Foundation page [1]: &#34;Good software is built by happy, well-supported people.&#34;1. https://foundation.rust-lang.org/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Linux is arguably one of the most important software projects on the planet right now.It is vital in so many aspects of society now,
Android, AWS/AZure, IOT, routers, etc etc.It should be taken as a serious given that bad actors are working hard, with huge budgets to nefariously gain some advantage in the development of Linux.They will have far better engineers, much larger budges, and have been working on it for many years.I would imagine ever intelligence service on the planet would love to have obscure exploits embedded in the kernel.I can easily imagine a scenario where a single exploit was introduced over many months one tiny bit at a time. Each patch a fully working fix for unrelated problem. Fully Legit.   But when they are all combined something wonderful happens. (for the nefarious player).This stunt was a few students who were not well funded nor were they uber kernel coders. Yet they had some success (depending on what you call success).I imagine the NSA has a team on this, with some exceedingly well skilled kernel coders working on embedding things, and I am sure they have a second team to find possibly implants by foreign services and so on.Had this been security researchers who managed to get changes into the WindowsNT kernel I think the reaction by the core Linux devs would have been different. 
(and yes I am 100% there are people spending just as much time doing this for Windows as for Linux, well maybe not).This highlighted a vulnerability, which is frankly quite real and needs to be taken seriously and contemplated over time.The guys were jerks, yes. 
What they highlighted is real
and a lot more serious than what this little stunt did."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Key takeaway from this update:One final lesson that one might be tempted to take is that the kernel is running a terrible risk of malicious patches inserted by actors with rather more skill and resources than the UMN researchers have shown. That could be, but the simple truth of the matter is that regular kernel developers continue to insert bugs at such a rate that there should be little need for malicious actors to add more."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is just such a weird fight. As someone who freelanced for long stretches of time, I think there are a lot of positives about freelance / gig work, and I also think that the majority of people who take these jobs understand the position they’re in and are happy with it. They chose to freelance and drive for Uber for reasons.The legit concern is whether Uber or any other freelance company misleads its gig workers on their earnings, and to me the best solution to that is not to force reclassify them as employees or prohibit gig work, but to regulate transparency in compensation. For example, require freelance employers to include expense tracking and calculate workers earnings after expenses. That by itself would fix most of the problems for the percentage of gig workers who don’t realize they’re extracting depreciation from their car more so than getting paid by Uber.The other issues of healthcare, etc., the US needs to solve at a societal level, not an employer level. I think humans have a right to health care. But I don’t think people have a right to a particular job, nor an entitlement for that employer to provide a particular mix of benefits.This idea that we need to provide our social contract / safety net exclusively via employers is so strange to me, compared to simply owning that if we want these to be rights of our citizens then the government should be providing them as tax-paid services."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It blows my mind that these platforms refuse to let workers set their own rates, choose their clients, choose how the work gets done, where the work gets done and how the work gets done. Those are the defining characteristics of what makes a worker a contractor or not.Instead, platforms like Uber dictate rates, dictate how, where and when the work gets done, and penalize workers if they don&#39;t take the clients Uber wants them to take. Uber even dictates what cars they can and can&#39;t use."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It seems backward that the government, instead of fixing government policy and laws that disadvantage independent workers, wants to force independent workers to become employees so that the government doesn&#39;t have to fix anything. It is abdication of responsibility for social outcomes.Many gig workers explicitly do not want to become employees, as there are many disadvantages to doing so. In these cases, the only people that benefit are the politicians that can go on ignoring the real problems."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Reminds me of the more adult 100$ debt riddle. Found it at econlib.org by David Henderson, but I&#39;ve heard multiple variations before, so I have no idea where the original comes from.&#34;It’s a slow day in some little town……..
The sun is hot….the streets are deserted.
Times are tough, everybody is in debt, and everybody lives on credit.
On this particular day a rich tourist from back west is driving thru town.
He stops at the motel and lays a $100 bill on the desk saying he wants to inspect the rooms upstairs in order to pick one to spend the night.
As soon as the man walks upstairs, the owner grabs the bill and runs next door to pay his debt to the butcher.
The butcher takes the $100 and runs down the street to retire his debt to the pig farmer.
The pig farmer takes the $100 and heads off to pay his bill at the feed store. 
The guy at the Farmer’s Co-op takes the $100 and runs to pay his debt to the local prostitute, who has also been facing hard times and has had to offer her services on credit.
She, in a flash rushes to the motel and pays off her room bill with the motel owner.
The motel proprietor now places the $100 back on the counter so the rich traveler will not suspect anything.
At that moment the traveler comes down the stairs, picks up the $100 bill, states that the rooms are not satisfactory, pockets the money &amp; leaves.
NOW,… no one produced anything…and no one earned anything…however the whole town is out of debt and is looking to the future with much optimism.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The one figure that this didn&#39;t quibble with is also wrong.Net profit definitely adds to shareholder value. But suppose that I make  $30 billion, reinvest $20 billion, and create something that is worth $90 billion.  My net profit is now $10 billion.  But I actually added $100 billion in shareholder value!Jeff Bezos knows this, and knows this well.  For many years Amazon ran at a net profit around $0 because it was reinvesting all of its profits in new businesses.  So it was adding shareholder value like crazy!  (And people who didn&#39;t understand this were walking around saying, &#34;Why is Amazon worth so much?  They don&#39;t even make a profit!&#34;)Of course doing this calculation correctly includes estimating the present value of the thing I created.  And that is notoriously hard.  So the proxy used in the real world is market cap.  However market cap is volatile and subject to change based on the emotions of speculators.  Certainly Amazon&#39;s actions last year are not the whole story for why they added $600 billion in market cap!So while net profit is the wrong measure, there is no measure that can be used which really is right for &#34;added to shareholder value&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this is a very smart piece. It exposes very clearly that money is not value.You can bundle existing value from one side, add maybe an extra bit here and there and collect money for the process.
But how much money you collected in the end has very little relation to how much value you added to the system.
Especially since some of the shareholders did absolutely no value creation.Jeff Benzos is a very smart person and an excellent CEO. He used to work for the Renaissance Fund as well. I really wish I could hear his honest opinion on this piece. He will most likely never read it but I hope he would and I hope he took the time to reply with honesty and no ego."</p>
