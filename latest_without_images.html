								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I stopped using my Microsoft Surface Pro because it had the same issues. It&#39;s a clusterfuck of bad design decisions at Microsoft, the most offensive one being that they prioritize the execution of their scheduled spyware upload (telemetry) over honoring the agreement with the user that a sleeping PC will remain asleep unless the user takes action. It&#39;ll even install updates at night and then make reboot sounds to wake you up. And the next day, your unsaved open documents are all gone. Plus as described here, many Windows 10 laptops will either burn themselves, or the battery will be empty whenever you need em."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; All newer Dell laptops now use the Microsoft Modern Standby.So let me guess: &#34;modern&#34; here is indicates a shitty new thing that doesn&#39;t work as well as the old thing....after further reading, yep:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/dev...&gt; On occasion, the system stays in the active mode (with the screen off) for a longer interval of time. These longer active intervals occur for a variety of reasons, for example, processing incoming email or downloading critical Windows updates. Windows components that are allowed to leave the SoC in the active power state are called activators because they are registered with the power manager as capable of blocking the transition back to the idle power mode. The durations of these activities vary widely but are controlled to extend battery life. The durations of the activities can be viewed with the built-in SleepStudy software tool or through Event Tracing for Windows (ETW)-based instrumentation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I own XPS 13 9380 with Windows 10. Same mess with the sleep. I have to carry the laptop in the bag when commuting. You never know what it is doing when lid is closed. There is no lights on the laptop to indicate its state so I just usually put it to my ear and listen until the fan goes off after closing the lid. Then it is semi safe to put it into the bag. Feels like stone age.Things are just getting worse with Windows and those standard PCs. I never understood why they moved to that S1 idle when S3 was fulfilling basic needs. This family Intel+Windows starts to irritate me. I am seriously considering either fully moving to Linux or to Apple Silicon and Mac OS."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is slightly tangential, but it&#39;s Atlantic-cable-related, and I just learned about it. Let me set the stage. By the 1920s, analog fax technology was established and there were a variety of experimental and early commercial systems in use. One of the first uses of modems was to transmit faxes over the long-distance telephone network, turning a voltage into a pitch, and vice versa. The electronic marvel of the 1930s in the newsroom, aside from the teletypes, was that you could take a photo in San Francisco and have it published just hours later in New York.But how do you get a picture across the Atlantic Ocean? Those analog fax systems suffer from noise and in the experimental systems of the 1910s and 1920s long-distance was impractical. Shortwave to get over the Ocean was right out. There were no transoceanic telephone links. But there were submarine telegraph cables. Morse code or Baudot telex. Not very fast with no amplifiers along the lines yet. But you could send a telex across the Atlantic ocean.Enter the Bartlane transmission system. First, five photographs were developed from the original negative, at different exposure levels, using a conductive developer. So each point of the image is more or less conductive depending on its exposure. Each of these photos is scanned, as if it had pixels, and a 1-bit intensity value collected for for all five photographs, creating a five-level greyscale bitmap image on tape basically. (Five bits worked with existing Baudot code equipment.)This enormous tape was then sent over the wire. On the receiving end a printer, with intensity controlled by the level indicated, would then selectively expose a spot on a photographic plate to light, as it stepped through the tape. Six hours to send a small image. But digital was the only way to send a photograph from London to New York overnight from its early trials in the 1920s until the 1950s.http://www.hffax.de/history/html/bartlane.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Cool.  We take it for granted, but the intercontinental data (and voice) connectivity cables are an impressive achievement for humanity -- technical, and for global community.  And globe.gl has me &#34;seeing&#34; for the first time a particular cable for which I have a much smaller personal story.One of those submarine cables being severed accounts for one of only two software/hardware downtimes for a B2B startup&#39;s launch MVP, which had been deployed in critical production overseas.Our station appliances at the facility needed to talk with servers (at the network-closest AWS AZ) multiple times a minute, for cryptographic security reasons.  The appliances had a boot-time check for network connectivity (which saw extreme latency and packet loss as network unavailable).  For reasons, the facility powered off all equipment at night.One day, the facility said the appliances wouldn&#39;t &#34;turn on&#34;, I quickly found they were having network problems, but facility insisted their LAN and Internet connectivity was fine.  I was able to carefully SSH in (with terminal responsiveness like a bad dialup to an overloaded timesharing system), and relaxed the timeout on the check that was in a retry loop, and the stations came to life (albeit network requests during operations much slower than normal).  The facility manager advised later that day that it turns out a submarine cable had been severed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This might be a stupid question, but is it implicit that these &#34;submarine cables&#34; are all fiber cables? If so, are they of similar or very different bandwidths? I would think there are cables of differing ages that are used for different things, or are all non-fiber cables taken out of service long ago, or are they just not included on the map?Also, the &#34;Polar Express&#34; cable on that map is fascinating, but it seems like it&#39;s not planned to be completed until 2026.[1][1]: https://www.submarinenetworks.com/en/systems/asia-europe-afr..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Good. The website imore reported earlier this year that 96% of people in the US had opted out of tracking.It’s almost as if no one wants this “feature” Facebook has been “providing” and given information about it and a choice have roundly rejected it.I can’t wait to see what some of Apple’s other initiatives like the anti-tracking features in Mail on iOS 15 and the upcoming iCloud Private Relay do to the industry.Hell, US intelligence agencies block ads at the network level because the ad industry is so infested with tracking/malware/spyware/exploits/etc. That’s a hell of an indictment.Of course any time someone looks into it they find that that click-rate fraud is at outrageous levels. So maybe no one needs Apple. The fraud bots will keep the ecosystem running. /shttps://www.imore.com/96-iphone-users-have-opted-out-app-tra...https://www.vice.com/en/article/93ypke/the-nsa-and-cia-use-a..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a slightly more cynical take on this than it seems most of Hacker News does.Facebook had found a way to monetize it&#39;s iOS app without Apple getting a 30% cut.Apple decided to cut that off to prevent Facebook from making money without Apple taking their cut. The fact that Apple can sell this to users as &#34;privacy&#34; is all the better for Apple.At the end of the day Apple is still a corporation. They are beholden to shareholders, not privacy advocates. Apple will maximize profits and has found a way to cut off revenue to competitor and breed goodwill at the same time.Judging by this comments thread, it is working very well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;People are opting out of Facebook’s tracking for a reason: they no longer trust the company with their data after years of evidence they should not.&#34;Alternatively, this is the first time mainstream users are able at all to opt-out. I would strongly suspect users opt-out in any case, for any app, regardless of trust history."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Daczak serves on the WHO team to investigate the virus origins, but this did not get mentioned in any reports.  Instead he warns other not to discuss it. He does not include notes that research was done on modifying bat viruses to make them infectious to human cells.  These behaviors look like a guilty person, do they not?The wuhan and eco-health researchers had already started work on the furin cleavage sites and why would they stop when DARPA blocked it? Funding can’t only come from the US. Did CCP also block this research?&gt; there is published evidence that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was already engaged in some of the genetic engineering work described in the proposal and that viruses designed in North Carolina could easily be used in China."</p>

There is no spike protein anyone knows of which would have been used in this research3.  The PRRAR furin cleavage site is not one humans would have tried it is unlike any other known furin cleavage sites in coronaviruses4.  There are now many known related sarbecoviruses which have been found with furin cleavage sites5.  Furin cleavage sites have independently evolved in multiple different branches of coronaviruses, probably a dozen times that we know of now.6.  The furin cleavage site is short and can easily happen through recombination with another virus due to coinfection.7.  This is very likely what happened due to infection with the SARS-CoV-2 ancestor and an HKU9-like virus.It is not particularly suspicious that the thing which we were worried about happening and causing a zoonotic spillover event is the thing which actually happened."</p>

People should adjust their daily activities around the daylight hours they have, and let time be less of a controlling force in their lives.We live in a globalised world, especially in business. So with the whole world on UTC, everyone knows when the meeting starts, when the delivery arrives, and when the end of the year starts and finishes.And if that fails, we should just attach rockets at the poles and push/pull the planet back upright to get rid of the problem altogether."</p>
