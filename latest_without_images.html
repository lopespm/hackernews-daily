Congratulations to all who have worked on the project.I understand the reasons for not putting a camera on or near the JWST, but I’m still a little sad that we’ll probably never get to see the thing in situ in all its operational glory.Maybe one day when it finally expires, we can launch a “sample return” mission to tow it back."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the big numbers that been thrown around is that JWST has 344 single points of failure in its mission. Now that deployment has been completed, is there somewhere that lists how many of those points we have passed?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To me the second most exciting idea about JWST is that it might give us fairly definitive proof that other intelligent life exists in the galaxy.The most exciting idea is if that happens we&#39;ll realize they might have built their own version of JWST and proven we exist."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been working on BookStack for over 6 years now, learning a lot about open source project maintainership during that time. Originally developed it while looking for a documentation system for my mixed-technical-skill workplace. Wanted something easy to use without having to get finance involved when increasing our user count.With Confluence backing away from their self-hosted offerings, hopefully many will find BookStack useful. It&#39;s not supposed to be a direct replacement, and the design &amp; content structure is quite opinionated, but it can serve many of the same use-cases as Confluence had served."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From a quick look at the demo it looks nice, however i think that since people are more likely to read than edit, the &#34;Actions&#34; should be lower than the navigation panels. E.g. in this:https://demo.bookstackapp.com/books/bookstack-demo-site/page...Instead of &#34;Actions&#34;, &#34;Page Navigation&#34;, &#34;Book Navigation&#34; it should be &#34;Page Navigation&#34;, &#34;Book Navigation&#34;, &#34;Actions&#34;.Note: this seems to be an issue when the window width isn&#39;t too high to put the actions at the right side. I only noticed it after i wrote the above since i use a narrow width for the browser as my monitor is large and it makes it easier to read text. Regardless, in this &#34;narrow mode&#34; i think the actions should be placed after navigation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I looked into a million wiki/documentation projects and my absolute favorite for consumption (reading and navigation) was Docusaurus [1].The only problem is that Docusaurus is intended for static public documentation, so it does not provide user-accounts or multi-topic content-management that you would expect from bigger wiki-like projects.I wish Docusaurus would expand its scope to serve as a wiki, rather than single-purpose documentation - but I understand these are different use-cases altogether.[1] https://docusaurus.io/docs"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"That sounds like a major, incredibly dangerous update to the DB driver. Their 7.1, 7.2, 7.3 versions seem to all have breaking changes [1].Yet they are in obvious violation of SemVer expectations, which they declare to follow [2]:&gt; Mongoid follows versioning guidelines as outlined by the Semantic Versioning Specification, so you can expect only backwards incompatible changes in major versions [sic][1] https://docs.mongodb.com/mongoid/current/tutorials/mongoid-u...[2] https://mongoid.github.io/old/en/mongoid/docs/upgrading.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Mongoid docs[1] seem to be pretty cool about this change:&#34;As of Mongoid 7.1, logical operators (and, or, nor and not) have been changed to have the the same semantics as those of ActiveRecord. To obtain the semantics of or as it behaved in Mongoid 7.0 and earlier, use any_of which is described below.&#34;Is it just me or is this one of the most terrible breaking changes in a popular, official library ever?[1] https://docs.mongodb.com/mongoid/current/tutorials/mongoid-q..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We use Mongoid. I treat every upgrade, no matter how small as its own piece of work involving going through the changelogs with a fine-tooth comb. This particular issue got flagged up when we last looked at upgrading. Currently Mongoid upgrades are stalled until we have the time to figure out the impact of some of their more egregious changes.I have a generally low trust approach to all dependency upgrades, irrespective of how minor they are, I&#39;ve been bitten by enough &#34;minor&#34; changes. But I treat Mongoid as an active adversary who is setting out to break things with every update.It&#39;s the complete opposite approach to that of the Rails core team and those that work on ActiveRecord (as the nearest equivalent to Mongoid). Changes to Rails core are always well flagged with really good advance warning of upcoming breaking changes, frequently with deprecation warnings several versions in advance. There just seems to be a core culture of thought and care towards their users."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Freddie de Boer just wrote something on his Substack about this - https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/many-kids-dont-have-a-w...The quick takeaway is that school is that for the most vulnerable kids, school is about a lot more than education. Taking school away from those kids can be much more damaging than many people realize.It seems to me like that right strategy would be to just say something like:    We encourage all kids to stay home, but if you can&#39;t, that&#39;s ok. You can come to school and have a warm, quiet place to spend the day, and we&#39;ll provide free lunch to everyone who comes.

Forget about the education piece for a while, just provide the (very important for some people) day care part."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I read this post earlier today, and found it quite shocking. I really hope this is an exception rather than the normal.I previously didn&#39;t think about it this way, and thought closing schools was the more sensible choice. But we&#39;re failing a whole generation like this.It more and more feels like we live in a society that sarcrifices their young, just to keep old people on their life support machines a little longer.Yeah, that&#39;s hyperbole. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s the right path, tbh."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think I&#39;m getting something different from this than what the author intended.* They mention their study hall as a &#34;super spreader event&#34;.  This feels...hysterical to me.  Not just because it worries me that this kid is thinking about this in the way they are, but also because it&#39;s wrong.  The risk this person faces is much more likely from the HVAC system in the school, not the study hall.* The way they talk about the other kid asking questions &#34;with their mask down&#34;.  To be obsessed with this sort of minutiae as a kid is scary to me.* Kids thinking about test...and apparently being given something like 5 tests in a single day?  This seems wasteful and hysterical on behalf of the school.* Begin upset at kids for taking these tests in the bathroom instead of at home.It just seems like there is a whole realm of paranoia that this kid is trying to fit on top of their life, and I don&#39;t think this sort of paranoia is in any way reasonable.I think that teaching kids to think about their world with this framing, and at a formative age, is and already has done major damage to their development."</p>

Thanks for submitting it, but I am afraid there is not much to see right now.We are still in closed beta (mostly to control cost and gradually improve user experience), with much more left to do. There are some examples of what Kagi can do in my twitter feed. [1]Main idea of Kagi is to offer a paid search product, where user is also the customer and is central to everything that happens. Btw. Kagi is pronounced ka-gi (similar to yogi), I get asked that a lot so there it is...If you want to beta test, feel free to sign up and we will do our best to send an invite within a week.[1] https://twitter.com/vladquant"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Been using them for about a week, very happy with it.Regional results (especially since the last update) feel as automatic as google. While I still hope they’ll add my suggestion of a bang for region switches, most queries I do don’t need one, and it properly switches between English and German.All of the DDG bangs. Seriosuly, search without bangs is nothing I’d ever want to go back to.Built-In Domain Blacklist. Goodbye Pinterest. Forever.General results are great. More relevant results than either DDG or Google and a great presentation (like showing snippets from accepted or upvoted SO answers)And I have not even played around with advanced filters like lenses (which people in their discord seem to love).Negatives: So far, I’d say only that the widgets are less usable than DDGs.I had low expectations, but I’m really very positively surprised."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I grew up in the late 90ies with internet in Switzerland, and as a broke pre-teen and teenager I was used to getting EVERYTHING pirated and this habit sticked with me, even though when in later years I was working as a software developer.Torrenting, sharing with friends and family is still completely legal in Switzerland.Only after pay services like spotify became a thing and were more convenient than managing and tagging my multi TB sized aac/mp3 library, I switched.Same for Netflix. But since fragmentation of streaming services started to happen, I&#39;m going back to things like stremio/torrents/DDL sites.For software, as a hobbyist videographer I wouldn&#39;t purchase the Adobe suite and all the expensive VFX tools I use for my family videos. But whatever software I use professionally (at work and at my employer), I&#39;m of course getting proper licenses."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I subscribe to Netflix, Disney+ and Amazon (although that&#39;s just a byproduct of prime), and am happy to continue paying ~£30/month (which is roughly what a basic Cable package would cost me), and even pay the occasional £20 one off for a digital purchase of a &#34;cinema&#34; movie (see: Disney+&#39;s recent releases, new bond movie etc).However, when studios resort to pulling tricks like [0], artificially limiting content (john wick 2 is available on netflix, but to watch the first, you have to purchase it on another service), or just being fragmented (which of the 5 apps on my PC has the content I&#39;m looking for?) I start to get super frustrated at the services, and if this continues will either likely just stop paying for the content, or look elsewhere. The content needs to be easily accessible in high quality or it&#39;s going to lose to piracy.[0] https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a37170236/black-widow-scar..."</p>

I posted it previously when it worked in 2D and wanted to share it again because the 3D really makes the shade come to life. Most of the credit for the update due to migrating from Leaflet to Mapbox GL JS."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A feature that would make this even more fun to use: a way to auto-rotate the map so that the bottom of the screen is the direction that sunlight is coming from at the current time of day. Right now, I can only infer the sun’s direction from the pixelated shadows of buildings, but I’m curious about its direction at different times of day relative to various windows in my building. I think rotating the map with the sun would be an intuitive way to show that direction.The UI could be a toggle button below the “Tilt map” toggle button with an icon of a sun and a title “Rotate with the sun”.I understand that the sunlight comes at slightly different angles to each point on the map. The feature wouldn’t have to complicated because of this, though: I would find it intuitive if the feature only calculated the angle from the sun to the location at the center of the visible map."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The high-level goals of python end up creating these little syntactic landmines that can get even experienced coders. My personal nomination for the worst one of these is that having a comma after a single value often (depending on the surrounding syntax) creates a tuple. It&#39;s easy to miss and creates maddening errors where nothing works how you expect.I&#39;ve moved away from working in Python in general, but I think the #1 feature I want in the core of the language is the ability to make violating type hints an exception[1]. The core team has been slowly integrating type information, but it feels like they have really struggled to articulate a vision about what type information is &#34;for&#34; in the core ecosystem. I think a little more opinion from them would go a long way to ecosystem health.[1] I know there are libraries that do this, I am not seeking recommendations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those looking to avoid this specific problem, there is a flake8 rule: https://pypi.org/project/flake8-no-implicit-concat.More broadly, the https://codereview.doctors makers are making the point that their tool caught an easy-to-miss issue that most wouldn&#39;t think to add a rule for. A bit of an open question to me how many of those there really are at the language level, but still seems like a neat project."</p>
