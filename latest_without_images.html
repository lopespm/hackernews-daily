								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Link with a bit more actual information: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5...As far as I can tell, what&#39;s going on here is that there are multiple stages of antibody development.  People have circulating B cells, and these cells have their genomes modified by the the VD(J) recombination process [0] from the  genome in the human germline (i.e. what your germline cells and most of the non-B cells in your body have).  There are a large number, but nowhere near infinite number, of B cells and corresponding antibodies that can be produced in this process, and I think these are what the authors call &#34;germline&#34; cells.Once a naive B cell decides that it encodes a useful antibody (which is a complicated process), it starts to divide.  Some of the daughter cells further mutate in a process called affinity maturation [1] to produce what are hopefully even better antibodies.I think that the idea behind this research is that there are certain antibodies that can be produced by affinity maturation that are very useful against HIV, but that the &#34;germline&#34; B cells that lead to these antibodies are not particularly likely to be selected by the immune system when exposed to natural HIV antigens.  Instead, the researchers have developed customized antigens intended to target specific germline cells which are known to be able to mature into cells that can produce the desired antibodies.  If this works, the next step would be a series of additional vaccines (which are not the same as dose 1) that will try to encourage maturation into the useful antibodies.The takeaway is that this result is very promising and that there is (so far?) no reason to expect the trial participants to be immune to HIV.For the ML crowd, another way to think about this is that, when your body is exposed to an antigen, it runs a massively parallel search algorithm to find good antibodies in a truly massive space of possible antibodies.  Unfortunately, most people, when exposed to real HIV or to prior vaccine attempts, get stuck in a bunch of not-fantastic local minima.  The idea is to specifically aim the search in the right direction so, after a few rounds, it can find a better solution.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V(D)J_recombination[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_maturation"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interested to hear from people in the know: how good does this look?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My understanding is that many HIV vaccine candidates have showed promising Phase I results but so far they have all failed in later trials.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV_vaccine_development lists five vaccines that made it to Phase 2-3 (and all failed). Two of them appeared to increase the risk of contracting HIV. The strongest candidate appears to have been ~30% effective."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There is something really pleasing about reading PDFs. It’s perhaps how static it is and it won’t change on me. I can zoom in or “operate” on it without some reorganization. It puts the mind to ease. There is no reflowing. There is no columns shifting. It’s just is. Like a piece of paper as an analog - the intent of the author and the designer is retained and frozen in time. Fonts are embedded and chosen by the creator. Haters of PDFs do not understand the human aspects of it - they just see it as a specification (which is convoluted)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love &#34;printing&#34; webpages to PDF files. I&#39;ve been doing this for more than 15 years. I delete most of the images first so that I end up with files of 50-500KB. I then store said file in appropriate labeled directories.Now 15 years later I have a private stash of websites and wikipedia articles that I can consult by simply pressing command+spacebar (the files are indexed in MacOS search).To make a PDF file out of a website I currently use Printfriendly.com, but it wasn&#39;t always this way.Back in the days I loved to use Arc90&#39;s Readability (a firefox extension). I don&#39;t know what happend to that extension though, there are plenty of old HN articles about that Wonderfull plug-in though:Post from 2010, probably I started using it right after finding this post...

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t understand why so many people think &#34;pdf&#34; automatically means &#34;A4&#34; or &#34;letter size&#34; document. PDF&#39;s are size agnostic. Storage is cheap and so is processing power. A phone-sized pdf will be 20 mb instead of 1 mb, but so what? It&#39;s a small price to pay for quality typesetting. Similarly, pdf&#39;s can be sized for the now typical 16:9 laptop screen."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What upsets and concerns me the most is when I see poorly developed SPA on really important sites.  For example, government service application websites.  If reddit or nytimes has a bloated, intermittently failing SPA site, that&#39;s an annoyance.  When it&#39;s a form to apply for unemployment, ACA health care, DMV, or other critical services, it&#39;s a critical failure.  Especially since these services are most often used by exactly the population most impacted by bloated SPA (they tend to have slow or unreliable internet and slow computers, maybe even a cheap android phone is all they have).Such sites should be using minimal or no JS.  These aren&#39;t meant to be pretty interactive sites, they need to be solid bulletproof sites so people can get critical services.  And I haven&#39;t even mentioned how SPA sites often lack any accessibility features (which is so much easier to implement if sticking to standard HTML+CSS and no/minimal JS)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d like to add a bit more nuance. Modern frontend development provides many opportunities for failure. These failures often make their way into production. I, personally, get great results with modern FE development. My users are happy. I am happy. It&#39;s all very successful. All the defenders of modern FE development will likely chime in with the same sentiment. I also get great results with C, which arguably provides even more catastrophic opportunities for failure. I wouldn&#39;t say &#34;C is a failure&#34;, but I absolutely hate working in C, and I&#39;m glad we&#39;ve made improvements to systems programming. I think the point I&#39;m moving toward is that we absolutely should strive to make better tools for delivering web content, but the reasons for failure are far more complex than the tooling itself. So, let&#39;s not frame things in black and white and call something that&#39;s been used with large amounts of success a failure. That&#39;s not very productive and is just flame bait. The real question is, &#34;What&#39;s next?&#34;, how are we going to improve the current situation?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Regardless of my tweet, that is a personal opinion based on my feelings, background and experiences, the discussions in the replies are interesting from the POV of understanding what different people think in the programming community. Some will say that critiques are only from old people, in the style &#34;when I was young we had only zeroes! You now have ones and zeroes&#34;. Others say that the web is slow because of ADs and trackers and modern frameworks would otherwise be fast. There is who believes that the problem comes from big companies imposing new standards in order to turn the web into the new Java applets (a full fledged application platform), and so forth."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"“Sick building syndrome” is a difficult topic to discuss because it’s very difficult to prove a connection between the vague symptoms and the building. In many cases, only a single person seems susceptible to the claimed building issues. In this case, the apartment complex appears to have over 1,800 units, which makes it surprising that only a single person is experiencing such dramatic effects.Unfortunately, doubting these people’s stories is taboo online so I’m going to tread carefully. However, when only 1 unit out of 1800 apartments (presumably 2000-3000 total residents considering multi-bedroom units) is experiencing severe and dramatic symptoms, my first guess would not be the soil under the foundation. I would be looking for building materials or chemical spills in that specific apartment unit.Also, I’m not suggesting that we discount this person’s story. Their symptoms are certainly very real in that they are suffering, but the selfie of the person wearing medical equipment in front of a mirror combined with measurements from consumer devices as evidence should be approached with caution. There is a relatively new phenomenon casually known as Munchausen by Internet where some patients are drawn to the increasing attention they can garner by sharing, and unfortunately exaggerating, their stories on the internet. These patients often post selfies of themselves wearing medical equipment, in doctor’s offices, or in hospital beds. More commonly, typical patients prefer not to be photographed with medical equipment or in medical facilities.  Again, I’m not suggesting we disbelieve this person, but it’s important that we consider the bigger picture (1800 unit apartment complex, apparently only one case of severe symptoms?) before accepting a single person’s analysis of what is causing her issues.Mistaken “sick building syndrome” diagnoses can actually be very detrimental to patients who mistake other illnesses as being caused by their buildings, as they hyperfocus on their presumed explanation to the exclusion of following more typical diagnostic work ups that would help them eliminate more common explanations for those symptoms."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some years back I signed a lease in a luxury apartment hi-rise in downtown Chicago. The complex had been an add-on to an existing shopping center and mall. Long story short, the apartment smelled like old grease and trash often, and I could never trace the exact source as it would come and go.
No matter how many air filtration units I installed, or odor absorbing devices, the odors would still collect and infiltrate my clothing and furniture. Again, it wasn&#39;t constant but regular enough for me not to stay there very often.I ended up caulking the entire apartment with clear caulk and sealing any air gaps. Because the hi-rise was pressurized like most hi-rises, I concluded somehow this was drawing up smells from grease traps etc. Of course I could never prove it.My conclusion is that most of these buildings are so cheaply and poorly made that I will never again rent a unit like this. Too bad I spent 30k on the lease and hardly ever stayed there.  So the woman&#39;s experience seems pretty plausible to me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Most people here seem concerned about vocs. Plastics, carpets, sofas, paints, air fresheners and a ton of other typical household items produce them.I feel like the author is really jumping the gun here in identifying the source of pollutants by not seeking to consider the fact that new apartments are loaded with freshly off-gassing materials.The other thing that should have been mentioned is more about their vitals prior to moving in. How confident was she in her baseline because it could be a preexisting condition that became very exacerbated.Edit: But that said, my opinion of the Irvine company is extremely low. I’d not be the least bit surprised if they willfully cut every corner they could. Either with remediation or materials in the apartment. And pollutants do pool overnight but near freeways they are typically the worst in the dawn hours. There would be less air exchange in the apartment, leading to a buildup from an external or internal source."</p>

So I ended up making an FB account which I&#39;ve only ever used to be able to see the club pages (I haven&#39;t ever posted anything!) -- dumb of me I know, but FB had almost become a requirement to participate in life.However recently, I&#39;ve noticed that I now get a couple of junk text every day or two whereas up until a few weeks ago, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d ever had a single junk text.I wonder if this is why."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a good discussion on this by Troy Hunt[1].&gt; But for spam based on using phone number alone, it&#39;s gold. Not just SMS, there are heaps of services that just require a phone number these days and now there&#39;s hundreds of millions of them conveniently categorised by country with nice mail merge fields like name and gender.[2]&gt; Another general observation on this incident: I&#39;m seeing extensive sharing of the data, both the entire corpus of countries and individual country files. Not just in hacking circles, but very broadly on social media too. This data is everywhere already.[3]&gt; New breach: Facebook had 2.5M addresses exposed in an incident that impacted 533M subscribers&#39; phone numbers.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi, I&#39;m the tech lead of Cloudflare Workers.This article contains several misunderstandings.If a Cloudflare customer has configured their origin server to respond only to Cloudflare IPs, then they MUST also verify that the &#34;Host&#34; header on any request actually matches their domain name. If they do not verify the Host header, then anyone can sign up for Cloudflare and simply configure their DNS to point to the victim&#39;s origin IP address, and requests will be routed there -- but will have the attacker&#39;s domain in the Host header. Workers is not needed for such an attack. This attack has always been possible and is common to basically all CDNs. Fundamentally, the CDN has no way of knowing if the origin server that a user has configured really belongs to them -- the CDN can only tell the origin (via the Host header) what customer it thinks it is serving, and expect the origin not to accept requests that were on behalf of a different customer.Instead of IP-based authentication, we strongly recommend using mTLS-based authenticated origin pulls (with a zone-specific key pair) or Argo Tunnel, as these methods are much more secure.As long as the origin server is verifying via one of the above means (IP+host header, AOP, or Argo Tunnel) that the request was processed by Cloudflare on behalf of the customer&#39;s zone, then the attack described in the article doesn&#39;t accomplish anything. If a Worker makes a request to a hostname that is on Cloudflare, then all of the target host&#39;s Cloudflare security settings will apply to that request the same as if the request came from an external client.Additionally, as mentioned in the article, any requests coming from a Worker will have the CF-Worker header identifying the zone which sent the request. If a customer suspects abusive requests coming from Workers, they should report it to us.~~The article claims that the X-Forwarded-For header can be forged, but this is not true if the target host is itself a Cloudflare customer.~~EDIT: What I said about X-Forwarded-For seems to be incorrect. CF-Connecting-IP has always been the header we use to identify the client IP, and it cannot be forged. X-Forwarded-For seems to have more complicated and subtle behavior that I&#39;m not familiar with. I&#39;m investigating."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s a nice trick, with some automation you should be able to register new domain names and Cloudflare accounts to get past the 100k limit as well.Cloudflare&#39;s anti bot tooling is terribly annoying while using Tor. I understand why they do it, though. Using Tor is a good way to show how terrifyingly much control Cloudflare has over the internet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; As you can see, X-FORWARDED-FOR can be set to an arbitrary value, so you can bypass IP limitation requests during scrapping or more dangerous IP verification during a login procedure … The origin IP is not forwarded to the website, so the only way to block this kind of request on your server is to filter on CF-WORKER header.X-Forwarded-For should always be treated as forged at least for security purposes (except the hops set by reverse proxies under your control). If you do IP whitelisting based on untrusted X-Forwarded-For you’re doing it terribly wrong."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s also the cheapest route to drive, as it&#39;s optimizing for lower fuel consumption:    With insights from the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Lab, we’re building a new routing model that optimizes for lower fuel consumption based on factors like road incline and traffic congestion.

Provided that the few extra minutes aren&#39;t critical to one&#39;s wallet, it&#39;s a cost savings. For me those extra minutes are rarely critical. If I could, I&#39;d usually choose the lowest stress route! But I&#39;m definitely going to enjoy using this additional information."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The important paragraph that most people probably care about:    Soon, Google Maps will default to the route with the lowest carbon footprint when it has approximately the same ETA as the fastest route. In cases where the eco-friendly route could significantly increase your ETA, we’ll let you compare the relative CO2 impact between routes so you can choose. Always want the fastest route? That’s OK too — simply adjust your preferences in Settings."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"FTA but not the main point of this thread: we’re now able to bring Live View to some of the trickiest-to-navigate places indoors: airports, transit stations and malls.Seems to me that these are the easiest places to navigate indoors, because of the plentiful signage. Malls probably the hardest of the three, but still pretty easy IMO. I&#39;ve never had any issue finding a gate or baggage claim at an airport, since there are signs every 10 feet or so."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Something doesn’t quite sit right with me about him linking to a couple things that mention Walker’s rebuttal https://sleepdiplomat.wordpress.com/2019/12/19/why-we-sleep-... but not linking to it directly. If you are trying to get people to think critically about the book it seems like they should at least be given the opportunity to see the authors response to your criticism."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had a purely practical issue with &#34;Why we sleep&#34;. The book says multiple times that you cannot run a sleep deficit and then make it up later.  So what should I do if I have run a deficit? If the deficit reduces cognitive function, and I can&#39;t make it up with more sleep, does it follow that for every short nights sleep I will have a permanent reduction in cognitive function? If I turn my alarm off and let my body decide it makes me sleep for longer after a deficit, is my body wasting its time?It doesn&#39;t feel like this can be 100% true"</p>
