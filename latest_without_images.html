								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Compiz was probably the single most impactful event for desktop linux of the mid 2000&#39;s. Not that it itself made much of a difference, but the ripples affect many areas we take for granted today. A few reasons:  - it put linux ahead of windows and mac in terms of appearance;

  - it brought many new users and most were a good mix technical and enthusiasts;

  - it showed the advantages of modular software;

  - many plugins were useful and these useful plugins influenced desktops to this day;

  - it was fast, stable and cool enough;

  - it brought many new developers;

  - it was an incentive for vendors to improve 3d linux drivers;

  - it made X.Org developers improve redirection,

  - it came by default on the most popular distro from 2006 to 2012.

Yes, most of the effects were useless but even they helped developers and designers to decide what not to include or do in the future. It pioneered useful things like selecting an area of the screen and saving it directly to a file, useful zoom and quick visualization of non-visible windows. It also showed how important compositing was on the desktop. Although probably not in direct influence, there is a reason android, wayland and whatever comes with ChromeOS all have compositing features.At the time, there was some interesting developments and experimentation: métisse, sun&#39;s looking glass, bumptop, deskgallery... none of them was as successful as compiz. I&#39;m proud I was myself part of it (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X9bcrJ3TjY) and have my name written in some of its source files to this day, even if almost nobody use it anymore."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Compiz was one of those things I could show off to friends to prove that linux was actually way cooler than any of _their_ operating systems, but since then seems to have been completely forgotten about (at least by me). This was a nice blast from the past."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow did this ever take me back. Arguably my first &#34;public code release&#34; was a plugin (&#34;mod&#34; back then I think) for the WWIV BBS system -- a screensaver called &#34;Bubbles&#34; that would draw random circles on the idle screen instead of the dead blinky cursor at top left. BBS owners would basically need to code it as a diff in their own system and recompile the thing.I was maybe 9 or 10 years old. It was probably 50ish lines of C code, and I made some serious assumptions about what video card and modes were present.I really really loved computers and coding back then.Reading the comment below about being elderly and soulless also resonates for me at the moment.I miss the romance of it all. :) I&#39;ve been married to computers for nearly 40 years now, and all of the spice is gone. It&#39;s just comfortable and regular and routine.Oh well, on to another 2-hour interminable sprint planning sesh (sigh) -- &#34;yes dear, I&#39;ll be right there&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is Alina Chan, one of the co-authors of Viral: The Search for the Origin of Covid-19.In defense of a natural origin of Omicron, this study describes the remarkable evolution of SARS-CoV-2 during convalescent plasma treatment of an immunosuppressed patient for 3-4 months; the mutations also reduced sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03291-yWe know that there is a large immunocompromised population in Africa and that Covid-19 is rampant there. We also know that most hospitals, regardless of country, don&#39;t have the resources to track the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in their immunocompromised patients. So it&#39;s not unexpected that a variant like Omicron could have evolved over an entire year in an immunocompromised individual before finally infecting others.If there is any evidence that a lab in the region was serially passaging SARS-CoV-2 in neutralizing antibodies/patient serum, then I&#39;d say there is something to go on for a potential lab origin. But at the moment, there is not even circumstantial evidence pointing to this happening in Africa. Maybe setting up a secure channel for whistleblowers with evidence of the above would be the most productive approach.The above is not to say that I don&#39;t think there needs to be much more transparency and accountability from scientists working with pathogens.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m open minded, but my bullshit detectors started going off around the point where it was casually implied that we all know and it is widely accepted that delta was leaked from a lab.  I tried googling it but could find nothing.  Then I looked at the two sources the author links:&gt; https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4371212&gt; https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4382708Neither of these have nearly enough evidence or support for such a massive claim (the second doesn&#39;t even mention delta), as far as I can tell, and I can find no other reputable sources that make a similar claim.  Heck, I can&#39;t even find un-reputable ones that mention this.Am I missing something?  I&#39;m not going to continue with the article if this is how flimsy the sourcing is."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If the author actually had some kind of evidence that there was a lab leak source of Omicron, don’t you think it would be mentioned in the opening paragraphs of the blog?  Instead we have a long list of connect-the-dots tweets, out of context quotes, and unsubstantiated speculation going on for 2/3s of the post before we even get to the Omicron stuff.The meat of the speculation is a scary looking graph plotting genetic delta from the origin.  Here’s a more objective plot from the Wikipedia entry: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV-2_Omicron_variant#/...Notice anything?  Looks like Gamma and others have similar genetic distances without other mutations.Sensational blogging is pretty sensational.  That’s about it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"At this point I&#39;m convinced that the entire antivirus industry is a scam scheme for the most part. They make everyone suffer for their own profit.Users are scared into installing this crap and paying recurring payments for it, and then the performance of their computer goes to shit. Developers are given nightmares by having their software misdetected as a virus or broken by the antivirus changing the OS behavior in unexpected ways."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m surprised there isn&#39;t any math in this thread on how much they stand to make with this, so I&#39;ll try with a bit of napkin math.NortonLifeLock reported 21M customers in 2021, with 60% using Norton 360 (presumably the rest are using their identity theft products?) so let&#39;s call that 12.6 million computers (ignoring multi-computer licenses for simplicity.) You&#39;re not going to mine any Ethereum on a CPU, so let&#39;s assume we only care about GPUs. Let&#39;s say that 20% of users have a PC with a GPU suitable for mining any ETH at all, and within that 20% they have an average of 6GB graphics cards. The internet claims that a 6GB graphics card will average around 26 MH/s for Ethereum, which would have earned $38 in the last month of mining. Assuming Norton gets 25% of users to activate this (which seems high to me) we have around (25% of users activated)*($38 worth of ETH mined/month per gaming PC)*(20% of all PCs are gaming PCs)*(15% Norton pool fees)*(12.6M installed Norton copies) = 0.25*38*0.2*0.15*12.6 = $3.6 million per month, or $43.2 million in profit per year. If they enabled this for everyone I imagine they could easily get into the hundreds of millions of dollars of pure profit per year range.However, mining on a mid-range graphics card typically isn&#39;t profitable once you factor in electricity and the decreased lifespan of the graphics card. So while this is making huge profits for Norton, it&#39;s likely costing the users money if they enable it. At $0.10/kWh and 15% pool fees, you&#39;re negative on the majority of gaming PCs, and deeply negative on every single non-gaming PC.Pretty scummy move."</p>

So besides SEO, there&#39;s this thing where the recipe itself is basically defenseless against someone stealing it and calling it theirs but the sum of the fluff around it plus the recipe on the other hand can be copyrighted and enjoys all the protections afforded to these kinds of things. So, if say, Jamie Oliver likes your recipe and puts it in a book passing it as his, you can now legally tell him to stop doing that because of said fluff."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is probably one of the best write-ups I&#39;ve seen around the basics of automotive control unit reverse engineering.More modern VW control units are the same in broad strokes - they use UDS on ISO-TP instead of KWP on TP2.0, but this is just evolution of the same fundamentals. And instead of the wacky SGO format inside of FRF update files, they use the ASAM MCD-2 D-ODX format to define flashing layers. Most European automakers are similar.One interesting difference and trend in automotive control modules (also mentioned in Willem&#39;s fantastic write-up) is that many EU modules started adding signature checking and encrypted updates in the late 2000s, while most US and Japanese automakers have only done so in the last 2-3 years.These encrypted and signature checked updates are by and large still fairly vulnerable - often due to logic errors in the complex upgrade processes and occasionally due to a strange insistence on using RSA using PKCS#1.5 with e=3 and inadequate padding validation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The electronics seemed to be fabricated using bare dies attached to some substrate, probably to lower cost and improve reliability at higher temperatures. The board is made up of two parts, a low-power part with the CPU and CAN transceivers, and some high-power part with 6 MOSFETs forming a three phase H-Bridge.&gt; https://blog.willemmelching.nl/images/vw/IMG_3181.jpgIt doesn&#39;t really look cheap to me (large machined surfaces on the cast aluminium casing, two ceramic PCBs, everything connected with wire bonding, even the motor windings and the external connector, which means that at least those bonds are carried out on an almost completely assembled product; also look at the sheer size of the motor bonds) but it does look very reliable - everything is bonded or welded, zero connectors, no fasteners, all solid state."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;&gt; Only try this on an actual car if you know what you’re doing. Even though only two very small patches are made to the model specific calibration values, making changes to your EPS might have unintended consequences.The author has no idea what he&#39;s doing, or more specifically what hazards might be lurking right under his nose. I worked in EPS for 6 years and it&#39;s all really cool stuff right up until you download code and it promptly turns left all the way to the stop the first time you touch the wheel. That was a bug ;-)  I can&#39;t tell you how hazardous it may be to tweak tuning parameters - that depends on a lot of things. Tuning aside, just commanding it over CAN might allow you to do things that wouldn&#39;t normally happen and might damage something - i.e. are all protections still in place when taking an external command? I didn&#39;t work on this model, or at this company, I&#39;m just saying I&#39;ve seen a lot of stuff and wouldn&#39;t recommend messing around with safety-critical ECUs like this."</p>
