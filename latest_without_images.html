					<h3><a href="https://looking-glass.io/">Looking Glass: Run a Windows VM on Linux in a window with native performance</a></h3>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m an engineering software contractor and every client has a whole bucket load of outdated IDEs and random USB interface drivers they want me to install on my machine. Often this stuff has weird specific version dependencies, kernel level drivers that cause weird things to happen (like the computer to BSOD if you boot it up with other USB devices attached), random system level crashes, and when you go to the driver download page there are always an unsettling list of simple security vulns noted.The #1 thing that I&#39;ve ever wanted is a Linux that lives between the bootloader and Windows that lets me achieve native performance on the Windows VM, but gives me an environment where I can easily do all the things that you can usually do in HyperV like create snapshots, clone installs, share Sharepoint drives between images, etc. But I do need something that is perfectly stable and just works. This is the right technology (thank you so much for working on it), but just not yet at a maturity that makes me feel comfortable about putting livelihood on the line.Edit: actually, please, if anyone knows something that suits this use-case, even if it costs decent money, please leave a comment."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If anyone is interested, the main developer, who goes by &#39;gnif&#39; spends a decent amount of time on the dedicated Looking Glass sub-forum on the Level1Techs forum, here:https://forum.level1techs.com/c/software/lookingglass/142Level1Techs also has a ton of information and help both on the forum, and their YouTube channel, about setting up Looking Glass and VFIO. The main host of the YouTube channel, Wendell, has forgotten more about nitty-gritty system administration than I will likely ever know in my lifetime. He also just seems like a genuinely good human being."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I run a VFIO setup with a single GPU - the linux host is headless, and Windows runs on top with the GPU. Its pretty awesome. Windows runs at native performance - no problem gaming or running other heavy workloads. The linux host acts as a devbox and runs a few other homeserver style services.It&#39;s difficult to set up right but it taught me a lot about VMs and hardware. Once you get it setup well enough, its relatively painless. Like I haven&#39;t messed with my VM settings in over a year, everything just continues to work smoothly. Including windows updates, driver upgrades, most online games with anti-cheat etc. If i upgrade my hardware, it might take a day or two of tinkering to get it back up. Based on my benchmarking it runs within ~5% of native perf.This is still the best guide IMO if you want to set it up - https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PCI_passthrough_via_OVMF. Single GPU is basically the same as dual GPU, except you have to ensure the linux host does not take over the GPU or load any drivers for it during boot."</p>

					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27875158">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Pre M1, I&#39;ve always preferred a PC.When I&#39;m using a laptop, especially doing real work, they heat up, the fans go crazy, the laptop is hot to the touch and everything slows down.It almost makes you anxious. You&#39;re wondering if it&#39;s about to crash or go on fire.I&#39;ve always kept a Desktop PC on the go for this reason, a well cooled desktop just doesn&#39;t have these issues. With a laptop, I always feel like I&#39;m compromising a bit.I got an M1 Macbook Pro recently and it just doesn&#39;t have these issues, I fire up my whole dev environment and get busy, and it&#39;s still quiet and (mostly) cool, and I can&#39;t notice anything slowing down.I don&#39;t care so much about the architecture differences, x64 vs ARM etc, but the fact that I can finally use a laptop like a desktop is massive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Funny. I spent a summer in 2009 in Vietnam, working on one of those old unbeatable Powerbook silver models, in an apartment without air conditioning. The fan would run at full power constantly, and finally gave up the ghost. There was no way to repair it where I was. So what I used to do was keep a bunch of Wired Magazines in the freezer, and put them under the laptop, changing them out every 20 minutes or so. The machine still works... but yeah, that fan noise is really a great subconscious reminder that you&#39;re using it too hard. Also a good way to know if your code just entered an infinite loop, long before any other warning comes up... and occasionally that clue gives you enough time to cancel a process before the input freezes.[edit] Just had a cool idea, since this discussion is heading towards how subtly useful auditory cues have been in our workflow. What if different processes played fans at different pitches, so the total volume still added up? That could actually be really useful out-of-band state information."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Excellent idea. Adding audible feedback to the runtime is an effortless way to know what’s going on under the hood. I submitted a post about this concept last week:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27808113In it I add midi sounds to the system handlers from nodejs’ event loop."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Big tech censorship will not solved without addressing the other half of a problem with two sides.Without systems that promote quality, non-ideological, nuanced, original, tolerant dialogue we will keep running into the false dilemma of unmoderated cess pools or heavy handed moderation.If we are to avoid this dilemma we need systems that organically promote constructive, tolerant and inclusive communication, and original, nuanced, intelligent, non-ideological ideas, instead of the opposite.This cannot be done by organizations whose profit incentive is aligned with user attention instead of user satisfaction.Those organizations benefit from degraded communication until strong moderation is both continually demanded and decried.---On a side note, I am so disappointed in the constant framing of ideas as right or left. It dumbs society down incredibly to view so much through the filter of two (often arbitrarily correlated, historically shifting) clusters of supposedly disjoint options.In the real world, communes work well sometimes, markets often work better at scale but not for everything, markets require &#34;social solutions&#34; like non-commercial criminal and civil justice systems, education and health could be explicitly tested and then managed as investments with a pay off of lower taxes (including for the rich) instead of as charities forced on the rich, etc.The Right/Left and associated ideologies are all self-defeating when believed in isolation and the nuances of their ragged edges, their limitations, and constructive combinations ignored."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This all sounds very nice, but there&#39;s a bit of sleight of hand here since the article goes out of its way to avoid details. That way everyone reads into exactly what they want, and it&#39;s totally non-obvious whether this is actually a workable proposal or not.But what&#39;s the concrete proposal here? How would things actually work? Will the services be forced to accept whatever unmoderated feed of filth the linked to service sends their way? If not, how is this supposed to fix the moderation problem?How are you supposed to link together applications with totally different data, interaction, and identity models? Obviously you couldn&#39;t link e.g. say Discord to Instagram and have the interactions between the systems make any sense. Are we just going to have a predefined ontology of possible social networkign apps, populated with the currently existing models, and define an API for all of then? When and how does that ontology get redefined? Or define a single lowest common denominator covering everything? What happens with features that don&#39;t fit into the models? They&#39;re entirely forbidden? They need to go through a multi-year public review bureacracy?Who exactly will be forced to interoperate, and who gets a free pass?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;First of all, the internet’s “marketplace of ideas” is severely lopsided at the platform levelThe marketplace of ideas itself has been show to be a bust in recent years, IMHO.Better ideas, better models of truth and reality don&#39;t win out. People have not shown themselves interested in intellectual debate or argument. We do not see the &#39;best&#39; ideas rise to the top. And before anyone asks who I am to judge the best ideas, I&#39;ll answer - nobody, but I can see that factually incorrect, scientifically illiterate, conspiratorial, harmful crank ideas gain legs in the online world we&#39;ve created. Often at the root of these is a profit motive.Is censorship the best way to deal with it? Probably not. But we do need to recognise this as a problem as well as getting het up about giant internet platforms deplatforming people."</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27874100">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; The investigation by the Guardian and 16 other media organisations suggests widespread and continuing abuse of NSO’s hacking spyware, Pegasus, which the company insists is only intended for use against criminals and terrorists. (from the Guardian inquiry about the same topic).Every time we allow special laws or special tools to fight &#34;terrorism&#34; or &#34;child abuse&#34; or other evils that get people worked up, they end up being used against the people in general. Every time. Why are we even surprised."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For politicians in democracies citizens are potential voters, foreigners don&#39;t matter.It&#39;s still arguably better than dictatorships, where your citizens don&#39;t matter either, as long as you have a good police system.We act surprised when we notice such things but we shouldn&#39;t be, it is a mistake to apply the same standards that we, as the lucky citizens of &#34;free countries&#34; enjoy, to any other system of power.From a less cynical point of view, as an Israeli, I am not happy at all to see this kind of export products from my country. It is in great part because of the conflict. Te SIGINT units are huge and among the people who graduate from the army with this kind of knowledge you will certainly find many who will turn a blind eye to ethics for a huge paycheck. Not to mention that the research itself that the defense apparatus needs attracts capitals from other countries that will buy some of it and use it for unorthodox means. I wish we exported less of these things, especially to autocratic countries. I agree it&#39;s horrible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Aren&#39;t these private hacking companies breaking the law though? Does anyone know why no one has sued them or arrested them or something? From what I understand in most cases, any attempts to reverse engineer or exploit any system is against terms of service with the offender held liable. Some teenager who comes up with a game hack can be slapped with a massive fine, but these hacking companies aren&#39;t even breaking the law? How does that work?Cause I think I&#39;m in the wrong game"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hey all, author here. I didn&#39;t expect this to reach front page of HN. I came here to submit and it was here already! I am looking for more ideas to experiment. Here&#39;s one idea which someone from another forum gave me: exploring recursive queries and using SQLite random methods to do the insertions.Another crazy idea is to learn about SQLite file format and just write the pages to disk."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You can go even faster if you can organize your problem such that you simply start from a copy of a template SQLite database each time (it is just a file/byte sequence).We do SQL evaluation for a lot of business logic throughout our product, and we have found that starting from a template database (i.e. one with the schema predefined and canonical values populated) can save a lot of time when working in tight loops."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Database optimization posts are always interesting, but it&#39;s really hard to do any apples to apples comparison. Your performance is going to depend mostly on your hardware, internal database settings and tunings, and OS level tunings. I&#39;m glad this one included some insight into the SQLite settings disabled, but there&#39;s always going to be too many factors to easily compare this to your own setup.For most SQL systems, the fastest way to do inserts is always just going to batched inserts. There&#39;s maybe some extra tricks to reduce network costs/optimize batches [0], but at it&#39;s core you are still essentially inserting into the table through the normal insert path. You can basically then only try and reduce the amount of work done on the DB side per insert, or optimize your OS for your workload.Some other DB systems (more common in NoSQL) let you actually do real bulk loads [1] where you are writing direct(ish) database files and actually bypassing much of the normal write path.[0] https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/insert-optimization....

					<h3><a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/telegram-app-security-encryption/">Cryptographers unearth vulnerabilities in Telegram&#39;s encryption protocol</a></h3>
				</div>
				<div class="story__comments">
					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27866934">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Do Signal, Wire, or Matrix do this transcript consistency thing, or is there some other way by which they prevent message reordering? From what I know, encrypted messengers almost never implement that. At least in Wire I noticed reordering at some point and it uses an implementation of what is now called the Signal protocol.And that&#39;s the most severe vulnerability from the article. The second one is &#34;mostly of theoretical interest&#34; according to the researchers themselves, the third requires &#34;an attacker [to] send many carefully crafted messages to a target, on the order of millions of messages&#34;, and the fourth &#34;requires sending billions of messages to a Telegram server within minutes&#34;. So while this is not bad research, not at all (it&#39;s really great that people take this close a look!), the title sounds rather more severe and people will obviously jump to the conclusion that &#34;See, MTproto is bad like we said all along!&#34; without reading anything. Good research, bad article?«Obligatory notice in Telegram comment threads: the real issue in Telegram is that end-to-end encryption is optional and made extremely inconvenient to use: no implementation at all in TDesktop, can&#39;t use it across multiple devices, doesn&#39;t work for group chats at all... That is the main reason Telegram isn&#39;t secure: they can read all your chats except when you use this stupid inconvenient mode.»"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Given how bashing on MTProto is a favourite cryptographers&#39; activity from the day-0, I&#39;m actually kinda encouraged by the fact that&#39;s all they found. It&#39;s especially nice, that htey could fix all of them without breaking back-compatibility, which isn&#39;t really a given for crypto protocols. Would appreciate more technical and less dumbed down responses from the Telegram team, though. I have no idea what the fuck &#34;counting grains in the bags of sound&#34; is supposed to mean.(Also, it&#39;s funny, but being accustomed to SMS and such I always somehow assumed Telegram messages can be reordered by chance too, if I send them fast. I never really thought about it, obviously, but simply didn&#39;t expect it to be otherwise.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While bashing on Telegram is basically HNs favorite past time, there aren&#39;t many other alternatives that work just as well in the area that I care the most about: being a great chat app. Telegram is fast, has native clients instead of a garbage web ui (or electron based app), has better stickers than the alternatives, is easy to write bots for and has a larger user base where I&#39;m at than any of the alternatives other than WhatsApp."</p>

Persistence is achieved via firing the 0-click again. Because the 0-clicks they&#39;re using appear to be quite reliable, the lack of traditional &#34;persistence&#34; is a feature, not a drawback of the spyware.  It makes the spyware more nimble, and prevents recovery of the &#34;good stuff&#34; (i.e., the spyware and exploits) from forensic analysis.&#34;Oh that&#39;s bad."</p>

Everyone there is working hard all year long, charging for tourist services very cheaply. Yet there are many examples of places with year long tourism, but you can still find mass closures during siesta.Everyone, through culture, decided not to overwork and there&#39;s no one &#34;hard-working&#34; enough to have their business open during siesta. No employee will agree to work during siesta, similarly employers do not expect their business to be open."</p>
