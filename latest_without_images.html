								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I would think about your positioning some.You’re marketing this as having “less complexity” which   first of all, isn’t going to appeal to people unless they’ve already used the other tools. But, if they had tried Trello, that’s far from complex, as you say it doesn’t have the features you think are needed, so you are more complex than that. It might be that you’re excellent at UX but that needs some comparative examples to see how you have differentiated things.Instead, it might make sense to go more with all the features you need, nothing you don’t angle. Note that I don’t think this really differentiates too much from clickup which has personal productivity options, and as you get bigger you know customers are going to ask for more and more features, because that’s what they do, and we also know that business accounts are the money makers in this market.  It also runs counter to building an “all in one” tool. If you hope to replace chat, docs, collaboration, calendar, and journaling, that’s a big change for people who stepped in just looking for task management.I did see that your prices are lower so you might try positioning based on lower prices than your competition, if you have carefully chosen those price points."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’m in the same industry, and find these attempts of constraining technology through secrecy extremely naive by our legislators.
I’d wager that if you already know how to operate an SDR, you properly will have little trouble with the fairly simple  algorithm of measuring phase differences, filtering, CFAR etc. to make a passive radar. Synchronizing a bag of RTL-SDRs with a common oscillator is a trivial soldering task.The cat went out of the bag the second SDRs jumped from DARPA R&amp;D to DVB-T commodity.That aside having a passive radar breadboard is not the same as a high-end passive radar where frequency/phase stability, use of wideband multi-source emitters, ultra-low noise amplifiers and N&gt;&gt;2 channels for increased angular resolution are integrated in an operational system. These systems that actually works, should be controlled."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You can order a reasonably good passive radar on Alibaba right now.[1]The DVB-T/T2 Passive Radar (external radiation source radar) itself does not emit signals, but receives the echo signals of non-cooperative radiation sources (radio, television, communication base stations, etc.) reflected by the target for detection (as shown in Figure 1). The radar is composed of antenna, multi-channel receiver, and signal processor: the dedicated reference antenna receives direct wave signals, and the monitoring antenna array receives target echo signals; the multi-channel receiver amplifies the signals received by all antennas, performing frequency conversion and A/D sampling. The signal processor processes the output signal of the receiver, and outputs target information after reference signal purification, clutter suppression interference, matched filtering, target detection, parameter estimation and tracking processing. Unlike other passive detection systems, DVB-T/T2 Based Passive Radar(external radiation source radar) can achieve single-station positioning and speed measurement, and can detect more types of targets (can detect radio silence targets, such as autonomous cruise drones, birds and balloons), and is particularly suitable for applications where there are restrictions on electromagnetic radiation and high detection performance requirements.Type of Target: Low-altitude targets such as drones, balloons, paragliders, and general aviation aircraft, including non-cooperative targets with radio silenceDetection Range Directional model: 5 to 10km (DJI Phantom 4), Omnidirectional model: 2 to 4km (DJI Phantom 4)All suppressing this does is cut the US out of the market.[1] https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Silent-Sentry-Passive..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; &#34;My media content had been pushed aside into a submenu while the app promotes its own streaming media and premium services instead.&#34;This is my biggest pet-peeve coming from Linux world. In Linux the music players you find bundled with different distros are simple, but they just work.However since moving to MacOS, I have to either use iTunes or Music, and in Android the default music player and the latest updates of the alt music player I installed the author problem is true; they expect me to use their services and that&#39;s front and clear, while my local music is hidden away in a menu button.This is a fairly ridiculous situation IMHO (well, solitaire in Windows getting ads/online is slightly more, but I&#39;ll never go there) since a music player that fulfills my needs is pretty easy: show a list of artists, play either the whole artist or a single album in shuffle mode.Attempt 1: https://twitter.com/FPresencia/status/1364892370509127681Attempt 2: https://twitter.com/FPresencia/status/1578720636645826560"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I suppose I understand the reasons people prefer Jellyfin.  But on the small chance of liking a commercial product, Plex is truly dead simple for my parents.  They have an AppleTV.  They signed up.  I share it with them via their registered email address.  And they’re in.  It was as simple a process as I could hope for.That being said, do I like everything they’re pushing for? No.  But they at least allow users to opt out.I understand the sentiments here, truly.  I just don’t have a compelling reason to change since it does what I want, is simple to set up and use, simple to share, and gets refined all the time.This is heresy, but not all commercial software is the devil.  I suspect RMS would hate me for this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Plex is one of the reasons I now always choose open source over closed source but free as in beer.  They start out great but as financial constraints creep in the compromises are made that create a very unpleasant experience.  For example, I&#39;d love to use Obsidian, which is an amazing app, but who knows what will happen to it in the future."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It may be  true today that calloc checks for multiplication overflow and doesn&#39;t zero memory if it doesn&#39;t need to, that&#39;s modern revisionism.  Historically, calloc did not do either of those things.eg, from the 4.4 BSD, circa 1993:https://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=4.4BSD/usr/src...    void *
    calloc(num, size)
     size_t num;
     register size_t size;
    {
     register void *p;
    
     size *= num;
     if (p = malloc(size))
      bzero(p, size);
     return(p);
    }"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Regurgitating from an older comment of mine: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13110538----The first version of UNIX to include `calloc` was Research UNIX V6, and here&#39;s how it was implemented: https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo/blob/Researc...    calloc(n, s)
    {
    return(alloc(n*s));
    }

There are several interesting things we learn from poking around V6:- `calloc` originated not on UNIX, but as part of Mike Lesk&#39;s &#34;iolib&#34;, which was written to make it easier to write C programs portable across PDP 11 UNIX, Honeywell 6000 GCOS, and IBM 370 OS[0]. Presumably the reason calloc is the-way-it-is is hidden in the history of the implementation for GCOS or IBM 370 OS, not UNIX. Unfortunately, I can&#39;t seem to track down a copy of Bell Labs &#34;Computing Science Technical Report #31&#34;, which seems to be the appropriate reference.- `calloc` predates `malloc`. As you can see in the above code, there was a `malloc`-like function called just `alloc` (though there were also several other functions named `alloc` that allocated things other than memory). (Ok, fine, since V5 the kernel&#39;s internal memory allocator happened to be named `malloc`, but it worked differently[1]).[0]: https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo/blob/Researc... (format with `nroff -ms usr/doc/iolib/iolib`)[1]: https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo/blob/Researc..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Does anyone know if this is actually true?By that, I mean the title of this article, &#39;Why does calloc exist?&#39;. My guess would be that back in the origins of the C library:1) Few cared about automatic overflow checks, that was a job for the programmer, so it seems unlikely the creators added calloc() specifically so that it could check if m * n overflowed (after all, there are loads of libc calls that will shoot you in the foot if you don&#39;t do overflow/buffer size checks)2) calloc() is ancient, probably pre-dating many virtual memory optimisations, and back then, memory was relatively fast vs instruction execution, so adding calloc() to speed up giant memory allocations would be less impactful. But that&#39;s just a hunch, and I&#39;m often surprised by just how sophisticated early UNIX code was. Early computing was slow, every performance gain you could squeeze out of the system mattered and if there were VMs that could defer zeroing memory until it was really needed then people would probably try to do that.But my guess is, calloc() was simply a helper function, added because it was very common to malloc() some memory and then zero it straight away. Does anyone know the actual history?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The author was doing the right thing with explaining it only makes sense when you know the history of how we got to where we are - but there is a bit more to it. It is all a series of band-aids. Band-aids all the way down. As somebody who has been involved with AWS since 2012 I&#39;ve seen them all get added incrementally in response to explosions in usage and complexity and customer unhappiness and frustration.Explicit allows being all you can do in an IAM policy were easy(ish) when there was a handful of AWS services and API actions. As there were more and more services and policy actions etc. they became unwieldy. Enter Permission Boundaries where you could wrap a few explicit denies around them. Kubernetes RBAC is nearly at the same place and could now really use those too - but I digress.Also, early on in my AWS journey, even two accounts (one non-prod and one prod) was only done half the time and viewed as a best practice to think about - people genrally just opened one AWS account. But when IAM wasn&#39;t enough (i.e. there wasn&#39;t enough granularity on the resources or the conditions exposed etc.) the answer became separate AWS accounts as the only, or at least the easiest, way enforce these authorization boundaries/separations with a blunt instrument you could trust. It also helped to keep your bills straight before they would do things like break them down by Tag.Then you often needed cross-account role assumptions to deal with the inevitable cases where things or people needed access between these accounts.Then the explosion in AWS Accounts led to AWS Organizations to provision and manage them all. And it built in Service Control Policies and OUs as a tool/layer to help further manage/constrain IAM policies/permissions (IAM policies, Permission Boundaries and SCPs now being in a venn diagram with each other these days).But AWS Organizations managing heaps of accounts was also too painful to use and get right and so they brought in AWS Control Tower to help make setting up Organizations easier.So, in short, this all makes sense when you understand the inability to totally rewrite/refactor important complex systems used by customers (breaking backward compatibility) and instead trying to keep solving all the challenges with an steady stream of incremental band-aids that you can announce at re:Invent."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Almost ALL manuals for setting up something on AWS, third party tools, and sometimes AWS official tools, effectively have a step that requires admin permissions, like being able to attach arbitrary policies to an instance.At that point you can either:- give everybody Admin access- involve the same 2 or 3 trusted people in processes that they shouldn&#39;t really be involved- dig down into permissions to try to build something yourself that apparently the people writting the manuals gave up on doingLooks very bleak, anybody has a different view in this? Seems unlikely that big organizations work like this on AWS."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Rant: I&#39;m glad the author called out GCP as well, but the idea that it&#39;s the user&#39;s fault for granting too many permissions is absurd. Has the author tried doing this at scale? Try a super simple example: I want a user to have access to query a schema in BigQuery. Can you guess the magic combo of permissions that is going to take? Because the documentation is not going to correctly tell you. Thus after spending way too much time trying to get it done one ends up widely over-permissioning to just get the damn thing to work. You could argue their model is sound and it&#39;s just that how they aggregated permissions into roles is absurd or even just argue that they need better defined roles and I would accept that, but still it&#39;s quite frustrating as is. I mean just look at the length of the reference: https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m so happy to see this. It should live on folklore.org. The librarians were heroes (loved the &#34;pink slips&#34;, ha ha).I was an engineer at the time — my manager had apparently heard a little bird and told his reports that we might want to go through the Apple Library and check out any books that looked interesting ... because we would likely not ever have to return them.I grabbed Foley and Van Dam, maybe a few others. It was sad to see the library go but having only been at Apple for two years, perhaps it served to give me a taste of what Mr. Jobs at the helm would be like."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Every corporate librarian or archivist keeps a plan to save their archives in their back pocket. We have to. Corporate archives can come under attack at any time when someone in power—a new CEO, a legal department, the consulting firm behind an acquisition, even a random IT person cleaning up servers—suddenly doesn’t like the idea of a bunch of old stuff lying around. (If you want to know how the Hewlett-Packard Company Archives was saved after enduring a major spinoff, 6 CEOs in 10 years and a company split, read my 2020 article.)I like the idea that corporate librarians and archivists know they have a professional and ethical responsibility that supersedes what the current corporate leadership believes is their current business interest. (Think about the reasons someone would decide they don&#39;t &#34;like the idea of a bunch of old stuff lying around&#34;)Engineers could use some of this too.It is striking to me how the library staff is all smiling big on their last day of work -- because they know they saved the archives, without Steve Jobs noticing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Exported to PDF in case this get taken down by Apple.&gt;But then I read the New York Times article about Laurene Jobs starting the Steve Jobs Archive. Here’s what that article said.&gt;When Mr. Jobs returned to Apple in 1997, a dozen years after he was forced out, one of the first things he did was offer Stanford University the company’s corporate archives, said Henry Lowood, the curator of Stanford libraries’ History of Science and Technologies Collections. “Stanford had a signed document from Apple’s legal department within 24 hours, allowing it to transport some 800 boxes from the company’s campus to the university.”This story wasn&#39;t made up by her. It was reported, may be misreporting, may be Apple&#39;s Submarine PR for years. And she kept the story going. ( So to speak )And then this interview [1] with Jony, Tim Cook and Laurene Jobs. I guess people can make up their own mind after watching the interview. But if anything a lot of what was being said by Tim Cook and Laurene Jobs was repeating what Steve had said publicly. Intentionally or not.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdvzYtgmIjs"</p>
