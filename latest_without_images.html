								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been using Signal for a long time. I have repeatedly been unable to convince iOS users to use Signal because &#34;I don&#39;t want another app&#34;. Android users have been much more willing to give it a shot.As an android user myself, I much prefer having SMS built in because I use the search feature often to look back through all my SMS/Signal chats. I also regularly forward an SMS message to a Signal user, or vice versa. I&#39;m already starting to feel like those iOS users who told me &#34;I don&#39;t want another app&#34;...Signal seems to be trying to move further and further from &#34;my preferred way to chat with people&#34; and closer to the chat equivalent of &#34;that protonmail account I only log in to when I need secrecy&#34;.I obviously love having security on messages in transit, but I also like being able to keep my message history around and search my conversations for something that happened a year ago. It seems like Signal is on a trajectory to turn everything into disappearing messages. Are they the &#34;safe for activists&#34; communication app, or the &#34;let&#39;s try to make as many as possible safer by default&#34; app? Feels like they don&#39;t know.And on top of it all the messaging is just frustrating. &#34;we&#39;ve taken away an incredibly useful and heavily used feature so we have development resource to better implement shitcoins and such&#34; is such an irritating defense of the decision that I disabled my monthly donation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is an awful decision. I&#39;ve converted some friends and family to Signal over the past years (it took a while) and it is now their default messaging app on their phones. This is going to confuse them and is going to make it difficult for me to keep convincing them that Signal is the route to use. (&#34;Why do I need 3 apps (Android Messages, Signal, Whatsapp) to talk to people?&#34;)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m very upset by this decision. I&#39;ve been using Signal as my SMS app for a very long time.Messages that I would have sent via SMS currently will automatically get sent via Signal if the person I&#39;m sending to has started using Signal without my knowledge. This has happened in several instances where I was pleasantly surprised to see a friend had started using Signal. Now that I&#39;m forced into a separate SMS app, this will no longer be a possibility. I certainly won&#39;t be firing up Signal to see if a contact has joined before sending them an SMS."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Eh.  If you don&#39;t want to donate, don&#39;t, but I don&#39;t quite get the outrage here.  The Wikimedia Foundation is still small as far as charities go and is visibly making Wikipedia better: the new UI is a breath of fresh air, and given the insane complexity of MediaWiki markup, the visual editor is a piece of unimaginable technical wizardry.  Wiktionary is an unheralded gem and even Wikidata is starting to be genuinely useful.For what it&#39;s worth, Charity Navigator gives them 4 out of 4 stars with a 98.33/100 rating: https://www.charitynavigator.org/ein/200049703Meanwhile eg the American Cancer Society gets 73/100 and spends more on fundraising than WMF&#39;s entire budget, so oncologists can snort blow off hookers in Vegas, but nobody cares."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is this the same person who every now and then appears on HN utterly outraged by Wikipedia&#39;s fundraising?I donate to Wikipedia.And I am glad they have lots of money.  I do not feel outraged about it, I feel happy about it.I do not feel outraged that they use whatever persuasive tactics that they use - this is necessary in the modern world.Wikipedia is a great service, it should be valued.  They should not always be living close to the edge of going out of business.  How they spend their funds raised is their business.This anti Wikipedia person is really annoying and I wish they would stop their crusade.EDIT: it seems the outraged guy is a right wing Murdoch journalist.   Enough said, it all adds up.  I still remember how Murdoch ran a successful campaign here in Australia to sink the planned national fibre to the home broadband network - 10 years down the track we never got our national fibre network.  These guys hate tech, especially free information services like Wikipedia and national broadcasters like the ABC Australian Broadcasting Corporation - Murdoch wants to own it all and hates free."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Man, Wikipedia is like the best website I can think of. No joke.No silly 25MB framework, no hype, no popup banners (except the donation), no ads, no tracking, doesn&#39;t ask to sign up when I scroll down, no paywall...Just doing it&#39;s thing providing all the world with all knowledge for free, in a lot of languages.These managers can earn $4 million for all I care.Hell, I work for a mid-sized company that doesn&#39;t even come close to being as useful as Wikipedia and our C-suite earns a million a year."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a former researcher with multiple high-impact publications I can 100% confirm it:- when I was a researcher in Italy for an unknown lab, all of our articles were generally very scrutinized and went through years of reviews before publication- when I worked in Michal Graetzel[1]&#39;s laboratory things get published much more easily on more higher impact journals with less scrutiny. Not only most of the publications didn&#39;t really add much to the scientific knowledge, but they didn&#39;t even have the very high standards required when I was in ItalyWhy is this bad? You get more funding the more you publish...So labs that publish easier due to the names involved get much more money...which they can use to publish even more and get even more money...which they can use to publish even more...There&#39;s excellent scientists anywhere, really. But funding, fame and politics are extremely asymmetric in academia.[1]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Gr%C3%A4tzel"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I was an undergrad in college, I helped design a study on the role of gender perception in expertise.We had a piece of text that the subjects (undergrads) would read and rate the expertise of. We had the same text but we randomized whether the name would be a commonly male name, a commonly female name, or initials.We also randomized if they&#39;d watch a clip of men&#39;s sports beforehand (men&#39;s basketball), women&#39;s sports beforehand (women&#39;s basketball), or no sports. And finally we randomized whether the person giving the subjects instructions would be a young woman (one of my classmates) or a young man (me).Our small study showed what you&#39;d expect- students- men and women students rated male writers more highly than female writers, and initials were right in the middle, though they tended to be more like responses for men.The tester&#39;s gender made no difference that we found.The sports thing made a measurable difference, but it didn&#39;t reverse the skew.My 18/19 year old self was somewhat skeptical we&#39;d find a difference, but I was totally wrong. It taught me a lot about bias and perception, which this study also shows."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Double-anonymous/blind reviewing is completely standard in most areas of computer science, e.g. networking (SIGCOMM, NSDI, IMC, HotNets, MobiCom, MobiSys), systems (OSDI, SOSP, USENIX ATC, HotOS), security (Usenix Security, S&amp;P), machine learning (NeurIPS and ICML), graphics and HCI (SIGGRAPH and CHI), and at least some top-tier theory conferences (like FOCS).So I think most computer scientists would agree with the article&#39;s conclusion that double-anonymous reviewing, while flawed, is better than the alternatives. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve done a non-anonymous submission in 10 years, and as a reviewer, usually I don&#39;t have a strong guess about who wrote the paper (and when I think I know, often I turn out to be wrong). It&#39;s a little annoying that this news article in Nature Magazine ignores the longstanding widespread prevalence of this practice in a conference-driven (but... we like to think important) academic discipline. :-)But:
(1) I don&#39;t think the big benefit of double-anonymous reviewing is that a lousy paper from a Nobel laureate (or, from CMU/Berkeley/MIT/Stanford) isn&#39;t let in unfairly. To me the big benefit seems to be that reviewers have to review every paper as if it might be from their friends or a famous person, and consequently have to review each paper with due care and try sincerely to understand its contribution, which maybe they wouldn&#39;t do if they knew it&#39;s from some random place/author they&#39;ve never heard of or don&#39;t think highly of. I think the way it affects judgment may be more in equalizing time/effort spent to read and understand a paper (and the generosity you give a paper because &#34;maybe&#34; it was written by your friend or somebody you respect), rather than a straight-up bias towards liking whatever the faculty at a famous university are writing about this year.(2) While I do think it&#39;s true, and a good thing, that double-anonymous reviewing helps &#34;marginalized groups of authors who often struggle to have their work see the world&#34; as the lead researcher says, we should probably acknowledge that authors are not the only beneficiaries of a scientific publication. The interests of the reader matter too -- the journal or conference has some duty to serve them. On the margin, maybe some readers would be more interested to learn what Albert Einstein is thinking about these days, or would like to see a well-balanced conference program that includes a good talk by a known-provocative speaker, instead of one more random (but adequate!) paper from a nobody. I&#39;m not saying we should give a huge weight to this -- it&#39;s fine to make people eat their vegetables, but, I don&#39;t think we should act like scientific publication is only to give authors a line on their CV and the readers&#39; preference is 100% irrelevant. A scientific journal shouldn&#39;t exclusively serve the authors. (Other kinds of media care way too much about what the reader wants, e.g. Facebook giving you whatever it thinks will keep you clicking things on Facebook, but there is probably a happy medium somewhere.)(3) The challenging frontier may be in grant submission and reviewing, where proposers are typically not anonymous to the reviewers, which surely leads to some biases. I have heard about government programs where they did use double-anonymous reviewing and it seemed weird to me. (Probably this is a situation where track record should matter, yet trying to summarize your own track record while remaining effectively anonymous seems really hard...)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As someone who&#39;s been closely following the Infowars/Free Speech Systems trials (watched all the depos, trial footage, etc.), all I can say is that I&#39;m glad these families are finally getting justice. Even though I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be tied up in appeals for awhile (and reduced on appeal), hopefully it&#39;ll prevent future harassment campaigns against families when tragedies occur.And before anyone says &#34;but why wasn&#39;t Jones given a trial to determine his guilt? The first amendment is under attack!&#34;, Infowars has repeatedly failed to prepare its employees for depositions, refused to respond to discovery requests, and has perjured itself numerous times. The default judgements received in both this and the Texas cases were well deserved, and anyone with a less explosive personality and media presence would have been given far fewer chances to comply."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is great news, but we should temper our expectations: It&#39;s likely that Jones will appeal and keep this tied up for years before he has to pay anything. Even if he is eventually obligated to pay some amount, it is unlikely to be what the jury just decided. And even if it is what the jury just decided, Jones&#39; company is already &#34;bankrupt&#34; (yet still on the air) and he will almost certainly avoid liability through all the useful tools and entities available to a person who has hundreds of millions of dollars in the first place. And through all this, he will probably remain on the air spouting his lies - as he is literally right now as I write this post.In sum, it&#39;s good to know that we&#39;re trying to hold him to account, but it seems unlikely that this stops him in any material way from just continuing on the way he has been.Our system is not setup for situations that involve faith as bad as Jones&#39;, on the part of people who have not themselves committed an obvious violent crime."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a good verdict - defamation in the media is a very serious problem. It&#39;s unfortunate that it took a person like Alex Jones to convince people of it. If anything he should not be taken seriously. Those who are taken seriously have gotten away with much worse by merely apologizing or correcting themselves (as he did as well).As for the amount - the highest fine paid by Wall Street firms for the 2008 crisis was less than $100M. One of those numbers is unjust for sure."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This looks really promising. But by far the biggest moat that Jetbrains is going to have to cross to get into VSCode territory is the plugin ecosystem. Personally I work on React projects so my first thought was: &#34;is there a Prettier[1] plugin?&#34;. Looking through the landing page it looks like Plugins are in the works but until that is implemented, it&#39;s going to be hard adopting it.ALSO I just noticed this but can someone (ideally from JetBrains) explain what this line means: &#34;Requires login and periodic connection to JetBrains servers to verify the project&#34; (specifically the last 3 words of that sentence). Quite frankly this line is extremely alarming, are you saying that you&#39;re scanning my project to make sure it&#39;s not a &#34;professional&#34; project? I&#39;m going to assume this line means that they are checking the IDE and not your source but I won&#39;t be using this product until I get an explanation for this. You can find this at the very bottom in the licensing and pricing section.[1]: https://prettier.io/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I installed this 30 min ago.1. My M1 temp went from 28c to 60c2. CPU utilization to 103%?3. It&#39;s using 3.29Gb of RAMAnd it hasn&#39;t changed.With a single python project with 3k lines of code.VSCode sits at 280Mb and CPU temp around 28c.Edit:Vim + SpaceVim sitting at 17Mb :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So I tried it out. I own a CLion license and have been using Jetbrains products since IntelliJ 3.0. It seems ok, but very very VSCode-ish.I tried it with our Rust codebase and it seemed to be fairly competitive with CLion in terms of analysis. I didn&#39;t try any refactorings but I did notice that it doesn&#39;t have many of them. It was fairly snappy, felt more responsive than CLion. I was disappointed that even after I switched it to &#34;IntelliJ&#34; keybindings many keybindings still were more like VSCode than IntelliJ. I.e. Ctrl-N was still &#34;open new tab&#34; and not &#34;jump to symbol&#34; (have to do ctrl-shift-alt-N for that.)Overall, I guess I&#39;m curious where they go with it. I won&#39;t be trading in my CLion license, though. I am probably not the target audience; I suspect they&#39;re looking to capture customers who work in large corporations where VSCode is getting penetration as a hosted/fleet solution. With the default keybindings I suspect those coming from VSCode will find Fleet very comfortable.For myself, I continue to give Jetbrains money for their IDEs, because as a company they do great work and give good value. I&#39;m happy to modestly help pay the salaries of their employees. I wish them luck."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Funnily enough when you look at the countries in the &#39;happiness index&#39; they all happen to be countries which fundamentally have pretty good underlying economies (and often they tend to be from european countries that have decent social support structure).Well-being is probably a third-order effect from a strong economy, good healthcare / social care, culture and a variety of other factors. But because it is a third-order it is very hard to measure the impact of policy, because:* They are &#39;arms length&#39; from policy changes.* The indexes are slow to respond to changes.* They are noisy and affected by unrelated factors (i.e. does a colder winter decrease happiness?)* A policy which improves well-being today could very well decrease well-being far into the future (e.g. increasing a countries spending and decreasing tax)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; So — suppose we give this sort of combined well-being survey to a random sample of people, and also measure what products and services they&#39;ve used and purchased. From this dataset, we could make reasonable statistical inferences about the amount of well-being increase or decrease associated with a certain product or service among a certain class of people.Unfortunately, no, you can&#39;t.  There are lots and lots of problems.  Just a few off the top of my head:1.  The effects of products are not uniform across the population.  Alcohol, for example, catalyzes well-being for some people, but for others it has a dramatic negative effect.2.  The effects of consumption on well-being change with the time horizon over which you measure them.  Eating ice cream might improve my subjective well-being today, but harm it tomorrow when it has a deleterious effect on my health.3.  Externalities.  Owning a private jet might improve my subjective well-being, but harm everyone else&#39;s with its noise and emissions.Measuring economic output is actually a not-entirely-unreasonable proxy for measuring well-being because in a free market people presumably make rational choices and spend their money in a way that maximizes their well-being.  The problem is not that the proxy is wrong, the problem is that people turn out not to be very good at making these choices.  It&#39;s not entirely their fault.  A big part of the problem is information asymmetry: producers know a lot more about the potential negative outcomes of their products than consumers do.I think a much better way to tackle this problem is with education and stronger consumer disclosure laws rather than trying to change the metric to something as poorly defined as &#34;well-being catalysis&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"And that is exactly what New Zealand started doing in 2019[0].A large problem with metrics is that they have a tendency of becoming a goal of their own. Instead of them being used as mere indicators, we end up with entire countries whose sole goal is to eternally increase their GDP - to the extent that it ends up harming the general population.People do not solely exist to generate revenue, and it is about time we stop pretending they do.[0]: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesellsmoor/2019/07/11/new-ze..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This study was in Chinese people who were overweight and were eating a lot of carbs (~300g a day). Presumably this was largely high GI rice. IF made a modest difference. They also lost some muscle mass, as expected. The study tested a lot of different variables, apparently without adjusting for multiple hypothesis testing.Hard to generalise these results. If you are eating a toxic diet, I guess more time without it is a good thing. A similar study in a Western population showed no effect of isocaloric IF [1]. In another study, IF with energy restriction in obese subjects was more effective than energy restriction without IF [2].I don’t see that the data supports IF as a universal strategy. If you are obese, then these studies suggest eating less, for less hours of the day and less at night is probably beneficial. Otherwise, as far as health interventions go, exercise has a much larger magnitude of benefit than dietary interventions. It also has the major advantage of simplicity - more exercise is better for everyone everywhere at every age [3]. Contrast this with the utterly confusing state of nutrition science. And exercise also makes a difference even when you do a little bit, whereas eating a little bit better does almost nothing.[1] https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullar...[2] https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/articl...[3] This is not 100% true. There are some contraindications to exercise for people with specific conditions.EDIT: When talking about the benefits of exercise versus diet, I mean the effects on health in general (mortality, lifespan, healthspan). Exercise isn&#39;t an effective method of weight loss as others have indicated."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m just skimming through the paper and I see no calorie equated control group or even measuring caloric intake.If that&#39;s the case than this is another &#34;eating less causes weight loss&#34; study, and measuring the benefits of caloric restriction.They don&#39;t even equate caloric restrictions between the methods they compare ?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Students break acceleration world record...for electric vehicles.This isn&#39;t close to the record for dragsters; if they can increase the energy density per unit mass there are traction and downforce improvements that can be used to improve this. It&#39;s very hard to beat chemical energy like detonating gasoline or nitromethane - you&#39;re looking at roughly a factor of 100, with ~40 MJ/kg for gasoline and 0.4 MJ/kg for a lithium ion battery - especially if you&#39;re racing through a 15 PSI gas that you can use in your chemical reaction without having to accelerate it onboard.I suspect that traction control for an electric motor may someday allow electric vehicles to exceed the records held by internal (well, mostly internal) combustion engines. You could keep the tire at exactly the right amount of slip for maximum acceleration, rather than trying to balance centrifugal clutches to get just the right amount of power at the right time.I wonder what the record is for a vehicle that can pick up electric energy from a tether/rail/overhead wire...though cables that can carry megawatts of energy are probably pretty heavy.Edit: I think the most interesting category here is the typical friction-propelled, human-carrying vehicle of either chemical or electric power sources. Railguns, rockets, fan cars (using active downforce), and vehicles which engage the ground by rack and pinion are qualitatively different. When the question is accelerating your own mass forwards using the friction developed by your own mass being pulled down by gravity, there&#39;s an interesting optimization problem trading off weight and power."</p>
