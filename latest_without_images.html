								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From the notes: &#34;These marginal design choices are not the only way to get an efficient unit, since the fridge compressors from the 1940&#39;s and 1950&#39;s era were very efficient, while having consistently longer lives. This failed unit is purely an example of doing just enough to get by until it is someone else&#39;s problem.&#34;I&#39;ve been seeing this as a common issue throughout most of the household appliances we&#39;ve tried to buy in the last ten years. They just don&#39;t last."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These studies never account for survivorship bias. There were plenty of crappy appliances decades ago, but they’ve all long since broken, so we only have the very best old appliances to compare against today.Also, the inflation adjusted cost of a fridge in the 50s was something like $10k. A $10k fridge today (e.g. Sub Zero) will easily last for many decades. A $1k Wal-Mart special will not."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Without numbers it&#39;s really hard to say how good or bad these engineering choices were in regards to the consumer to come out on top or not.In my experience appliances are a lot more efficient and cheaper than they used to be. My new stainless steel fridge has much more capacity while using the same amount of power than the 20yo one it replaced (Which didn&#39;t actually fail, but the white coating was rusting all over the place).My HE washer doesn&#39;t fill the entire tub compared to the old upright ones, so my water heater is used less, and spins at ~1,200rpm, greatly reducing dry times for my electric dryer. The recessed lighting in my house went from 90 watts per bulb to 12 watts for LED, and saves me $$ on cooling when needed. My tankless water heater heats up only the water being used, no more, no less.I&#39;m paying roughly 32¢/KW all-in (after taxes, fees etc.) for electricity in the Bay Area, so efficiency gains build up quickly over time.Anecdotally, the only issues I&#39;ve had so far have been with poorly engineered Samsung refrigerators, where the fans would seize due to ice buildup, not mechanical wear."</p>

Crypto libraries need a lot of testing and reviews by experts, which BearSSL doesn&#39;t have yet. Thomas Pornin is an incredibly smart guy when it comes to crypto and BearSSL is my crypto library of choice for small (mostly embedded) projects, too. Projects like this might help to get it the attention it needs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lebanese here. To answer some of the questions in this thread:- No, Lebanon does not follow Islamic Banking.- No, people can&#39;t make wire transfers anymore. All bank accounts are frozen, you can&#39;t withdraw your own money. You have to beg and wait in line for weeks to be able to get a tiny amount of your account to be able to buy bread etc.- The local currency collapsed, lost more than 90% of its value. If the bank decides to give you some change (from your own money), they play money conversion tricks so that e.g. your account is down $1,000 but you get $100 only.- This person did not &#34;rob&#34; the bank. He tried asking the bank for money because  his father (and some people said his child as well) were in the hospital, needed medical care, and for that the hospital needed money. He had $210K in his account, but the bank kept kicking him away in previous attempts to appeal to them. He came back with a gun, and held hostages. Negotiated until they give back $35K, to his brother who was waiting outside. Then he surrendered without hurting anyone.- He is now in bad health because he&#39;s on a hunger strike after they arrested him. (In the negotiation they promised him not to arrest him, but of course they need to make an example out of him.)- Why is this all happening? Bad economic and financial policies for 40 years, rampant corruption. The economy was unproductive, but they kept the local currency subsidized, as it turns out by just spending the money that people deposited in the banks. And it&#39;s all gone now."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;&#34;I mean even at Google (on a different team) I was a &#34;technical lead&#34; in my 20s, and let me tell you, I had noooo business leading anything technical of any importance. But this is very common! We would never accept this in other fields. Would you live in a house built entirely by junior carpenters in their late 20s who built one or two houses that barely stood up? Would you drive cars designed and built by junior engineers?&#34;one of the strangest and most baffling things about the entire industry tbh. Like, would you ever expect a 25 year old guy to command a spaceship? Yet in software you have these weekly &#34;I&#39;m 40, is my life over&#34; posts. In most disciplines people correctly acknowledge that there&#39;s a sweet spot of skill and experience that overlaps somewhere in your late 30s, 40s or even 50s, yet in software very often we recreate Lord of the Flies, leading to chaotic project management."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author is using the word a bit differently, but the fact that &#34;sprint&#34; has been normalized as a unit of work for software development, and developers are expected to be in a &#34;sprint&#34; more or less at all times, has always been a source of the deepest absurdity to me.A &#34;sprint&#34; is, almost by definition, a pace that&#39;s sustainable only for short periods. The fact that developers are expected to perform sprint after sprint endlessly, to view &#34;sprint&#34; as the default baseline pace, seems a ludicrous abuse of language."</p>

To add all the truth @aboodman wrote, both teams were amongst the best I’ve worked with, but Chrome was much healthier, happier and more supportive. Senior industry folks helped."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The book which taught me to &#34;really&#34; program is certainly the quirkiest that I&#39;ve ever read. &#34;Learn to Program with Visual Basic 6&#34; [0]My dad purchased it for me when I was nine. He didn&#39;t know how to program, but he took a stab in the dark. I diligently read through the whole book and worked through all of the lessons. It&#39;s written in a conversational, narrative style about a college course where the students produce a piece of software for a china shop.I think you&#39;d be hard-pressed to actually derive much value from this book unless you&#39;re keen to learn an antiquated version of Visual Basic and have the patience for a book targeted at absolute beginners, but it&#39;s definitely quirky. And for me, holds a lot of sentimental value.[0] https://www.amazon.com/Learn-Program-Visual-Basic-6/dp/19027..."</p>

After multiple attempts over 25 years, I&#39;m giving it another go this year and this time it is actually clicking.- Malicious Cryptography: Exposing Cryptovirology - Adam Young, Moti YungThis is way out of my league in terms of cryptography, but this fascinated me early in my career, and led me to implement one or the other algorithm. Very prescient in many ways.- Patterns of Software - Richard GabrielNot directly about computing, but I got a lot of deep insights from this book. It also brought me to the next book:- Notes on the synthesis of form - Christopher AlexanderThis is not a computing book per se, but it goes to the core of system architecture. Even in its original field, this book is kind of wild.- All Mathematica Guidebooks - Michael TrottMathematica is wild, these books are wild, they are old but still oh so inspiring."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; The culture of “we are awesome” has dominated most internal communications for the last couple of years, including in 2022. We all believed that we were awesome and would continue growing and winning.This is the big thing that drives me nuts.I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a fragility of ego thing or what the cause may be, but it results in a corporate inability to critically self-evaluate at the highest levels.  If you can&#39;t say where your weak areas are, you&#39;re not improving.One of the experiences that untreated ADHD blessed me with was routinely failing classes.  That repeated exposure to undeniable failure (and the consequences of it) really helped me accept that failure is the default.  If you&#39;re not constantly fighting against failure, you&#39;re failing.  You can&#39;t pretend that something didn&#39;t work out, or stop thinking about it because it hurts.The self congratulatory back-patting (even if it&#39;s just &#34;everything is fine, we&#39;re doing great&#34;) is treating success like an achievement.  Success requires vigilance.  Excellence is not an achievement, it&#39;s an activity.We need more leaders that talk about the things we could be doing better, and doing so inspirationally, not derogatorily.  It&#39;s ok that you&#39;re not the best at something.  Very few are.  That doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t or shouldn&#39;t do better.Try internalizing that if you&#39;re not constantly struggling to do better, you&#39;re not living up to your potential."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, that sounds so poorly handled.  Not figuring out a way to tell everyone affected at (nearly) the same time is probably the worst sin.Best layoff I ever went through was when my boss came to our team and said, &#34;look, don&#39;t tell anyone, but we have a layoff coming in a few days.  I have to let one of the three of you go.  Do you want me to decide or do you want to decide amongst yourselves?&#34;.  She knew we were good friends outside of work and would probably make a better choice than her.I ended up volunteering because one other guy had just bought a house and had a baby and the other guy had debts to pay off and I didn&#39;t.  Ended up working with both those guys again.  One of them ended up leaving and getting a new job, then he pulled me in after 1.5 years of unemployment, and then we pulled the last guy in after he eventually got let go."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I tried to get a big-ticket item using Klarna. Had the money in the bank, just thought I&#39;d give it a go. It failed multiple times without any sort of meaningful error message. Apparently each of those failed attempts hit my credit score. I told them to close my account multiple times through multiple channels (chat/email/etc.) and reverse any damage done to my credit score.Till this day I get monthly balance/statement emails from them even though I have yet to use a single penny of their credit facility. Too bad they don&#39;t use all that marketing budget on competent customer experience/service."</p>

What I hope to see one day is a Linux friendly laptop with an eInk display (frontlit for extra bonus [1]).  I wouldn&#39;t use it as a replacement, but for quickly grabbing when spending a few hours outside.  Maybe Framework or MNT Reform could do it?[1] the Dasung has multiple settings for the backlight and it&#39;s an absolute necessity for using it indoors.EDIT: backlit -&gt; frontlit, silly me.ADD: PineNote is also promising as it support BLE and thus could be used with remote keyboard/mouse."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, this is great! I&#39;ve been hoping for eInk with good refresh for years, and seeing it in action in your demo is very cool.&gt; The screen can refresh up to 30 times per second, this will degrade the eInk display rapidly. Do not use with fast changing content like videos.Have you noticed the degraded display in your Kobo? I imagine it&#39;s not uniform across all pixels, since editing would mostly be localized to your cursor area (though scrolling and other actions would be wider). I&#39;d also be interested in hearing what the timeline looked like for the quality drop, since it sounds like it&#39;s a function of the total number refreshes for each pixel."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; The Supreme Court held that the Defendants did not access an unauthorized or restricted information network and found Defendants not guilty of violating the Information Protection Act based on the following findings: (i) there was no objective evidence showing that access to Yanolja’s API server was restricted or that Yanolja has implemented any technical measures blocking unauthorized access; (ii) Yanolja’s general terms of use was clearly applicable to registered users only; (iii) Yanolja’s general terms of use did not prohibit use of packet capture and scraping, which was used by Defendants; (iv) Yanolja’s API server was accessible via mobile app and a PC web browser; and (v) there was no reason to restrict access to Yanolja’s API server, as it was not used for storing valuable business information.I am not a South Korean lawyer (or any lawyer), but basically this just means you do have to actually put effort into restricting access to information if you want to sue someone over illegally accessing it, right?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On the one hand, I do think that scraping should be legal, on the other hand, I maintain a lot of websites and scrapers are a gigantic pain in the ass that make hosting a popular site for normal people cost-prohibitive (you need to scale up servers or invest engineering time to prevent scraping).This can only lead to a more centralised web where only rich people can afford to host content.There needs to be a solution like some kind of internet metadata archive, distributed on IPFS or something where bots can get their data if they want."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the bar to whether something is an &#34;illegal data breach&#34; or not, should be whether the security is half-decent according to most security researchers. Because in cases like these (and the one where someone almost got arrested for clicking &#34;view source&#34;), the vast majority of security researchers will agree that the security was terrible and irresponsible.Even scraping public data could be a gray area e.g. if you&#39;re scraping a huge amount of possible addresses or de-aggregating on a massive scale. More importantly, you could say that you are doing this, e.g. claim that you found a &#34;secret&#34; 64-bit key by evaluating every possible one. But if your data is accessible via simple API requests, clearly there is limited &#34;guessing&#34; or brute-force going on."</p>

There is no MAC, so no integrity check for the ciphertextI imagine this is to prevent accidental disclosure of sensitive data through basic tools (only) like grep, and Spotlight.Also to prevent layman attempts at tweaking the files in a text editor like one used to do tweaking save files as a kid.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Surely there is a better fix to a deserialization exploit than just making every new app implement `bool dontBeHackable { return true; }`??Even just, I don&#39;t know, forcing all builds to silently include this property in the compiled output - I mean, interacting with  OS app state data files should be abstracted away from the programmer anyway, so it shouldn&#39;t matter if they&#39;re signed/encrypted behind the scenes, just handle it automatically, right?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Changing a security model that has been used for decades to a more restrictive model is difficult, especially in something as complicated as macOS. Attaching debuggers is just one example, there are many similar techniques that could be used to inject code into a different process. Apple has squashed many of these techniques, but many other ones are likely still undiscovered.&gt; Aside from Apple’s own code, these vulnerabilities could also occur in third-party software. It’s quite common to find a process injection vulnerability in a specific application, which means that the permissions (TCC permissions and entitlements) of that application are up for grabs for all other processes. Getting those fixed is a difficult process, because many third-party developers are not familiar with this new security model. Reporting these vulnerabilities often requires fully explaining this new model! Especially Electron applications are infamous for being easy to inject into, as it is possible to replace their JavaScript files without invalidating the code signature.It makes me sad that we are likely not going to see any new fundamental design rethink for security&#39;s sake in mainstream operating systems. It is cost prohibitive at this point to do something that gets security right for the world of 2022 and yet not break all the apps which would never be rewritten!Mobile OSes were a good break off point as far as security goes but that came with a lot of functionality sacrifice.Although something like QubesOS can theoretically dream of being semi-mainstream with support from hardware and OSS OS vendors like RH/Suse/Canonical or even Microsoft."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve programmed for a long time. One of the best programmer&#39;s I&#39;ve known actually had his own debugger. He was an OS kernel developer and carried the debugger with him from job to job; we were working on the new operating system at IBM that would become AIX. He was a bit of a nuisance in the large development organization because he would wander around the kernel in his debugger fixing code before others had even noticed the defects.We were working on a distributed file system, and I had complained that we couldn&#39;t be expected to finish on the same deadline as the hardware device driver teams and the network stack teams. How would we even develop our software if we didn&#39;t have any working communication between machines? Well, my friend came to the rescue and wrote the kernel support for the NIC and a comm stack up to the level of UDP (having a debugger helped).Eventually, the managers of the other departments that wouldn&#39;t cut my team any slack on our schedule started coming around to ask us for help because they were falling behind schedule. They were responsible for the official development of the network device drivers and networking, and it turned out they didn&#39;t have a working kernel debugger like we had (thanks to my friends personal one), so they had fallen behind schedule while we were already making good time on our distributed file system running on top of the our own hacked together temporary device drivers and networking code. I had to lend the teammate and his debugger to the other two teams to help them with their schedules."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Such a joy to listen to Carmack talk about just about anything.Not sure if it&#39;s an age thing but there is a particular feeling common to contemporaries of that era, growing up in our formative years as computers grew from their humble beginnings to the incredible machines we have now. At that time, each new improvement brought astounding differences in capability. In the space of 10 years we went from 8k to 64k of memory, 4 colors to 256 colours to 16k colors to 16M colours. Resolution from 320x200 to 640x480 to 1024x768, which was close to photo-realistic (for the time, an amazing capability). I remember how revolutionary it was when I first got a computer that could render 80 columns of characters - rather than 40. Storage went from tapes to floppy drives storing a hundred kb of data to MB to hard drives storing GB of data. Every time one of these changes happened, a vista of opportunity opened up to explore and innovate and figure out what you could do with the new capabilities. Writing code in those times was all about deeply understanding the internal capabilities of the machine you had and how to get the most out of them.Something about that process forged a deep appreciation for the fundamentals of hardware and software that I don&#39;t know how anybody could get these days."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been trying to listen to the whole thing (it&#39;s 5 hours!), and there are some really interesting moments. Albeit, a bit too much talk on old video games that aren&#39;t from my generation, but I&#39;m sure this will be interesting to some people to.What I found interesting:* he has insane hours and has never burnt out. He says that if you want to achieve big things in your life, you need to work a lot. He also says that as long as he&#39;s working, and making progress (and he always makes progress when he keeps trying, reminds me of Linus), then he can withstand his hours and pressure.* he learns a lot through reading computer science books* he is really big on simplicity, seems to appreciate Golang and its design, and he&#39;s not into metaprogramming on C++. I really like that he&#39;s focused on building things that work, and can be maintained, and not that interested in theory and advanced concepts that don&#39;t seem to bring him much. He also says he spent some time on the functional side, and that probably made him a better programmer, but he&#39;s back doing C++.* he talks about the sort of hacking community he felt part of, where you just wrote code and shared it and reused other people&#39;s code. It really feels like open source is something else, made me feel bad about all these patents, and weird licenses (even Apache 2 or MIT) and academic people whining about credits. Wish we could just share and use whatever and be happy with it :(* Agree with him, VSCode is THE IDE. It&#39;s much better than emacs IMO (I&#39;ve tried using vim many times but couldn&#39;t).* 8-9 diet cokes a day. Holy fuck. That&#39;s a lot of caffein (and I&#39;m guessing not good for the teeth)"</p>
