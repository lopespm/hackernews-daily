								<p class="story__comment_others">"It’s odd to me that the Ryanair flight yesterday was already closer to its destination of Vilnius than Minsk when it turned around.Ryanair said that the crew had been &#34;notified by Belarus (Air Traffic Control) of a potential security threat on board and were instructed to divert to the nearest airport, Minsk&#34;.So they didn’t have an incident onboard? There were no hijackers claiming to have a bomb? Just ATC telling them they have a bomb on board? And instead of landing at the nearest airport of Vilnius they turned to take a longer, more indirect route to a further away airport of Minsk?This would seem obviously suspicious to me. If you have a bomb on board, wouldn’t you want to go to the nearest airport, not the one further away? Wouldn’t you ask why you are being redirected further away? Then wouldn’t the response when you point out you’re closer to Vilnius and for safety want to land there make it clear to you something fishy was up? I would love to hear the radio communications and any communications back to Ryanair operations on this one."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think what the CountThings app is doing is great. There are too many industries where tasks are being performed inefficiently due to a lack of applying readily available technology. They had the foresight to develop a product for a very common problem and make a business out of it.I’m a bit surprised that this is making the rounds of HN though. OpenCV and other computer vision libraries have trivialized such counting applications for decades now. ML isn’t really necessary.The watershed algorithm for example, comes built-in and allows segmentation which can then be followed up with blob counting: http://www.cmm.mines-paristech.fr/~beucher/wtshed.htmlI don’t want to diminish OP’s work since the product seems to be well-developed and respond to a real need. I guess the challenge must have been making the app robust enough to support different workloads, lighting conditions, etc. I suppose the novelty factor is seeing to what extent the technology that we as developers and engineers work on every day is often disconnected from practical application."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; [mapping memory WX] hasn&#39;t been forbidden on any of the prior platforms that Dolphin supportsWell, rarely completely forbidden, but e.g. I think OpenBSD has been W^X by default for quite some time (though IIRC with a WX allowed flag per… FS mount?). Now on FreeBSD it&#39;s not default but it&#39;s there, and if you turn it on, you have to mark WX-mapping binaries by running `elfctl -e +wxneeded`.Firefox actually became W^X compliant all the way back in 2015: https://jandemooij.nl/blog/wx-jit-code-enabled-in-firefox/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It’s always nice to see Dolphin news. I dunno why they’re so surprised over the JITs syncing in some games, though. I suppose a lot could go wrong, but only a few games seemed to have especially strong reliance on floating point behaviors to begin with, and I sort of expect the behavior of JITs to be influenced by the interpreter a bit due to the way things are laid out in dolphin.I tried porting a much simpler JIT to M1 and ran into the problem that Rosetta 2 was simply better at translating an AMD64 JIT than my attempt at a JIT. It could’ve been related to W^X performance, but I actually suspect the real answer is that Rosetta’s optimization passes were doing things the JIT did not do natively. I don’t know how to debug that, though, because from the debugger’s PoV, emulated processes look just like native Intel processes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The author&#39;s definition of what makes a &#34;decentralized application&#34; is too strong and I don&#39;t agree that email isn&#39;t an example of a decentralized application. She argues that it&#39;s not because it&#39;s really hard to run your own mail server.To me, &#34;decentralized&#34; doesn&#39;t mean every user has to run their own node. It means it&#39;s an open network, anyone can join, and there&#39;s no centralized control / censorship. You can buy a domain and use Proton, Fastmail, or any other provider to have your own email. If you become unhappy with them, it&#39;s easy to move. We have open specs that allow every service to interoperate, so you don&#39;t need to know or care what provider your recipient is using."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The decentralized applications don&#39;t need to &#34;win&#34; (in market share) to be successful. They just need to be viable alternatives for a non-insignificant number of principled people willing to use them. This is enough to ensure that big players are kept in check. It&#39;s a basic application of Taleb&#39;s &#34;Minority Rule&#34; [0]I don&#39;t care that gmail has the majority of the market. I care that Google can not simply break compatibility with SMTP/IMAP and force everyone into their version of it. And no, &#34;it&#39;s hard to self-host&#34; is not enough of an argument. There are plenty of smaller professional hosting companies and as long as there is an option this is enough to stop Google from monopolizing the market.Likewise, I don&#39;t care that Matrix still doesn&#39;t have a perfectly polished client. As long as it lets me talk and have video calls with my family and friends without being forced into WhatsApp or iMessage or whatever closed solution is popular, I&#39;m willing to deal with its inconveniences and shortcomings. Bugs can be fixed, privacy violations can&#39;t.Crypto as well. For all the talk about &#34;investment opportunities&#34; in crypto and the &#34;get rich quick&#34; schemes, there are still a good number of people working on it that understand that the important thing is to have an alternative to the existing financial system.The worst part of the article though is not that it presents a problem that does not exist, it&#39;s the proposed solution: political intervention and regulation always works out in favor of the status quo.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"All I can really say in response to this article is that I expect it to age poorly.2021 is just a bad time to make confident pronouncements about decentralization. The vast majority of the population is living in Facebook/WhatsApp/Discord/Visa&amp;Mastercard land, sure.But I&#39;m a heavy Matrix user, it works great. I torrent all the time: it works great. I&#39;m also on urbit, and it works great. I don&#39;t use Mastodon personally but I hear few complaints from people who do. Podcasts are fine, other applications of RSS are pretty crippled by bad defaults of only including a little bit of the blog post, but Substack at least doesn&#39;t do it that way, which has me using an RSS reader again. It&#39;s nice!The big elephant is the cybercoins, and it&#39;s just a weird time to declare them a failure. It&#39;s like no one remembers 2017, this has practically been a carbon copy, just with more institutional buy-in and bigger numbers.No one knows if cryptocurrency is going to fulfill the promise of becoming a global store of value, let alone if it will be Bitcoin or Ethereum or some dark horse: but it pretty much has to go from worth nothing to worth everything, and the middle stages of that are going to be weird.The one I&#39;m really betting on is Matrix, though. They have reliable income from the French and German governments, and plenty of motive to make a really good platform. I fully expect them to be as slick and featureful as Slack and Discord within a couple of years, and start to eat those company&#39;s lunch.&#34;Redecentralization&#34; is harder than the first phase of building a green-field decentralized Internet, because there are entrenched powers with a head start. But there are some compelling advantages to decentralized technology, with means, motive, and opportunity, to build them out.Yeah. Don&#39;t think it will age well. Let&#39;s check back in around 2031 and see what actually happened."</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27257641">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Vitalik is consistently one of the most interesting people to follow in the blockchain space. Even his (5+ year) old writing is quite interesting, if nothing else to see how Ethereum&#39;s research thinking has evolved over time.A few questions re: why &#34;Ethereum is not going further than quadratic [sharding].&#34;The first reason given: there&#39;s a minimum number of nodes required for shard for safety guarantees. So, a couple hundred shards, each with 1000 users seems like a limit. But I wonder: 10 years from now, if the blockchain (maybe pipe?) dreams succeed, then why do we expect 1000 * 500 = 5M nodes? This seems like it&#39;s quite small.Especially if running a node on a phone ever becomes reasonable, or at least participating in the data availability process is possible here, then why would we not go further?The second reason for non-super-quadratic sharding is data permanence. But here, couldn&#39;t we design different shards with different appetites for data permanence. Sure, NFTs currently are forever, but I can think of many applications where users do not give a damn about data permanence, and even some applications where users would prefer if data was just forgotten about.In which case, what&#39;s stopping us from saying &#34;these shards, we save. The other ones, who cares about.&#34; We would want users to opt into such guarantees, of course, but it seems reasonably possible.Of course, let&#39;s get a good sharded blockchain before we optimize for more.I&#39;m excited to see how sharding research continues to involve and drives the cost per TX (economic and environmental) down. Consider me a cheerleader rooting for you all!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This has some really questionable assumptions.
Like the part about permanence.&#34;An important property of a blockchain that users really value is permanence. A digital asset stored on a server will stop existing in 10 years when the company goes bankrupt or loses interest in maintaining that ecosystem. An NFT on Ethereum, on the other hand, is forever.&#34;This is wrong 2 times.First, there is no general requirement of permanent storage. Its not important at all. It solely depend on the use case. Thats why it is very much inefficient to use a DLT with that property to move value (btc/eth etc.). I dont care how my coins was moved 10 years ago. The only storage that is relevant for me, now, for value transfer is the current undisputed state (aka the balances). Sure the Tx history has use cases and people who need them should store them but making that a technical requirement is only going to degrade performance and drive up Tx cost.BTW cash does not have a recorded Tx history who thought &#34;p2p cash&#34; should?
Its only because of the way BTC works (chain of all Tx) that this &#34;believe&#34; became common. Its technically not needed at all. There is absolutely no reason to recreate the whole chain to come to the current state. You either use the current state or you cant participate. If you would find an error in the chain whatcha gonna do about? Nothing. The current majority accepted state is all that matters. The &#34;validation&#34; is placebo it does nothing. And by running the exact same software as anyone else your validation would simply do the same error if there would be one.Second, the &#34;forever&#34; is a blatant lie. There is no way to know. Its will exist for however long at least someone is willing to store it. Exactly the same is true if storing is optional. But without the downside of crippling the performance and impose cost on the people running the DLT.
The cost for storage should be paid by the user of the storage.
If I can impose cost on all participants of a decentral system for all eternity with a one time payment then the system is deeply flawed. The possibility for abuse can be limited by simply making it expensive at any given time. But this obviously reduces the usefulness of the whole system especially for value transfer. The idea of an internet of value is to make value move like data, dirt cheap and decentral so no one takes a cut."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like the idea that &#34;a million transactions per second ought to be enough for anybody&#34; (not a quote, just a paraphrase echoing Gates for those who missed it) could come back as another storied mistaken estimate at some point.Just taking the human population as a starting point, if we posit that in the future, non-human entities will also be doing transactions, and there may be orders of magnitude more of those entities than there are humans, and the entities will be networked and operating at machine speed… I don&#39;t know, but it seems like the thinking on scaling needs to be even more ambitious."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Even if you&#39;re a &#34;computer person&#34; who is comfortable messing with the internals of a PC, be very careful with the power supply. Opening it up should really be left to professionals. Capacitors can remain charged for a long time after disconnecting the power cord. If despite all the warnings, you open it up to fiddle with internals because you think you understand the components and can pay attention not to touch things, at the very least, use only one hand at a time to avoid creating a circuit through your heart.In most other parts of the computer the worst that can happen in most cases is that you damage the computer, the power supply is different, there you also have a good chance of getting shocked."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had some contact with PSU designers at a name brand server company and learned some things:1. Electrolytic capacitors: Only Japanese brands can be trusted (this sounds racist or something, but it&#39;s an actual requirement).  They all should be de-rated for reliability (have 2x the voltage rating).  Only exception is the main bulk filter capacitors, where your only reasonable choice is 450V, but these should be 105C.  Tantalum capacitors: not allowed.2. Main switch MOSFETs: only Infineon can be trusted.  Single active clamp / single switch topology is a no-no due to bad experience.  (I think the one in the article uses a diode clamp, so should be OK).3. Standby supply needs its own fuse.  The problem is that the main fuse is too big for the standby supply.  If there is a standby supply fault, you will fill the machine room with smoke and your brand will be mentioned in the news when machine room is shut down.  This destroys shareholder value.The current limit for any exposed 12V rail is only 20A or something line that (240VA UL limit), so you must not have exposed 12V when the server cover is open.There was basically a 100 page requirements document all along these lines."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some components, mostly capacitors, have the wrong hole spacing for their pins, and leads were bent to fit. That suggests part substitutions during assembly. Many of the through-hole components were not pushed all the way down into the board. That suggests overworked assemblers. This was obviously hand-assembled.The author makes a point that there&#39;s a clear division between the AC line side and the DC side. That&#39;s required for UL approval, but power supplies do show up without it. The power transformer that crosses the boundary should also have a split bobbin, so the AC line side coil and the output side coil are separated by a barrier, not wound on the same bobbin.There are worse power supplies.[1][1] https://linustechtips.com/topic/515473-teardown-and-review-o..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m adamantly pro dry-run and like OP I&#39;ve found that you really need to design for it. From my experience, OP&#39;s two main ideas are spot on: librarification and pushing dry-run logic deeper into library code.Here are two other things I&#39;ve found:1. Regardless of where you push your run/dry-run dispatch to, the underlying &#34;do it&#34; logic really needs to be factored properly for individual side effects (think functional). Otherwise, you inevitably end up with loads of &#34;if dry-run / else&#34; soup or worse, bugs _caused_ by your dry-run support.2. You still need safety nets for when someone is doing dangerous operations without dry-run. Pointing and calling [0] is a great trick for this. For example, say your tool is about to delete X, Y, and Z. Instead of a simple &#34;Yes&#34; confirmation which the user would quickly end up doing on auto-pilot, you could have a more involved confirmation like &#34;Enter the number of resources listed above to proceed&#34; and then only proceed to delete if the user enters &#34;3&#34;.Very curious to hear about design idioms folks have come up with![0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointing_and_calling"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At my work I&#39;ve gone through and setup a variety of &#34;replacement&#34; commands for commands that may have dire impact on production systems. All of these replacement commands dry run by default (or fake dry run/try to create a dry run the best they can) and require a &#34;--do-it&#34; (think emperor palpatine voice) flag to do the intended operation. I&#39;ve had multiple coworkers thank me for this setup as it&#39;s saved people from silly typos and mistakes, one such being the different handling of programs in the use of and ending &#34;/&#34; in folders. ex. &#34;/etc&#34; is different than &#34;/etc/&#34; sometimes for certain operations.I&#39;d like to one day see a global flag on operating systems to dry run nearly all commands that changed anything."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Their example of pushing it into the type system is nice but requires a language with a fairly powerful type system. Once simple way to do this in basically any statically typed language is just requiring a &#34;Run Token&#34; for any bit of code that does something &#34;for real&#34;. This method works well if you want the output to be similar or identical for dry run and actual run.    struct RunToken;

    fn do_the_thing(_: RunToken, ...);

The general approach works for just about any statically typed languages (although null is the enemy).You can make it a bit more tedious to generate that RunToken so that a `do_the_think(RunToken, ...)` looks more natural. But the idea is simply that if the only place you create a RunToken is when parsing the --no-dry-run flag you can&#39;t accidentally do_the_thing when you move the code out of the `if is_dry_run` block without noticing.Of course this is a simple way to get fairly reliable dry run. I do agree that having seperate plan and apply steps is approach is the best when you can do it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A few months back, I bought an AKASO Keychain camera to see if it&#39;s at least a 75%-decent knock-off of the Insta360 Go. I found that it was a truly terrible product and left a negative review detailing all my impressions and issues with it.Not long afterwards, &#34;Tara&#34; from AKASO (using a gmail.com account with the name &#34;Jessica&#34;) sent me multiple requests for the following:&gt;We sincerely appreciate your comment, which is helpful for improvement of our product and service in future. To bring  you a better shopping experience, we would like to send you 30 USD gift card. Would you please help us to re-adjusting your comment rating or remove it?Thanks to the Amazon review system, companies would much rather spend money suppressing bad reviews of their shit products instead of spending money to make good products in the first place."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Like I said in other comment: this is all Amazon doing, and their inactivity towards reports of what clearly was, and is, bad practices.Amazon basically became a rigged marketplace where those who thrive are the ones who can get away with a lot of things. From completely disregarding guidelines, TOS, targeted attacks to destroy competitors listings, you name it.It&#39;s just like prisons, people go in and come out worst because that&#39;s the game that has to be played in order to survive.The only one to blame is Amazon that promoted these practices by giving leverage to those who did it. With more revenue, more exposure, privileged access to Amazon account managers (yes, talking to a human is a privilege for an Amazon Seller)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Amazon.de is sub-eBay in terms of bargain bin junk store vibe. It&#39;s mostly stuff direct from Alibaba with an own brand name slapped on it to get around having to compete for the buy box. I&#39;ve actually started going back to eBay, Google Shopping and some independent web shops I know are good just to cut through the noise."</p>
