I got vaccinated in May and have convinced others to get the shot since the side effects, while existent, appear to be minor compared to the reduction in harmful symptoms. Talking to my doctor is what did it for me. He cleared up most of my concerns and pressed me that my remaining concerns were too nebulous to be useful. If he just said &#34;shut up and take it&#34; I wouldn&#39;t have.My mother only got vaccinated last month. She and my father are both medical professionals (she&#39;s retired and my dad got it early on since he&#39;s super high risk). Her main hangup was the lies and coercion. She believed that if the vaccine was actually as great as they&#39;re saying they&#39;d be able to make more objective goalposts and win arguments instead of stopping them because the other side is too stupid to make their own decisions. I&#39;m confident there was also some element of &#34;if I get it now I&#39;m telling them their tactics worked.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The original author of the bracket colorizer extension gets a great shout-out in this post and was also involved in the discussions of building the feature.Moreover, he has stated that he was tired of maintaining the extension and seems to be fully in favor of this move:&gt; Author of Bracket Pair Colorizer here.&gt; I follow this thread with interest, my extension is something that grew a bit out of control, and I grew tired of maintaining it.The comments here suggesting that the Visual Studio Code team was somehow wrong for making this improvement or that they otherwise wronged the extension author are not reflective of the actual process nor even the extension author’s own feelings.The blog post does a great job of describing why bracket colorization isn’t appropriate for the plug-in architecture anyway. Making it fast can only be accomplished within the core of the editor code which has more direct access to syntax parsing.This is a win for everyone all around. The Code team did a great job with this feature and the associated blog post."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"VS Code is an amazing piece of technology, despite all the &#34;Electron hate&#34; (although changing to WebView2).I recently commented on it here:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28556588Microsoft engineers are top-notch and this is another feature I&#39;ll be using daily.  Good stuff!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve always wanted something like this extension, but where the brackets aren’t colorized, but rather change size depending on their nesting level, with the outermost brackets becoming increasingly large as the total nesting level of the expression increases — exactly the way brackets do in maths.Ideally, unlike in TeX, additions to nesting levels wouldn’t require a re-flow (i.e. typing a bracket wouldn’t make the code constantly shimmy around on the screen), but rather these would just be changes in the perceived size of these characters, while keeping them where they are on a monospace grid (since a lot of code assumes a pure monospace layout for indentation et al.)In my imagination, this would work by just having a set of bracket/paren/brace/etc. graphemes in each font, that have increasingly-long ascenders/descenders, while the base size of of the “functional” part of the grapheme remains constant. As if there were five versions of the letter g, with an increasing length of the stem on which the lower hook rests.As such, these magnified brackets would be rendered similarly to the way emoji are rendered in terminals: the grapheme would eventually “leak out” of its monospace box (in the emoji case to the sides; in this case above and below), to the point of eventually overlapping surrounding graphemes, rather than re-spacing the text to give it room."</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28691358">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the founders of Simula here.We&#39;re flattered that someone posted us to HN, but we were honestly not ready for this much publicity at this precise stage of our project.  It would have been better had this happened a few weeks from now, when we have more accurate footage of our actual prototype to show. Let me explain:1. *Video footage.* The video footage on the front page of www.simulavr.com is taken against an HTC Vive and an older prototype of our window manager. It doesn&#39;t showcase the higher resolution of the Simula One (more than 4x that of the Valve Index), or any of the new features we are intending on releasing with it (hand tracking, AR mode, environments, etc).2. *Prototype pictures.* The website doesn&#39;t have any actual photos of our headset yet!  That&#39;s because we are in the process of finalizing the design.  We have printed parts and plenty of renderings, but they are still changing every week.3. *Specs.* The specs are close to the final specs, but still placeholders. Between supply chain issues, stuff still under development, and issues getting support from manufacturers at our volumes, we might have to change things for the final prototype.One of the reasons we threw up this website in its current form was to get the ball rolling for manufacturers.  They won&#39;t supply us with parts unless we have some sort of product interest, but we can&#39;t generate any sort of product interest unless we have some sort of website. It&#39;s very much a chicken and egg sort of problem.We appreciate everyone&#39;s kind words, yet also understand the skepticism.  For people on the waitlist: expect updates to start to come from us in a few weeks, when we will show some previews of some of the actual goodies which makes our headset special."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s important to remember that this is on the way to being an MVP. It&#39;s not a finished, polished product. This is HN. Don&#39;t we like people hacking on startups any more?I think it looks like a really positive first step. Yeah, the resolution is too low but that&#39;s solvable with a better headset. It&#39;s a bit laggy, but that&#39;s probably due to recording video of VR being hard. The windows are weird sizes, but that might be user choice. Heck, I personally don&#39;t want to code things floating in space, but that&#39;s just a matter of choosing a different background. All those problems are solvable.There are loads more problems that are also likely solvable too. And maybe some that aren&#39;t. We don&#39;t know yet. I&#39;m glad someone is working on the problem to find out. That&#39;s far better than not having, maybe, one day in the distant future, a VR option to use for work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fun note, almost all of it is written in Haskell. If I remember correctly they&#39;ve also done a bunch of stuff that helps Godot, or at least something to do with the Haskell bindings. Very accessible guys, I once asked a question on the gitter, and got helpful replies almost immediately."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We once had a customer who would call us in a panic a couple of times a year saying our inspection equipment was experiencing unusually high false rejects and they were generating very high scrap rate. By the time we got a technician on site the next day, everything was working flawlessly and the customer couldn&#39;t reproduce the problem either. This went on for almost three years with various levels of escalation to the current management. Finally, one day a technician was on site for another project when the customer came up to him and said &#34;It&#39;s happening right now! Come fix it!&#34; The technician rushed over to the equipment and discovered that the sun was shining at exactly the right angle to cause a lens flare in one of our cameras. This happened twice a year as the sun moved along its trajectory. A strategically placed piece of opaque plastic fixed it permanently."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The phase of the moon really can affect performance.  A friend of mine worked on wireless links in Scotland and was struggling with loss at certain times of day, but not exactly the same time every day.  When they graphed loss against time, the pattern was really periodic over many days.  The periodicity turned out to be 12 hours 25 minutes, which they eventually realized is exactly the time between low tides.  The problem was at low tide the reflected path off the water interfered with the line-of-sight path causing signal fading, whereas at high tide it interfered much less.  In particular, see figure 2 of their paper for the correlation between tide height and SNR: https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mmarina/papers/EDI-INF-RR-136...  As tide height really does depend on the phase of the moon, presumably their loss did too, if they measured for long enough."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I heard a great story a while back for a digitization project where historic content was being provided by many libraries around the world, including one in Russia.The quality of the scanned books was excellent, except for a weird distortion every so often where part of the page would be shifted partway through as if someone had shifted half the page in Photoshop. This was only noticed in books over a certain size so people were checking to see if there was some kind of mechanical problem with the scanner (these were robots with automatic page turners so it was plausible that there could be something which was only an issue past a certain position), trying to figure out of there was some way that the software had some kind of memory leak or other issue which would explain the long and inconsistent intervals.Eventually they were on a long-distance phone call to Moscow and not turning up anything when there was a loud rumble in the background. “What was that?” lead to the realization that the library&#39;s scan center was close to a subway tunnel. The vibration of a passing train was enough to cause a glitch but only if you happened to be scanning at the exact time it went by: the reason longer books were noticed was simply because having more pages meant that at any point in time a long book was more likely to be sitting in the scanner and the technicians running the scanner were apparently tuning out the trains as background noise. This was reportedly the first project they&#39;d done with one of the scan robots which can process an entire book unattended so it was plausible that smaller past projects simply hadn&#39;t been scanning frequently enough to hit this problem or that some previous technician had noticed and immediately redone the page."</p>

They are mounted on single sticks so they can be rotated/tilted to various angles.  That&#39;s what the single central mount thing is, the 2&#34; thick triangle bit with the two bolt holes.  The leading edge of that mount also has a classic curve associated with some radar target mounts.  It prevents direct reflections by the mount.https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/15746/lockheeds-helend...Lol, thedrive agrees with me:

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I still haven&#39;t found the &#34;holy grail architecture&#34; for offline-first with backend sync where the backend isn&#39;t just a simple data store but also has business logic and interacts with external systems.Doing offline-first well implies that the app has a (sqlite or similar) local database, does work on that database and periodically syncs the changes to the backend. This means you have N+1 databases to keep in sync (with N=number of clients). Essentially distributed database replication where clients can go offline at any time. Potentially with different tech (for example sqlite on the client and postgres on the backend).When the backend isn&#39;t very smart it&#39;s not too hard, you can just encapsulate any state-changing action into an event, when offline process the events locally + cache the chain of events, when online send the chain to the backend and have the backend apply the events one by one. Periodically sync new events from the backend and apply them locally to stay in sync. This is what classic Todo apps like OmniFocus do.The problems start when the backend is smarter and also applies business logic that generates new events (for example enriching new entities with data from external systems, or adding new tasks to a timeline etc). Obviously the new server-generated events are only available later when the client comes back online.When trying to make the offline experience as feature-rich as possible I always end up duplicating almost all of the backend logic into the clients as well. And in that case, what is even the point of having a smart backend."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I played with rxdb about a year ago, it’s really clever and has some great ideas.It’s built on the incredible PouchDB (the original offline first db) which is a truly feet of engineering. However I feel it is somewhat neglected (not implying that the original maintainers have any responsibility to the users, this is free Open-source, the fact they gave it away in the first place is brilliant). When I last used it about 6 months ago there had been very little activity in years on the github and I am concerned about their use of automatically marking inactive issues stale after 60 days. There is so little activity the only issues that are open are ones from the last 60 days.I found a sync conflict[1] (basically a hash collision, the attachments are unintentionally stripped from the document before hashing) and submitted a ticket, unfortunately as there is so little activity the issues was marked as stale and closed automatically. It’s not a bug that many people will come across but is a legitimate issue for anyone using binary attachments.So, rxdb is really great but I would be cautious about using it when the underlying platform is looking a little neglected. I truly hope someone has the time to take it on as it is an incredible toolkit.1: https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues/8257"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I do this for my mobile app, because the users are often working in remote areas without cell coverage or any network at all.I have a pretty simple strategy though:  I use SQLite on the mobile devices and when the device is back within network coverage, take a copy of the SQLite database, zip it up and throw it up to the server.  It ends up in an S3 bucket (all the device database backups end up with a UUID as their name), kick off an automatic process via a Lambda (triggered by S3) that imports the SQLite database into the bigger DB, job is done.It works pretty well, SQLite databases compress REALLY well.  The only tricky bit is having to check the version code of the database in case I have an old version of the app floating around in the wild (it happens)."</p>

Companies pledge to donate $X USD  amount per year per software engineer (SE) to a foundation (or whatever legal entity).

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As someone who has gone through a kidney transplant, this is actually a bit depressing since progress in this field is painfully slow.I have seen these articles pop up at regular intervals for a decade now, and if we&#39;re going to be honest: nothing much has happened during that decade.  This is still an under-funded area where nothing more than &#34;pre-clinical&#34; prototypes keep getting press - and then nothing.I used to be active on various forums for kidney patients (one of which had more than 27.000 members last I checked).  I&#39;m not very active anymore because it is too depressing to read about people who are less fortunate than me (I have good health, live in a country with socialized medicine and my total cost per year for keeping the transplanted healthy is less than $300).  For instance non-affluent people living in the US.I&#39;ve lost count of how many americans I&#39;ve known who have ended up in a place where taking their own life seems like the best option.  Either because they are tired of finding money for the medications that keep them alive, tired of navigating bureaucracy, because they don&#39;t want to drag their entire family into a financial hole, or because they are just physically exhausted.  (Dialysis is time-consuming and slowly ruins your body)Take some time to think about that.  Think about what it means that every so many months someone on a forum you frequent tells you &#34;I&#39;ve had it - I&#39;m going to give up and die&#34;.  It can be quite taxing if you allow yourself to care.So excuse me for being negative, but this isn&#39;t anything to be excited about.  This is just a reminder that nothing much that actually has any impact is happening in this area.Please take some time to review the national statistics for the US and please consider becoming an organ donor.https://www.organdonor.gov/learn/organ-donation-statistics"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That looks interesting, but the linked article is a bit short on details, but high on praise.For example I would like to know, if the goal is, to actually put this inside of people?Currently it is smartphone sized. That might work, but only if the person moves not much, because it does not seem flexible. And having a stiff smartphone in your body would mean moving like a old school robot. That still might beat the alternative, but would be a serious limitation. Maybe they get it smaller and more flexible - then I would be curious how long the bioreactor and hemofilter lasts, before they need replacement? Because that means dangerous surgery.So the first versions would be probably carried outside the body and connected to your arteries?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Before the launch of the XBOX 360, the company I worked for was one of their suppliers, and without going into enough detail to make me identifiable, the management of our two companies had arrived at sort of a stalemate: We didn&#39;t want to tell them exactly how our algorithms worked, and they didn&#39;t want to tell us exactly what they were doing with them-- think of it like a data compressor where, we don&#39;t want them to know the exact compression algo, and they don&#39;t want us to have their data.So, somehow, It is arrived at that a website will be created that encodes MS&#39;s proprietary data, but doesn&#39;t store it, but also our algorithm is implemented server side, so there&#39;s no leakage of proprietary stuff.A month later, the app is done and tested and I&#39;m decoding data from the website on real hardware. I move on to the next project.Three years later, the Xbox 360 is out, I decide I&#39;m tired of filling out reimbursement forms for Heroku and its got to be a security risk with no updates in 3 years... so I take a look at the apps stats to see if its feasible to shut it down--exactly zero users. Nobody ever attempted to use it, not even once.Ironically and unknown to me, the source code had been lost in a freak accident and when I deleted the Heroku account that was the only copy of the source left.Even worse, a year later someone claimed to have a use for the app and where was it please? And I had to explain we no longer had the source. I remember a very long e-mail about how irresponsible we were."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember a conversation with an inexperienced PM, who was still in the mode &#34;we need to add X because a customer asked for it&#34;.What I&#39;ve learned - although I&#39;ve never had a PM role - is not to blindly just give customers what they ask for, but to figure out what they really need. Their feature requests are often a proxy for something else they aren&#39;t able to articulate.Another thing to be careful about is adding that one thing a customer asks for but nobody else does. You end up wasting cycles and bloating the product with these one-off asks. Sometimes you have to stand your ground and say &#34;no&#34;, because the ROI just isn&#39;t there. Startups in particular are vulnerable to this because they haven&#39;t got a large enough customer base and capital yet to comfortably say &#34;no&#34;, and end up with features jammed into the codebase that are still there, years later, when the original customer that asked for them are long gone.There are exceptions of course - perhaps the feature is for some legal requirement e.g. &#34;we need to show this specific set of Terms &amp; Conditions before the user clicks Yes&#34; they must have and can&#39;t live without."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I once spent a week working on a fairly complex feature for a product that the users were demanding almost daily updates on.  I delivered it and, by coincidence, happened to be where the users were a couple of weeks later and I stopped by to say hello and saw that the user who had been asking for the feature every day was still using the product the &#34;old way&#34;.  I asked why and he didn&#39;t seem to follow what I meant, so I reached over and showed him the feature that he had been demanding I add and he said, &#34;oh, wow, that&#39;s awesome, that&#39;s going to be such a huge timesaver for us!&#34;"</p>
