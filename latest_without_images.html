								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Related to database indexes, but not the post:  a busted database index brought down ticket sales of the 2008 Olympics Games.This was the first time regular people could go buy tickets for events &amp; they had been lining up overnight at Bank of China locations through the country.  We were down for over a day before we called it off.  Apparently this led to minor upheaval at several locations in Beijing &amp; riot police were called in.We were pretty puzzled as we had an index and had load tested extensively.  We had Oracle support working directly with us &amp; couldn&#39;t figure out why queries had started to become table scans.The culprit? A point upgrade to DBD::Oracle (something like X.Y.3 to X.Y.4) introduced subtle but in character sets.  So the index required using a particular Unicode character set, and we were specifying it, but when it was translated into the actually query, it wasn&#39;t exactly the right one, so the DB assumed it couldn&#39;t use the index.  Then, when all the banks opened &amp; a large portion of very populous country tried to buy tickets at the same time, things just melted.Not a fun day."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why exactly would it be so bad to just put a suitable index on the table containing strings? The time complexity of the resulting search would be the same, so I assume there will be some constant factor slowdowns. Is it that indices over string fields are stored inefficiently on disk? (If so, can that not be fixed in the db engine directly?) Or is this fine today but wasn&#39;t fine 15 years ago?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The ending is the most important part.&gt; Now, what do you suppose happened to that clueless programmer who didn&#39;t know anything about foreign key relationships?&gt; Well, that&#39;s easy. She just wrote this post for you. That&#39;s right, I was that clueless newbie who came up with a completely ridiculous abuse of a SQL database that was slow, bloated, and obviously wrong at a glance to anyone who had a clue.&gt; My point is: EVERYONE goes through this, particularly if operating in a vacuum with no mentorship, guidance, or reference points. Considering that we as an industry tend to chase off anyone who makes it to the age of 35, is it any surprise that we have a giant flock of people roaming around trying anything that&#39;ll work?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been having some sort of severe performance issue in one form or another since Mojave/Catalina or so with a 2017 MBP and a 2020 M1 Mac Mini.The symptoms is always generally poor performance after the system has been running a while (4h to a week, varies), usually with WindowServer using CPU cycles non-stop and UI that felt choppy across all programs.This seemed to happen frequently after &#34;opening many files&#34;, like doing some recompiling with Xcode for a few hours, or indexing a large volume with Spotlight. Rebooting helps temporarily.Today I realized that data read/written since boot was about 1TB in a few hours on a brand new OS install, and I traced this back to the com.apple.Safari.History process. Somehow having bookmarks and previously using Safari 15.x caused a huge amount of I/O that wouldn&#39;t stop - the solution was to remove all bookmarks and reading list items. Performance was immediately back to normal, no reboot needed.So just logging in with your iCloud id, you could be &#34;importing&#34; whatever performance problem you&#39;re having on a new install.I recommend you reboot and take a look at your disk I/O stats - maybe this will help someone!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have created a learning framework for myself to learn literally anything.
First of all It’s not going to be easy to get started learning something new because there are many holes in your mental model about the material and the aim of the learning is to fill those holes.
We’re living in an information era. You can drawn yourself in surfing the web/docs/articles if you are some kind of perfectionism to convince yourself that you’re learning. But that’s the trap. You should spend about 30-40% of your time learning the material and 60-70% of your time applying it and then under the process you’ll find: “Oh I don’t know how or what is X” then you go to learn about X specifically. This works best. In other words as you will be applying what you have learned so far you start “learning on demand”. In other words filling the individual holes. This loop will force you to learn the topic."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Overall a pretty good summary of how to teach yourself new skills. I personally went far too much into unguided learning early in my software journey. I took on personal projects that were far too ambitious and floundered with problems that would have been 10x easier if I&#39;d focused on grasping fundamentals.What&#39;s missing in this post is that it entirely focused in isolated learning, away from tutors and other forms of interpersonal teaching. Any approach to learning stuff &#34;quickly&#34; should take seriously Bloom&#39;s 2 Sigma Problem. [1]Partly offloading your learning problem onto an expert tutor trained in master learning has a good chance of vastly exceeding any learning approach a novice can adopt on their own. The internet has thus far failed to support this learning model, I think because it would be incredibly expensive for students.1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_2_sigma_problem"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I must say it&#39;s worth mentioning that as you build up a library of knowledge and experience in your mind, learning new things become more transitional than exploratory. Picture spoken languages for example. At first it&#39;s daunting and most languages have their quirks but overall after a few you find your marks easily.The effort becomes a memory concern where cheat sheets are how you transition or learn quickly into a new space.I&#39;m a polyglot in software development. I can work with most tech stack within 2-3 weeks and be efficient within 3-6 months, idiomatic within a year maximum. A big part of that is due to relatability between spaces. Every toilet has a flushing button and every kitchen has a sink and every language had a form of exposing positive or negative response.My advice is always throw yourself in and swim. Find whatever swimlane or swimming aid available and move forward.One caveat is learning spaces that are constantly shifting. For example, Swift. What a mess. Look up anything in that language and find 5 ways to do something, 3 expired, 1 manageable and 1 undocumented that works. It&#39;s sad but know that that&#39;s the outlier, not the average!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A couple years ago I had an experience with a spider that entirely changed my perspective on them and most insects, and now I make a conscious effort to help them as much as possible, instead of kill or even repel them.This particular spider kept running back and forth between my monitor and a window, and when it&#39;d get to my monitor, it would wave its front legs at me. If I moved to the left, it would run across to the left side of the monitor and waves it legs again. If I stood up and moved closer to it, it would run back to the window, turn around, and waves its legs at me. From watching YouTube too much, I was always under the impression that this was either a sign of aggression or a defensive stance.But after a few times of going back and forth like this, I realized there were approximately 50 baby spiders around a light by the window, which had been closed since the previous day. Normally this would be a nightmare for me (I&#39;ve always had a fear of spiders), but after a while, I had this crazy notion that the spider was trying to get me to open the window. So I did, and it immediately ran to the babies, wrapped a single strand of silk around the old webbing, and started dragging swaths of the babies&#39; webbing toward the window.I have no idea if the room was just dry and they needed some humidity, or if the food had been too scarce for too long. Whatever it was, that parent spider was in full blown panic mode, and managed to effectively communicate their problem to a human. I haven&#39;t killed any spiders or insects since (aside from a few particularly asshole-ish mosquitos), and actually keep small water dishes in my bathroom for two spiders who&#39;ve now lived with me for nearly a year. If any babies hatch inside and get close to me, I use my phone&#39;s flash to guide them back to a corner with a light on -- they are seemingly always drawn to the brightest light source.Spiders are incredible creatures, and I deeply regret not realizing that sooner."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of my school friends walked a different path from me and became a paramedic. He used to have to go to homes in &#34;socioeconomically challenged areas&#34; in order to revive people who had taken substances that they should not have taken - and also other things which were even less good. On one of these trips in a drug hell hole he saw a tank with a spider in it, and he realised that these people were likely mistreating it. So he asked if they wanted it and after a short conversation bought it off them for a nominal amount.So - he had a tarantula. I had never seen or met a thing like that and I was fascinated. It was very shy at first - it spent all day everyday hiding, possibly because of fear of drug addicts. But eventually it got a bit more confident. The thing was, it recognised and remembered individual humans. When it first met you or saw you it would hide. If you were calm and Kit (the paramedic) was calm with you it would come out and allow you to stroke it. This might take a few visits. But, once you had won it&#39;s confidence it would come right out and say hi as soon as you were in the room.I came to believe that it was self aware, and that it had a mental model that included social interactions and trust. It was just a belief, as it&#39;s really hard to see the anecdote and experience I have as data, but that&#39;s what interacting with it made me think. I thought it was as smart as a cat, or maybe even a dog."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Talking about Portias, I recommend reading &#34;Children of Time&#34; by Adrian Tchaikovsky, it&#39;s about the process of uplifting spiders and how humans re-establish contacts with them. Another great book about smart &#34;spiders&#34; is &#34;A Deepness in the Sky&#34; by Vernor Vinge, my favorite in the &#34;Zones of Thought&#34; series."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wish I could a 2-3 hour interview where I (or the candidate) showcase one of my projects and explain the architectural details and decisions in addition to showing any cool/hairy/insane code that got the job done. We can discuss those things and see how to improve them, or laugh at the crazy solutions.Honestly how many times do I need to rehearse these dumbass algos (blah blah blah, so I&#39;ll optimize for space with blah blah blah) okay already. I would much rather show you real world code that I&#39;ve built, or passion projects I spend my free time on. I want to bring me to your company/projects, so get to know what I&#39;m about holistically as an engineer. I think you can best understand that by looking at actual work done and judging whether or not the person is capable of contributing to your needs.Whenever we face challenges, we learn from them. At scale, we learn everyday. So just hire people who are passionate about facing challenges and learning from them. Not someone who can spend 8 hours a day like a college student playing leet code instead of building something useful. It really isn&#39;t that hard to memorize a dozen essential data structures and algorithms. But then what? So cringe."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Been on the hiring side for more than a decade. In addition to other advice in this thread, I would like to add -I treat the interview as my chance to help the candidate pass the interview. This bent of thought may seem subtle, but makes all the difference in meeting the candidate in their terrain, and seeing the world from their point of view.  Consequently, the case studies given explicitly state that if the candidate finds something else that intrigues them, I am happy to take that as a case study instead - gives them something to flaunt and for me to learn about.Some candidates are shy to open up, or just not comfortable conversing with strangers, or misread the power asymmetry in the interview and get anxious - I spend a fair bit of time just conversing human to human.For the really uncommunicative candidates, I make a slight of what they built (fake slight) and this gets the conversation going like a star. The good candidates exhibit a great amount of &#34;Builder&#39;s Pride&#34; and defend what they built.  They really good ones admit to the possibility that there were other better ways to have built, or explain to me the constraints under which they made the choices they did."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some of these are great tips and I agree wholeheartedly.However, in personal experience, I&#39;ve found that this works much better with more experienced developers rather than with junior engineers. Why? Because for some reason, a lot of junior engineers have been pavlov-ed into thinking every interview is for something at Google/Facebook scale (no matter where they are interviewing) and they start describing extremely convoluted designs using tech that they are also not completely familiar with just because they want to come across as knowledgeable.Something that I struggle with in these cases is reining in the dev back to the &#34;what&#34; rather than the &#34;how&#34;, because I&#39;ve seen even good engineers go into this &#34;let&#39;s add a system-bus for everything&#34; way of thinking. Constraining problems explicitly tends to devolve into the &#34;Interviewer-Interviewee information asymmetry&#34; which is the same with most DSA problems (At least with DSA, most constraints are known by both parties).On the other hand, almost every time I&#39;ve picked an actual problem we have with a system, be it a bug or a new product or something else, as an interview question with an experienced interviewee, I feel like I&#39;ve come out understanding the problem space AND solution space better just through the process of discussion and in multiple cases, actually ended up using a lot of ideas from these discussions, so interviewing feels much more &#34;natural&#34; and a &#34;dominant strategy&#34; in game theoretic sense."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The future is not as dark as it seems because of the rat race of megacorps.You can use reduced versions of language models with extremely good results.I was involved in training the first-ever GPT2 for Bengali language, but with 117 million parameters.It took a month&#39;s effort (training + writing code + setup) and about $6k in TPU cost, but Google Cloud covered it.Anyway, it is surprisingly good. We fine-tuned the model for several downstream tasks and we were shocked when we saw the quality of generated text.I fine-tuned this model to write Bengali poems with a dataset of just about 2k poems and ran the training for 20 minutes in GPU instance of Colab Pro.I was really blown away by the quality.The main training was done in JAX, and it is much faster and seamless than PyTorch XLA, much better than TensorFlow in every way.So, my point is, although everyone is talking hundreds of billions of parameters and millions in training cost, you can still derive practical value from language models, and that too, at a low cost."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The GPT-3 family is still to expensive to use, too big to fit in memory on a single machine. Prices need to come down before large scale adoption or someone needs to invent the chip to hold it (cheaply).The most exciting part about it is showing us there is a path forward by scaling and prompting, but you can still do much better with a smaller model and a bit of training data (which can come from the expensive GPT-3 as well).What I expected from the next generation: multi-modality, larger context, using retrieval to augment input data with fresh information, tuned to solve thousands of tasks with supervised data so it can generalize on new tasks better, and some efficient way to keep it up to date and fine-tune it. On the data part - more data, more languages - a lot of work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Neat to see more models getting closer, thought it appears only one so far has exceeded GPT-3&#39;s 175B parameters.That said, what I&#39;m really curious is how those other models stack up against GPT-3 in terms of performance -- does anyone know of any comparisons?"</p>

					<h3><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29127098">Ask HN: How were video games from the 90s so efficient?</a></h3>

					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29127098">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I built games in the 90s. Graphics was obviously the hardest part.We thought about things in terms of how many instructions per pixel per frame we could afford to spend. Before the 90s it was hard to even update all pixels on a 320x200x8bit (i.e. mode 13h) display at 30 fps. So you had to do stuff like only redraw the part of the screen that moved. The led to games like donkey kong where there was a static world and only a few elements updated.In the 90s we got to the point where you had a pentium processor at 66 Mhz (woo!) At that point your 66Mhz / 320 (height) / 200 (width) / 30 (fps) gave you 34 clocks per pixel. 34 clocks was way more than needed for 2D bitblt (e.g. memcpy&#39;ing each line of a sprite) so we could beyond 2D mario-like games to 3D ones.With 34 clocks, you could write a texture mapper (in assembly) that was around 10-15 clocks per pixel (if memory serves) and have a few cycles left over for everything else. You also had to keep overdraw low (meaning, each part of the screen was only drawn once or maybe two times). With those techniques, you could make a game where the graphics were 3D and redrawn from scratch every frame.The other big challenge was that floating point was slow back then (and certain processors did or didn&#39;t have floating-point coprocessors, etc.) so we used a lot of fixed point math and approximations. The hard part was dividing, which is required for perspective calculations in a 3D game, but was super slow and not amenable to fixed-point techniques. A single divide per pixel would blow your entire clock budget! &#34;Perspective correct&#34; texture mappers were not common in the 90s, and games like Descent that relied on them used lots of approximations to make it fast enough."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve created a 4k UHD video editor for Haiku OS (https://github.com/smallstepforman/Medo), it’s a C++17 native app, with over 30 OpenGL GLSL effect plugins and addons, multi threaded Actor model, over 10 user languages, and the entire package file fits on a 1.44Mb floppy disk with space to spare. If I was really concerned about space, I could probably replace all .png resources with WebP and save another 200kb.How is it so small? No external dependancies (uses stock Haiku packages), uses the standard C++ system API, and written by a developer that learned their trade on restrained systems from the 80’s. Look at the old Amiga stuff from that era."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lower resolutions on smaller monitors. 256 colors at a time, no truecolor yet.Lower-res samples, if any.Lower framerate expectations - try playing Descent 2 on an emulated computer with similar specs to the lowest specs suggested on the box. Even one in the middle of the spec range probably didn&#39;t get a constant 60fps.More hand-tuned assembly (RCT was famously 99% assembly, according to Wikipedia; this was starting to be unusual but people who&#39;d been in the industry a while probably did at last one game in 100% assembly, and would have been pretty comfortable with hand-optimizing stuff as needed).Simpler worlds, with simpler AI. Victory conditions designed to be reached before the number of entities in the game overwhelmed the CPU completely.Simpler models. Most 3d games you play now probably have more polygons in your character&#39;s weapon than Descent would have in the entire level and all the active entities; they certainly have more polys in the overall character.I mean, really, three million tiles? That&#39;s insane by that day&#39;s standards, that&#39;s a bit more than 1700x1700 tiles, a quick search tells me the maximum map size in Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 was 256x256, and it&#39;s a fairly safe assumption that RCT1 was, at best, the same size, if not probably smaller. I can&#39;t find anything similar for Sim City 2000 but I would be surprised if it was much bigger."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In 2018 I built a privacy-friendly open-source consent manager (https://github.com/kiprotect/klaro) which is used on many websites across Europe. From the beginning I never liked the IAB, didn&#39;t implement it and told people that I regard it as unlawful since e.g. a user cannot possibly make an informed decision that involves thousands of third-parties. Still many of our users kept asking me about it since it was &#34;the way&#34; to become compliant.So I finally asked the IAB how one could potentially implement their framework as an open-source framework. Their answer was basically that it&#39;s not possible. You have to register as a CMP provider and ensure that your users are using your software in their compliant (ha ha) way, which is of course impossible to enforce with an open-source software that everyone can self-host. In general, in my opinion the IAB is mostly a framework to shift liability from the advertisers who steal the users&#39; data to the publishers and CMP providers. Therefore I&#39;m quite happy we never got around to implement this &#34;feature&#34; in our CMP, and I hope the IAB will quickly die and takes all those alibi CMP providers down with them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really hope they actually issue a hefty fine here, instead of just a &#34;now stop doing that&#34;.Not issuing a fine would send a signal that simply ignoring the law until you&#39;re told to follow it pays off, since the companies involved certainly made much more profit in that time than they would have made had they followed the law.Also, the fines should be issued to everyone involved in this mess - middlemen and library providers like IAB, the ad companies actually collecting the data, and most importantly the publishers that sent their visitor&#39;s data to them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those who don&#39;t know, SS13 is an open-source multiplayer round-based roleplaying game that has been built on the closed-source BYOND engine since 2005. Imagine Among Us, DarkRP (on Garry&#39;s Mod) or NoPixel (on GTA V) but with much more content for both antagonists and normal workers. Or Dwarf Fortress/RimWorld but everybody controls a different person (with usual crew count being 50-150 people).It has a great number of forks, with more than a dozen focused on the space station gameplay loop and various others that adapt the game to themes such as marines vs xenomorphs missions, an open-world modern day city setting, ancient civilization world, etc.Other than that if you want to find out more I&#39;d suggest watching the two most popular game reviews about it I added in another comment https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29109264"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love that I can be pretty &#39;wired in&#39; to HN, tech twitter, etc. and still find cool stuff like this that&#39;s been around for years and I&#39;ve never heard of before.It looks like a pretty cool game, I&#39;m surprised I&#39;ve never heard of SS13 given all of I&#39;ve seen about Dwarf Fortress."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don’t agree with this perspective: why do entry-level students have to understand the internals behind compiling their code, and weird edge-cases like misspelling import? In my experience this is actually the stuff that hinders learning and confuses students.The author claims that students won’t be able to do real-world programming without learning this esoteric stuff, but actually this is the exact stuff they don’t need to know: full teams can and have built huge java projects just by using the intellij project wizard and maybe a tiny bit of Gradle from stack overflow. Actually students can solve most of the author’s problems by spending 5 seconds on Stack Overflow.I’m not saying that these more esoteric details are completely useless. Learning e.g. the difference between char and UTF8 “character” is actually pretty important so that emoji inputs don’t crash your website. But this is stuff that should come in later classes, particularly for students who are interested in those details. Not everyone needs to know it.In fact my experience is that some colleges have the exact opposite problem: they teach students old tools and techniques which are tedious and not actually used much later on. Like writing code by hand and deducting points for syntax errors, or using some outdated framework e.g. jQuery. When I saw the title my first thought was literally “yeah stop making students use eclipse, they should be using IntelliJ!”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Using Java or Python in a professional IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans, PyCharm, or Eclipse is not a good first introduction to programming for computer science students, whether they’re in the field to become web developers, systems software engineers, or academic computer science researchers.I was forced to program Java without an IDE and my experience is that I learned less in all those lessons over a year than in a few select days at work during my first year.Furthermore, according to a friend who is a specialist teacher this is a common problem:Most kids are inclined to see how things works as a whole while most teachers want to teach analytically by tearing everything apart.I&#39;m grown-up now and don&#39;t mind diving deep into stuff (in fact I enjoy it) but in my understanding we really should try to go with the flow when teaching:Teach kids the wonders of programming (and everything else) and then go into the details as needed.Because, if my friend is right and I understood him right (he doesn&#39;t teach programming) most kids doesn&#39;t want to learn programming because they want to know how to please javac but because they want to create cool stuff."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Eclipse is poor tooling for teaching. Far too many buttons and noise that gets in the way. But the opposite, programming with no debugger and no linter is just as bad. It punishes you for getting the smallest syntax mistakes by waiting for the compiler and reading out erroneous messages.A debugger makes it far better to understand the execution of code line by line, and should be standard in education, but it&#39;s not.I feel that visual studio code, with some modifications, would be perfect to begin with. Then when building things at a higher level, introduce why to use eclipse, like how it handles packages, etc."</p>
