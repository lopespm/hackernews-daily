								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Inequality by itself is not a bad thing. Let&#39;s start from there. If 90% of the population had a (sustainable) lifestyle of current dollar millionaires, and the remaining 10% had a (sustainable) lifestyle of dollar billionaires, there would be lots of inequality, but it wouldn&#39;t be problematic.Inequality is only bad if you&#39;re in a zero-sum game. The rich do have the power to extract rents and &#34;rig the system&#34; to cement their wealth and power. Those are things Graham is clearly against. But an entrepreneur who gets rich by reducing waste and improving productivity by harnessing technology deserves our praise. They&#39;re not causing the &#34;poor to get poorer&#34;.And comparing the wealth distribution of today to that of 1980 is pretty silly. We&#39;re in a global economy now, so if you want to be fair, you need to look at it from a global perspective. Almost all Americans are going to fall in the top 10% of earners globally. And global poverty has collapsed since 1980. Yes, you no longer get a comfy middle class life just by virtue of being born in the US (regardless of skills) anymore. I personally don&#39;t believe that an unskilled worker in the US deserves to be paid 10X what an equivalent worker in Bangladesh makes just because they were lucky enough to be born here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m just gonna quote what I think is a very important part from the Graham piece itself&gt;&#34;People who don&#39;t look any deeper than the Gini coefficient look back on the world of 1982 as the good old days, because those who got rich then didn&#39;t get as rich. But if you dig into how they got rich, the old days don&#39;t look so good. In 1982, 84% of the richest 100 people got rich by inheritance, extracting natural resources, or doing real estate deals. Is that really better than a world in which the richest people get rich by starting tech companies?&#34;And my answer to that question would be, arguably yes. Why? Because at least old money understands the concept of noblesse oblige. The real sinister psychological thing going on behind the Graham argument is that it&#39;s not at all about meritocracy, it&#39;s that this mentality of earned wealth completely rids the owner of any sort of responsibility.The aristocrats and oligarchs of the olden days might have been corrupt, debauched and half-useless, but at least they knew it. This new, self-made entrepreneur class does not only think they have earned their money themselves, which as a sidenote is also kind of a fiction, but that they&#39;re intellectually superior, morally superior and virtuous in ways that anyone else just can&#39;t understand.Old money might have ignored you and thrown a party, but Silicon Valley money wants to remake people in their images, they have a Protestant zealotry associated with their money that makes any oligarch look straight up sympathetic in comparison.C.S Lewis:&#34;“Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron&#39;s cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience. They may be more likely to go to Heaven yet at the same time likelier to make a Hell of earth. This very kindness stings with intolerable insult. To be &#34;cured&#34; against one&#39;s will and cured of states which we may not regard as disease is to be put on a level of those who have not yet reached the age of reason or those who never will; to be classed with infants, imbeciles, and domestic animals.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of people who are just as smart and motived as Elon Musk or Steve Jobs will never be able to start their own companies and get rich.Because they have family obligations that take priority.Because they live outside high-income countries.Because they have no access to support network, so when they fail, they fall all the way to bottom.Because they may have made a crippling mistake in their pasts that now prevents them from reaching their full potential.And so on and on. While I would still recommend everyone to pursue the dreams over never trying to do so - being poor is the single most powerful force that prevents people from doing that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I got hit with this a few years back. I signed up for Ps CC for a month (I thought) to create an anniversary gift for my wife. I used it ONCE. Tried to cancel and they told me I had in fact signed up for a year, and that if I didn&#39;t cancel now, they&#39;d give me two months free.I didn&#39;t want it at all! Anyway, I sucked it up, got on with the remainder of the year, because they wouldn&#39;t let me put the cancellation in early, had to do it X months before the end. Then life happened and I missed the deadline to cancel and got suckered for a second year!Fuck Adobe and this practice is all I have to say, I stick strictly to Open Source options now. It may have been my fault for not reading the first time, but robbing me a second time by counting on me missing the cancellation because they wouldn&#39;t let me do it there and then is just scummy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is this really a cancellation fee or is it just honoring your contract? AFAIK it&#39;s very clear on Adobe&#39;s page that your options are (1) Annual plan paid monthly, (2) Annual plan prepaid, and depending on the product (3) Monthly plan at usually 150% higher price.https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/plans.htmlIf you signed up for a yearly plan paid monthly, the cancellation fee is finishing your contract.If you didn&#39;t want to agree to pay by the year maybe you shouldn&#39;t have signed up for a year of service?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had the same, they wanted me to pay the rest of the year (after 2 or 3 years?). Problem is, that is against Dutch law, after an initial year, one is only allowed to prolong a contract by 1 month at a time. I reminded the person on the phone (who only spoke English, so imagine what happens when you are not as fluent in it as I) that they broke Dutch law, I told that to 3 other persons and they finally told me: Ok, we&#39;ll cancel. Finally.Edit: I had to call them, because the website indeed only showed me these options where I had to pay the rest of the year. Email didn&#39;t help, they offered me some discount for the rest of the year. Very strange as a Dutch person, it has become so normal to not worry about this (I really like this law, a nice example of citizens before companies.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Apple has just engineered the worst possible situation for themselves by being the only way to get apps on the store and by simultaneously incessantly marketing the store as &#34;Safe and Secure&#34;. The former encourages them to maximize the number of apps on the store, while the latter encourages them to shoot first and ask questions later.If side-loading or alternative ways of getting apps onto the iPhone existed, then they could implement far stricter controls knowing that, worst case scenario, you can still get an app onto the iPhone. This is how it works on the Mac. Tor isn&#39;t on the Mac App Store, but that of course doesn&#39;t mean Tor can&#39;t be used on the Mac.This is one of the tricky parts about AppStore discussions, it&#39;s not about being for or against the AppStore. In fact, I wish the AppStore was MUCH pickier about the apps it let in, and I also wish there was an alternative to the AppStore to catch cases that didn&#39;t meet that strict bar. Then the AppStore could actually be about curation as opposed to fear-induced isolationism. Then Apple wouldn&#39;t have to inadvertently have political side-effects when it disallowed apps like HKMap.live.Being on the AppStore could still be advantageous beyond just &#34;either that or you don&#39;t get to be on the iPhone at all.” Apple payment processing, iCloud integrations, Family-sharing, etc. could all be tied to being ON the AppStore, so there&#39;d still be a huge incentive to try to ship that way. And side-loading doesn&#39;t have to be easy or even on by default."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I got scammed on the App Store a couple of weeks ago.I needed the SmartThings app for some Samsung home automation devices, searched for it, and installed this one:https://apps.apple.com/us/app/smart-things-smart-view-app/id...When it charged me a $20/year subscription (now cancelled) I thought &#34;Wow, Samsung charging me for this feels pretty cheap of them, but I guess that&#39;s how they do things - after all, I found this on the App Store&#34;.The app I should have installed was this one: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/smartthings/id1222822904"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Patrick McGee from Financial Times had a whole twitter thread [1] on it. It got everything from banning apps for competitive reason to Apple&#39;s FEAR ( Fraud Engineering Algorithms and Risk ) team saying the current App Store review process is inadequate.I am starting to think there is a much deeper problem with Apple, it is that without Steve Jobs, no one is being the yard stick of quality, especially in UX.A decade of App Store, you are wondering if they have actually put any effort in its Apps Search Engine. It took them 3 years to admit they have problem with Keyboard and offering an update after 5 years. For things that are easily quantify, like Sales, Hardware Performance ( Apple Silicon ), Logistics and Operation. They are absolutely excelling under Tim Cook. For everything else it seems they are loose, at least from an Apple Standard point of view, although that is still far higher than their competitors.To quote Steve, it seems people are too focused on the process, and forgot about the content.[1] https://twitter.com/PatrickMcGee_/status/1380194940236353536"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;d love to use deno, but I really don&#39;t understand the point deno&#39;s module/package system.The standard practice of deps.ts/dev_deps.ts as described in the docs[1] just seems absolutely asinine to me. Importing everything into one scope and then re-exporting from one file just seems like an awful hack.What do you do if two libraries have functions with the same name? Do you namespace them yourself, or export an object under the name of the library (and therefore give up destructuring?)The URL thing seems similarly cumbersome and unecessary. Is there something wrong with a configuration file that would map &#39;package names&#39; to the urls to get them from?, and then import { foo } from &#34;packagename&#34;?[1]https://deno.land/manual@v1.9.0/examples/manage_dependencies"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The risk of dying from a blood clot after receiving the J&amp;J vaccine is six in 6,800,000 (6.8M). The world population is 7,900,000,000 (7.9B). If everyone on the planet got the J&amp;J vaccine tomorrow, and if it is the cause of the clots, then 6,971 people would die from the vaccine.Yesterday, Covid19 killed 8,803 people (according to worldometers).We don&#39;t want anyone to die from vaccination, and we don&#39;t fully understand what the clotting issue is, so it probably makes sense to pause using J&amp;J as long as the mRNA vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna) have not been implicated (which they haven&#39;t). OTOH, if this being in the news causes fewer people to get vaccinated, pausing it may be a mistake that will cause more overall deaths.Now, your risk of dying either from vaccination or Covid19 depends on various demographic factors not accounted for in my math above. But, nonetheless, the risk of dying from the J&amp;J vaccine is really, really, really tiny.Like, if I knew there was a 0.00009% chance my car were going to explode every time I got in it and started it, I would not be at all nervous about starting my car everyday for the rest of my life. I&#39;m way more likely, even accounting for my age demographic, to choke to death eating dinner tonight (5,051 deaths from choking in the U.S. in 2015 of which 2,848 were older than 74).Edit: lifetime risk of car exploding assuming I start it every day for 50 years is about 1.6%. Okay, maybe I wouldn&#39;t play that game."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;The incidence of cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) varies between studies, but it is estimated to be between 2 and 5 per million per year. A recent study in the Netherlands with comprehensive ascertainment suggested a much higher incidence.&#34;
https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/STROKEAHA.116.0...So the six reported cases in 6.8 million vaccinations seems low. Glad I read about all this because I got the J&amp;J vaccine 12 days ago. No noticeable side effects so far. I exercise a lot and did a 5 mile hike four days ago that resulted in a slightly strained a calf muscle.  I have been taking it easy the past few days, meaning sitting and reading a lot more than usual. So after learning about the blood clotting, have started exercising the legs frequently. My optimistic thinking is that even if the vaccine does cause an increased risk of CVST that risk can be eliminated via exercise.It will be most interesting to learn if those six cases involved people at high risk, if they exercise regularly, etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"John Campbell suggested on his video the other day that perhaps this is happening because some injectors are not aspirating. What that means is that when an intramuscular injection is given you want to ensure that it goes into the muscle and not into a vein. So the proper way to do this is for the person doing the injection to first pull out the syringe (after it&#39;s been stuck into the arm) a bit to make sure there&#39;s no blood coming out. Then if not, the vaccine is pushed in. If blood is seen then a new site has to be chosen. Apparently Denmark has included aspiration in their directions for usage of the AZ vaccine."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Being a self taught software developer who has been programming since I was 12, I had no idea how to reverse a binary tree.It can be done.  As a self-taught developer, and after years of startups and consulting, I got my first FAANG job at age 40.  I hadn&#39;t done any real kind of interview in 15 years.  I spent 90% of my time preparing for CS questions, and struggled at the first one, but ended up at FB, and Google a few years later.My mindset wasn&#39;t that they really cared that I could do these obscure programming exercises that I hadn&#39;t used once in 20+ years of real-world programming, but rather that I could prove that I could learn and adapt."</p>

I just don&#39;t want to work with difficult, unhappy people.It&#39;s a strange tone to take? The buried lede is: &#34;[I] travel around and work as a digital nomad.

Not only that they will insist the dance correlates with productivity and you have to nod and agree with them. The question is, do you spend the time to learn the dance?That&#39;s pretty much it, it&#39;s just a stupid dance. You can get angry and say &#34;No no no, this dance is stupid!&#34; Or you can learn the dance, do the dance, then be richer than 95% of people in the world."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So what I really want to know is: what happens at Cloudflare--which uses v8 to implement Cloudflare Workers in shared memory space--when this kind of stuff happens? (Their use is in some sense way more &#34;out on a limb&#34; than a web browser, where you would have to wait for someone to come to your likely-niche page rather than just push the attack to get run everywhere.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"People in this thread seem very confused about a lot of stuff so I’m going to try and make some clarifications:1) This is an RCE, so what it does is achieving code execution in the browser, i.e. it can run arbitrary code from the attacker, it’s literally like running a compiled program inside the target’s browser. This doesn’t bypass Chrome’s sandbox, so a lot of OS operations are not reachable from within the browser (for example, a lot of syscalls can’t be called).This is the first step in an exploit chain, the second one would be a sandbox escape to expand the attack surface and do nasty stuff, or maybe a kernel exploit to achieve even higher privileges (such as root)2) WASM being RWX is really not a security flaw. W^X protections in modern times (even in JIT-like memory mappings) makes sense only when coupled with a strong CFI (control flow integrity) model, which basically tries to mitigate code reuse attacks (such as JOP or ROP). Without this kind of protection, which needs to be a system-wide effort as iOS has shown, W^X makes literally zero sense, since any attacker can easily bypass it by executing an incredibly small JOP/ROP chain that changes memory protections in the target area to run the shellcode, or can even mmap RWX memory directly."</p>

But this is unacceptable:&#34;telling employees to download an app on their personal phones that would check their location and ensure they were working their scheduled hours.&#34;Why someone is obliged to install something on a private phone? What if someone does not have smartphone, what if that phone will stop working, who is to blame, who is responsible for fixing it, how quickly - will an employee sign SLA for fixing the phone?Employer should provide a phone for an employee and then whatever employer wants can be installed there.

Only a few people had access to push changes, which they did from home (run deploy script, go through a checklist of what should have changed, run revert script if there&#39;s a problem). They&#39;d get paid for being on-call, and used an authentication app to access our systems.One day my boss asked if I would install this authentication app on my phone, so I would be able to push changes. I refused, stating that my phone is my private property. This resulted in quite a long conversation, with reassurances about security, etc. but I didn&#39;t budge. At one point they stated that my &#34;argument wouldn&#39;t work&#34; if it was on a company-provided phone. I completely agreed and said that would be fine, which seemed to surprise them.I don&#39;t think it had even occurred to them that I was being honest: I didn&#39;t want to install random things on my phone.

While yes, Apple&#39;s walled garden does feel like a Rolls Royce compared to anything, the price tag difference this time was just way too step for me to keep buying a new Mac: It was basically 2x or more for roughly similar hardware, if not slightly worse on the MBP side. Overall, using Pop_OS! with its specialized GNOME3 setup has been a bliss, and I must say I had expected a far more difficult migration. In a few days I was happily up and running with my new machine. And then, there is the support - Apple&#39;s support outside of visiting  a Genius Bar is basically non-existent. System76 has diligently helped me even set up external hardware that wasn&#39;t theirs! Long story short, very much looking forward to COSMIC and continuing this experience. The  only thing I do miss a lot is my iTerm2... :)"</p>

They likely learnt a lot along the way and you would as well.If you&#39;re really keen to understand it start with the first commits: https://github.com/maryrosecook/gitlet/commits/master?after=...The first two (meaningful) commits simply create the .git directory and the tests for it. You can almost certainly understand that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So, I&#39;m going to put that out there, but I really wish I could read security-sensitive code like this. TLS implementations, cryptographic implementations, etc. It would be really amazing if there was a way for Github to automatically display code like this by extracting comments out.In general I think it&#39;s an amazing way of learning, I remember reading the gobyexample.com website and writing the same thing for go assembly: https://davidwong.fr/goasm/add"</p>
