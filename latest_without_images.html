								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I had 10gb internet on what was essentially a shared connection when I lived in Zürich.That, along with a surplus server I literally housed in my shoe closet, gave me the firepower I needed to prototype out something that led to two research grants which now employ myself and a new PhD student.We discount technological investments like this as being “too much” and “unpractical”, but we forget that, even if it only one person in a hundred or a thousand take advantage of them, the impact can be enough to launch careers or start businesses with sizeable positive externalities."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Firstly … 25Gbit symmetrical … WOW.Secondly - as a person living my whole life in IT - both passion and professionally - I have no idea what would 25Gbit be good for. I’m currently paying about $80 for symmetrical 1Gbit fiber and have the option to upgrade to 5Gbit for about $180 but it seems so pointless.Here is the reasoning behind my grumpy opinion:1. Living in a home with Cat5 throughout so the best I can do is to route 1Gbit. Running cables in multilevel (American) homes is a major PITA.2. My Wi-Fi (802.11ax) is heavily affected by homes around me so only one AP can run with 80MHz channel width and the rest is 20-40MHz. Throughput ends up being somewhere between 150Mbit-500Mbit, depending on where you are.3. I have a few smaller servers running ..stuff. The trouble is not about server performance or bandwidth.. it’s about reliability. Running any business on consumer line (in the USA) is just signing up for trouble. (Eg. “Is your line down because your modem received a fault firmware? No worries, the tech is going to be there within next 4 days to check your cables…”).4. Things like game downloads on PS5 .. yes, they are amazingly fast (even on 1Gbit. They install faster from internet than from the built-in BD-ROM). But many games need to also “install” (whatever that means on PS5) and that takes 2x the time of download anyway. I can live with that once a month.5. Big fan of streaming services, however many providers limit bitrate on their side so I am still watching the sometimes blurry 4k …Back to original question and with genuine curiosity - what is 25Gbit for???"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On behalf of all tech-minded Americans, I would like to say... I hate you.I just got a notice in the mail that my ISP is &#34;upgrading&#34; their network so now I can pay $200 USD/month to get a whopping 2gbps, which I actually thought was pretty amazing until I read your post. So, thanks.In all seriousness, congrats! You made a good case for why one would need that much bandwidth. Also, we need to catch up here. :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This has happened to me also (indie game dev) a few years ago.The number is about 20 or so games that have been removed by Apple because they hadn&#39;t been updated in two years. The worked perfectly fine on all the new hardware/software and even work today.On top of that, I know that there is another 30 or so apps I was involved in with clients that have also been removed.These weren&#39;t the biggest apps/games in the world, but they were all high quality finished products that had nothing wrong with them.   Its just the cost of re-publishing each one out-weighed the return, so I didn&#39;t have much of a choice sadly. I do have plans to re-publish some of them, however they have to take a back seat for current work.All that to say, I have a large part of my portfolio of work that is no longer available to the public, which just sucks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Similar to the author of the tweet, Apple removed a working version of my FlickType Keyboard that catered specifically to the visually impaired community, just because I hadn&#39;t updated it in 2 years.Meanwhile, games like Pocket God have not been updated for 7 years now: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pocket-god/id301387274"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am having trouble summoning the outrage I see in the other comment threads here. The App Store is stuffed full of abandonware. Apple should be more aggressive with this, not less. If you can&#39;t recompile your app and patch up support for recent OSes and recent devices on an ongoing basis, then your business model is not sustainable. I know, I used to sell iOS apps.The market right now is absolutely flooded with indie games, some light pruning is probably for the best."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Sabine’s niche seems to be a confident cynicism or learned skepticism and is a much appreciated addition to the space.I like Sabine’s personality and the fact she stands in defiance of the status quo of scientific outreach, namely my two least favorite tropes: “science is fun” and “let me explain something using terrible metaphors because I fail to understand the math myself”.Sabine, if you’re reading this… please create more technical content.Maybe a companion video to your more general takes.One that shows the numerical side of things. Your experience and personality already lend itself to this effort.You say “the math is insufficient” show us the math!  Show us how it’s insufficient using numerical examples.Scientific outreach has a real “draw the rest of the owl” problem and I think Sabine is perfectly poised to fill the gap.There’s a George Carlin quote I’ll paraphrase ~“never talk down to your audience, they’ll catch up eventually.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve never understood. From an outside perspective the black hole will evaporate before the thing falls in. Thus a thing can never fall in. From its perspective the hole will emit more and more intense radiation and finally evaporate just before it hits the horizon.If true, I think you can go even further and say no black hole can completely form; the collapsing matter just gets exponentially closer to being fully black until the effect of the Hawking radiation outweighs the gravitation, but it all evaporates before going fully black. No?(This latter part assumes there&#39;s some Hawking radiation or equivalent from pre-black holes as well).Now, I assume the pre-Hawking radiation would be unitary, since the only reason Hawking radiation is not unitary is because BHs don&#39;t have information, but pre-black holes are not black holes. So doesn&#39;t that solve the info paradox? Without resorting to holographs and whatnot? Where&#39;s the error?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you change assumptions to solve a big problem, you don’t necessarily need to measure the big problem to check the assumptions. General Relativity itself was first confirmed with a relatively simple measurement of star displacement during a solar eclipse.The “real solution” to the black hole information paradox will be one that solves the paradox AND provides a “small” way to test the change in assumptions that creates the big solution. This is definitely worth looking for IMO."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The sole purpose of blockchain is to prevent double spending without a trusted partyOther proposed applications are mostly dumb / misguided, like immutable storage, social network posts, etc, these can be done with hashing or digital signatures aloneIf you have a better way to avoid double spending than blockchain folks woukd get very excited. Traditional database can’t do that (requires a trusted party)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Blockchain has no use other than to store tokens for speculative gambling. 
Take a look at this presentation - https://bit.ly/3OB5G18Proof-of-work - the USP of blockchain makes it slow and expensive and planet destroying at scale. But it&#39;s not a bug, it&#39;s a feature. You take it out and the blockchain is neither public not permission-less. A private, trusted, permissioned blockchain is pointless.The whole blockchain, web3, crypto, NFT, DeFi, DAO ecosystem is a massive ponzi scheme. The proponents keep cooking up new buzzwords to keep the pot boiling and to attract new starry eyed idiots who will bring in real money into the system to keep the ponzi going.Blockchain is a hammer in search of nail. A solution for problems that do not exist."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Blockchains are excellent for logging that uses trustable peer participation, distributed append, and tamper resistance. For example, each peer can add their own chain links, and also see all the chain links added by other peers, and also be sure that the log hasn&#39;t been corrupted by any of the peers.Some examples IMHO are logs of participation (e.g. voting), agreements (e.g. contracts), exchange (e.g. payments), and auditing (e.g. compliance).A blockchain can be public or protected i.e. private just to the participants. A blockchain can store plain text information or access-controlled information i.e. encrypted information or links to sign in systems.All of these capabilities provide massive trust advantages over a traditional database as managed by a central administrative entity, which requires the participants must trust the central administrative entity to be truthful, unbiased, secure, and with sufficient high availability and disaster recoverability."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Off-Topic: Most stories about politicsI wish this was still the case. Talking about politics used to be avoided here, and certainly engaging in reddit-tier partisan arguing was extremely rare. Now there are political posts almost every day that have comment sections full of mud slinging. I&#39;m guilty of it too, even as recently as today, so I&#39;m not taking a holier than thou position, but man those threads are just incredibly strong flamebait.There has been a noticeable shift in the way HN engages with political topics over the last couple of years, and more recently in particular."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a young person who has often been exposed to reddit and the rest of the internet&#39;s political flame wars, HN has really taught me how to communicate respectfully with people who I don&#39;t agree with, which often leads to better understanding of a topic. Thank you, mods"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What many may not realize is that there&#39;s a thriving industry in sending passengers on planes for the sole purpose of them taking things from A to B.Years ago, you could get discounted flights to Europe where you couldn&#39;t check in any luggage. Why? That allowance was taken up by documents for various clients. This was usually quicker than any courier services at the time.I&#39;ve had friends who worked in the oil and gas industry. One story I was told was where parts were desperately needed to repair a drill bit on a gas platform. The best option? Someone would fly halfway around the world, drive to a particular factory, wait for the parts and then fly back. This was cheaper and faster than any courier service, even if you spent $10,000+ on the ticket.This was exacerbated because a person with 200lb of machine parts could walk through customs where a shipment might get stuck in customs for weeks. And each day of non-operation cost hundreds of thousands of dollars."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While the tweet is correct (&#34;It is physically impossible to exceed the 70-pound domestic weight limit for a small flat rate box&#34;) the shortened title here which omits the word &#34;small&#34; is very misleading.  The USPS offers a variety of sizes of flat rate boxes (https://www.usps.com/ship/priority-mail.htm#flatrate), all of which have the same 70 lb weight limit.  It&#39;s only the &#34;small&#34; that cannot be overweight.  The two mediums and the large can exceed the limit with dense contents.  Perhaps the title could be changed to omit &#34;physical&#34; and add back &#34;small&#34;?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a 115lb shipment of small metal parts that needs to be across the country before Wed.  Both FedEx and UPS quoted me ~$750 to ship it in a 12&#34;x8&#34;x8&#34; OSB box via 2-day shipping.  Fedex one rate boxes have a weight limit of 50lbs.  The small boxes are $31/ea to ship.  I just finished breaking the shipment up into 3 parts.  Heck, next day would be ~$300."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"After one year, I-bonds are pretty similar to savings accounts and they are indexed to inflation. Your money won&#39;t grow, but it won&#39;t shrink either -- and as Treasury bonds they are the lowest-risk investment that exists. If you buy some today, they will pay 7.12% for the next 6 months. After that they will probably be adjusted to pay even more, based on the current inflation rate.There are two major catches: you have to wait at least 1 year before you cash them out, and a person can only buy 10k in I-bonds per year.After the first year is over, selling I-bonds and getting access to the cash takes a few business days.I&#39;ve been tiering my emergency savings based on how many redeemable I-bonds I have. I have enough money in the bank to cover emergencies I might need to pay for very quickly -- things like plumbing problems, car repair, etc. The rest of my emergency fund is going into I-bonds. If I have a longer-term need for savings, like losing my job, I don&#39;t need all of my savings right away and I can wait for the amount of time it takes to cash out I-bonds."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The issue is that there is no incentive for banks to increase interest rates on accounts as they are already sitting on too much cash. Banks make money by lending money out, in times where banks are strapped for cash on hand, you will see interest rates increase. I don’t see this changing in the near future."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I spent the last few years developing software on AWS. I honestly cannot imagine not using it. Once you get good at infrastructure as code (CDK), microservices, and how everything wires together, any other technical stack is just painful. I still believe that engineers are completely underestimating productivity gains in people that are good at AWS. There is just so much less BS in terms of systems working, everything clicks together, you arent stitching a million open source libraries to build a stack. Billions of dollars of effort are behind making it as seamless as possible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I agree that there is weird cult-like thinking around AWS, when the reality is their base services like EC2 or s3 are pretty great but most of them are just mediocre. Yet, people will insist on using services just because AWS built it, mostly just brand mentality.Running things on prem or on something like Hetzner cloud can be much simpler in some cases, and with Kubernetes now you can provide a great platform anywhere. It just isn&#39;t the solution for every use case."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The first half of the post is like blaming the barman because you drank a bottle of Michters Celebration and are stuck with a $30K bill. It’s not hard. Just don’t buy shit that may bankrupt you.And suggesting Hetzner dedicated servers as an alternative? Why not EC2 spot instances if you’re so budget conscious? It’s just Linux (or whatever you put on them).We spent big on dedicated hardware in the early days of our biz. Sure we bought bandwidth at 95th percentile which was cheaper. But as our people became our biggest cost we quickly moved into aws and haven’t looked back. Our bill is $500K per year and we happily pay it because payroll would be way more. However it’s the richness of the toolset and on demand scalability that is the real win.If you need to push a fuckton of bandwidth with little CPU usage you should buy your own metal, colo it and buy bandwidth at 95th percentile billing. We dug up a sidewalk and leased from Zayo to do just that for a specific thing. Most other applications belong in a cloud provider like aws."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Another way to put this is that for most pop music, you could often degrade gracefully to three triads of major or minor quality.But even for something discussed previously on HN-- the Beach Boys &#34;God Only Knows&#34;-- this doesn&#39;t work. Wilson really wants a half-diminished seventh chord at the high point of the melody. One could perhaps degrade to a diminished triad in the accompaniment, but he&#39;s literally singing the seventh of the chord so it&#39;s there regardless. Substituting a major or minor triad there is a qualitative change and sounds suspicious.If you&#39;re making your own instrument you might want to be aware that there&#39;s a &#34;suspicious&#34; sound that some types of consistent chord substitutions can have on certain classes of instruments.For example, a bagpiper can make severe simplifications to the harmony or even change melodic intervals to fit what they have available. Audiences generally accept this because the strictures of the instrument have made that a common practice. (Even if you&#39;re unaware of the strictures, you&#39;ve probably gotten used to hearing the result of the common practice.)However, if one consistently employs major/minor triad substitutions on the guitar people are eventually going to hear that as a lack of quality. As in the Beach Boys example, this will often happen during key points. The guitarist may get lucky if the singer happens to fill out the missing note of the chord-- e.g., guitarist plays a minor triad and the singer fills out the seventh at the beginning of the chorus of &#34;Last Dance with Mary Jane&#34;-- but eventually the audience will figure out that the guitarist is missing a vital skill.Anyway, unless your instrument is so novel it doesn&#39;t have any associations with extant instruments, make sure you have some kind of &#34;escape hatch&#34; so that skilled performers can play the chords they need. :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The obligatory video is of course &#34;Four Chords&#34; by Axis of Awesome:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pidokakU4IRick Beato has kind of the opposite video about &#34;the most complex song ever&#34;:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnRxTW8GxT8The song in question is Never Gonna Let You Go by Sergio Mendes; plenty of videos exist of it; here&#39;s one live:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPh3bTglak"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A couple notes&gt; While it&#39;s almost always I, IV, V, and vi, we have both II/ii and III/iii, differing on whether the third is major or minor.This might be a bit confusing as written, because the slash &#34;/&#34; is normally used in roman numerals to indicate secondary chords. For example, the II chord may be written as V/V. (V/V is always II, but not the other way around... the &#34;/&#34; notation indicates that the chord is functioning as a secondary chord, which is something you figure out from context.)The terminology &#34;open chords&#34; is also a bit unusual. The term &#34;open chords&#34; usually refers to chords that use open strings (strings that are not fingered). Chords without a third are often called &#34;power chords&#34;. You can do your entire song with power chords if you&#39;re playing rock music.I&#39;d also add that what chords you get as the three/four chords you need depends so heavily on genre. If you were playing blues, you might pick I7, IV7, and V7 for your first three, and then maybe bVII7 as the fourth. If you were playing jazz, you might pick something like I69, ii9, IVmaj7, V7."</p>
