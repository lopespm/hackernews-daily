We respect your privacy. Aurora Store is also unaffected by Google marking your device as uncertified or lacking of necessary Google apps. Play Protect is not present, as this is a Play Store only feature.Do I need Google Play Services to use Aurora Store?No. Aurora Store was built to access the Google Play store without any kind of Google services. It doesn&#39;t matter if you use it with or without Google Play Services/MicroG.Is it safe to use Aurora store?Aurora Store is fully open-source and verified by F-Droid. If you&#39;re asking about the safety of the apps in the store, those are the exact same ones the Play Store would load and display. A lot of dangerous stuff seems to sneak past Google though, so as a rule of thumb, don&#39;t download anything which you&#39;re unsure about."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d urge anyone who finds this behaviour unacceptable to contact the UK&#39;s CMA - the regulator responsible for competition.They have an ongoing investigation into Google and Apple&#39;s practices with regards to app stores (and mobile platforms in general) [1], and have been looking for evidence on the topic of competition in app stores, and dominance.While the UK is just one country, the CMA has a wide mandate to act on competition matters and has announced their preliminary findings on the merger of Facebook and Giphy, which (in short) recommend a forced sale of Giphy to prevent potential future anticompetitive moves, such as through terms of service. They have a particular current interest in digital markets, and are forming a new unit specifically to deal with tech antitrust issues (the digital markets unit)While the CMA public consultation on the Apple/Google mobile platforms work has closed, their investigation team can be contacted via the email inbox listed at [1]. When engaging with regulators like this (for anyone not familiar), it is helpful if you explain why a particular move has harmed you, and can give examples or any available evidence about it, and explain the impact that it has had on you, and the impact on the wider ecosystem as a result.I&#39;m sure other regulators are looking into this, but for those who are unhappy about this situation, I&#39;d urge you to contact a regulator. If your own national regulator isn&#39;t looking into it, there&#39;s no reason not to contact the UK one (or indeed any other), and explain your concerns and help them with finding evidence - often for policy and enforcement teams, getting evidence together is the hard part of their job, and I can say from experience they do read their emails.[1] https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/mobile-ecosystems-market-study[2] https://www.gov.uk/government/news/facebook-s-takeover-of-gi..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think the problem Apple ran into was that there was no confusion at all. Apple announced they were going to scan users&#39; devices after years of marketing themselves as a &#34;privacy-focused&#34; company. Shockingly, customers were pretty mad about the whole thing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is one of those failure apologies, that&#39;s just making us dislike them even more.I have no idea why they haven&#39;t done a 180 yet, this is a bigger failure than the butterfly keyboard. They are letting themselves become the symbol of technological dystopia in the public consciousness. Even an acquaintance who does construction was venting to me about how bad apple&#39;s policy is and why she is getting a pixel.After entirely removing that feature and making a commitment to fight against that kind of future I feel like they owe two more apologies to get on my good side - one for screwing up this bad in the first place and one for insulting my intelligence with their handling of the outcry. This isn&#39;t 1990, you don&#39;t handwave a mistake this big."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the &#34;confusion&#34; was 100% intentional. That the two features (iMessage scanning &amp; on-device spying pre-upload to iCloud) were intentionally released at the same time to make the whole thing harder to criticize in a soundbite.Confusion is the best-case scenario for Apple because people will tune it out. If they had released just the on-device spying, public outcry and backlash would have been laser targeted on a single issue."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love the tone of this, it’s like the musings of an explorer who discovered a jungle city abandoned by a mysterious civilization.“there were old wall slogans inside that must have been added to motivate and inspire the employees” … “ the tall building had several brick structures on the lower main level. He suspected that those structures probably had plants and ferns in them so that important business clients and employees would be met with a pleasing sight upon entering.” … “Martin Gonzalez also noticed pictures of people using Motorola products that had been left on the walls of the building.”Indeed, the ways of the people of the Motorola civilization of around 2011CE are mysterious and strange to us. Perhaps the central atrium served some kind of ritual purpose? Were prisoners perhaps thrown off the upper balconies as a sacrifice to their gods? We will never really know."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sorry for the expression but &#34;holy shit!&#34;.I worked in Motorola for 10 years from the late 90&#39;s. I was based in Europe but travelled to Schaumburg every two months or so (or to Phoenix).It is really a shock to see this place abandoned - last time I was there (15 years ago) it was very much alive.It has been a long time since I had such a nostalgic squeeze of heart."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s amazing that neither the article nor any of the comments so far mention that Google bought part of Motorola, for its 10,000 patents. Then sold it a few years later.I was in Google Patents and I interviewed people for the position of &#34;acquirer of patents.&#34; This was a period when they actually thought the &#34;throw weight&#34; of your patent portfolio really mattered in cross-licensing deals. Most of those patents were utterly worthless in any sort of deal."</p>

					<h3><a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2021-08-12-git-password-authentication-is-shutting-down/">Git password authentication is shutting down</a></h3>
				</div>
				<div class="story__comments">
					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28160869">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m fine with this change for my usage, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve used password auth for myself or any automated service I&#39;ve setup for years now. However, this will introduce more confusion for newcomers who already have to figure out what Git, GitHub, etc are. I just spent some time last weeekend teaching someone the basics of how to create a new project. Such a simple idea required introducing the terminal, basic terminal commands, GitHub, git and its most common commands. It took about 3 hours for us to get through just the most basic pieces. Adding on ssh-keygen, key management adds even more friction.It&#39;s certainly a difficult problem. How can we offer a more gentle learning curve for budding developers while still requiring &#34;real&#34; projects to use best practices for security and development?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ok I&#39;ll admit it. I&#39;m the dingus who is still using https and login/password. It&#39;s how I learned to use it years ago and since I only ever access GitHub via cli it&#39;s all I&#39;ve ever learned. I don&#39;t program anything complex and I&#39;ve never put anything secure up on GitHub (it&#39;s public, after all, so i had the expectation that all info on there is insecure). I don&#39;t understand why this is being deprecated when it&#39;s the default suggestion GitHub provides you when you add a new repo to your profile so that you can connect your local git repo to it. For hosting my trivial personal projects it seems so silly to have to go onto github&#39;s web interface and click through a bunch of their ui to build a personal passkey(which is just a password with a different name afaict).  Am I just not the intended audience for the change or am I missing something crucial that doesn&#39;t make this seem like a bunch of extra effort for no meaningful change?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Disclosure: I&#39;m the Git Systems PM at GitHub. Opinions are my own and I wasn&#39;t directly involved with this effort.GCM Core is a really straightforward way to auth with GitHub and several other Git hosts. It comes with Git for Windows by default, can be installed with `brew` on macOS, and from a .deb on Linux. https://github.com/microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-Core (it started under the Microsoft banner but is maintained by GitHub employees now)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">" A great example of starting something to solve a real problem that you faced yourself.

All the best."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Slip approach for interactive courses is what is missing in most of learning platforms. For developers the learning process happens when you start coding not by watching videos. But most of the platforms like Udemy they only support text and video materials. We actually wrote an article about importance of learn by doing https://dev.to/corpcubite/why-learn-by-doing-is-important-5a... hope you find it helpful."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good idea. Please consider generating websites from the courses to allow people to &#34;white label&#34; this. Alternatively, offer iframes or an api - a kind of headless CMS. This would allow course creators to feel comfortable not being so locked in."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It might seems like a simple feel-good story for some, but it&#39;s more than that. I didn&#39;t imagine how much children learn and cope through toys until I had my own kids.Example 1: when my daughter was 2 she got a fishbone stuck in her mouth. I gave her lots of bread and water so that something would force the small bone to go down. After 5 minutes the issue was resolved and she immediately jumped to her teddy bear and started playing &#34;you have a bone teddy, you need bread, take this, take that&#34;. The first plays were urgent and quite serious and the teddy was always &#34;cured&#34; quickly. But later through the following days as she played the same idea she started to improvise. Teddy, in her hands, would cough and cough - I would offer him things for 10 minutes and more and nothing would help him. And she would laugh at this. After these plays fish bones in her mind were no longer serious.Example 2: when she was 3 we tried to adapt her to a kindergarten. After the first day when she was home she picked up her toy cars and started playing. Some of the cars were teachers, others were children, one was me, another one was her, and one small car was a smaller child that cried all the time. And we played the routine where I came to the kindergarten with her, stayed for a bit, and then went to work. At the moment the &#34;dad&#34; car went to work she would physically tense up and become silent, as if it was really happening. But those moments became easier once she learned more details about what to expect during the typical day in the kindergarten and that later the &#34;dad&#34; car always comes back to take her home. Seems like this experience was helpful as, despite being somewhat shy, she never cried during her adaptation period."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This kind of stuff is super helpful.My dad was a surgeon who treated kids with scoliosis. He also happened to make teddy bears as a hobby. So he made a teddy bear with an artificial spine in it that he put scoliosis hardware on.When he was meeting with a kid for a pre-op consult, he would let the kid hug the teddy bear, and then he would show them the teddy bear&#39;s X-Ray. It really helped them understand what was going to happen to them, and put them at ease."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This dad is carrying on a fantastic, but not at all new tradition. I had surgery in the early 1970&#39;s when I was three, and I&#39;ve still got the old teddy bear up in a box in the attic that the staff at the hospital made for me that &#34;needed the same surgery&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really want to like Snopes, but I&#39;m not convinced that they weigh evidence correctly. For example, they debunked the myth that Marilyn Monroe had 6 toes. First, I don&#39;t believe that she did. Or even care, for that matter. But at the time, one of their &#34;facts&#34; was that if she&#39;d had a toe removed, she&#39;d basically have to learn to walk all over again because it would throw her balance completely off. (Note: the article no longer includes this fact. It did at one time, though.)However, my wife&#39;s a podiatrist. Part of her job is amputating parts of feet when they&#39;re damaged or infected beyond repair. I asked her what it&#39;s like for an otherwise healthy adult to recover from a pinky toe amputation, and she said it&#39;s basically a matter of waiting for the wound site to heal and then they continue with life as normal. Contrary to popular belief, even a big toe amputation isn&#39;t that disruptive. A vestigial 6th toe hanging off to the side? You&#39;d never notice it was gone.I emailed Snopes and said hey, while I agree with your conclusion, this particular supporting fact is invalid according to an expert in the field. They replied basically that I was an idiot for believing she had 6 toes, and they left the article as-is.That&#39;s not at all what I thought, and I actually agreed with their conclusion. I just didn&#39;t like that they were using incorrect facts to support it, and especially didn&#39;t like that they reacted poorly to a well-meant correction.Since then, I&#39;ve been skeptical of Snopes. Although I think they&#39;re probably right most of the time, that left a bad taste in my mouth. Are other people sending them corrections about their own fields of expertise and having them rejected? I have no way of knowing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"All modern media companies today have been built by using these kinds of shady &#34;growth hacks.&#34;Doesn&#39;t anybody see the irony of Buzzfeed calling out a fellow media company for using such tactics?Buzzfeed&#39;s entire growth strategy for years was copy-pasting content from trending reddit threads and turning them into &#34;listicles&#34; with clickbait headlines, then feeding them into Facebook.Was that not also plagiarism?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Netflix, like countless other online services, is not built for global citizens - people that work in different countries to their own.I am a British born expat, living in Qatar, so of course I want to watch the UK orientated Netflix programming and not the Arabic or Hindi. I have a UK TV license but of course, I can&#39;t watch UK TV from Qatar. Trying to pay for things online is frequently a nightmare as many companies won&#39;t take payment from a UK card unless it&#39;s from a UK IP. Same trying to pay tax on my US houses, also some websites don&#39;t even let you connect to them unless you use a US IP address! Google rightly defaults to Arabic if you&#39;re not logged in, that&#39;s fine, but even they don&#39;t provide a simple way to change the language to English! Similar with Spotify, same with Apple music. Whatsapp voice calls are blocked in Qatar.All of these problems and many more are bypassed with a good VPN. It amazes me how few services ever take into consideration that people don&#39;t always live and work in their country of origin. If VPN&#39;s are clamped down on it&#39;s going to make life difficult for tens of millions of people. VPN&#39;s are actually VITAL in many situations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Many years ago, I worked at a small (3 US states) ISP, roughly 500-600K customersThis ISP was one that mostly absorbed smaller ISP&#39;s that weren&#39;t able to scale up enough to remain competitive.One of the ISP&#39;s they absorbed was CondoInternet. A Seattle based firm that provided gigabit internet service across Seattle&#39;s affluent areas and expensive condosAs it turned out, a lot of the customers ordering the service hailed from a country with a very restrictive censorship regime. A &#34;great firewall&#34; if you willThey&#39;d set up home-made VPN&#39;s using Raspberry Pi&#39;s etc for family to tunnel into and watch Netflix on typicallyNetflix however even in 2017 was smart and their algorithm would see these thousands of people logging in while everyone else in Seattle was typically asleep and eventually ban the entire ISP&#39;s IP range. Logging in would give a &#34;please turn off your proxy/VPN&#34; error messageEvery time this happened the ISP&#39;s phone tree would explode, going from mere seconds to literal 6-10 hour queue times. The NOC was entirely upskilled CS agents who had no idea how to contact Netflix&#39;s relevant teams to get the IP ban removed, instead they&#39;d simply tell CS to have customers wait until the IP ban expired (usually a few days)This would happen almost every other month"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Disney+ had inexplicably blocked my IP address for &#34;being a VPN&#34; for close to year, despite me never running a VPN from my home network. Though the block didn&#39;t stop me from watching their content, it just stopped me from paying for, which I was more than willing to do and spent far to long dealing with their support to try to make it happen.If the same thing happens with Netflix, it also won&#39;t keep me from watching Netflix content, I&#39;ll just stop paying for it. Other than the aforementioned Disney+ content, I rarely pirate anything these days and I&#39;d rather not if I can help it."</p>

We don’t notice this on the web, because Mozilla and Google (!) enforce terms for us (and most desktops don’t have GPS receivers).Take out the gatekeeper on mobile and we might find that the benevolent dictatorship wasn’t so bad after all.Edit: want to add that replacing Apple’s consumer protection gatekeeper role with a government agency is a non starter. Apple (and to give them credit, Google) know that the data available to the gatekeeper role is toxic and dangerous. Government thinks it’s a big bowl of lollies."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is mostly good, but it forces Apple/Google to hand over your email address (or other means of communication) to anyone you download an app from so they can spam you.The bill says they don’t have to allow spam, but specially allows “legitimate business offers, such as pricing terms and product or service offerings”… which is spam unless one explicitly opts-in to it.I don’t appreciate the double-talk. This part of the bill is user hostile and should be deleted."</p>
