								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To me, the particular use case and whether it is fair use or not, is of minor interest. A far more pressing matter is at hand: AI centralization and monopolization.Take Google as an example, running Google Photos for free for several years. And now that this has sucked in a trillion photos, the AI job is done, and they likely have the best image recognition AI in existence.Which is of course still peanuts compared to training a super AI on the entire web.My point here is that only companies the size of Google and Microsoft have the resources to do this type of planetary scale AI. They can afford the super expensive AI engineers, have the computing power and own the data or will forcefully get access to it. We will even freely give it to them.Any &#34;lesser&#34; AI produced from smaller companies trying to compete are obsolete, and the better one accelerates away. There is no second-best in AI, only winners.If we predict that ultimately AI will change virtually every aspect of society, these companies will become omnipresent, &#34;everything companies&#34;. God companies.As per usual, it will be packaged as an extra convenience for you. And you will embrace it and actively help realize this scenario."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If the training set contains verbatim (A)GPL code does this mean that Copilot also should be distributed by Microsoft under GPL? Because without it Copilot (as it is distributed by Microsoft) couldn&#39;t be built, wouldn&#39;t it make it a derivative work of GPL&#39;d code (and obviously every other license)?I see a lot of people comparing human learning to machine learning in the comments, but there is a huge difference - we don&#39;t distribute copies of humans"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am really confused by HN&#39;s response to copilot. It seems like before the twitter thread on it went viral, the only people who cared about programmers copying (verbatim!) short snippets of code like this would be lawyers and executives. Suddenly everyone is coming out of the woodworks as copyright maximalists?I know HN loves a good &#34;well actually&#34; and Microsoft is always suspect, but let&#39;s leave the idea of code laundering to the Oracle lawyers. Let hackers continue to play and solve interesting problems.Copilot should be inspiring people to figure out how to do better than it, not making hackers get up in arms trying to slap it down."</p>

Flip basically charged 1 month rent and guaranteed a fill or they&#39;d pay the rest (6 months) of my lease. Compared to our landlord who wanted 1.75x rent, up to 2.75x rent if not filled immediately, after significant negotiation. Hiring a broker myself would have likely cost 1x rent or more anyways with all the risk on us.I really like the service provider + financial underwriting combination, where you get basically an SLA for them providing a  service, where they take 100% of the risk after the fee."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My father has COPD from over 50 years of smoking. I convinced him to switch to vaping and he&#39;s been using a Juul for a few years now. Awhile after the switch his primary care physician listened to his lungs and said they sounded a lot better. She said she because the science isn&#39;t in &#34;I can&#39;t tell you to vape but I can tell you to keep doing what you&#39;re doing&#34;.Should non-smokers pick up vaping? Probably not. But in this one instance it was a good move for a smoker.I&#39;d like to see more studies in this area and some more regulations on the &#34;juice&#34; for vapes. The quality, and I assume health effects, vary widely between different juices. For example: I bought him a non-refillable vape by another company and he started coughing and complaining of soreness in his throat.I also think the arguments against the flavored juices are hysterical/hypocritical given the variety of flavors of liquor one can find.Disclaimer: I think all drugs should be legal."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We spent decades trying to get rid of cigarettes and it worked and now we let this fucking Juul through the front door. It’s as if we haven’t learned a fucking thing in decades, and the fact that this founder is celebrated in Silicon Valley sickens me. He just found another opportunity to hook kids on nicotine for another few generations and now he’s a fucking billionaire. Fuck that guy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s quite outrageous.If this special issue was peer-reviewed, people donated their time for free to publish 11 studies with potentially severe conflicts of interest.If the issue was not peer-reviewed, then the editors handed out free publication for money, which is what predatory journals do.There is no way to spin this as remotely related to good scientific practice, which would mean:- Funding is independent of results- Double-blind peer review- Pre-registration wherever possible"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Let me take these PhD level regex down to elementary school awesome.I have a process table and I want to grep it for the phrase &#34;banana&#34;:ps auxww | grep bananaroot  87  Jun21   0:26.78 /System/Library/CoreServices/FruitProcessor --core=bananamikec 456 450PM   0:00.00 grep bananaArgh! It also greps for the grep for banana! Annoying!Well, I&#39;m sure there&#39;s pgrep or some clever thing, but my coworker showed me this and it took me a few minutes to realize how it works:ps auxww | grep [b]ananaroot  87  Jun21   0:26.78 /System/Library/CoreServices/FruitProcessor --core=bananaDoc Brown spoke to me: &#34;You&#39;re just not thinking fourth dimensionally!&#34; Like Marty, I have a real problem with that. But don&#39;t you see: [b]anana matches banana but it doesn&#39;t match &#39;grep [b]anana&#39; as a raw string. And so I get only the process I wanted!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The more general tip is that a single regex isn&#39;t the only tool you have.  You don&#39;t have to get your final product one one step.  Almost every &#34;disaster&#34; regex comes from someone trying to do too much at once.One other solution would have been to run the regex twice, once to pick up all instances of Tarzan, and a second on the results of the first to filter out all instances of &#34;Tarzan&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This trick may be thought of as a simplification of the systematic approach to parsing stuff, that is the lexer-parser division of responsibilities.The lexer uses regexes but only for splitting the input stream of characters into tokens. Identifiers, integers, operators, strings, keywords, opening brackets and whatnot - each type of token is defined by a regex. This part is hopefully deterministic and simple, although the lexer matches regexes for all kinds of tokens at once, which is why lexer generators are often used to generate lexers.The heavy lifting is done by the actual parser which tries to combine the tokens into something that makes sense from the point of the grammar.So in this trick the sub-regexes between |&#39;s define the tokens (the lexer part) while the group mechanism selects the single token that we want to keep (a very very simple parser)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For languages with Hindley-Milner typing, like SML and OCaml, it has long been known that type-checking is even worse in the worst case (DEXPTIME hard) [1]. But the programs where this matters aren&#39;t what one would write by hand, typically.[1] https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/96709.96748"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had not thought of pattern-exhaustiveness checking like that.Isn&#39;t compiling several languages, including Rust, actually undecidable though? Seems like if your type system or metaprogramming systems are Turing complete, this has to be the case.So that&#39;s ~worse than NP-hard already (though calling it NP-hard is still technically correct)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"TFA notes that rustc is not a particular _efficient_ SAT solver, taking something like 10^4 times as long as a commonly used algorithm [1] would on a small example.So, I&#39;m curious: what&#39;s the _strongest_ case one could make for including a more robust SAT solver as part of the exhaustiveness checking? Is there any reasonable place where this could matter? (Extremely autogenerated code?)[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPLL_algorithm"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Former film pro here. I don&#39;t see anything &#39;impossible&#39; here, most of this is stuff I could do on my desk 10 years ago with a modest setup - but only with a lot of patience and manual labor.If these demos fairly represent the user experience then it&#39;s slick as hell and further blurs the line between editor, compositor, DI specialist etc. Much will depend on whether the ML marketplace can be competitive with many mature commercial offerings from software studios that have no intention of letting their lunch be eaten. Video production involves a lot of bleeding edge technology but the client base is also suspicious of new providers or do-it-all solutions at first, and very loyal to products and tech support offerings that have got them through difficult projects in the past, so there will be a big hill to climb between people acknowledging it&#39;s cool as hell and their willingness to sell it to a producer who is making a 5, 6, or 7 figure bet on what some editor/VFX geek is telling them.The web browser/cloud storage is an issue. It could be a plus in many circumstances, but it&#39;s also a big barrier to any production that&#39;s working in a remote location without reliable internet, especially given the massive data volumes involved. That limits a lot of the use cases to post production, and many producers and directors are going to be wary of starting on one platform and finishing on something else; nobody likes workflow changes unless they can be shown something seamless, like having your Avid/Final Cut/Premiere/* project leave your machine and show up frame-perfect in Runway, along with a definite answer about export time like being able to take in 12 hours of video and have it online within 24h. There will also have to be a lot of questions about security, downtime, and being able to get your project back out of Runway if money runs out, the editor gets fired, creative differences rear their head etc.Looks like an instant win for short-form projects like personal shorts, music videos, commercials, corporate, demo reels, spec pieces. Potentially very good for reality TV indie and low-mid budget films once the above questions are answered. Toughest nut to crack is large budget or episodic TV where there&#39;s very stiff competition and contractual or professional commitments already in place, but doable within 5 years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m so glad to see this on the front page -- this website, in conjunction with a video from Two Minute Papers, is what convinced me to teach myself machine learning. I come from a filmmaking background, and have used green screen extensively. It&#39;s big, bulky, has to be set up correctly, lit correctly, and is expensive and just generally a pain to work with.I&#39;m currently working on a fully-automatic version of this based off some excellent research from the University of Washington. It&#39;s still in its infancy, but if you&#39;d like to follow my progress, I post occasional updates over on https://nomoregreenscreen.comThis is just the beginning of what&#39;s possible in the intersection between DL and creative filmmaking, and I&#39;m really excited to get to be in this field at a time when compute is cheaper than ever and all the information I could want is available for free on the internet!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve just given this a go, with very little work I was able to produce a near seamless mask which was able to adapt to dynamic and changing pose - interesting stuff.The main drawback I observed was computation speed, most edits required &gt;20 seconds of loading/buffering (with a 1Gbps internet connection). I presume the computation occurs on their own servers, so with beefier hardware the performance could be increased, however my intuition is that the app would perform faster if running natively (rather than a shared resource quota on a remote server).In this regard, the lack of performance could be a major productivity killer, my hypothesis is that it is the video processing/manipulation which is taking a long time (and not the model classification). Many companies have tackled this problem space with completely video transcoding chips (such as YouTube), however this generally still incurs long periods of waiting."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is so eerily familiar I swear I&#39;ve had many of these exact conversations word for word. The only way this doesn&#39;t turn into a complete nightmare of a cluster is if the exec team &#34;gets it&#34;.  If so, you just might stand a chance at building a data team that gels with the rest of the org.But if the exec team simply hired you for window-dressing, expect to be treated like a scapegoat and a punching bag. Any mistakes will be your fault. Any wins will be to the credit of the business.  The Director of Product will ask to &#34;embed&#34; dedicated DS headcount and you won&#39;t have any real power to shape the roadmap. If the exec team doesn&#39;t give you equal footingf with Product (or Marketing, Finance, and Eng for that matter) then this will rapidly become a soul-sucking job.  However, if E-team does give you the authority to call Product&#39;s bullshit, and tell Finance to stuff it, and not take direction from Eng leads, then you actually might be able to accomplish something really cool."</p>

You could&#39;ve achieved everything you wanted in investing even in the pre-computer era, like for example Buffett did. In fact you could&#39;ve done everything you wanted already in the 1600s Amsterdam - see the book &#34;Confusion of Confusions&#34;, a pretty great read.Read the 10-Ks, think about what people (will) need, what kind of margin pressures and competition dynamics will play out across the economy, read finance history books, play with pricing models.
