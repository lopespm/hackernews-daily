								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m in a post-Thanksgiving charitable mood, so thank you, Jack. The execution hasn&#39;t been perfect (as has been commented on ad nauseam), but Twitter is the closest to a worldwide-accessible [1] Speaker&#39;s Corner [2] I know of, and that - despite all the completely valid criticism - is a valuable public service: mediating access to information has been the defining tool of control for those in power pretty much since civilization began, and I, for one, will always pick an imperfectly moderated cesspool over the prior status quo where a church or a government told me what&#39;s true and what to think. FWIW, you&#39;ve also championed transparency and decentralization for your platform more than any other SV social media titan [3].[1] If you have access to the Internet, that is.
[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speakers%27_Corner 
[3] https://twitter.com/jack/status/1204766078468911106"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A few reflections on this announcement.1) Remember that CEOs of public companies are essentially unable to say what they think or want. The cost of doing it is being sued for damages, having to spend countless hours with lawyers, etc. Jack might think X, but he&#39;s only allowed to say Y, and he doesn&#39;t want to go beyond that because he doesn&#39;t want to fight that fight.Only people in a close circle really know what&#39;s going on, and it&#39;s most certainly not random people on the Internet (or HN).2) Also, consider that Twitter, and perhaps Facebook (sorry but I don&#39;t give a sh*t that its new name is Meta), are really difficult companies to run, especially if you&#39;d like to do some public good, as opposed to just maximizing returns.There are so many things that can go wrong, so many other things that will set your company on fire without warnings, and that doesn&#39;t give people the time to think strategically on how to tackle certain difficult scenarios.Twitter and Facebook essentially control most of the public discourse these days; never seen such amount of power in the hands of a few companies.3) Despite common opinion, I actually think that Twitter (unlike Facebook) has done more good than harm. Why? Because it has essentially enabled an incredible explosion of &#34;voices&#34; that can be heard (err, read) all over the world.4) Yes, we can think of countless ways to make Twitter better, but remember that Twitter is not run by Jack Dorsey, nor that other companies are run by their CEOs. Companies are run by boards, which means, by large funds with controlling interest in these companies. Even a well-intentioned CEO has to fight against many things his/her board want. And unlike enlightened CEOs, enlightened boards are essentially a very rare creature, almost never seen on planet Earth (IMHO).5) You might think I&#39;m defending Jack, perhaps I am, but it might be because hatred is really easy to dispense, while trying to be balanced in your judgement is really hard, and perhaps the conversation about Twitter should benefit from cooler heads, as opposed to quick slogans."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s zero explanation in the email for why he resigned. He&#39;s re-iterating the point that the company is fine moving forward with the rest of the board, the new CEO and the existing team, but no actual reason as to why he left."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been meaning to write almost exactly this blog post for a while now, glad that someone else did it.Two things that I think are worth calling out:1. In many ways Apple&#39;s anti-competitive behaviour on iOS/iPadOS is a blessing. It&#39;s one of the few things that keep Chromium&#39;s dominance in check. Of course, it&#39;s not great that Apple are stifling innovation like this, but consider the alternative: Chromium dominance on all platforms.2. Why it&#39;s worth caring about this at all? So what if Chromium is the only engine, it would make things easier for developers after all. To this I say, go read some of the discussions in standard bodies(for example about FLoC). Engineers from Apple and Mozilla are largely our bastion against Google&#39;s harmful proposals for the web. Pushback from Apple and Mozilla are only relevant as long as they have market share to speak of. The recent lawsuit against Google(summary[0]) by many US states should be extremely worrying to anyone that cares about the open web and it should make handing over any more control to Google a terrifying prospect.Mozilla maintains a list[1] of their positions on various standard suggestions that is also a useful resource.0: https://twitter.com/fasterthanlime/status/145205393819534131...1: https://mozilla.github.io/standards-positions/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a depressing situation, particularly knowing that Firefox is pretty much kept alive at Google&#39;s whim. It makes one seriously wonder whether it is feasible at all to maintain an independent open-source web browser in 2021. People tend to blame Mozilla&#39;s management and I&#39;m sure there have been management failures but I&#39;m not sure what they could do to make Firefox a thriving, independent, sustainable browser. It seems that the market niche of tech-capable people who value privacy and customisation over a simplified UX is not capable of sustaining Firefox on its own. So Mozilla tries to move in Chrome&#39;s direction, removing configuration options and &#34;dumbing down&#34; the UI, which frustrates its existing user base (including me) while apparently also failing to eat into Chrome&#39;s market share.So what to do? Go back to being the quirky, heavily configurable browser we all know and love? That would be great for me, but even assuming Mozilla can afford to do that now (greater configurability leads to greater code complexity and therefore greater maintenance costs), experience seems to suggest it won&#39;t be enough to allow Mozilla grow its market share to a sustainable level.Finally, and this is a bit of a tangent, but I&#39;ve never quite understood why Mozilla got such a hard time from users about telemetry. I understand that telemetry is in general something to be suspicious of, but we&#39;re not talking about handing your data over to Google so they can target you with ads; we&#39;re talking about sharing technical data with a non-profit organisation to help them maintain and improve the browser you rely on. Mozilla are removing a feature you use daily? Okay, did you enable the telemetry that lets them know you use it? Receiving and analysing user data is increasingly important to delivering a good user experience. If open-source projects can&#39;t access the same data as proprietary ones do, we can&#39;t expect them to be able to react to user demands in the same way, and so we can&#39;t expect them to be able to compete in today&#39;s market."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think part of this discussion needs to be that Firefox, while open source, doesn&#39;t provide footing for the community to build browser forks the way Chromium does. This sort of open usage, ironically, feels very fitting to the spirit of Firefox, but they&#39;re not even close to Chrom(e|ium).I&#39;ve been building a browser full time the past year+ (synth.app) and FF core wasn&#39;t really even an option. They&#39;ve done very little to make the engine usable outside of Firefox.Now I&#39;m sure there are a variety of savory and unsavory things that led here, but building that stuff out seems like a good way to grow the ecosystem. At least they would&#39;ve had a chance at capturing the Brave/Opera/Edge/etc market and those seats at the committees.This isn&#39;t to say that I&#39;m not worried about these standards merging like this. I&#39;ve spent many hours working out weird chromium only behaviors that websites rely on these days to do things (and egregiously so if they detect an agent remotely resembling chrome)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Whenever I try to use something other than IntelliJ (generally VS Code) I&#39;m always struck by how awful the code completion and auto-imports are. I really hope we can get a lightweight editor with those two functions working properly.However, I don&#39;t see how you can do either of those features well without a lot of indexing of the codebase. And indexing is a major reason why IntelliJ so so clunky."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There’s a real opportunity here for JB.If they’re prepared to give this away for free, and make money off of upselling folk on hosted remote dev envs (or licensing the server side to cloud providers) then this could actually compete with vscode.They basically don’t have any other product that is competitive with vscode.…but, I’m skeptical they’re willing to make the jump to freemium based on their other SAS product offerings which have… hm… not been hugely lucrative."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just hope the remote development features will actually work adequately in this.They tried to get that stuff working with existing IDEs multiple times [0][1][2][3], but they are all broken in their unique ways.Whenever I see them announce something new in the remote development space I always jump in right away and try it out, discover it is broken too, and then go back to using VS Code remote dev features.For local dev I still use JB stuff, but it is simply too broken and awkward for remote.[0] https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/configuring-remote-in...[1] https://lp.jetbrains.com/projector/[2] https://blog.jetbrains.com/blog/2021/11/29/introducing-remot...[3] https://www.jetbrains.com/code-with-me/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For those who have worked around and at Stripe for the past decade, this is not a surprise. Stripe, and especially the founders, have a quite a poor reputation for screwing over people in and around their orbit.Almost every fintech startup has the story of Patrick reaching out about an acquisition, mining them for information playing along and then ghosting - same thing for candidates. They leadership team, specifically Patrick and Will Gaybrick are extremely smart but have screwed over a ton of people - be very careful about trusting.You don&#39;t hear anything about this online, they&#39;re incredibly effective at squashing hit pieces and have a huge amount of reporters and power brokers under their control. On HN and silicon valley Stripe and Patrick are a PR machine. Patrick has almost direct control over YC and HN, you&#39;ll notice that every single Stripe post automatically has pc as the first comment, regardless of anything else. Everything negative gets buried.With Patrick now living in Woodside, Will on permanent vacation in Malibu and John permanently in Ireland the company is definitely a bit in chaos mode internally. Their entire people team has turned over and they&#39;re having major retention issues - so I&#39;m not super surprised that stuff like this is starting to leak out.I run a $XB fintech, and am afraid to use my name given the backlash."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Had the opposite experience recently as an EM. Spent a few months trying to find a staff-level engineer. Found a great candidate who worked for a FAANG, worked to get our budget up to his expectations, sold him on the team, and he accepted our offer with a start date 6 weeks in the future so he could have time to wrap up his work. Fine, I&#39;m just happy to have filled the role after an arduous search. A few weeks go by, and he hasn&#39;t responded to my &#34;we&#39;re excited to have you join the team, etc&#34; email or any HR emails about filling out his paperwork. I call and email, the recruiter calls and emails, nothing. We never hear from him again..He&#39;s been active on social media so we know he&#39;s alive, and assume he parlayed our offer into a raise somewhere else. Ok, that happens, but to accept an offer and totally ghost? Jeez. I could have used those intervening weeks to interview more candidates had he just sent me a quick note, now I&#39;ve got to backfill his position while also trying to fill the new ones that just opened... I guess hiring is a shitshow from both sides sometimes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m posting this from a throwaway and not my regular account so not to incriminate myself. But my experience outlined below is 100% truthful.Stripe is arrogant. I have many years of solid and proven experience. They called me out of the blue and I accepted to speak to the hiring manager. The recruiter sounded very arrogant in first conversation. She rushed me to schedule an interview but inexplicably postponed the interview with hiring manager by four weeks once I accepted.When I reached out to an acquaintance of mine who had worked in Stripe in the interim, she said that they are simply in search of marquee brand names in your resume and it is a mess inside. As per her, the people who work there are simply too egotistic. Even people who just happened to have won the &#34;lucky sperm/egg&#34; lottery by joining a rocket ship early on considered themselves as geniuses.In my experience in interviewing with them I felt the same. I sensed an undercurrent of arrogance, feeling of superiority, etc. They deserve praise for what they have accomplished so far and their valuation but it feels like it has gone to their head for many employees who work there now.Needless to say, I didn&#39;t get the job. I&#39;m not bitter but felt that they didn&#39;t treat me well in the process...If you are interviewing there, beware....."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interestingly enough, there has been a community project dedicated to keeping the last Winamp version alive (last version from the original creators), and it really great to use.https://getwacup.com/It includes a skin that allows it to work on modern display resolutions. It&#39;s really interesting to see just how low-res screens were when it was in it&#39;s hey-day, given that they are nearly unusable on a 4k monitor.Edit: I was too young to remember the releases, but replies are indicating that version 5 was in fact, not the most popular :P"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just can’t understand the point of the DMCA takedown here. This software is very dead and abandoned at this point, and the only thing bearing its name is vaporware that appears to be so distant from the original as to effectively not even compete with it.Of course, the copyright holders have every legal right to do so. But doesn’t it seem pointless? This codebase probably has more historical interest than commercial by now. Am I missing something?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Honest question, as someone who actually used Winamp back in ~2004: why would you want to use it now?I have some nostalgia for it, sure, but what exactly does it actually offer you that something like VLC doesn&#39;t? It seems like it plays my music and videos competently enough, and I don&#39;t know anyone who actually uses Shoutcast anymore.This isn&#39;t a passive aggressive dig or anything, I would actually like to know."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I get a horrible feeling in my stomach when I see these &#34;remote&#34; IDE options. I am very sure that they have their benefits, coding from a thin-client machine and having an &#34;always on&#34; session in the cloud ...But it feels like a slow errosion of our control and ownership of our tools. Where everything is becoming a rent-seeking opportunity and good tools are made available for a monthly rent.Personally I like having my whole build system, IDE, CI/CD on a machine I work at. I get this might not be for everyone, but I think we need to be careful what we give up long-term for these conveniences.Granted, I could just use VI and a terminal and nobody is forcing anyone to use anything ... but like many things, they are not like-choices.I depend on my tools, and the fewer dependencies to paid-montly SaaS features the better."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This looks very interesting.This was almost overdue. Since the beginning of Covid, the need for good remote code development raised quite a bit (at least for many people I know, including our team). When compared to VS Code and its remote editing over SSH, IntelliJ was really lacking. I know of a couple of people who went away from PyCharm just because of this.Related reports: https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/PY-19752, https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-226455I tried Code With Me but this seems limited to 10 minutes in the free version or so, and also not really intended for remote editing but more for pair programming.&gt; hosted in SpaceWhat does this mean? I have not really explored this so far. Can I host private own Space instances? I can imagine this would be a requirement in many environments.Is Space an alternative to GitHub or other hosting solutions? We would not want to move our code, issues and internal project management over to some other platform. We just want good remote editing support.Will there be a free community version of Fleet?Anyway, I applied for an invitation to Fleet Preview. Maybe I can get a chance soon to try it out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Meanwhile IntelliJ is rotting with months-old bugs that render entire features useless, with no fixes and no ETAs in sight. The only product that I pay money for that constantly, on almost every release, pains me with new bugs, a good portion of which are never fixed. I thought about using other Jetbrains products like DataGrip (and now this Fleet), but I&#39;m not going to invest even more into a company that simply refuses to fix bugs and regressions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So the cool thing about this demo was that I remember when it was first submitted many years ago and thought it a cool demo that demonstrated the viability of WebGL which I expected to take off a lot quicker than it has.But I also recently came across madebyevan.com again by accident after researching the backing of different npm projects to assess which ones had good momentum or commercial backing behind them to assess their long-term viability, and noticed a lot of npm projects (~2M weekly) relying on esbuild [1] as a fundamental part of their build system due to its amazing performance [1].All good except that the foundational part of many npm projects feature is mostly being maintained by a single developer [2], a @evanw who was also prolific in responding to esbuild&#39;s issue catering for different peoples issues &amp; feature requests. I didn&#39;t think this level of investment in a popular OSS project was sustainable and hoped they had good sponsorship behind them, but was surprised that @evanw [3] didn&#39;t have sponsorships enabled which I thought strange as most authors of popular npm projects have good sponsorship, but upon further research it&#39;s because Evan Wallace&#39;s day job is as the CTO and cofounder of Figma - a popular company with ~10B valuation.Which is great in that esbuild isn&#39;t at risk of being sporadically abandoned from its lead developer joining a new/demanding startup, on the other hand a foundational project in npm&#39;s ecosystem is being developed in the spare time of a Co-founder &amp; CTO of a ~10B Co - who also creates great demos :)[1] https://github.com/evanw/esbuild[2] https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/graphs/contributors[3] https://github.com/evanw"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Different cultures have different unwritten behaviours on roads.In the mountains of Italy, drivers give a short honk before entering a turn on a serpentine road, which usually can&#39;t be seen around. If there is no responding honk, they will take the full width of the road (making the very tight turn easier and faster). Tourist drivers have to pick up on this :)In much of Europe oncoming cars flash their lights to warn others about dangers and (especially) speed traps or police checks, so they can slow down in time.Here in Lithuania, flashing your warning lights (the four orange ones on the corners of the car) means thanks, for example if you let someone merge from one of the very short onramps. I&#39;ve never seen this in Germany, where onramps are however much longer.And amongst truck drivers it&#39;s pretty wide-spread to blink right to tell a following car you think it&#39;s safe for them to overtake you and blink left when you think it no longer is. At least on long roads where there are no obvious right turns. I flash them a grateful hand sign when passing their mirror."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ok, time to throw in the explanation I grew up with. I always thought it was definitive, but turns out its not. Unfortunately I have already passed on this urban legend :P.On foggy roads in north India, it is difficult to see vehicles on the road. So lights were used to indicate the status of big vehicles like trucks. Two lit bulbs on left and right corners (illuminating Horn Please) meant honk to get a pass. And to indicate you can overtake, the driver could light one bulb in the middle (illuminating a OK) to indicate its ok to take over. Eventually this system was scrapped but the tradition to paint &#34;Horn OK please&#34; remained.(my god the theory is falling apart in my own head as I retell it)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A reminder that pretty much no lorry driver in india knows English. Vehicles here have inane phrases like this and it’s for the most part almost protocol to paint them when you get a vehicle of that class. The guy who paints Lorry backs with the company name probably asks “you want the horn ok please phrase right” and the drivers probably like yeah whatever.Not like the drivers here expect courtesy from anyone around them. If anything they expect (and return in kind) douchebaggery. It’s like playing gta. Of course you expect every passerby to steal your car and you act accordingly.Similarly auto rickshaws all over Tamil Nadu used to ubiquitously have the phrase “the age for a woman to get married is 21”. Similar bullshit reason (though in this case the govt might have mandated it at some point, memory unclear). Thankfully it’s disappeared nowadays."</p>
