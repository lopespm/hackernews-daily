								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi everyone! I&#39;m the lead developer of Zas Editor. I wanted to share some details about the editor you might be interested in.The text-storage data structure, syntax highlighting and search features are written in Rust, and the UI is written in Swift since we wanted to create a native macOS experience. The Swift and Rust code talk to each other using C FFI, and no, that doesn’t take away the safety features of both languages.We’re using the Rope data structure for text representation, and the tree-sitter parser for syntax highlighting and some smart features like file outline, local renaming and symbol search. All other language features are powered by LSP servers (rust-analzyer and gopls).I’d be happy to answer any questions under this comment or anywhere else in this thread."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Zas Editor developer here. I think it’s important to address a problem a few people have mentioned so far: no data is collected other than your Mac’s serial number, which used to be used for finding how many computers a license is used on (we no longer do that)We’re going to add a privacy policy in the website. We haven’t already done that because we didn’t really expect this much attention within hours of releasing. Honestly, we were expecting few downloads and more technical feedback."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wonder if it really still make sense to develop an editor as a commercial product. This is probably a massive effort, and the revenue is maybe not so large.There is IntelliJ and Visual Studio. IntelliJ is successful, yes, but they have a long history, and the editor is really good. Visual Studio is maybe also successful but I&#39;m not sure how profitable it really was or is.But otherwise? Sublime Text and others were maybe successful at some point but not sure how profitable they really were. If you count the amount of development which went into it vs the revenue.For me as a user, I&#39;m extremely hesitant to use any non-open source editor. An editor is a long-term investment. I would not touch this Zas editor unless maybe in 5 to 10 years when it is widely used by many people or when it has become open source but otherwise not. Yes, it looks nice from a first glance but that is by far not enough.My personal only exception is IntelliJ because it is so good. PyCharm specifically, although I have used other IntelliJ products in the past, starting with the original Java editor, 15 years ago or so, which was heavily praised by some friends.But otherwise, I want to be able to extend the editor easily, also its core itself. I want to be able to support it when the original developer stopped working on it. Or port it to other systems the developer does not care about. Or do some changes the developer disagrees with. Etc. I want to be sure that it is in principle possible to run this in the next 10-20 years. Or not only me. The nice thing with open source is that many people think likewise, and then there will also be others doing such effort, like supporting it on recent systems, adding features, fixing bugs, etc. So then it is a community effort."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Context in mind, what jumps out to me is a remarkable compositional competence of the algorithm, even when given extremely vague prompts like &#34;happy sisyphus&#34;. The images match the prompt remarkably well with a few notable exceptions like &#34;cottagecore tech-adjacent young robert moses&#34;, where it seemed to have focused on &#34;cottage&#34; rather heavily, not understanding cottagecore as an aesthetic neologism,  and &#34;power bottom dad is for the people&#34;, which definitely got the &#34;dad&#34; part, but it looks like it still struggled to understand &#34;power bottom&#34; (perhaps the curation of training data may have contributed to this). Even if these were curated specifically to match the prompt, what the algorithm was able to do with profiles is amazing (especially bearing in mind that these profiles are meant to be evocative, intentionally idiosyncratic blendings of extremely complex, contextual terms that were written without visual representation in mind, even if they gesture at specific aesthetics)Side note: what might make artists a bit relieved is the fact that artifacting is still pretty apparent even in the curated examples. Fine details or even whole figures sometime devolve into that scrambled topography familiar to AI art. Even in more compositionally competent artworks, the &#34;brush strokes&#34; frequently have identifiable blurs at the margins. Text also seems to be gibberish even if aesthetically coherent. Even still, these are all such minor issues that additional photoshop would be both easy and readily doable.Overall, this is frankly stunning and I&#39;m really excited to see what others come up with. I feel like it&#39;s language and composition ability definitely did not disappoint the hype of its press release."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This tweet provides important context: https://twitter.com/nickcammarata/status/1512119623315075081...They weren’t just copying/pasting prompts there was human creativity involved as well"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Stunning.My question is whether more compute and more data will be sufficient for the AI to create its own art styles. Everything we see here are iterations on the stylistic inventions of humans. Do we need a new paradigm in AI research before it can make that conceptual leap, or will the current trajectory be able to achieve that?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is kind of OP&#39;s fault, right? I don&#39;t think it was appropriate to initiate a charge back on a payment to affirm since they provided their service to OP, that is they already paid for whatever OP was buying. I have a feeling that timing between OP opening the chargeback and the shipping of the item was actually coincidental.I&#39;d think if you paid affirm and the merchant hadn&#39;t shipped the item, then your recourse would be to go to Affirm, not your credit card you used to pay affirm."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a misconception that when you initiate a chargeback through your credit card, then you&#39;re good, you have your  money and the merchant just has to eat it.But the chargeback doesn&#39;t erase your debt with the merchant, so they are free to collect that debt by other means, including sending it to a debt collector.Adding a third party like Affirm makes this messier - Affirm (presumably) fulfilled their service, they let you finance the debt and they paid the  money to the merchant"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Timeouts for Regexp is quite interesting.  The engineering purity in me saddens at such a thought, but indeed it seems highly practical.The syntax feels a little rough although I have no ideas how to make it better:    Regexp.timeout = 1.0
    ...
    /^a*b?a*$/ =~ &#34;a&#34; * 50000 + &#34;x&#34;

I think I would favor the:    long_time_re = Regexp.new(&#34;^a*b?a*$&#34;, timeout: 1.0)

version instead but I use the `=~` almost entirely, so that would still be a big style change.  Probably end up setting a global timeout per app and then overriding for individual checks as needed?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There are some web apps still in production that I wrote almost a decade ago in Node+Express in the simplest, dumbest style imaginable. The only dependencies are Express and some third-party API connectors. The database is an append-only file of JSON objects separated by newlines. When the app restarts, it reads the file and rebuilds its memory image. All data is in RAM.I figured these toys would be replaced pretty quickly, but turns out they do the job for these small businesses and need very little maintenance. Moving the app to a new server instance is dead simple because there&#39;s basically just the script and the data file to copy over, so you can do OS updates and RAM increases that way. Nobody cares about a few minutes of downtime once a year when that happens.There are good reasons why we have containers and orchestration and stuff, but it&#39;s interesting to see how well this dumb single-process style works for apps that are genuinely simple."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was interviewing for software jobs recently, and while I was studying up on the &#34;system design&#34; portion I kept circling around the same insight that Dan Luu writes about so well here.I would sit down at an interview and try to create these &#34;proper&#34; system designs with boxes and arrows and failovers and caches and well tuned databases. But in the back of my mind I kept thinking, &#34;didn&#39;t Facebook scale to a billion users with PHP, MySQL, and Memcache?&#34;It reminds me of &#34;Command-line Tools can be 235x Faster than your Hadoop Cluster&#34; at https://adamdrake.com/command-line-tools-can-be-235x-faster-... , and the occasional post by https://rachelbythebay.com/w/ where she builds a box that&#39;s just fast and with very basic tooling (and a lot of know-how)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the biggest problem for most developers is not understanding what one computer can actually do and how reliable they are in practice.Additionally, understanding of how tolerant 99% of businesses are to real-world problems that could hypothetically arise can help one not frustrate over insane edge case circumstances. I suspect a non-zero number of us have spent time thinking about how we could provide deterministic guarantees of uptime that even unstoppable cosmic radiation or regional nuclear war couldnt interrupt.I genuinely hope that the recent reliability issues with cloud &amp; SAAS providers has really driven home the point that a little bit of downtime is almost never a fatal issue for a business.&#34;Failover requires manual intervention&#34; is a feature, not a caveat."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Oh RFPs are an everlasting source of fun in B2B.Like, we&#39;ve received the wrong questionaire once. It contained the question what we would do if armed forces intruded into our secured facilities to seize assets. We eventually settled on the answer &#34;Run or hide, while calling the cops&#34;. At that point the customer noticed their error and it was pretty funny.In other areas, the consulting teams and us are developing some degree of a safe word system. Ask us in operations for something the right way and we can give an annoying answer how nothing is possible due to security policies and compliance and further discussion requires meetings with people with long job titles. And suddenly, deal breakers aren&#39;t that important anymore. And sometimes you can even team up with the customers infosec department this way in order to simplify things into a both more secure and easier path.The best way we&#39;ve found around this is to write white papers for commonly asked questions and topics, like storage security. It&#39;s great for our sales guys to be able to answer common questions with a PDF with a bit of glamour, but with enough incomprehensibility density to look important and to get forwarded to infosec / CISOs. Yes I&#39;m a bit jaded about the process."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Back when I had my own HPC company, we often consulted on RFP specs for customers building clusters.  After a while we started building our own clusters.  A well known large/prestigious university on the East Coast US called us to help with the RFP, and bid.  We did.We found out later that they simply wanted help with the RFP.  They never took our bid seriously.  Small company with a great rep, they preferred dealing with the large companies with meh reps.Another one ... a university somewhere here in Michigan, an alma mater of mine in fact, did something akin to this, but used another vendor as its stalking horse.  We constructed our bid aggressively, and submitted.Later that month, while on vacation with the family in Florida, the purchasing agent called me up.  She wanted me to teach the other companies how to do what we did (much higher density, far better performance, etc.)  I asked why.  She said they liked our solution.  They just didn&#39;t want to buy from us.We&#39;d won the RFP.  But lost the business.Of course, we declined teaching our competitors.  They (the university) were unhappy with that, and didn&#39;t understand why we wouldn&#39;t do this for them.I was then, and still am somewhat, blown away by the complete lack of understanding of how businesses actually work, on the part of the RFP folks, the purchasing agents, etc.Another time, I had a university call us up asking for a bid for something.  I asked if they had a preferred vendor (all do).  She said yes, but state law said they need at least 3 bids before they can purchase.  I asked if our bid would be taken seriously.  She said no.Yeah.  I&#39;ve shared some of these anecdotes with others in this industry, and we all nod our heads.  All of us have run into this before.  Some of the stories are far more outrageous than mine.An interesting tangent:  I currently work for a company whose RFP we won ~14 years ago for storage, but was rejected by the person who was my first boss here, as we (the company back then) were too small.  That&#39;s happened multiple times throughout my career.   Even though our solution was demonstrably superior in all technical and financial aspects, we &#34;lost&#34;.Can be disheartening."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some companies even do this for job applications. A manager has a person they want for a role but, because of policy, they must publish it on their employment website, and go through the charade of interviewing candidates, wasting everybody&#39;s time. In the end, their preferred candidate wins."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is pretty fun. Thank you OP!Little off-topic, though, I love how Wordle kinda opened our eyes to the possibility of doing this kind of games in the web instead off a one-off native app. I recently made a word puzzle myself[1] which some of my friends enjoy playing and there&#39;s no way I would go through the soul-crushing cross-platorm native development ordeal for such a niche little app. But it can live in the web! (and pretty much for free thanks to Netlify). I&#39;m now thinking of dusting and old Objective-C game that I wrote 10 years ago and never released, and rewrite it on web.Idk, suddenly I feel excited about the web, again.[1] https://palabrije.com/en (Sorry for the self-promotion)"</p>

Some of them were hair-pulling difficult, too. I never saw a modern rendition of those puzzles, so I thought to create one.Eight Colors is the result. The rules are simply, but puzzles do get challenging after few levels.Hope HN likes it! Happy to hear any feedback!"</p>
