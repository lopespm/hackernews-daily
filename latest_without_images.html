								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a big fan of the idea of independently-run proxy servers.Caddy has a secure forward proxy plugin born out of a research project at Google that does something similar, but works with any clients that let you configure HTTP proxies, and doesn&#39;t terminate TLS: instead it tunnels it over TLS. The proxy server itself can also be probe-resistant, i.e. difficult to detect that a website is acting as a proxy.I&#39;m hoping more people can help test the patch to support Caddy v2: https://github.com/caddyserver/forwardproxy/pull/74(Edit: Disclaimer - Don&#39;t use this in situations where your personal safety or freedom could be at risk... not yet. Not until more people with more experience can vet its implementation for bugs, and a very clear threat profile can drawn up. If you have experience with this, we&#39;d love your help.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hi, from Iran with love!First of all, thank you moxie and signal team for this proxy.Until 2018, many Iranians used telegram but Iran&#39;s regime after Russia blocked this messenger. telegram released mtproxy and this proxy was helpful. Russia lifted the ban on telegram but this app is still blocked on my country. but with VPNs, many iranians still use this app. after 2018, second most popular messaging app in iran was whatsapp, until facebook&#39;s new privacy policy, like all of you, many iranians switch from whatsapp to signal. mullah&#39;s regime removed signal app from the iranian app stores and started blocking all signal traffic in the country, but they don&#39;t block whatsapp. I&#39;m not a paranoid but it is difficult to understand for me why they didn&#39;t block whatsapp after 2018? can they break whatsapp encryption?I have a suggestion for signal team: please put tor in the signal, tor is better than any proxys or vpns."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Pangloss, who was as inquisitive as he was argumentative, asked the old man what the name of the strangled Mufti was. ‘I don’t know,’ answered the worthy man, ‘and I have never known the name of any Mufti, nor of any Vizier. I have no idea what you’re talking about; my general view is that people who meddle with politics usually meet a miserable end, and indeed they deserve to. I never bother with what is going on in Constantinople; I only worry about sending the fruits of the garden which I cultivate off to be sold there.’ Having said these words, he invited the strangers into his house; his two sons and two daughters presented them with several sorts of sherbet, which they had made themselves, with kaimak enriched with the candied-peel of citrons, with oranges, lemons, pine-apples, pistachio-nuts, and Mocha coffee… – after which the two daughters of the honest Muslim perfumed the strangers’ beards. ‘You must have a vast and magnificent estate,’ said Candide to the turk. ‘I have only twenty acres,’ replied the old man; ‘I and my children cultivate them; and our labour preserves us from three great evils: weariness, vice, and want.’ Candide, on his way home, reflected deeply on what the old man had said. ‘This honest Turk,’ he said to Pangloss and Martin, ‘seems to be in a far better place than kings…. I also know,” said Candide, “that we must cultivate our garden.’-- Voltaire, Candide"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love this and I aspire to eventually, if I come out of the grinder with any ambition, drive, or passion left, do something similar.I abhor big corpratism, and love the way software can be independent and disconnected from it, if not usually in practice.I deeply admire Basecamp&#39;s style of &#34;you don&#39;t need VC money, keep it small, keep building something useful that gets you paid.&#34; I want that someday but someday is not this day.I&#39;m not much of an idea guy. I can build stuff. I can get really passionate about how things &#34;should be&#34; and implement process and infrastructure to get there. But whatever &#34;it&#34; is, just hasn&#39;t come to me yet.I long to be an indiehacker but for all the supposedly wrong reasons.I want to putter but don&#39;t know where to get the right seeds to be puttering for."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I quit my job at Google a little over a year ago to work full time on my product. I still don&#39;t make near half the salary, but that connection to my users using a product I built is something that, prior to this last year, I didn&#39;t know I&#39;d be so attached to.Users message me to appreciate some small look &amp; feel improvements, they leave feedback and I fix things for them, I get excited about a new feature and it brings value to their work. I let them vote on the more experimental ideas.I get happily excited for each new subscription, and it all feels earned, a stark contrast to how I felt about my biweekly paychecks at corporate life.The product [0] launched on HN a year ago, and I&#39;ve worked on it almost every day since then, and after having reached some threshold of MRR, I&#39;ve since felt that I can keep working on it forever.Tonight, I&#39;m up late releasing another feature [1]. The motivation to do so feels effortless, as, it&#39;s my garden.[0] https://terrastruct.com[1] Sync diagrams with a github repo, ~hacking the README as a presentation tool (https://github.com/terrastruct-bot/Demo)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is far too low. A fine large enough to destroy the company (as was effectively done to Purdue) would have been the only palatable outcome. And even more importantly, legal repercussions for all their employees who were personally responsible for this.All this settlement achieves is &#39;a cost of doing business&#39;, as they say. It&#39;s not punishment or deterrence. McKinsey and other companies like them will do similar in the future, and simply pay it off, again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know someone who worked for McKinsey for a few years, and some of the projects he described were straight up slimy. The one I recall right now was helping a big payday lender (read: large scale loan shark) figure out how to get their money back from people who were behind on their payments. The problem was that they can only attempt to withdraw so many times from someone&#39;s bank before they&#39;re banned, so the agreed solution was to estimate the best time of the month when the client had received their paycheck, but before they had used it to pay rent and other expenses.This person is no longer working there, and I&#39;m not surprised."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The absolutely most fascinating part of this is learning how McKinsey has long argued that making recommendations that businesses may or may not act on does not create legal liability (until this).I’m trying to see that argument applied in any other instance and it becomes totally ridiculous.“You see, your honor, I merely suggested to my client that he kill his neighbor in order to take his land, I didn’t think he’d actually DO it!”"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Only tangentially related, but are there any projects out there that modify CD or DVD readers to make it possible to read the raw (analog) pits and lands from the disc? When I was rescuing the last batch of burned CDs from my teen years a few years ago I unsurprisingly had some with lots of read errors. Googling around only lead me to forum threads where people recommended certain drives that would be very good at error recovery, but I thought it might be even better if you could get the raw stream from the disc and then do all the EFM reversal etc in software with more advanced analysis, brute forcing etc. But nothing of this kind seemed to exist."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I hope no one is saying Privacy Sandbox is worse than third party cookies, or is trusting this article to form an opinion about it. Web advertising was a $319 billion dollar industry in 2019. Does anyone wonder who may be lobbying their government to scrutinize Google and offer themselves for interviews for articles like this? Does anyone think the result of beating up Project Sandbox will be more radical privacy protection?No, I don&#39;t think this article has anything really to do with a better privacy outcome and everything to do with watering down Google&#39;s stance to something more status quo for the advertising industry.There are no actual critiques of Privacy Sandbox&#39;s APIs here. There&#39;s no mention of what critics stand to lose if Privacy Sandbox becomes the standard. There&#39;s merely hand wringing of &#34;but do you trust Google?&#34; Everyone who&#39;s made themselves available for quoting in this article is a web advertising professional, including the ones who come off as not[1][2]. None of them care about you.[1] James Rosewell is cited as director of &#34;Marketers for an Open Web.&#34; He&#39;s also the CEO of a company that specializes in device detection. His LinkedIn headline reads &#34;THE  Fastest and Most Accurate  Device Detection = more  profitable websites&#34;[2] Alan Chapell is sarcastic about Google attempting to do this openly through the w3c. He&#39;s cited as running a privacy law firm. Their web site says they represent tech companies navigating privacy issues. They aren&#39;t actual privacy advocates. https://chapellassociates.com/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google&#39;s way of leveraging their browser dominance to use 3rd party cookies as a way to gain competitive advantage:Step 1: Implement a whole new browser functionality where Google alone can track people.Step 2: Eliminate 3rd party cookies so Google&#39;s competitors have to create increasingly unethical and invasive fingerprinting techniques to remain competitive.Step 3: Increase advertising rates since they are the only company able to effectively target adverts on the web. (Profit)Did I miss anything?Google in their enthusiasm to prevent Microsoft from dominating the web has become worse than Microsoft was in its heyday."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So if I understand this correctly, then killing off 3rd party cookies is anti-competitive, leaving them in is anti-privacy, and putting out a privacy-enhancing alternative is also anti-competitive.  Is there anything that can be done that would satisfy all regulations?Also, this reminds me of a story I heard years ago, that a California oil change location needed to store oil above ground due to EPA regulations, but needed it stored underground to satisfy the fire department regulations.  So they were constantly getting fined from one or the other, and had to just include those fines as a cost of doing business."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is seriously cool. I feel slightly validated that I&#39;ve also been wrapping these by hand, since it&#39;s kind of quirky to try and auto-generate these while keeping the same usability and such as their original incarnations.For those interested in a Rust variant, I&#39;ve been hacking on one for awhile: https://github.com/ryanmcgrath/cacaoI wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s yet ready for production use, but so far it&#39;s working pretty well for me. Been dogfooding it by building an app I&#39;ve wanted for a bit - a proper magic-wormhole macOS app.One of the things I&#39;ve really wanted to keep to is the delegate pattern, since I think it actually works really well for Rust&#39;s model. A fun example I finished yesterday is ListView cell reuse:https://twitter.com/ryanmcgrath/status/1357097991081844737/p...Ultimately I view this as one of the last pieces needed for a cross-platform Rust UI framework to actually work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a little sad that after 50 years since Microsoft and Apple were started, there still is no easy way to write a natively looking cross-platform GUI app, even with a language like Golang.Recently I looked at couple of options of writing some Golang to make a simple GUI app that would look natively on Windows/MacOS (text area, several checkboxes/buttons), and there&#39;s no much there to be honest."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t see an @autoreleasepool anywhere in the source, which I believe means calling some AppKit APIs from Go-managed threads will silently leak memory (due to memory allocated internally by the APIs that will never get released).In my own projects, I had to wrap calls from foreign threads into AppKit APIs with an @autoreleasepool {} block or my app would leak memory.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is such a cool passion project, thanks for sharing your collection with us. Will bookmark this one for sure.It&#39;s great to see remnants of the demoscene pop up like this from time to time. I&#39;m sure there are many of us relative old-timers here that got their first taste of graphics programming thanks to those demoscene BBS tuts from back in the day (Denthor of Asphyxia anyone?).Just the other day I was reminiscing with a fellow programmer on freenode about mode13th shenanigans and the all-nighters that ensued.This HN post put a smile on my face. Cheers from South Africa!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Cool that people still keep such stuff!
I was part of the demoscene way back in the late 80s-early 90s, and I just clicked randomly on some of these fonts and one of them looked familiar. However I couldn’t tell if it was one that my friend (in our demo group that I’ve long since lost touch with) had made or if I saw it in someone else’s demo... this was not a time where we concerned ourselves with archiving our work for future generations to watch. And it would be impossible to find out since my parents kept asking me whether or not to keep my old Amiga that was sitting unused for years ... and I ignored their questions and eventually they threw it away... I’m just glad Bitcoin hadn’t been invented yet — haha."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"No one is talking about the very big risk associated with this, that mental health professionals can commit you against your will with no trial, which is an erosion of civil liberties (incarceration without trial). Having known several friends who got committed and held against their will in psych wards when there was no good reason to, because their insurance was good, this is an issue.Notice they don&#39;t give any stats about outcomes, but the primary cited issue is &#34;mental health&#34; which is very vague and a subjective assessment.We should not create an extra judicial system that has no checks and balances. Otherwise we will head towards medical authoritarianism which could easily be abused by those in power (psychiatrists and others) for their own personal gain.See https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/rosalindadams/intake for an example of what I mean."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We&#39;ve had a program like this in Eugene Oregon for 30 Years. It&#39;s the model a lot of other programs follow.https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/this-town-of-170000-replac...They handle most non-violent 911 calls which cops would end up handling. Things like people walking into a business naked or sleeping in the doorway of a business, these guys get called. It&#39;s a big percentage of 911 calls in any city where you have homeless people.Usually they can help people out, but if people do get violent or belligerent, they call for police backup. That&#39;s pretty rare.Overdoses, sick homeless people, people shouting random shit at people in front of businesses, pretty much anything non violent, these guys talk them down give them a little help, drive them to a clinic, or whatever they need. It&#39;s a lot cheaper and more humane than arresting them."</p>
