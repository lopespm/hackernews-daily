								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hm - I can&#39;t see how this is functionally significantly different than EasyMotion[1] or Sneak[2]. Not a knock on it - just curious if I&#39;m missing something.My problem with these types of plugins is that, although it&#39;s a bit more annoying to type out a few more characters, with my vanilla Vim workflow I can pre-compute the motions in my head - I can figure out I need to type d7l or whatever way before I get to the point in my editing where I need to, and as I&#39;m typing it out I&#39;m already thinking about what I want to do next. With sneak, easymotion, or leap, it looks like I can&#39;t actually figure out what keys I need to press to get to where I want until I&#39;ve already started the motion. That means I need to take some time to read the label, etc. So maybe I&#39;ve saved a few milliseconds of not having to type one or two more keys, but I lose that and more by having to parse what to do.Curious about other experiences and if I&#39;m off base though.[1]: https://github.com/easymotion/vim-easymotion

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I didn&#39;t expect to learn much from this article - but it actually really resonated with me. I often am responsible for purchasing decisions and found much of the advice to sales reps really insightful.(1) The number one thing that bothers me is when I reach out to a company to explore their product and I get scheduled with a BDR who&#39;s sole job is to &#34;qualify&#34; me as a lead. I know BDRs are in a tough spot - but if you have someone reaching out and interested in your product, take advantage of that and get them straight to the person who can demo and answer questions. I&#39;m shocked at how many companies make me want to prove myself as a customer before spending time on demoing.(2) Ask before recording meetings, and if someone doesn&#39;t want to be recorded make sure you actually have the ability to turn that recording off. I&#39;ve been on calls where the person who set up the Zoom/Gong wasn&#39;t on the call, and so no one had the ability to stop recording.(3) The details of what is shared on calls is often completely lost. Every time a new person gets on the call, they ask the exact same questions that have already been answered. Make the customer feel as though you&#39;re interested in their business, have discussed their pain points, and have a plan ready to help them.(4) Discounting discussions are always a pain. It&#39;s a game that no one likes to play.(5) Offer to send some swag to the implementing team at your customer - not just your champion. It&#39;s a nice gesture and goes a surprisingly long way towards building positive sentiment."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just thought the call out for &#34;Protected Health Information&#34; was weird, and it&#39;s wrong. If you&#39;re just having small talk with someone on a zoom call and you say &#34;Yeah, that last COVID booster really wiped me out, I was in bed for 2 days&#34;, that doesn&#39;t mean the call contains &#34;PHI&#34;.First of all, you shared it. The whole reason for protecting PHI in the first place is limiting what others can do with your information, not what you can do with it. And if you share it willingly, and not for medical purposes, it doesn&#39;t mean that the person you shared it with suddenly has a higher burden of security/privacy with that info.Just calling this out because so often see people that fundamentally misunderstand what &#34;PHI&#34; means in a legal sense, and specifically what the HIPAA regulations require."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who was accidentially thrust into an IT role and had to do some purchasing... I absolutely hated sales cales and B2B selling. The simple act of buying a server means finding an &#34;authorized reseller&#34;, going through some sales calls, proving that you are a worthy customer, then they want to know all about your other setup to make sure it is &#34;supported&#34; (which turns out to have no consequence whatsoever). The quoted price is completely different from what is listed, and there are arbitrary surcharges. Isn&#39;t there an easier way? Yes, but the pointy haired boss decided we have to go the proper route. Funnily the reseller had a very trustworthy name like &#34;usedserverdiscount24.de&#34; or something.The worst one was when I was trying to get some antivirus licenses. We were willing to spend a lot on Sophos, because it had good reviews, we were happy with the trial, and so on. But the reseller tried to upsell us, insisted we buy matching firewalls, and so on. So in the end we stuck with Windows Defender (we got a bunch of licenses for Advanced Threat Protection from MS for free)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Fwiw I had something akin to the overview effect when I attended a full solar eclipse. I thought I was prepared. I had read up on what to expect because I wanted to make the most of the experience for the kids. I wanted to make sure we observed the &#34;shadow bands&#34; (snake like shadows traversing across single colored surfaces that aren&#39;t always visible).Everything did proceed as I expected (including the shadow bands), but when the eclipse was full, the earth went quiet. All the animals stopped and wondered (including the younger children who were boisterously playing seconds before the full effect).As I stared up into the heavens, I had this deeply profound realization that our planet is traveling through space like all the other planets. The observation and experience of an eclipse made the abstract concept of space a reality and brought it closer to me in a way that just thinking (a lot) about space has never done."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; It was among the strongest feelings of grief I have ever encountered. The contrast between the vicious coldness of space and the warm nurturing of Earth below filled me with overwhelming sadness. Every day, we are confronted with the knowledge of further destruction of Earth at our hands: the extinction of animal species, of flora and fauna . . . things that took five billion years to evolve, and suddenly we will never see them again because of the interference of mankind. It filled me with dread. My trip to space was supposed to be a celebration; instead, it felt like a funeral.Very well written. Conveys his feelings quite well I find."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unfortunately sending every millionaire into space for them to realize this is an hostile environment is taking us closer to earth destruction. Sorry to be sour about this, but people could just teach themself astronomy and realize there is no place out there to welcome us when the earth will be on the verge to become unlivable. Even assuming a colony of a dozen women/men is ever established on the moon or Mars, they will die in a matter or months or years once the tether to earth is broken.Reading this guy paid millions of $ to realize these basic facts fills me with overwhelming sadness too. Can his experience be of value for us? Given that he could have discovered what he just experienced by reading good books, I think this n+1 experience has zero value. Send human beings in space to perform scientific experiments. Period."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"While I agree this is a problem - one which I have been the victim of as well - Amazon accepts the return with no questions and/or charges. This, of course, is not a great consolidation, especially for a novice who doesn&#39;t understand or encounters it too late. But I strongly disagree with &#34;Amazon runs little to no risk selling the fraudulent products, but still makes money off of them.&#34; In the next paragraph the author outlines how they&#39;ve lost trust in Amazon and will not be buying electronics. Erosion of trust is absolutely a massive risk, and one that eBay is also arguably pretty publicly recovering from. I suspect Amazon would prefer not to have fake drives and the costs associated with returns and erosion of trust for the infinitesimal rounding error that makes up the extra revenue they get from fake $20 thumb drives.
I&#39;m far from an Amazon fanboy, but I think the problem is more complex than Amazon turning a blind eye because they&#39;re making $10k extra profit a year from phony thumb drives. As an outsider, it seems like a difficult tradeoff of not creating incredible hurdles to list products, versus counterfeits getting through.In my case, the phony thumb drive I bought was delisted before I got home from the walk to the mailbox, literally."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think there&#39;s one thing that should be clarified from the article. &#34;Sponsored&#34; does not mean that the product is &#34;sponsored by Amazon&#34; as italicized in the article. It means the seller paid money to be at the top of the search query.Perhaps it is a healthy dose of old aged jadedness, but I have a habit of trying to avoid Sponsored items."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have refused to give Amazon any business of my own for several years because their directly-operated logistics business is morally disgusting to me. Realistically they run many businesses, that’s one of them. Their retail business is little more than branding. Their real business is private infrastructure.The retail business overall is a scam. Example: I’ve been trying to find a comforter for a while, and I haven’t been happy with some of the options I found because a lot of other ecommerce sites have not great search experiences. I thought, well I can search Amazon for my preferences and buy it elsewhere. Nope, not even a single filter I applied was true for any search results I looked at. Amazon didn’t even try to serve me cotton comforters, much less any other refinements they offered.They’re in the business of selling business. Whether that’s their logistics connecting suppliers and shipping with sales, or it’s their tech services connecting startups with time shares on a server.I wouldn’t buy a USB drive or a blanket from IBM either. It’s the same thing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There is so much more to our report than what was focused on in the WSJ article. The full report will be shared shortly…"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; “Outside his online play, Hans is the fastest rising top player in Classical [over-the-board] chess in modern history,” the report says, while comparing his progress to the game’s brightest rising stars. “Looking purely at rating, Hans should be classified as a member of this group of top young players. While we don’t doubt that Hans is a talented player, we note that his results are statistically extraordinary.”I basically made the argument that, in any sport, when a player does statistically much, much better than their previous performance would predict, that in and of itself should be considered evidence of cheating - perhaps not conclusive evidence, but definitely evidence warranting further investigation: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32990022&gt; All this talk of &#34;Carlsen accused him of cheating with no evidence&#34; reminds me of the blowback against some athletes in the 70s and 80s who accused rivals of taking PEDs &#34;with no evidence&#34;.&gt; Sometimes the evidence of someone doing monstrously better than can be expected by their history is sufficient IMO. I mean, look at this article about swimmer Shirley Babashoff [1], dubbed &#34;Surly Shirley&#34; at the time by the media, for suggesting the East German women were on PEDs in the 70s. Nowadays we look back on those images of the East German women, looking more manly than any dude I&#39;ve ever seen, and wonder how we considered with a straight face that they weren&#39;t on a boatload of drugs. Similarly, it completely baffles me how any sane person can think that Flo Jo wasn&#39;t on PEDs in the runup to the 1988 Olympics - her 100m dash record still stands today.&gt; I&#39;m not saying Carlsen went about it in the right way, because now Niemann is basically in an indefensible position, but I&#39;m also not willing to quickly dismiss it because Carlsen has &#34;no evidence&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The fact that an athlete in a competitive sport was allowed to partake in an event even after admitting to cheating not only once, but twice, is outrageous in itself."</p>

					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33043945">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The attention economy corrupts everything it touches: not just science, but journalism, politics, and even childhood.Being famous used to be rather difficult. Of course there were exceptions (writing To Kill a Mockingbird, being the guy who dove into the river to save a drowning child, for example), but for the most part, you were going to live your life known only to the few hundred or thousand people you met personally.Even though you could pick up a phone and dial anyone in the world who owned a phone, you wouldn&#39;t, and if you did, they&#39;d hang up on you. Now you can force your idiotic, or great ideas onto the screens of millions of people you&#39;ll never meet.Is that a good or a bad thing? It&#39;s certainly bad in some ways, and this is one of them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Having spent over 10 years in a university and been a professor, the problem isn’t attention seeking behavior but a lack of accountability.  For example, you can literally make up any data you want in a grant proposal and so long as it sounds right no one can or will double check it. The foundation of academia is rotting, but maybe it’s always been like this"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What most people fail to realize is that fundamentally, most principle investigators, the people who actually run the research world, are primarily fundraisers. Their day-to-day job is a mix of grant and proposal writing, relationship building/organizational meetings, and checking in on their postdocs, candidates, and lab techs.Your main goal, as a PI, is to keep your lab running, and thus research flowing, by any means possible. For some PIs, this means milking every drop of available talent and time out of your doctoral candidates, and is the most common cause of the horror stories you hear about people leaving academia. On the other end of the extreme, they can embed themselves so deeply in fundraising with private or public capital that their lab staff don&#39;t see them for more than 15-30 minutes a week, because they are essentially living their lives hopping from sales meeting to sales meeting.This wouldn&#39;t be a problem if the job of the PI was explicitly meant to be that of a salesman, but the actual role of a PI is to define the research being done. They draft the hypotheses, the expected impact, etc, because that is their intended role, but in reality these will always be constructed in a way that makes it easier for the PI to solicit funding.It&#39;s impossible for the attention economy to not play into the research funding loop then, because every set of eyeballs is another potential revenue source for future research, or a tool to justify growing the footprint of your lab. I wouldn&#39;t go so far as to call the superstructure corrupting of science though, not in those words. I&#39;d say it forces science to be mission focused, where the mission is a subtle negotiation between the people funding the research and the people performing it, and often times the person with the capital lands much closer to their ideal."</p>
