								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love Fabien Sanglard&#39;s work. I&#39;ve read through his books on Doom and Wolfenstein and never would&#39;ve imagined he&#39;d start looking at sprites for Street Fighter II.This is really great stuff and I think important as &#34;developer archaeology&#34;. The 80s and 90s don&#39;t seem that long ago (to those of us who were around), but it&#39;s easy to forget people back then didn&#39;t have the sophisticated tools we have today. That said, people did have tools, so it&#39;s awesome to be able to get a glimpse into the workflow of folks back then."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I absolutely love learning about the clever tricks and their long-tail effects that came out of dealing with incredibly resource constrained computing environments and/or where some quirk of hardware ended up inspiring a lot of fabulous creative misuse.This is a fantastic article!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember another article where the main developer set aside a big chunk of memory right when they started coding. When they had issues fitting everything in memory shortly before the deadline, he deleted this chunk and had no issue to deliver the project.I think this is something we should do more today. Defining a memory budget, and staying inside."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The key to this solution isn’t really the .txt file or the formatting.It’s the ritual. Any productivity system can be made to work once it becomes a habit and therefore your default action.I think .txt files or Org mode are attractive to devs because they feel like something we’d be doing anyway during our day. the same system will work with a paper journal or even a fresh piece of paper every morning if, and only if, it can be integrated into your natural daily workflow as an automatic habit. I personally found that paper is better for me because I get to it before unlocking my computer and being confronted with work and communications and notifications that compete with it. However, I have a lot of peers who couldn’t hang on to a paper journal or TODO list during the day if they tried, so digital formats win.The real key is to make it a habit and learn to stick with it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve always kept a text file or spreadsheet of things to do, priorities, etc... My biggest problem isn&#39;t keeping a list and getting organized, it&#39;s remembering to look at my list. I tend to space out for days working on a problem and forget to look at my list.I&#39;ve experienced a big productivity boost by using the desktop background of my 43&#34; monitor as a whiteboard (blackboard actually). I have an jpg the size of my monitor that I jot things down on as text on the image. I can store meaningful small images the trigger my memory to do something. I&#39;ve become so used to visually thinking about what I&#39;m doing that I switched my text file todo list to markdown so I could store images in it.It&#39;s surprisingly quick to keep my large jpg open in paint and jot or paste things to it and then reset it as the desktop background. I learned later this is called a &#34;vision board&#34;Still, I&#39;m so bad at spacing out that I need more than looking at my vision board monitor all day, so I use the Windows system scheduler to bring up a daily, weekly and monthly html file that reminds me to do things."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used a plain text file for about 5-6 years before finding org-mode in 2009.  Of course, I technically still use a plain text file since that&#39;s what Org uses, just with some extra features that make organizing things specific to productivity easier.That said, I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d exclusively use a plain text file or even Org if I had to break my day down into as low as 15 minute chunks like this guy.  I find the text-based approach to work best for longer-term planning/strategizing and just keeping yourself from forgetting stuff over the course of days.  It also works better if you&#39;re already on your computer and using your text editor all day and/or SSH-ing into a box with the file.  If I need to remember to make it to 4 meetings today at very specific times, something that pushes notifications and upcoming meeting warnings might accommodate that better.I&#39;ve had meeting-heavy jobs, and split off the meeting management into Outlook (or similar) with good results.  Useful info that flows out of meetings can still go into your notes to be organized later though.  Then I make my GTD list &#34;task-centric&#34;, meaning that it focuses on getting discrete activities started and completed, with less focus on times/dates.  That requires some level of freedom to manage your own time though, so it&#39;s not for everyone."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I guess taking some risks as I am not really authorized to use social media, but at AWS there is a sauron like focus on not letting internal engineers view customer data.  On my service we don&#39;t even have tools to do it and the security controls are very tight and getting tighter all the time.  It&#39;s a big fucking deal, if not the biggest fucking deal, besides KTLO.Posting to get ahead of some of the comment here on security posture."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Such concerns specifically led to my decision of only uploading sensitive data to S3 with client side encryption. Since the aws cli tool only supports server side encryption with keys stored on amazon servers (where the non-default managed keys cost like 1 USD per month), I decided to simply symmetrically encrypt the backup of my syncthing data volume with AES256 using gnupg and only then pushing it to the S3 bucket."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Okay, opinions up front: I don&#39;t think this is worthy of &#34;declaring a security incident. Having some experience working behind the scenes, just because this policy was changes this way doesn&#39;t mean &#34;All AWS Support personnel had unrequited access to your S3 objects.&#34; To me, this reads as Twitter inflammatory nonsense. Here&#39;s why:* KMS Encrypted objects would not be accessible because the support personnel would need permission policies that grant `kms:decrypot` permissions to encrypted objects. The only way this could wind up happening is if you are granting the AWS Support principal access in the KMS Key Policy.* Objects with a default-deny bucket policy could not have been circumvented with the support team&#39;s escalated privilege. So if you have a policy that looks something like this, that data was not exposed:{  &#34;Action&#34;: &#34;Deny&#34;,

  &#34;NotPrincipal&#34;: [...]

}* Internal Checks. AWS has a lot of protections and checks in place to prevent their support personnel from accessing metadata about S3 objects. They don&#39;t have tools to fetch the actual objects unless your really high up the food-chain. Think like, people with a legal or security related reason to need to review data.Nevertheless, I&#39;ll share some nuggets of wisdom I&#39;ve accrued over the years, in a hopes to save y&#39;all some time:If you have an NDA with AWS, I&#39;d recommend reaching out to your TAM and asking them about what the potential exposure was; and make sure to ask about the internal access control mechanisms.But everyone who&#39;s concerned and DIDN&#39;T set up data access logging already: 1) Consider turning that on to trace potential disclosures in the future. 2) Open up a case with Premium Support under the CloudTrail, state that you have a security incident and you need to retrieve data events for the time of 2021-12-23 to 2021-12-22. If granted to you, save that sucker in S3 and query it for requests coming from `support.amazonaws.com` in Athena.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s interesting to see how they introduce a new binary format in their catalogue. I was expected to find a domain specific language to define the grammar of binary bitstreams, maybe as a context free grammar. Instead, they built a nice library of routines that helps them design custom parsers by hand for each new format."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Relatedly, check out GNU Poke: http://www.jemarch.net/poke"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’d like to see support for FIT files as they are emitted by Garmin fitness devices. It’s a clever binary format that in-stream defines the format of records which then contain the actual measurements which may be scaled for more compact representation. These multiple layers make the format not obvious to parse but the tool supports already an impressive list of formats that probably use similar techniques."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For five years, I ran a network of Twitter accounts promoting local tech events. They were (uncreatively) called the &#34;Tech Events Network&#34; and included ATXTechEvents, DENTechEvents, NYC_TechEvents, and 50+ others that would broadcast local meetups, even supporting basically unknown tech communities like Albuquerque with ABQTechEvents. All received massive traffic, engagement (RTs &amp; likes specifically), and became an active megaphone for their respective communities.. gaining almost 300k followers.More importantly, the meetups and events they tweeted saw attendance rise and more people know about them in general. It was great for everyone and I had hundreds of thank you tweets, emails, and DMs.But Twitter&#39;s repeated, bizarre, and unexplained API limitations hobbled the system more times than I can count. They&#39;d suddenly suspend one for &#34;API abuse&#34;, I&#39;d get it manually reviewed and they&#39;d release it.. only to have 10 suspended the next day. I even started asking followers to tag @TwitterSupport on our behalf and zero progress.After dozens of suspensions, I finally shut it all down. I haven&#39;t come up with a theory beyond Twitter hates tech communities but that feels off.."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For the last 6 years Dorsey was CEO, with final say on all corporate priorities. He could have undone this &#34;worst thing&#34; from an earlier time when he &#34;wasn&#39;t running the company&#34; in fairly short order. He didn&#39;t.Did he only come to the realization it was the &#34;worst thing&#34; after leaving the positono where he could&#39;ve fixed it?Dorsey&#39;s passing the buck here, both ways: blaming his predecessor for the error, then saddling his successor with the undone hairball task of fixing it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A couple of months ago some colleagues and I submitted a very basic request practically begging Twitter for access to users’ follower/following graph on the new API. The use case was super-simple and obvious (allow people to import their followers into a new app) and didn’t involve any sort of data mining or spam or anything.It took days? weeks? to get a generic rejection message from a “no reply” email address. Meanwhile — much irony — A16Z can help apps like Clubhouse get super-access since they were also a huge investor in Twitter.All of this pro- and anti-web3 stuff is a sign that all of these inter-connected webs of egos in our industry are jostling for power in an ecosystem that doesn’t need them very much. Meanwhile, there are lots of people in other verticals who completely missed the boat on the web investment play who are beginning to realize this is their opportunity to jump in and scale their capital alongside the people on the ground. A major investor / operator shakeup is about to take place."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wall St. does not care, so these companies can not care. Apple just gave BOE 20% of their OLED business to diversify away from Sanding and LG:Note that BOE is being propped up by the CCP to the tune of $100M a year in losses over the past decade as economic warfare against SK.Manufacturing is where today’s wars are being fought because these people know it gives them the power over those that would complain otherwise.I wouldn’t be surprised if Intel’s supply chain now has components that couldn’t be built without a lot of delays if the CCP snapped their fingers (since they have also funded the conglomeration of specialty materials companies: these new companies are cheap when all you have to do is devalue your currency (is. steal a few dollars from all your citizens)).Hopefully these conflicts stay entirely in the economic and manufacturing realm, because real war is hell."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Fun fact about SpeedCrunch history, the software descends from an off-hand blog post by Roberto Alsina, a KDE developer, complaining about KCalc usability [1]. Back then developers were often just unthinkingly cloning &#39;skeuomorphic&#39; interfaces like Apple used back then, designing user interfaces that resembled physical objects instead of taking advantage of the opportunities afforded by computers.His blog post elicited several rapid responses from developers taking his PyQt-based mockup and turning it into a &#39;real&#39; application ([2], [3]). One of those was Ariya Hidayat&#39;s &#34;SpeedCrunch&#34;, which has been actively maintained up to the present day. I can&#39;t find Ariya&#39;s original 2004 announcement, I think the original link was http://ariya.pandu.org/blog/archives/2004/10/calculator-feve... but that&#39;s dead now.But it&#39;s really neat to see how this all started from a day or two of hacking on a solution to a simple problem.[1] https://ralsina.me/stories/33.html

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29660177">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Have to say as a football fan, it&#39;s a scandal that they&#39;re running the world cup in Qatar. A winter world cup pushes the schedules way off what&#39;s normal and traditional. That is of course not the only concern, there&#39;s also stories about dozens of people dying building these stadiums in the desert heat.There&#39;s also a heck of a lot of stories about how Qatar was able to get the world cup in the first place. It seems that FIFA isn&#39;t exactly free of corruption, which is a shame because they&#39;re supposed to be in charge of the world&#39;s favourite sport. Of course there&#39;s no accountability in any way, who even knows who their national FA rep is? I guess that&#39;s one of the perks of running a sport with that much history, people will still feel compelled to watch.One thing that&#39;s positive is that ordinary people are not ignorant about this situation. You&#39;ll find in every FB post about this there&#39;s a load of voices expressing what I&#39;ve just expressed. So whatever the Qataris think they&#39;re buying with this massive outlay, they&#39;re not getting it.On the sporting side it appears they&#39;re making a decent effort of building a home grown team that isn&#39;t going to totally embarrass them, which is quite the challenge."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The tendency by FIFA and especially UEFA to prioritize money for its partners and for its officials above principles and sport has turned me away from organized football. I find it repugnant that when BBC and The Guardian (among others) reported back in 2013 on Qatar’s labor conditions in sweltering heat, the deaths, and what is essentially slavery to build stadiums, it was met by the football community and larger news media with a resounding thud. It wasn’t until the last few years that footballers who had nothing to lose started to speak their minds. It’s honestly disgusting to me to the point where I don’t know when I’ll ever want to watch the World Cup or Champion’s League again.I used to get excited by these events because the sport still seemed to be prioritized and people got genuinely excited by seeing talent rise to the level. I came of age hearing just how good Messi would become after his early appearance for Argentina in 2006 I think. His rise has witnessed the transition to players representing teams and entire brands. It hardly feels like sport but lifestyle, prestige, and entertainment, something Qatar is desperately trying to purchase as their oil money starts to dry up.https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-europe-24394971Maybe there was earlier reporting on this but this was the best I could do on my phone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;In August, Amnesty released a report that documented that at least 15 000 migrant workers had died since Qatar was awarded the World Cup hosting rights in 2010.&#34;If these figures are true, then no matter how &#39;successful&#39; the World Cup 2022 turns out, it will always be tainted by these shameful figures."</p>
