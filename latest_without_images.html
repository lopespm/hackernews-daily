								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This are beautiful.I had a go at doing roughly the same thing a couple of years ago [0]. It was mostly straightforward, but the part I really struggled with were rendering the sea. The encoding of OSM coastline is quite quirky [1]. When the edge of the rendering intersects with the coastline it&#39;s very tricky to compute which side of a coastline is sea and which is land. As an example - how would you render this [2]?I wasn&#39;t sure how I could solve this, so I wrote up a more abstract formulation of the problem here [3], and asked for help. I think the proposed solution make sense, but I think I would have to implement it by rendering individual pixels and wouldn&#39;t be able to lean on a higher level graphics library.I&#39;m looking forward to seeing how the author solved this problem.[0] https://twitter.com/willsewell_/status/1172523752699113473[1] https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:natural%3Dcoastline#...[2] https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=15/22.0330/88.8819[3] https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/1104642/im-s..."</p>

Each day the balloon is expanded and it is only after a while you realise how far away from the surface point you are on, all the other surface points have reached.   I mean i toyed with python and maps back in the day, and my intuition for how good looking you could make one of these is completely off.This stuff is amazing.I think I want there to be a professional software &#34;continuing-education&#34; [#] service.  A course I do each 6 months that just gets me to run something for an hour (from astronomy to 3d-printing).I know i could do it myself but the 10 -20 hours spent on each install wasted though bad configs seems something I would happily pay to avoid.[#] Not a &#34;re-education&#34; camp.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a huge fan of Readability Mode and use it often.  It&#39;s proof that Web design isn&#39;t the solution, Web design is the problem.For those who are using e-ink devices, or even just standard tablets, EInkBro is another immensely useful tool.  Yes, it&#39;s a standalone browser, not a mode on Firefox, Safari, Vivalti, etc.https://github.com/plateaukao/browser(Available through Google Play, F-Droid and other sources.  Android-only, sorry iOS fans.)What it offers over standard browsers is that it&#39;s optimised for e-ink displays.  That is, it favours pagination over scrolling, runs to full-screen, can easily adjust font size up or down (no more itsy-bitsy-teen-weenie-yellow-polka-dot HN fonts), bold text, and has its own reader mode as well.Even on a standard tablet, some of these features are a huge step above and beyond the mainstream browsers.The feature-set is limited, some of the UI is a bit rough, and a few things are just plain broken (if you need to edit entries in the JS or Cookie enabled/disabled sites ... you have to delete all data and start over again).That said, my usage is evolving from sending individual pages to EInkBrow when I want to do long-form reading, to using it at least part-time as a primary browser.  (Mozilla Fennec Fox is my first choice, still.)  The browser is stable and very much usable despite this.  The developer is responsive to requests and bug reports.What&#39;s most refreshing is that the design principle is readability of Web content, as determined by the user, and not by the page author or publisher."</p>

They sound okay on windows and I haven&#39;t figured out how to get them to sound good on linux. On windows the voices sound good, but I Wish I could get it to go a little faster. The voices don&#39;t sound human so it takes some getting used to.On linux the voices just sound more harsh. To the point I don&#39;t want to use it. If anyone knows a switch to flip or how to install additional voices to make them sound better, that would be great."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a powerful piece that resonates with my own experience. I went through a period of severe burnout that took me a couple years to recover from. One of my later insights was that burnout doesn&#39;t merely entail working too much (although that&#39;s certainly part of it); burnout often involves pouring too much of your heart and soul into something that does not love you back. I describe burnout now as a kind of &#34;unrequited love.&#34;So many of us go above and beyond for our companies/projects/teams/whatever. The author here describes overcommitting at work. We might have the best of intentions, but at some point, we don&#39;t see the returns we yearned for and start to question what all this self-sacrificial giving is for.  That is when burnout really sets in. I&#39;ve had friends burn out while working for hostile or indifferent managers, startups that are trending the wrong direction, companies that engage in illegal or unethical behavior, etc.A second insight was that burnout can play a positive role in our lives. It&#39;s like a circuit breaker that trips to protect us from a damaging situation. When we feel burnout coming on, it&#39;s a warning to pay attention to an important misalignment in our lives."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This person understands what actual burnout is. You get really seriously fried, like &#39;can&#39;t function in any sense&#39; fried. The references to &#39;you have to decide what we&#39;ll watch on netflix because I literally cannot choose a thing&#39; rang very true to me.I generally needed more than a couple months but less than a year, and the removal of whatever it was that I&#39;d burnt myself to a crisp trying to control. Over my lifetime that&#39;s been everything from overcoming homelessness, starting a business, transitioning the business to Patreon, trying to have a relationship: it&#39;s been a lifelong process of learning that I can&#39;t have things (even very desirable things) just by pushing harder to earn them. Quite often I just have to give up and not have the thing.The more I learn that, the less I&#39;m riding the edge of burnout.:)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For me, I&#39;ve started feeling like I&#39;m close to burnout. But quitting doesn&#39;t really seem like a helpful option.Could I actually take months off recovering? No. I&#39;d have to immediately start leetcoding and remembering what all those trees are for so that I could become employed again later on. And risk having to take a job that pays way less than before.Which brings me to my main point: I don&#39;t see an option where the work ever actually truly ends. There&#39;s always more. Always things I need to be doing. And until I have enough to retire, I have to keep grinding.Vacation doesn&#39;t help. It just puts me farther behind."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My biggest shock was how much &#34;PR&#34; was generated on Reddit, and how many sexworkers really do use the platform.I knew it was a thing, I knew of the memes, but to see both sides in arms over a company vs branding, creating their own website and content - and vanity domain as well.People really do just want a one click solution for creating adult content, and consuming adult content.And the memes, I think they&#39;re pretty toxic, 4chan, incel, reddit, twitter memes -  I never knew there was that much angst."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; He said BNY Mellon “flagged and rejected” every wire transfer linked to the firm, while Britain’s Metro Bank in 2019 closed OnlyFans’ corporate account with short noticeSo it wasn’t just the credit card merchants but wire transfers and corporate bank accounts. So stupid… at least CC merchants can blame chargebacks or something.I guess it’d help if laws were clarified, in the UK where they are  based as well.Maybe we’ll find out if something changed soon."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Does anyone think this was a failed pivot from the p0rn and the backlash was so great that they backpedaled?It actually reminds me of Ebay. Ebay became big with online auctions but as soon as they did they seemed to want to no longer be in the auction business. Instead they wanted to be in the online retail business. Maybe because there was more money per customer. Maybe because online retail was larger. Personally I always found Ebay&#39;s retail move to be weird and off-brand with a subpar user experience.Something about this Onlyfans move just doesn&#39;t sit right. Like who were the banks or payment processors that supposedly forced this? I haven&#39;t seen anyone claim responsibility (officially or not)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This distinction of changing the defacto ownership of your device and data is the real inflection point. The surveillance technology itself is not really that novel, as functionally it&#39;s applying established anti-virus techniques to data instead of code. Ask any AV company how their detection works, and it will include a variation on this.This same tech can (and will likely) be used to find the owners of bitcoin and other cryptocurrency wallets, honeypot tokens, community identities, and to provide profiling information to the company&#39;s political masters. The collisions in the hashing scheme mean that you can insert anything you want onto peoples devices and get them pulled into the legal system once it is flagged, where the process itself is the punishment. The whole scheme is too stupid to ever have been about reason, it&#39;s just pretexts and narrative, and this is as good a time as any to exit their ecosystem.Apple really picked the wrong time to attempt this, as I do not see anyone who understands how evil this is ever forgiving them. The most charitable thing I can say about it is that they&#39;re probably just doing it as part of a deal to avoid anti-trust plays, where Apple plays ball with the feds and its parties, and the storm just magically passes them over. The good news is running OSX made me lazy, and getting back into running a linux or freebsd laptop again is going to be fun."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;So what happens when, in a few years at the latest, a politician points that out, and—in order to protect the children—bills are passed in the legislature to prohibit this &#34;Disable&#34; bypass, effectively compelling Apple to scan photos that aren’t backed up to iCloud? What happens when a party in India demands they start scanning for memes associated with a separatist movement? What happens when the UK demands they scan for a library of terrorist imagery? How long do we have left before the iPhone in your pocket begins quietly filing reports about encountering “extremist” political material, or about your presence at a &#34;civil disturbance&#34;? Or simply about your iPhone&#39;s possession of a video clip that contains, or maybe-or-maybe-not contains, a blurry image of a passer-by who resembles, according to an algorithm, &#34;a person of interest&#34;?What I don&#39;t get is what prevented these things from happening last month?  Apple controls the hardware, the software, and the cloud services so the point at which the scanning is done is mostly arbitrary from a process standpoint (I understand people believe there are huge differences philosophically). They could have already scanned our files because they already have full control over the entire ecosystem.  If they can be corrupted by authoritative governments, then shouldn&#39;t we assume that have already been corrupted?  If so, why did we trust them with full control of the ecosystem?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a very well-written post. Ever since this program has been announced I have struggled with talking about the implications succinctly.Online, I never know if an interlocutor is even arguing in good faith, but even in person it&#39;s difficult to balance talking about all the ways that the claimed safeguards are meaningless, how the benefits don&#39;t really make sense, how this is markedly different from other infringements on privacy with the need to be concise and explain that the real problems aren&#39;t just theoretical because similar invasions of privacy are killing actual people around the world already.Anyway, I think the only practical way that this could resolve well, is if Apple saw a precipitous decline in its iCloud brand, then it could be argued that they had to abandon this plan for purely business reasons. A serious movement to abandon Apple services ($17.5B revenue in 2021 q3), might empower the people within Apple who opposed this reckless plan from the beginning."</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28303025">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s been frustrating watching the Spotify (and general movement) with podcasts fragmenting and going exclusive. Spotify won with music because it improved upon the existing state of listening to music and offered a free or cheap solution that was even a compelling alternative to piracy.Podcasts for the most part were in the ideal state for consumers, almost always free and mostly client independent distributed w/ RSS. I don&#39;t think there is much of any argument that Spotify can improve that state for consumers by taking a podcast exclusive. These deals are just payouts for the hosts not investments that make the shows better. Most even very successful podcasts likely have low opex (some exceptions like NYT Daily) and don&#39;t benefit from a big pile of cash.On a different note regarding the Rogan Deal, Spotify took ages to add video streaming support on Apple TV (main way I would catch Rogan) which basically caused me to quit casual watching. They also only recently added offline playback for Apple Watch and even then it&#39;s premium exclusive and requires manual downloading of eps. I don&#39;t understand at all why an enormous company like Spotify is so neglectful of the entire apple ecosystem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hearing &#34;Exclusively on Spotify&#34; on any podcast ad is a sure-fire way to make sure I never listen to an episode. One of the great features of podcasts is the flexibility in listening platform and I&#39;d really rather not switch to Spotify&#39;s substandard user experience."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Spotify is just not set up for long-form video content. The discovery aspect of YouTube is one reason why it reels you in. You&#39;re scrolling through your feed, you see an interesting clip, and you click on it. Another big part of YouTube is the comment section. Spotify lacks on both fronts. I also think the JRE clips were a big part of what sucked people into watch full epsiodes. If a 5-7 minute JRE clip were interesting I might jump in and watch the whole episode. I don&#39;t think they&#39;ve done that or done it as well on Spotify."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Since the author is on here - reckon you could beat up on simple random tokens a _little_ bit more? In particular how easy they are to identify and prevent leaking (easily fixed by adding a prefix).I work on secret scanning at GitHub. When token issuers use easily identifiable formats for their tokens we can easily spot them when they&#39;re accidentally committed. We can then work with the token issuer to automatically alert them of those leaks. A good example is AWS - if you commit an AWS key and secret to a public GitHub repo we will tell AWS about it and they will tell you about it (and quarantine the exposed keys) within a few seconds. We work with dozens of other token issuers too, though - some of the latest we added were Linear, PlanetScale and Ionic.The above relies on tokens being identifiable - we can&#39;t send hundreds of partners everything that looks like 32 hex chars. In future we want to be able to do even more sophisticated things, like ask users for confirmation before the push code that contains secrets. We recently changed our own token pattern for that reason.GitHub secret scanning program: https://docs.github.com/en/developers/overview/secret-scanni...GitHub&#39;s updated token format: https://github.blog/2021-04-05-behind-githubs-new-authentica..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is great.One thing that&#39;s worth remembering about randomly generated tokens is that it&#39;s important to always use safe comparison methods when comparing them to the stored one - otherwise you could be vulnerable to timing attacks.In Python you can use secrets.compare_digest(a, b) for this: https://docs.python.org/3/library/secrets.html#secrets.compa..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This post reminded me a little of https://blog.thea.codes/building-a-stateless-api-proxy/ from 2019, an absolutely brilliant hack that attempted to make up for GitHub&#39;s lack of finely-grained API tokens.The key idea there is to build your own custom proxy for the GitHub API, then issue tokens for it which are actually encrypted bundles of the full-permission API token plus a set of rules about what the proxy should allow it to do - only allow a GET to paths that match &#34;/gists/.*&#34; for example.It&#39;s somewhat similar to Biscuits storing a Datalog program &#34;to evaluate whether a token allows an operation.&#34;"</p>
