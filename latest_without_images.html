								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"About a decade ago, I implemented the Causal Tree CRDT (aka RGA, Timestamped Insertion Tree) in regular expressions using a Unicode string as a storage. Later we made a collaborative editor for Yandex based on that code.
It used many of the tricks as described in the text, even the optimization where you remember the last insertion point. So I am terribly glad it all gets rediscovered.The code is on GitHub [1] There is also an article which might be a tough reading, so no link.
Recently I greatly improved CTs by introducing the Chronofold data structure [2].
Regarding that benchmark article, I spent many years in academia, so the quality of content problem is familiar to me. In other words, I don&#39;t take such articles seriously.
CRDTs are fast enough, that is not a concern.[1]: https://github.com/gritzko/citrea-model[2]: https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09511"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On a meta-level, does anyone else think that the whole idea of writing a peer reviewed paper that is just a benchmark of different algorithms should be really rigorously reviewed before being accepted? Writing good benchmarks is hard, and so highly contextual that writing fair comparisons beteen algorithms (or data structures) is almost impossible unless you&#39;re an expert in all of the algorithms involved."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"By the way, as someone who has published academic papers, if you&#39;re ever bothered about a paper or have some comments, don&#39;t hesitate to mail the authors. (Their e-mail addresses are always on the paper; especially target the first author because they have normally done the work.) We are happy to hear when someone has read our work and I at least would&#39;ve liked to have known if someone found a problem with my papers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s one lovely trick.If I may suggest one thing... instead of range requests on a single huge file how about splitting the file in 1-page fragments in separate files and fetching them individually? This buys you caching (e.g. on CDNs) and compression (that you could also perform ahead of time), both things that are somewhat tricky with a single giant file and range requests.With the reduction in size you get from compression, you can also use larger pages almost for free, potentially further decreasing the number of roundtrips.There&#39;s also a bunch of other things that could be tried later, like using a custom dictionary for compressing the individual pages."</p>

  Triton

The 16 in this example is the &#34;block size&#34;, and could be anything. But this notion of expressing computation over blocks of dense data seems to be the big difference from other approaches.A very exciting result of the incredible performance that Triton achieves, is the ability to fuse NN operations such as Matrix Multiply + LeakyReLU + Batch Norm. Previously, you needed to rely on cuBLAS for fast hand-written Matrix Multiply kernels, and then your LeakyReLU would need to read that result out of memory, and then your Batch Norm would read the LeakyReLU out of memory again.The ability to write very fast kernels, and especially being able to fuse them together, to avoid unnecessary memory round-trips is a big deal!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was a cryptologic linguist for the army and went through a 16 month course of 6-7 hours of classroom instruction per day M-F, native speaking instructors, tons of immersion, and a couple hours of homework each night and left still feeling like I hardly knew the language that I was supposed to be interpreting. Unless your major in college is a specific language, you probably won&#39;t achieve any sort of fluency in your target language from taking a course in it, either.Language learning is hard and a multifaceted thing that no single application is going to adequately prepare you for. Speaking and listening are related skills yet speaking is much harder than listening, and both are much harder than reading (for the vast majority of languages). Rote memorization is necessary. Immersion is necessary. Comprehensible input is necessary.Language learning apps like Duolingo sell the idea of learning a language which is an extremely attractive idea to a lot of people. They also make it a fun activity and incentivize engagement with humor and gamification. The problem is that you can&#39;t possibly become fluent in a language with an app like it and there isn&#39;t any single app that will.I suppose in the end Duolingo&#39;s valuation is more a reflection of people&#39;s desire to learn a language rather than people actually learning a language, though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Honestly from using duolingo pretty heavily for a couple of years, attending language classes and doing my own individual study I&#39;ve found duolingo pretty useless. It&#39;s &#34;fun&#34; and gives one the sense of progress without really accomplishing much."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As an English speaker, DuoLingo didn’t seem that interesting to me. Then I listened to a podcast where the found Luis von Ahn explained why he started the company [1]. He grew up in Guatemala, and he noticed that learning English would essentially triple anyone’s earning potential in his country. Sure, I might never learn Chinese in DuoLingo, but if I could triple my income by doing it I bet I’d be much more motivated. English speakers that think this app is a toy aren’t the target market.Luis also invented the captcha and used it to digitize the full archive of the New York Times. I can’t speak to the quality of the instruction in DuoLingo, but I’m willing to bet that if there’s a computer-assisted approach to language learning that works, Luis is one of the people most likely to invent it.[1] https://www.npr.org/2020/05/22/860884062/recaptcha-and-duoli..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; I am an AI skeptic. I am baffled by anyone who isn’t. I don’t see any path from continuous improvements to the (admittedly impressive) ‘machine learning’ field that leads to a general AI- I share the skepticism towards any progress towards &#39;general AI&#39; - I don&#39;t think that we&#39;re remotely close or even on the right path in any way.- That doesn&#39;t make me a skeptic towards the current state of machine learning though. ML doesn&#39;t need to lead to general AI. It&#39;s already useful in its current forms. That&#39;s good enough. It doesn&#39;t need to solve all of humanity&#39;s problems to be a great tool.I think it&#39;s important to make this distinction and for some reason it&#39;s left implicit or it&#39;s purposefully omitted from the article."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What a confused and muddled post, trying to touch on psychology, philosophy, and mathematics, and missing the mark on basically all three. I&#39;m quite bearish on AI/ML, but calling it a &#34;parlor trick&#34; is like calling modern computers a parlor trick. I mean, at the end of the day, they&#39;re just very fast abacuses, right? Let&#39;s face it: what ML has brought to the forefront -- from self-landing airplanes to self-driving cars, to AI-assisted diagnoses -- is pretty impressive. If you insist on being reductive, sure, I guess it&#39;s &#34;merely&#34; statistics.Bringing up quantitative vs qualitative analysis is just silly, since science has had this problem way before AI. Hume famously described it as the is/ought problem†. And that was a few hundred years ago.Finally, dropping the mic with &#34;I don&#39;t think we&#39;re anywhere close to consciousness&#34; is just bizarre. I don&#39;t think that any serious academic working in AI/ML has made any arguments that claim machine learning models are &#34;conscious.&#34; And Strong AI will probably remain unattainable for a very long time (I&#39;d argue forever). This is not a particularly controversial position.† Okay, it&#39;s not the same thing, but closely related. I suppose the fact–value distinction might be a bit closer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What baffles me is the number of humans who think they are in the personal possession of some super special sacred form of magical and unexplainable intelligence. &#34;AI is just stats&#34; yes, indeed, but so is human intelligence. In many ways, AI from 2010 was already better than human intelligence.Three remarks:- The task many people seem to be benchmarking against is not just a measure of general intelligence, but a measure of how well AI is able to emulate human intelligence. That&#39;s not wrong, but I do find it amusing. Emulating any system within another generally requires an order of magnitude higher performance.- The degree to which human intelligence fails catastrophically in each of our lives, on a continuous basis, is way too quickly forgotten. We have a very selective memory indeed. We have absolutely terrible judgment, are super irrational, and pretty reliably make decisions that are against our own interests, whether it&#39;s with regard to tobacco use, avoidance of physical exercise, or refusal of life-saving medications or prophylactics. We avoid spending time learning maths and science because it&#39;s not cool, and we openly display pride in our anti-intellectual behaviours and attitudes. We&#39;re all incredibly stupid by default.- AI researchers need to work more closely with neuroanatomists. The main thing preventing AI from behaving like a human is the different macro structure of human NNs vs artificial NNs. Our brains aren&#39;t random assortments of randomly connected neurons: there&#39;s structure in there that explains our patterns of behaviour, and that is lacking in even the most modern AI. We can&#39;t expect AI to be human if we don&#39;t give it human structures."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"We are also fans:
For our everyday workhorse typeface, we exchanged Roboto for Inter. Roboto is a little bit narrow, and it turns out that Inter was developed by a Swede living in San Francisco, Rasmus Andersson, as a solution to a bunch of limitations he found with Roboto. It looked good and it was widely available free of charge. Tack själv, Rasmus!

How they have pushed Chrome as a &#34;better browser&#34; on the front page of Google (were no one else have been allowed to advertise) to Firefox users since way before Chrome was anywere nearly as good as Firefox, making it both a lie and - more importantly - a massive abuse of dominance in one market to gain monopoly in another just like Microsoft did with IE.As we saw yesterday with AWS authorities are willing to punish rampant abuse if they have a good case and this definitely is one.Edit: since this comment is getting a lot of attention the relevant authority in Norway is Konkurransetilsynet with web address https://konkurransetilsynet.no(Finding the exact correct form on that site and for this purpose seems to be an art and/or science it seems but if you can&#39;t find any just submit somewhere and explain the situation.)It would be beautiful if everyone could post underneath with the address to the equivalent office in your jurisdiction."</p>
