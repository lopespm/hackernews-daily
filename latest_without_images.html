								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"i will say they are right about one thing, small sellers are getting totally run over by design theft and aliexpress resellers. as a buyer, its a huge pain to have to sift through pages of aliexpress merchandise to uncover interesting and original work. make a cool printed design on a game boy shell? quickly stolen, mass produced on aliexpress, then sold by all the boring resellers on etsy. 90% of rpg dice sellers are selling the exact same stuff they got from the exact same bulk deal.one of the biggest problems for me is im never even sure if im buying the original design or a knockoff, which totally sucks.idk if this is just affecting the retro games / dice communities, or if others are also hit. ALSO you can kinda just sell semi-illegal &#34;grey&#34; goods on etsy? TONS of sellers just selling bootleg game boy games and rarely mentioning that in the product description."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the petition:AI-powered bots shut down legitimate seller accounts seemingly at random, while Etsy looks the other way on resellers who undercut authentic makers by peddling sweatshop-produced junk in clear violation of the spirit of the Etsy community.AI lockouts are a huge problem on Amazon, too, not to mention many of the sites and services used by HNers. I&#39;ve said it before and I will say it again:How many more pleas like this will we see on HN? Or, hear from friends, colleagues, and relatives who have been locked out or denied access to an important service, either through no fault of their own or by an innocent action?No warning.No explanation other than &#34;suspicious activity&#34; or &#34;violation of [vaguely worded] policy.&#34;No human to call who can help troubleshoot, other than a tech-savvy friend or relative.No recourse.There needs to be a technology bill of rights, not just for people dealing with Google, Amazon, Apple, and Facebook, but also the myriad other technology operators which can disrupt our lives in an instant with some poorly programmed process or unanticipated edge case."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Until you experience this simple way of traveling, it may look like an uncomfortable thing to do. My girlfriend has Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and loves traveling this way, where she would often be bedridden at home for days, when traveling she can at least be in a natural park, listening to birds, waking up by a tawny owl, see deer and foxes pass by the car without noticing you. Life becomes simple and you&#39;re so much closer to nature. 
Even with sub zero temperatures and no heating at night, with the right gear this is still very doable. Of course you have to go to places with low population density and be mindful of your surroundings."</p>

It&#39;s not overly grim, not saccharine &#34;everything is beautiful&#34;. Very matter of fact, very bittersweet.Cancer is a terrible thing and I hope we beat it one day. I&#39;m glad she at least had the NHS covering her expenses because I cannot imagine how gutting it&#39;d be to deal with the loss of a loved one compounded with debt.May her last days be as devoid of fear as possible."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This seems like a perfectly reasonable way to end a service. The server died, and the effort to bring it back up seems high.This is a reminder to pay for services you depend on. Per the Pinboard founder&#39;s post:&gt; I love free software and could not have built my site without it. But free web services are not like free software. If your free software project suddenly gets popular, you gain resources: testers, developers and people willing to pitch in. If your free website takes off, you lose resources. Your time is spent firefighting and your money all goes to the nice people at Linode.&gt; Like a service? Make them charge you or show you ads. If they won&#39;t do it, clone them and do it yourself. Soon you&#39;ll be the only game in town!https://blog.pinboard.in/2011/12/don_t_be_a_free_user/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This project was killed by invisible complexity. I felt a little sad
reading about it. There are lots of comments talking about the
sustainability of projects with respect to money and burnout, the need
to pay for services etc. I get that and agree. But I also get the
impression that wouldn&#39;t have helped here.When we reach a situation where some unknown person pushes an upstream
update, which causes a cascade of problems that even someone with deep
technical knowledge and daily connection to the project cannot unpick,
that&#39;s a breakdown in modularity/dependency.It&#39;s what we faced in the 1990s and from it evolved package managers,
version control, dependency management and all the good things.I think in 2022 we&#39;re back in a similar situation again.
Virtualisation, containers, cloud services and whatnot have regressed
development reliability.I predict the day when a really major service provider comes out and
says; &#34;Sorry everyone. It&#39;s been 10 days downtime. We&#39;ve put our 1000
top engineers on the problem and nobody knows what&#39;s wrong. We just
can&#39;t fix it.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"He says he had hundreds of users and hosting costs were a problem. This made me curious how this could be. Testing SSL for a few hundred users should pretty much free these days.He said Patreon pledges paid for 25% of hosting. So I looked up his Patreon. Turns out he has 3 (!) patreons, together paying $9 per month.The web is a strange place.Here comes a fun fact I can add: He is doing better than me. I have a website with about 500000 monthly users and 5 (!) patreons. So while he only had 1% paying users, I only have 0.001% :)Did I say the web is a strange place? Will this ever change?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I did some research on this as part of my undergrad in the early 00&#39;sI skimmed the article but it seems to align with the literature back then. The thinking was during our evolution that high volume low frequency sounds would represent a precursor to mortal danger (avalanches, earthquakes, stampedes, thunder, wind) so we were attuned to secreting stress hormones in early response. Unfortunately, much of our urban built-environment is full of (human-made) constant low-frequency sources, although we appear to have adapted to a degree (HVAC systems in buildings, traffic, industrial process plants, airports and air traffic, explosions, concerts).What isn&#39;t mentioned here, that I remember finding particularly concerning, was that while we seem to adapt, it&#39;s over our own time, as children we secrete more cortisol to low frequency noise than when we are adults... maybe some form of long term CBT I don&#39;t know.I have no idea where my old paper is but I remember (and someone with more time might want to check/confirm this) one important study showed cortisol levels of children at schools close to Heathrow compared to out in the UK countryside and how this affected standardised testing. There were limitations, and of course you had to control for a range of factors, socio-economic, teaching staff etc, but there was some measurable negative effect (again no idea if this was repeated/corroborated).The actual research I was doing was into our auditory perception of urban spaces. We took recordings of various urban settings and had participants listen and rate their emotional responses, if it felt &#34;hot&#34; or &#34;cold&#34; (and other adjective pairs), we also had them draw something to represent what they were listening too.Our &#34;findings&#34; were pretty limited for a short undergrad project but it was interesting how we generally appreciate background chatter and live-music and generally fearful and cold from large flat surface reflected sound (empty city plazas)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is one of the things I struggle with the most in life. I feel like most people don&#39;t seem to care about noise pollution and zero care is put into designing living spaces or cities to minimize it. I&#39;ve moved into apartments and nearly cried because I realized that there was some noise pollution that wasn&#39;t apparent when I visited it (e.g. a water boiler that ran constantly at night, road noise during the day, etc) and would have to deal with it for a year.One of the few countries I&#39;ve been to that takes noise pollution seriously is Switzerland. A beautifully peaceful and quiet country."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is one of the top reasons for preferring single-family detached housing. I lived in apartments for many years, and when I moved to a house I felt like I could finally relax for the first time in years.For the people advocating for high density housing to alleviate suburban sprawl and all of its environmental problems, I do appreciate the importance of that, but if I can avoid living in an apartment again I am willing to go to almost any amount of trouble to do that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Living in Spain, I love trains and take them over airplane when it&#39;s an option. However, trains are often around twice as expensive as flying for may routes. I know nothing about trains, but intuitively I would expect the opposite, and I really wish it was more affordable, specially high speed rail."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here in Germany, for as long as I can remember, the government praises itself every year for investing as much in rail as never before. I have not noticed the service quality to change for the better over the last 15 years. The ever-rising investments seem to be only enough to keep the status quo of the crumbling infrastructure."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As an American who doesn&#39;t drive, the experience of trains in the EU compared to the US is just delightful. Yes, there are super cheap flights and I used them often for longer haul trips but the trains were always amazing- I&#39;ve done trips including Mariupol to Lviv, Budapest to Berlin, and Berlin to Munich and always had a great experience. The Romania-Chisinau line is quite old but part of its charm. I see a lot of people talking about the expense compared to the cheap flights- those are solid and I&#39;ve used them a lot but after you factor in the waiting time at airports, the unexpected fees in case your bag is a kilo too heavy, the uber to and from a far away airport, etc. it&#39;s really not that much of a difference. There is no comparison to trains in the U.S. (e.g. I took one for 3 days from DC to LA; while I enjoyed it, it was a slough with no real food facilities for the passengers not in sleeper cars, old chairs, etc.). I hope there will be more investment, especially in the Baltics."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Deno core team member and TC39 delegate here.We have pondered about capability based security for Deno in the past. Our conclusion has always been that this is not possible to do securely in JS without freezing all prototypes and objects by default. The reasoning for this is that you need to make sure the capability token does not ever leak. For example as a malicious user I could override `globalThis.fetch` to exfiltrate the capability token destined for `fetch` and use it myself later.One could also override `Map.prototype.set` / `Map.prototype.get` to exfiltrate  a token every time it is added or removed from a `Map` (people will want to store tokens in a `Map`).One could also override `Array.prototype[Symbol.iterator]` to exfiltrate tokens  stored in arrays if those arrays are destructored, spread, etc.There are many more cases like this, where one can exfiltrate tokens because of the very dynamic nature of JavaScript.It is unlikely that freezing all intrinsic prototypes and objects is even enough. People will find ways to exfiltrate tokens."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The impression I get from the companies I&#39;ve worked at is to not trust packages that are mostly maintained by one person. Ironically, those packages are usually the ones that don&#39;t have outrageously large dependency trees and can usually be audited by a developer on a weekend, and the more &#34;trustworthy&#34; larger packages with hundreds of maintainers typically have monstrous dependency trees.Not saying 1-man tools are inherently better, but in my experience, these tools seems to have a tighter focus and less chances of scope/dependency creep."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Founder of Socket (https://socket.dev) here, a new tool built by npm maintainers to help solve JavaScript supply chain security.I totally agree with the idea that we should assume all open source packages may be malicious. Socket.dev uses &#34;deep package inspection&#34; to characterize the behavior of an open source package. By actually analyzing the package code, Socket can detect when packages use security-relevant platform capabilities, such as the network, filesystem, or shell.For instance, to detect if a package uses the network, Socket looks at whether fetch(), or Node&#39;s net, dgram, dns, http or https modules are used within the package or any of its dependencies.This entails running static analysis (and soon, dynamic analysis) on a package – and all of its dependencies – to look for specific risk markers.In this way, Socket can detect the tell-tale signs of a supply chain attack, including the introduction of install scripts, obfuscated code, high entropy strings, or usage of privileged APIs such as shell, filesystem, eval(), and environment variables.We are taking an entirely new approach to one of the hardest problems in security in a stagnant part of the industry that has historically been obsessed with just reporting on known vulnerabilities."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This reminded me of a quote from Catch 22:&#34;His specialty was alfalfa, and he made a good thing out of not growing any. The government paid him well for every bushel of alfalfa he did not grow. The more alfalfa he did not grow, the more money the government gave him, and he spent every penny he didn&#39;t earn on new land to increase the amount of alfalfa he did not produce. Major Major&#39;s father worked without rest at not growing alfalfa. On long winter evenings he remained indoors and did not mend harness, and he sprang out of bed at the crack of noon every day just to make certain that the chores would not be done.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Avoided emissions are a scam.&#34;Nature based&#34; offsets aren&#39;t that much better.  It is mainly &#34;pay us or we&#39;ll cut down this forest&#34; but there is a fundamental timing problem:  you emitted one ton of CO2 yesterday,  somebody else has to protect a forest forever to keep that CO2 trapped.There are other schemes that claim to be low cost such ashttps://www.vesta.earth/that have the problem of not being measurable.  Contrast that to other schemes that get 1% of the press coverage,  such as the &#34;gold standard&#34; of injecting CO2 into saline aquifershttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S17505...where you really can measure the gas going into the hole and can almost (but not quite) take it for granted that the CO2 will stay there for 10,000 years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"People pushing carbon offsets seem to have a lack of understanding of how global element cycles work.  To be brief, the only way to &#39;offset&#39; fossil fuel CO2 emissions is to bury an equivalent amount of carbon, extracted from the atmosphere, in a geologically stable formation or a permanently anoxic aquatic basin.  End of story.  Planting trees does not &#39;offset&#39; fossil emissions unless you plan to take the tree and bury it in an anoxic environment in which it can never decay.  Solar panels and wind turbines offset nothing at all.The only real fix for fossil-fueled global warming is to eliminate fossil fuels from the energy mix.  A practical plan for doing that would result in perhaps a 3% reduction in fossil fuel PRODUCTION per year (no, don&#39;t try counting emissions, count production).  In 30 years, this would mean zero fossil fuel production globally."</p>
