The Black Belt is both a geological term used to refer to the rich &amp; dark soil [0] and a geopolitical term to refer to the high percentage of African Americans [1]. During the Cretaceous period, the shore-line at the time ran through the middle of Alabama and Mississippi, depositing rich organic deposits, which in turn allowed for plantations to thrive in those parts of the deep south. Even nearly 160 years after the Emancipation Proclamation, those counties still have some of the highest percentages of African American Populations. Overlaying the population demographic map on a a map of the cretaceous shoreline shows a correlation [2].[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Belt_(geological_formati...

The Russian partition (and to a lesser extent Austrian one) was the cause of the area in blue being poor and underdeveloped.There was nothing particularly great in being under Prussian (German) occupation. It&#39;s that Russian occupation was so much worse, hell bent on robbing Poland on everything of any value."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In the US/Iraq war such contraptions were commonly referred to as EFPs (explosively formed penetrators). My platoon was once hit by a four-array EFP that was hung behind a cement wall (US forces would often line streets with barricades like this) so we couldn&#39;t see it. It went through the concrete wall, the humvee, and took some legs with it. Brutal things they were. We avoided prolonged truck excursions, but I remember we used to always sit with our arms and legs as staggered as possible--The thought being that if an EFP went through, you might get lucky and only lose one arm/leg instead of two. Of course it probably didn&#39;t help... but whatever."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I amuse myself by thinking that Sidney Alford (the expert in the video, who by the way appears to have passed away last year) looked like, and was, the modern Grand Maester, conjuring up magical (but yes, destructive and terrible) explosives for the use by kingdoms against each other.   He should&#39;ve been given a cameo part in Game of Thrones...I got onto the topic years ago when watching the Dambusters.   Related to this, he also has a video showing how putting a simple tube/bag of water behind an explosive charge magnifies its force incredibly.  I believe he started a company that built and sold explosives with such a water-fillable jacket that could be used to knock down doors by police forces.edit: here&#39;s the water filled explosive knocking down a door: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_80gWlDQdHg"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Wikipedia article on shaped charges is fascinating:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaped_chargeThe penetration distance is proportional to the diameter of the charge (counterintuitive; you&#39;d expect the height), and can be up to 7x as large.  So a ~5 inch charge shown in the film can penetrate up to about 3 feet of solid steel.Also, all of our known defenses against shaped charged rely on the assumption that the same spot won&#39;t get hit twice.  Composite armor breaks and deflects the geometry of the jet through its deformation; reactive armor relies on a mini-explosion to defeat the jet.  This has interesting implications in a world of drones and precision-guided munitions, and in fact the Javelin missiles we&#39;ve been shipping to Ukraine have double warheads, the first to destroy the armor and the second to destroy the vehicle."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"LUNA is trading at below $0.00001, that is below 1/1000th of a cent right now. For many, getting rid of it may be much harder than just ignoring it. A few weeks ago the price people were willing to pay for it hovered around $100.I say &#34;the price people were willing to pay&#34; instead of &#34;value&#34;, because now that nobody wants to speculate with LUNA, it did fall down to its intrinsic value: Practically zero. Nobody needs it for anything besides buying and selling it from and to other people, which is not happening anymore.Cryptocurrency is gambling, plain and simple. The difficulty that fiat currency faces is inflation, which roughly means diluting the economy that backs it too much. The difficulty with cryptocurrency is that there is nothing of worth backing it. Factor in the horrifying externalities, and its worth is negative.For Bitcoin, the most popular one, on the order of 100.000.000.000.000.000.000 of hashes get calculated to mine a single block, multiple trillion per second. Within ten minutes, only a single one of those 100.000.000.000.000.000.000 hashes is actually used, depending entirely on luck. The rest are thrown away entirely. They do not form part of the final hash or anything else, the energy spent on them is lost."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I prefer Matt Levine from his newsletter today:&#34;Safe assets are much riskier than risky ones. This is I think the deep lesson of the 2008 financial crisis, and crypto loves re-learning the lessons of traditional finance. Systemic risks live in safe assets. Equity-like assets — tech stocks, Luna, Bitcoin — are risky, and everyone knows they’re risky, and everyone accepts the risk. If your stocks or Bitcoin go down by 20% you are sad, but you are not that surprised. And so most people arrange their lives in such a way that, if their stocks or Bitcoin go down by 20%, they are not ruined.&#34;On the other hand safe assets — AAA mortgage securities, bank deposits, stablecoins — are not supposed to be risky, and people rely on them being worth what they say they’re worth, and when people lose even a little bit of confidence in them they crack completely. Bitcoin is valuable at $50,000 and somewhat less valuable at $40,000. A stablecoin is valuable at $1.00 and worthless at $0.98. If it hits $0.98 it might as well go to zero. And now it might!&#34;I have in the past told the story of TerraUSD and Luna by saying: The weakness in TerraUSD is Luna. One UST can be exchanged for $1 of Luna, but that only works if people continue to have confidence in Luna; if Luna goes to zero then TerraUSD will follow. But you could also tell the story by saying: The weakness in Luna is TerraUSD. Luna, as the cryptocurrency of a blockchain ecosystem, would rise or fall with the value of that ecosystem. But Luna, as the thing supporting a stablecoin, could go to zero in a week if that stablecoin needed support. Terra was so unstable because it was trying to be stable.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I interviewed with Terraform Labs less than a year ago. The guy interviewing me was a pretty standard eng manager who&#39;d left Amazon for the excitment of a crypto startup. I tried to prep for the interview by researching their white papers to figure out how the various balancing and investment mechanisms actually functioned on a technical level. But it was difficult to make sense of their white paper, which was fairly general, and different portions of their documentation seemed to contradict one another. When I asked what I&#39;d been misunderstanding, he told me that I hadn&#39;t misunderstood anything: their white paper was not a full spec, and their documentation was out of date. In that case, I asked, how could one actually understand the protocol? &#34;It&#39;s probably not possible at this point,&#34; he told me, &#34;These things are in motion all the time.&#34; I thought his answer was pretty eye-opening.Their interview question was: design a simple app which allows one to query the effect of crypto price changes on the supply &amp; price of LUNA. I gathered that the upshot was, how big a movement would be required to break the $1 peg? I wonder if their models weren&#39;t good, or if their models were good, and they were just accepting a high level of risk?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"God! I hope both WhiteHat Jr. and their parent company Byju&#39;s crash and burn. They are crap companies which make poor and gullible parents enroll their kids in one of their programs for extortionate amount of money. If the parents cannot afford to pay all at once, they give a &#34;loan&#34; to the parents and collect a part of it each month even if the kids aren&#39;t satisfied with the education that is being provided. Note that none of the kids in India use these apps as the only way to study. They attend regular schools and use these apps as an additional source. Byju&#39;s employs 1000s of people whose only job is to go visit as many houses as they can and trick the parents into subscribing for their services by falsely claiming that the only way their kids can succeed is when their education is supplemented by these apps. Many innocent people who want to do all they can to make their kids&#39; lives better fall into the trap and then keep paying the &#34;loan&#34; amount back which could be a substantial part of their monthly income.Meta and Disney invested a lot of money into these companies and they use it to bully anyone who tries to bring these issues up by shutting down their YouTube channels and filing defamation law suits [1,2]. The entire online education industry is unregulated and resort to shitty antics to extort money. I don&#39;t understand why these companies need to exist when we have other free and amazing resources online like Khan Academy which teach all topics to all ages of people.[1] https://thepost.co.in/news/633/whitehat-jr-lawsuit-pradeep-p...[2] https://www.reddit.com/r/india/search?q=pradeep+poonia&amp;restr..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Lots of great additions. I will just highlight two:Column selection:When you have tons of columns these become useful. Clickhouse takes it to the next level and supports APPLY and COLUMN in addition to EXCEPT, REPLACE which DuckDB supports:    - APPLY: apply a function to a set of columns
    - COLUMN: select columns by matching a regular expression (!)

Details here: https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/sele...Allow trailing commas:I can&#39;t count how many times I&#39;ve run into a problem with a trailing comma. There&#39;s a whole convention developed to overcome this: the prefix comma convention where you&#39;d write:    SELECT
      first_column
      ,second_column
      ,third_column

which lets you easily comment out a line without worrying about trailing comma errors. That&#39;s no longer necessary in DuckDB. Allowing for trailing commas should get included in the SQL spec."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a bit buried at the bottom, but:&gt; For Linux users, we removed the connection from content processes to the X11 Server, which stops attackers from exploiting the unsecured X11 protocol.It&#39;s hard to overstate how much of a benefit this is in terms of security for those on Linux. Any application with access to the X11 socket effectively has the keys to the kingdom, because it can hijack other applications, including those running at higher privileges, at will. (There have been halfhearted attempts to address this over the years, but nothing that&#39;s been effective or widely adopted.) The only real solution for desktop app security on Linux is to forbid direct access to X11 entirely, and so it&#39;s a huge deal that Firefox is now able to do this.In general, doing this sort of thing is a monumental undertaking for large applications like Firefox. Kudos to my former colleagues for pulling it off."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I firmly believe that isolation is the future of endpoint security and I like experimenting with Mandatory Access Control (MAC) on Linux. Tomoyo is my favorite major MAC/LSM in the Linux kernel.If you have a newer kernel (5.13 or greater), you may like to experiment with landlock. It&#39;s pretty cool and unlike FireJail, no suid required.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a real shame that platform native widgets had to be sacrificed for this to work. The easy way out was to switch to arbitrary app-drawn widgets across all platforms (which Firefox did for all basic DOM HTML elements); the &#34;we&#39;ll do one better&#34; alternative is to use app-drawn imitations of the system-native widgets (a la Qt) which Firefox is now doing for the scrollbar. But no one ever gets these widgets right (unnatural scrolling, non-identical behavior when clicking in the gapped region, different scrollable-to-nonscrollable widget ratios, colors not respecting certain subtle theming choices, etc, etc.I wonder if there was an alternative specifically for the scrollbar here - some way of obtaining an outer &#34;shell&#34; (via win32k, but then basically &#34;orphaning&#34; it so that you can&#39;t do anything besides kill it when you&#39;re finished) that just provides the window with an empty scrollable element that is then populated by the restricted process.That ship has really sailed though; I think the days of native widgets are quickly coming to an end."</p>
