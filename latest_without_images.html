								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I remember the electric atmosphere in the auditorium going to see the film the Epilogue video is taken from, Electroma [1], on screen. It was only playing in a single cinema in the world in Paris and only at midgnight. So glad I got to catch that.I am kind of glad to hear that Daft Pank is over and I say this as someone who their music means a lot to. The arc of their art is complete and there is nowhere left for them to go without it becoming forced, awkward or irrelevant: teenagers with attitude and samplers to elder statesmen recording with an orchestra.As this is HN, does anyone remember their more interesting dives into technology: Daft Club [2] and the multi-angle DVD of D.A.F.T. [3]?This quote [4] about Daft Club, and the state of music on the internet, from 2001 is really interesting in hindsight:&gt; It&#39;s great to find a new channel where there is an open access, open door to more, but not more than had to be done before. It&#39;s establishing a connection between people that listen to our music and ourselves. There&#39;s no limits of time, and it helps people get and listen to this music. A track that could have been done today can be online tomorrow. The other thing is to really express ourselves through the Internet.&gt; ...&gt; Napster is a cool thing with us. The important thing is to make a difference. Napster is a positive thing because it raises questions, it raises issues.[1] https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0800022/[2] https://web.archive.org/web/20020804191122/http://www.daftcl...[3] https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0279758/[4] https://web.archive.org/web/20070609232158/http://music.yaho..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I always thought Daft Punk figured out the perfect solution to the how to be famous problem. Everyone recognizes their artist name and their artist costume, but virtually no one knows their real name or would accost them on the street."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Best Daft Punk show I ever saw was Lollapalooza with LCD Soundsystem opening on the nearby stage. LCD Soundsytem closed with “Daft Punk is Playing..” and Daft Punk emerged in a pyramid and absolutely melted our faces."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; “When they legislate these things, they need to be appropriating enough money to make sure they work,” a source said. They estimated fixing the SB1310 bug would take roughly 2,000 additional programming hours.40 hours a week times 52 weeks is 2080 hours.  Subtract a few weeks for vacations and holidays, and you get a little less that 2000 hours.  So, basically, this is a little more than one programmer-year of effort if the estimate is in the right ballpark.It&#39;s gross that the decision not to fix this carries an apparent implicit economic calculation that one programmer-year is more valuable than the freedom that is being denied to an unknown number of people whom society deems less important.  (Granted the actual situation is more complicated and the state is constrained by their contract with the vendor, which we can reasonably guess is going to charge as much as they can contractually get away with rather than the programmer&#39;s actual salary cost.)At least the Department of Corrections has assigned people to do the calculations manually.  That&#39;s better, but it sounds like they just don&#39;t have enough people on it to keep up."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow. I know firsthand from family how this can severely destroy someone&#39;s mental health in what may not be so obvious; it is extremely heavy on someone every moment past the first hour they go past their release time, then the first day followed by a variety of things that will then be taken advantage of by other inmate and guards while one&#39;s defenses are down.  The fun poked at by other jealous inmates and cruel guards constantly will also weigh down hard on another human being.  Arizona penal system puts you into almost always into very nasty and dangerous places of incarceration. frompdx made a statement that truly made my gut feel as if I was at the top of a roller coaster I did not want to get on in the first place."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I wanted to have compiled [1] financials, PriceWaterhouseCoopers told me to pick a recognized accounting system, then change the company&#39;s business processes to match that.   They said absolutely not to go the other way, to try to customize any software to match our business.I think about that every time I read about another government (or private!) company that wastes tens or hundreds of million of dollars (or euros or pounds) on custom software.It seems like there should be 1, 2, or 3 DMV programs.   The same for building codes, tax codes, etc.   And prison software.   You can be more like Massachusetts or Mississippi or Montana (hypothetical examples) but pick one and harmonize with it.1: compiled is the lowest of 3 standards that outside accountants can do; &#34;reviewed&#34; is higher and &#34;audited&#34; is the highest.  Even at the compiled level they mailed out postcards to a certain number of customers asking if they were customers over the past year and had spent this much money.   It was fairly easy for the acquiring company&#39;s outside accountants to review PWC&#39;s work and bring it up to audited standard."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s interesting, but strikes me as very unrealistic. I don&#39;t think it&#39;d go that way. In fact, it&#39;d be far more horrifying.We wouldn&#39;t bother trying to convince an image of a brain into cooperation, because we simply lose any need to do that very quickly.One of the very first things we&#39;d do with a simulated brain is to debug it. Execute it step by step, take lots of measures of all parameters, save/reload state, test every possible input and variation. And I&#39;m sure it wouldn&#39;t take long to start getting some sort of interesting result, first superficial then deeper and deeper.Cooperation would quickly become unnecessary because you either start from a cooperative state every time, or you quickly figure out how to tweak the brain state into cooperation.And that&#39;s when the truly freaky stuff starts. Using such a tool we could figure out many things about a brain&#39;s inner workings. How do we truly respond to advertising? How to produce maximum anger and maximum cooperation? How to best implant false memories? How to craft a convincing lie? What are the bugs and flaws in human perception? We could fuzz it and see if we can crash a brain.We&#39;ve already made some uncomfortable advancements, eg in how free to play games intentionally try to create addiction. With such a tool at our disposal we could fine tune strategies without having to guess. Eventually we&#39;d just know which bits of the brain we want to target and just have to find ways of getting the right things to percolate down the neural network until those bits are affected in the ways we want.Within a decade we&#39;d have a manual on how to craft the best propaganda, how to best create discord, or how to best destroy a human being by just talking to them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve often imagined what it would be like to have an executable brain scan of myself. Imagine scanning yourself right as you&#39;re feeling enthusiastic enough to work on any task for a few hours, and then spawning thousands of copies of yourself to all work on something together at once. And then after a few hours or maybe days, before any of yourselves meaningfully diverge in memories/goals/values, you delete the copies and then spawn another thousand fresh copies to resume their tasks. Obviously for this to work, you would have to be comfortable with the possibility of finding yourself as an upload and given a task by another version of yourself, and knowing that the next few hours of your memory would be lost. Erasing a copy that only diverged from the scan for a few hours would have more in common with blacking out from drinking and losing some memory than dying.The creative output you could accomplish from doing this would be huge. You would be able to get the output of thousands of people all sharing the exact same creative vision.I definitely wouldn&#39;t be comfortable with the idea of my brain scan being freely copied around for anyone to download and (ab)use as they wished though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A well-written story that inspires a sort of creeping, muted horror.For anyone like me who is confused by the relation of the title to the story, &#34;The title &#34;Lena&#34; refers to Swedish model Lena Forsén, who is pictured in the standard test image known as &#34;Lena&#34; or &#34;Lenna&#34; &lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenna&gt;.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As suggested by others the number of taxonomists, people who could accurately identify species (many of which require internal dissection, or molecular methods), who are actually working on collecting and identify species has most certainly declined.  In many groups of insects there is at most a handful of experts worldwide who can take specimens to a species-level identification.This is not to say that species richness is not declining, its to say that in the past 3-4 decades Taxonomists have done a poor (some would say terrible) job at describing to the broader world why they are important, and why they require fixed, institutionally-based funding to actually be able to provide the services that would allow us to confidently state that data like these are because of environmental change (again, they very likely are) rather than a lack of experts in the field actually doing basic research.In other words, it is extremely rare that universities (in the US) actually hire what was once known as &#34;alpha-taxonomists&#34;, in part this is a reflection of taxonomists inability to sell themselves and adapt to new tools (but note that many have evolved) in part it is a reflection of the (I would argue &#34;immense&#34;) short-sightedness of institutions. &#34;We want answers to complex questions!  We&#39;ve neglected to give scientists time to think deeply, and research over decades to answer those questions.  Oh, we see.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Last year I installed a beehive in our garden. Didn&#39;t take their honey, didn&#39;t treat them for Varroa. In the midst of winter I was sure they were all dead. Then a few days ago temperatures shot up to about 18°c and suddenly they were back, basking in the sunlight and buzzing around the hive. Made me so happy...Seriously, I&#39;ve come to understand that contrary to what most of us seem to believe, it&#39;s not about what we can do to minimize our negative impact, but rather what we can do to have a positive impact on our environment. Not just ecologically, but also socially and politically."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s the unsurprising outcome of our relentless poisoning of insects, which continues unabated today.Humans think about certain things as being infinite, until they aren&#39;t:forests are so big we could never impact themoceans are so big we could never impact themthe atmosphere is so big we could never impact itthe weather system is so big we could never impact itthere&#39;s so many insects we could never impact themetc etc"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not sure what a thinly resourced piece like this is doing so high up on HN. There’s really very little evidence that this has anything to do with racial slurs.From a quick read: last June, the channel was banned for “harmful and dangerous” content. The ban was removed in under 24 hours. YouTube has not confirmed the reason. And yet:&gt; Experts suspect that it was the usage of words like &#34;black&#34; and &#34;white&#34; that confused the Yutube&#39;s AI filters.Well, if experts said it, it just be true! The experiment they ran is speculative as best and the article just ran with it as absolute fact. If the filter was caused by use of “black” and “white” wouldn’t every chess channel fall victim to it? The filter isn’t new, why was it triggered once last June?A lot of questions raised and an article that has no interest in answering them. It’s credited to “Buzz Staff”… I think it’s always  suspect when no one wants to attach their name to something they wrote. A smell of clickbait running all the way through this one."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recently took some actions to reduce the damage if Google ever ban my account.I&#39;m now using a custom email domain (although it&#39;s just redirecting to my Gmail for now), and doing regular backups of my emails (through Thurderbird) and Google Drive.With these news being more and more common, you never know when it&#39;ll happen to you."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What is amazing is how there is no way to recover from all these algorithmic banning. I&#39;m getting banned on Twitter every other day from following anyone because I follow a lot of academics. It&#39;s all legitimate but algos detected some pattern and I&#39;m now toast. Twitter provides exactly zero ways to report this or fix this. They simply don&#39;t care if some monority users suffer. We see same things when Google disables account and you get locked out from your electronic life.I used to think working with governments is very hard. Getting support in places like DMVs and passport renewals is super hard. But never thought so futuristic tech world will be so much more arcane and worse than even the governments."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This may sound silly, but: The closest I&#39;ve coming to building a &#34;robot&#34; was a simple little arduino kit. The kit was terrible, the parts defective, and you can imagine I was pretty sick of troubleshooting it after a time. These are things happening on my workbench with a small amount of automation code. I&#39;d have been thrilled if it had just worked as designed.Now, take three robots. One is wheeled, one flies by rotors, and another is rocket powered. Put them on a rocket, fly to another planet, and land them autonomously without wrecking anything. As a hobbyist I&#39;d be beyond myself to just do ONE of those. On Earth. Let alone millions of miles away on a distant planet.And to get video of it just days later, bounced across multiple orbiters? Mind blowing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As it got closer to the ground, it seemed really hard to get a sense of scale with that downward camera.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Barriers to entry are invisible. They are invisible to people on the inside and most frequently invisible to people who have a hand in creating those barriers.I once had a conversation with a founder about their signup flow. This founder had aspirations to be a global player. They said that step 2 of their flow included entering a credit card number. I had to stop them. &#34;What about people who don&#39;t use credit cards?&#34; They were nonplussed. &#34;You know, China, much of Africa ...&#34; they had never actually thought about whether people had credit cards because every single person they interacted with had one.Back to languages. If you&#39;ve never taught an introduction to computer programming for a general audience you are blind to what does and does not matter about a language. You look at things like `foo.bar()` and think &#34;Yeah that&#39;s a simple method invocation&#34; and have no idea how many people you just lost.Never underestimate how much ease of use matters. We, as a community, have selected for decades against people who care about language ergonomics because they get hit in the face with a wall of punctuation filled text and turn away. We fight over where braces belong while not realizing how many hundreds of thousands of people we&#39;ve excluded.Ease of use is the most important part of a language. It&#39;s just that the barriers to entry are invisible and so the people who happen to be well suited to vim vs emacs debates get to talk while the vast majority of potential programmers are left on the outside.We create barriers to entry accidentally because we design for people like us. To us the barriers are invisible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Going by their first example, the fact that I couldn&#39;t write   list.delete(value)

without realizing it involves a linear search is considered one of the benefits of Go.That said, I agree Go could use a bit for ergonomic and handy methods, while still remaining efficient.The example on Concurrency also has a different answer. Go gives you all the tools, but there are many different ways their problem can be solved. By explicitly avoiding a &#34;join&#34; method and having any default &#39;channels&#39;, Go makes all these possible. What is missing is some of the popular patterns that emerged in the last few years need to make it to into stdlib or some cookbooks.1. If you want a worker model, I would start n=3 go-routines and they all receive from a single channel. They don&#39;t need to much around with a channel of buffer 3, as in the example.2. If the workers already return data from a compute, the read from driver serves as the wait.3. In other cases, there is sync.Waitgroup available to synchronize completion status.4. End of work from the driver can be indicated via a channel close. Closed channels can still be read from until they are empty and the reader can even detect end-of-channel.Designing concurrent system is a bit complicated. Some tutorials do make it sound like a `go` keyword is all you need. All of these can fixed by improving std-lib or cookbooks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"But no one said Go was easy. It&#39;s just simple and easy to reason about. There&#39;s a huge benefit to something doing exactly what it says. No hidden behaviours, no overly complex syntax, nothing like that.I came from C# where I have gotten increasingly frustrated with the amount of additions to the language. Like we now have classes, structs and records. We now have async/await but we also have channels. This is what having a huge toolbox causes. Some people are going to write code using channels, me others will use async. Some people will use features that others don&#39;t care about.I think there&#39;s huge benefit in a simple language. In Go I know that there&#39;s only 2 ways to do concurrency. You either use go routines and mutexes or you use go routines and channels.Generics will bring a lot of helper functions that weren&#39;t possible before which will remove a lot of repetitive code.But otherwise I am super happy with writing Go code. All my pet peeves of something like modern Java or C# are gone."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Tree Sitter is amazing. The parsing is fast enough to run on every keystroke. The parse tree is extremely concise and readable. It resembles an AST more than a parse tree (ie no 11 levels of binary op precedence rules in the tree). The parse tree emits specific ERROR nodes, so you can get a semi-functional tree even with broken syntax.I can&#39;t wait for the tools to get built with this. Paredit for TypeScript. Syntax-tree based highlighting (vs regex highlighting). A command to &#34;add an arg to current function&#34; which works across languages. A command to add a CSS class to the nearest JSX node, or to walk up the tree at the className=&#34;| ...&#34; position, adding a new className if it doesn&#39;t exist.There&#39;s a nicely documented Emacs package for this [1]. The documentation is at [2]. The parse trees work great. There&#39;s syntax highlighting support and tree-walking APIs. There&#39;s a bit of confusion about TSX vs typescript langs but it&#39;s fixable with some config change [3].[1]: https://github.com/ubolonton/emacs-tree-sitter

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m an engineer on the code intelligence team at Sourcegraph.We&#39;ve been busy building out true precise code intelligence/navigation support, but we also have a mode for zero-configuration code navigation based on text search, universal-ctags, and hand-rolled regular expressions (which works surprisingly well!). Tree-sitter would definitely give better results than our current ctags-based approach. It&#39;s been catching our attention more and more lately, and we have plans to use it to upgrade our out-of-the-box, instant code navigation experience.It&#39;s not the exact right fit for our primary goals though, since it&#39;s designed around being extremely fast while editing and robust against errors. Sourcegraph is only used for navigating committed code, so we&#39;re leveraging formats like LSIF to generate complete semantic graphs of codebases and their entire dependency tree. That&#39;ll enable a lot of features that are out of reach for tree-sitter, but is a lot harder to get working out of the box and it&#39;s a much bigger technical investment.It&#39;s very interesting to see the topological space that houses these solutions fill out. Every tool has its own set of unique trade-offs and fall somewhere on these spectrums:- fast vs slow- precise vs imprecise- zero-configuration vs configuration requiredWe&#39;ve visited a few islands in this space but still very curious to see what other islands can be discovered. We&#39;re especially excited about tools and formats like tree-sitter and LSIF around which a large and supportive community can grow so that all the products we love and rely on as developers can all make forward progress."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I tried to use this to ease the front end work load of students in a compiler project (building a C compiler) for a University course, so that the project could be focused on the more interesting middle and back end parts of the compiler.
However, reported bugs in the C grammar that saw no activity at all [1] made this impossible. From this small sample of experiences, I was left with the impression that Tree Sitter is great for things like syntax highlighting, where wrong results are annoying but not dramatic, but not so suitable for tools that need a really correct syntax tree.---

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I worked on a startup that received seed funding to tackle this. I helped build the platform (using Twilio video) and then answered the first $5000 of calls. Things I learned:- Many entry level programmers at big companies (think Walmart Labs, Target, Goldman Sachs, etc) are too scared to ask managers/team for help. If you work for a large company, make sure new hires feel safe asking questions and seeking help or they will seek it elsewhere.- The really hard questions they&#39;re willing to pay $240 an hour for have too much context for you to grasp. They want you to replace their ORM layer or tell them why their 600 line test case is not working.- Getting customers is not too hard by poaching them from Stack Overflow, Reddit, CodeMentor.- Developers make good money working full time and idly sitting at their desk part of that time. Here you only get paid for active time and the idle time in-between will kill your salary.

Perhaps for students or devs who barely meet the 100 rep minimum requirement, that might be attractive, but for the experts who&#39;ve written the best Stack Overflow answers, that&#39;s likely to be a (small) fraction of their bill rate.Free contribution is rewarding as a means of helping.Well-paid contribution is rewarding for the $$$.Poorly paid contribution often loses both incentives."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d guess that the people at Stack Overflow might have an issue with someone using their name in this way. It should probably be clearer that this is entirely unaffiliated.100+ reputation on SO is also a ridiculously low bar, it&#39;s almost meaningless. Not that any amount of reputation by itself is a sure indicator, but 100 really doesn&#39;t mean anything at all.This kind of site also requires a pretty large critical mass to work, you don&#39;t just want a bunch of random SO users willing to participate, but you need the right users with experience in the right tags to match to the requests in a reasonable timeframe.There&#39;s a good reason Stack Overflow doesn&#39;t allow people to pay for answers, people already cheat enough for meaningless internet points, this will get much worse with real money on the line."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"With interest rates so low (and lots of headwinds for them to increase in the short-term), one has to think that this will be the new normal for a few years at least. The rise of SPACs is another sign - they are disrupting both later-stage VC funds as well as obviously vanilla IPOs.I wonder if the abundance of capital is not evenly distributed through the startup lifecycle, but more heavily-weighted towards later stages.Anecdotally, I&#39;ve heard from founders that SEED rounds are getting harder despite all the frothiness. Even back when we did our seed rounds ~2015, we already heard &#34;today&#39;s seed round is yesterday&#39;s Series A&#34; in terms of $ size but also minimum bar of progress. And these days it seems that is EVEN MORE true. It&#39;s also true it&#39;s easier to start a SaaS company than ever before. But it&#39;s ALSO ALSO true that there is less and less SaaS greenspace. Hmmmm."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I agree, at present, capital is abundant. That is, at the moment:  Σ(capital available) &gt; Σ(investment opportunities)

And this imbalance of demand for and supply of investment opportunities is showing up everywhere as... asset price inflation.You can see it in rising angel valuations, rising early-stage VC valuations, rising later-stage VC valuations, rising growth-equity valuations, rising leveraged buyout valuations, rising stock market valuations, rising cryptocurrency prices, rising home prices, etc. Feeding frenzies and bidding wars for high quality assets have become more and more common. Asset prices keep going up and up and up...The multi-trillion-dollar question:Is this sustainable?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is it really that much easier for a &#34;typical&#34; startup to raise money now than before? And by typical, I mean a non-Silicon Valley based startup with founders that no one has heard of before and that do not have good connections with VCs operating in a mediocre market with a decent, but not ground-breaking offering. Not a hype-driven, silicon-valley based startup in a &#34;hot&#34; market led by superstar founders or founders with deep networks?It would seem that all this &#34;easy money&#34; is simply flowing to the places where it has always flowed before, but in larger quantities. The same big money chasing a small number of deals, just with deeper pockets and more gusto to participate in an auction if need be.Honestly, has it really gotten any easier for the typical startup?"</p>
