It’s where I:* first learned about CRDTs, kickstarting an interest in distributed systems* first learned about TLA+, kickstarting an interest in formal specification* first saw the book Quantum Computing Since Democritus recommended (in a post about Professor Sussman’s reading list), kickstarting an interest in quantum computing* first learned about the LEAN theorem prover, kickstarting an interest in machine-checked proofs of correctness for mathematical theorems* first learned about tree-sitter, leading me to write a tree-sitter grammar for TLA+All of these (well, except quantum computing really - that remains a pleasant side-hobby although I did work in Microsoft’s quantum program for a bit) are now things I use in the contracts I work on as an independent software engineering consultant, and the open source work I do in between. TLA+ especially has had an enormous impact. Five good posts over the course of ten years is still a pretty good signal/noise ratio!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; “You can’t exercise your way out of obesity,” […] “you can’t outrun a bad diet.”While this article is being a bit dramatic and possibly understating the impact of exercise slightly, I feel a little dumb that I didn’t know this earlier. It took me several decades too long to understand the obvious, that exercise is for building strength, and losing weight happens by eating less. I tried for way too many years to exercise my fat off, and it never really worked because I’d unconsciously eat to compensate. Once I tracked what I ate, exercise actually became more effective.A lot of people know this already, so it’s not busting everyone’s myths, but we also do have a strange narrative surrounding exercise and weight loss that I bought into. It makes me wonder if we’re physiologically wired to be allergic to the idea of less food, from an evolutionary perspective, because being hungry is literally risking death to our alligator brains."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Irony.A linked article describing a scientist trying to rigorously find out how weight changes and energy expenditure and diet are connected, revealing the little we do know and the vast sea of what we do not know.The discussion here: full of anecdotes and bro science berating one another &#34;that&#39;s not how it works, it works like this&#34;, &#34;I personally do this-and-that&#34;, &#34;you just have to x-y-z, it&#39;s that simple&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The conclusion is almost certainly wrong:1. From a simple sniff test, if this were true, then athletes wouldn&#39;t need a lot of calories. This obviously isn&#39;t true, eg Phelps eats 8-11K calories a day. I personally eat around 3.5K calories a day. If exercise didn&#39;t impact caloric burn I assure you I&#39;d be a lot fatter...2. The only plausible mechanisms for why exercise wouldn&#39;t result in more overall caloric burn is that less energy is expended in non exercising states, eg the body is trying to conserve energy and either reduces metabolism or reduces fidgeting, walking, etc. This often happens to people trying extreme calorie loss diets.The implication of this is that somehow the sedentary lifestyle of your average couch potato is the &#34;normal&#34; lifestyle for a body, and the lifestyle of a hunter gatherer is &#34;overactive&#34;, and their bodies are chronically tired and trying to reduce their metabolisms. That... seems quite unlikely.3. Finally, this blog post dives into some methodological issues: https://darrendahly.github.io/post/2012-08-31-hunter-gathere...EDIT: Increased metabolism due to muscle mass is not as big an effect as you’d think: https://www.unm.edu/~lkravitz/Article%20folder/metabolismcon..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The underlying case looks to be a pretty straight developing country &#34;referral fees&#34; / kickback type case.One issue is how long these cases take to resolve. This was a whistleblower blowing the whistle.Basic deal was Watson (who ran Northstar) a property developer signed a deal to kick back referral fees to an entity that did literally no work (Villanova Trust) created by a brother of the two amazon employees (Nelson and Kirschner) who were the transaction managers for 9 data center lease deals. The kickback deal was signed after these two Amazon employees met with Watson (the Vendor).Amazon then did $400M in deals with Watson, who then kicked back $5M to the trust in &#34;commissions&#34;. Then amazon discovered deleted files indicating the employees were entitled to &#34;shares&#34; in these projects from Watson of something like an additional $16M.Others in the mix at developer also did some kind of land flip thing. One example was property that they bought for $20M, then sold to Amazon for $116M. In one case there was something like a $20M increase in price on property that was sold to Amazon the day that it was bought?! So they were frontrunning things. Watson was pissed, and wanted a cut, so recorded a meeting with the folks doing the flip scam. But that backfired because the folks doing the flip scam knew about the leasing scam and said, hey, if you don&#39;t back off we&#39;ll blow lid on your lease scam - claiming &#34;that&#39;s FBI&#34;. They did end up compromising on kicking back $5M to Watson from the flip scam.Anyways, all allegations, and thousands of pages so I&#39;ve no doubt got some parts wrong, but it makes for interesting reading!My question - it seems to take a long time to get these white color criminal types into jail.In the linked post, there is a lot of complaining that the FBI messed up the guys career, but man, this court case - why would you hire a guy like this into a position of trust?Note these allegations are contested. “My only hope in defending myself against its false allegations is that the process will be fair and impartial.” Mr. Nelson said per a WSJ article."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What a weird story. I have limited, tangential experience with getting the FBI involved with crimes of an employee. In our case, they were not in a rush to make any moves against the person until they had an airtight case with indisputable evidence. Honestly felt strange given how obvious the crime was during the investigation.Although in this case the seized funds were apparently returned. I have a feeling a lot of crucial details have been left out of this piece (EDIT: See links below to the investigation details. There are multiple parties involved and some of they were keenly aware that they were breaking laws that were &#34;FBI-type stuff&#34;). The devil’s advocate take on this outcome would be that the person cooperated with the FBI to provide evidence and/or testify against bigger fish in the case in exchange for being let off the hook. If this was the case, we’d probably see some headlines about an Amazon-related criminal charges in the coming months or years. Although in our case the released documents were full of “Company 1” and “Individual 2” anonymity, so someone (usually a journalist) would have to figure out the connection.Or maybe this really was some big misunderstanding with disastrous consequences to the family. Impossible to know from an article from this perspective.EDIT: There&#39;s a more in-depth review of the case here: https://www.geekwire.com/2021/former-aws-real-estate-manager...From the summary, it does appear that multiple people are involved in the case and the person in this article (Nelson) doesn&#39;t look like the key player in the alleged frauds, though he would have played a significant role in facilitating the accusations. There&#39;s definitely some shady business going on, but this guy could have been more of a pawn than active player.One of the text messages from transcripts is notable (Note &#34;Nelson&#34; is the accused person in the Medium article):&gt; “Flip me a couple buildings … and let me really line your pockets like we were discussing!  ” Ramstetter wrote in a Dec. 17, 2018 message to Nelson, according to a copy of the exchange Amazon filed with the court.The transcript in that article is also enlightening, because it&#39;s literally a conversation between two of the partners who acknowledge that what they&#39;re doing is &#34;federal, FBI-type stuff&#34; and express concern over it. If you ever get a message like that from someone proposing to &#34;line your pockets&#34; in exchange for facilitating deals with your employer, maybe don&#39;t work with that person any more."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Terrible story. Civil forfeiture seems utterly incompatible with any notion of a just society. It&#39;s like democracy just gave up and regressed to feudalism.Even _if_ the author had turned out to be 100% guilty of whatever Amazon accused them of - this form of civil forfeiture is still punishment without trial and not in line with the sixth amendment.In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"sigh. My team is facing all these issues. Drowning in data. Crazy S3 bill spikes. And not just S3 - Azure, GCP, Alibaba, etc since we are a multi-cloud product.Earlier, we couldn&#39;t even figure out lifecycle policies to expire objects since naturally every PM had a different opinion on the data lifecycle. So it was old-fashioned cleanup jobs that were scheduled and triggered when a byzantine set of conditions were met. Sometimes they were never met - cue bill spike.Thankfully, all the new data privacy &amp; protection regulations are a life-saver. Now, we can blindly delete all associated data when a customer off-boards or trial expires or when data is no longer used for original purpose. Just tell the intransigent PM&#39;s that we are strictly following govt regulations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have caused billing spikes like this before those little warnings were invented and it was always a dark day.  They are really a life saver.Lifecycle rules are also welcome.  Writing them yourself was always a pain and tended to be expensive with list operations eating up that api calls bill.----Once I supported an app that dumped small objects into s3 and begged the dev team to store the small objects in oracle as BLOBS to be concatenated into normal-sized s3 bjects after a reasonable timeout where no new small objects would reasonably be created.  They refused (of course) and the bills for managing a bucket with millions and millions of tiny objects were just what you expect.I then went for a compromise solution asking if we could stitch the small objects together after a period of time so they would be eligible for things like infrequent access or glacier but, alas, &#34;dev time is expensive you know&#34; so N figure s3 bills continue as far as I know."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The AWS horror stories never cease to amaze me. It&#39;s like we&#39;re banging our heads against the wall expecting a different outcome each time. What&#39;s more frustrating, the AWS zealots are quite happy to tell you how you&#39;re doing it wrong. It&#39;s the users fault for misusing the service. The reality is, AWS was built for a specific purpose and demographic of user. It&#39;s now complexity and scale makes it unusable for newer devs. I&#39;d argue, we need a completely new experience for the next generation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A couple of years ago, I was attacked by a Kiwi bot near a UC campus. This is my story.The bot and I were moving towards each other on a sidewalk, and when I came close it stopped, as they do when sensing an object in front of them. But there was an awkward moment as I tried to go around it and it repeatedly jerked forward an inch as its motor kicked on and off. Maybe I was walking around the very edge of its radius. In any case, my behavior must have triggered some pathfinding bug, because it turned and drove right into my legs, after which it stopped and sat stationary. Luckily they&#39;re small and move slowly so it wasn&#39;t a big deal, but that memory stuck with me. Articles about Tesla pathfinding issues always bring it back to the surface."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We were walking past one of these robots whose wheel got stuck halfway off the curb, so it was completely stuck. My friend helped it back up, and it had a prerecorded voice say “thank you for helping me!” It was unexpected and delightful to be thanked by a robot, we make sure to help any we see that are in distress, even though we know they’re owned by a private company with profits in mind."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked for this specific company, a couple years ago, as a robot handler and operator.In situations like this it is possible for an operator to manually organize the robots.Before I left we were making great strides to allow 1 operator to be able to keep tabs on up to 5 robots at a time in certain neighborhoods.Campuses, which are fully and thoroughly mapped, can probably have 1, maybe 2 operators at a time.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"On the question of &#34;why 12 notes&#34;, I STRONGLY recommend this video by David Bennett:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvmzgVtZtUQThere&#39;s a really important step missing in the article which has been aluded to by a couple of comments already. It&#39;s the step between:   1. a series of notes defined by the harmonic series, that is, exact integer multiples (or ratios, if you prefer) of a base frequency, a physical phenomena found in nature

and   2. the well-tempered scales used by most western music, which adjusts the ratios to allow certain compositional &#34;tricks&#34; to be used without sounding dissonant.

The set of notes defined by (1) are typically referred to as &#34;Just Intonation&#34;, and was the basis for most western music (and some non-western music) until somewhere between about 1400 and 1600 (lots of room for discussion/debate there).The &#34;problem&#34; with just intonation, if indeed it is a problem, is that if you define two series of notes (call them a scale, if you like) using these integer ratios but starting from two different notes, you will trivially find cases where &#34;the next higher E&#34; is a different frequency. So starting from (say) A and moving by integer ratios gets you to a different (say) F than if you start from (say) B.This means that if you are writing in a just intonation scale with (say) A as the root, you have a set of notes that are not actually the same frequencies as if your scale started on (say) B.By itself, this is not a problem at all - there is all kinds of lovely music written through history that works just fine with notes and scales defined this way. You just stay in the same scale throughout, and there are no issues. There are even some scale changes you can make that still work, you just have to know what they are (and they depend on the root note and the set of integer ratios you&#39;re using, so it gets complicated).But ... somewhere in the period mentioned above, a subset of western musical culture started to want to experiment with &#34;modulation&#34; - changing from one scale to another in the midst of piece. On continuous pitch instruments (e.g. violin, voice), this is entirely possible to do, since they can play any frequency in their range at all. However, it does require significant skill on the part of the performer, since the pitch of a (say) &#34;F&#34; will differ depending on the scale currently in use in the piece.The breaking point, such as it was, came with the development of fixed pitch instruments (keyboards). These can only play the notes they are currently tuned to, and so if the (say) F in two scales is a different frequency, you cannot play in both scales without retuning - an obvious impossibility in the middle of a piece.So, &#34;well-tempered&#34; tuning was developed - the ratios described in TFA. These are tweaked by relatively small amounts so that the notes are close to where Just Intonation (integer ratios) would have placed them, but not precisely the same. These small shifts mean that the (say) &#34;F&#34; is the same frequency whether your scale began on (say) A or B. You can now play a fixed-tuning instrument like a harpsichord or a piano, change from one scale to another, and everything remains &#34;in tune&#34;.Of course, to ears used to Just Intonation, &#34;well-tempered&#34; tuning sounds out of tune. But in the west, most people (even within our musical academies) have grown up used to the sound of well-tempered tuning, and it is Just Intonation that sounds &#34;off&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really don&#39;t understand all the hate in the comments for this article. This seems like a really fine introduction to a lot of the concepts. I had to scour the web a long time before understanding that the scales were constructed because of the simple/reduced ratio of root note to the others, which is clearly spelled out in this article.Music theory is, in my experience, typically taught as a list of facts to remember. Deriving it from first principles, insofar as it can be, is not common. This article is attempting to start that process.Some commentators are saying that the article doesn&#39;t address why we have 12 notes but I wonder if they even know why (one answer is because it&#39;s a good compromise between number of notes and that have simple/reduce ratios to each other [0]). I&#39;m also skeptical of music theorists that can&#39;t even attempt an answer to basic questions about note length frequency, why some chords are &#34;sad&#34; or &#34;happy&#34; and other basic questions. It&#39;s difficult because music theory is a hodge podge of theory that&#39;s attempting to describe what&#39;s effectively an evolved language (with different music evolution for different regions), but there are some basic tenets that probably apply.I don&#39;t claim to have deep knowledge but there are a few key facts about music and music theory that are really obscure unless you know where to look. Any attempt at coming to music theory from a more rigorous foundation should be encouraged.[0]  &#34;Measures of Consonances in a Goodness-of-fit Model for Equal-tempered Scales&#34; by Aline Honigh (https://github.com/abetusk/papers/blob/release/Music/measure...)EDIT: corrected spelling (thanks for the comments pointing it out)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Music was taught as part of the quadrivium (alongside arithmetic, geometry, and astronomy), so it has a long history of being thought about in mathematical terms. There&#39;s nothing wrong with looking at music that way. What is so interesting about music is its ability to turn mathematical beauty into aesthetic, artistic beauty.Sometimes the math is just there in the background: &#34;This chord progression is based on certain physical facts related to the harmonic series. That makes it sound good, and I like it&#34;. Sometimes it is brought to the forefront: &#34;All of this music appears to be generated from a short pattern of notes which is recognizable even as it is subjected to rotations, elongations, truncations, etc. That is beautiful.&#34;Certain types of music play up the lovely-pattern-ness of music, and some don&#39;t. Neither is better than the other (denigrate the art of Justin Bieber who dare), but you can probably guess which I prefer :)Consciousness, pattern-recognition, spatial rotation of abstract objects, natural mathematical beauty, poetry, drama, acting/performance, nonverbal collaboration, shared rhythm: music is a nexus for all of these things.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One egregiously loud motorcycle rolling through manhattan can be a nuisance to literally millions of people. This is unreasonable and a ticketing system like this makes a ton of sense.Police enforcement could probably solve the issue just as effectively.  Cops ignore loud honking and loud cars when its right in front of them.  If they would just stop ignoring such things the frequency would surely go down as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good. I look forward to this enforcement in my city. I currently live against a major road. During the night, the traffic noise isn’t disturbing, except for about one vehicle in a thousand. And that motorcycle wakes me at 3am. For weeks on end. My neighbor’s kid’s motorcycle. On his way to work at 3am, has to gun it when turning out of the neighborhood, waking everyone. These are neighbors who had shot their next door neighbor’s cat, so unlikely to adapt their actions based upon my request. I’d happily pay for this device for my town. And yes, I’ve investigated soundproofing my bedroom. Quote was around $16k. Multiply that by the dozens of neighbors he wakes each night, and he forces everyone else to bare hundreds of thousands of dollars in upgrades so he can make noise at 3am. As much as I don’t want to step on anyone’s “freedoms”, noise sucks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Tangent: We should outlaw leaf blowers in cities while at it. It&#39;s february and freezing out and for some reason the idiotic management in the apartment across the street has contracted some crew to do daily leaf blowers on nearly completely clean sidewalks disturbing probably hundreds of people WFH. Not to even mention how particularly awful leaf blowers are for the environment."</p>
