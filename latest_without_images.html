								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Congrats!Just a heads up, as a semi-happy webflow customer: your customer service chat bot / the way you hide methods to contact customer service is very frustrating. The first time I ran into a technical issue I almost considered just cancelling my account and moving elsewhere because I couldn&#39;t figure out how to speak/chat with a human. There are many services I spend less money on monthly that have infinitely better customer service. Ultimately a friend provided me with your support email and I got a response there, but was shocked that wasn&#39;t listed anywhere on your website that I could easily find.."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is indeed incredible.When I read such posts I have so many different feelings mixed up.1. I&#39;m envious, I won&#39;t hide this :)2. I think that I shouldn&#39;t give up with my own product3. I think that I don&#39;t work hard enough4. I feel pleasure, I&#39;m glad that it was success for you. Yep, I don&#39;t only envy but also can be happy for someone5. Your name is Vlad, are you by the way from Russia? If so, Поздравляю от всей души! =)These posts should be in golden collection.Especially if someone says: &#34;Hey, who needs another tool like this?&#34; and you show him posts from dropbox, webflow and others"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"After spending 7+ years in the static site generator world, I recently started using Webflow exclusively for all marketing sites and landing pages and have been blown away with how much better it is than dealing with the complexities of the Static site + Headless CMS ecosystem. It seems you&#39;ve actually delivered on the vision that dreamweaver was originally trying to create all those years ago.I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if one day Webflow&#39;s market share on the Web gets to be Wordpress-sized.With the recent funding raised, I&#39;d love to hear what your vision is for the next 5 years of Webflow as a product?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I left dropbox when they changed the full page upsell to &#34;dropbox business&#34; so that I couldn&#39;t easily figure out how to skip it and get on with my work.I had a paid pro account at the time.I actually had a conversation with a product manager; I checked the yes you can contact me  when I cancelled my account.  They simply refused to admit that an upsell was a advertisement and that disrupting my workflow on my paid, professional account for an ad was wrong.The other interesting thing about that conversation, they could not understand how a sole proprietor would see no benefit from collaboration tools and kept making up bizarre scenarios where I could use them.I actually asked them if they were a product manager or a salesperson at one point.To Dropbox&#39;s credit,  that product manager didn&#39;t try to retain me,  they were genuinely trying to figure out why I had quit; they just couldn&#39;t grok the reason."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was told a story about the Dropbox sales team a while back that swore me off using them. They contacted the company I worked at, that didn&#39;t have a business contract with Dropbox, offering a great deal and a meeting was quickly arranged. The meeting (which I only heard about secondhand from a good friend) quickly turned into a strong-arm operation.Dropbox had &#39;detected&#39; that employees at our company were using Dropbox and it would be unfortunate if their stored files were no longer available and it would be in our best interest to sign up for a business account or we might legally be in breach of some terms of service. Some detective work later it was determined that people had been signed in to Dropbox from company machines, but there were no accounts opened with a company email and nothing business related was being synced. All Dropbox binaries and network connections have been blocked since."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really wish mobile OSes would allow you to grant apps permissions but serve fake data, (that&#39;s important!) without giving the app the ability to tell the difference. Just so it appears to the app that you&#39;ve given the permission, when you in fact have not. This would solve this entire class of problems and then some. So, for example:- App &#34;has&#34; access to contacts, but the system returns that you have none.- App &#34;has&#34; access to location, but the search for GPS satellites never completes.- App &#34;has&#34; access to storage, but it&#39;s actually /dev/null."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This seems to be a global phenomenon.https://rbej.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12958-020-0...Possible toxicity of something that we deem safe could be an explanation.A side comment. I am 42. When I was younger, in the late 90s, getting into physical fight was much more common than today. These days even drunk young guys seem to be content with hurling a few insults. (For record, I am a peaceful person and the possibility of getting beaten up for no good reason was something I definitely did not look forward to during my old pub crawls.)I wonder if this is actually a manifestation of population-wide testosterone drop."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The study states the majority of the effect is for fairly predictable causes like age and obesity, but I found this interesting:&gt; After controlling for confounders—including year of study, age, race, BMI, comorbidity status, alcohol and smoking use, and level of physical activity—total testosterone was lower among men in the later (2011-2016) versus earlier (1999-2000) cycles (P &lt; 0.001)Excluding all those confounders, there&#39;s not much we&#39;re left with. Environmental toxins?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If due to environmental toxins (say, hormonally active “forever chemicals,” plastics, etc), my guess is you’d see the deleterious effects first in women. Women also make (and need) testosterone, just at much lower levels than men, so they have much less to lose. There’s research going back 30 years on the efficacy of low dose TRT in women to treat all kinds of things that tend to hit women in their late thirties on (when natural testosterone has been declining for 15-20 years); I’m on mobile now, but what I recall most from a review paper was the efficacy in treating fibromyalgia pain. The lack of continued research on this seems to be almost entirely due to social pressure. (People lose their minds when you talk about women and testosterone, or men and estrogen.)It’s hard not to wonder if environmental toxins affecting the testosterone levels of men are also contributing to the rise of health issues in women, especially autoimmune conditions, fibromyalgia/CFS, obesity, depression, etc.In other words, women might be the canaries in the coal mine for systemic problems arising from environmental endocrine disruptors."</p>

Most are very lightly used items that were returned, and in some cases it&#39;s just that the packaging was damaged. If you&#39;re ok with this, it&#39;s not uncommon to find items with over 50% discounts. In the few cases where I got a bad item, returning it was a breeze.  My main complaint has been that the items are very hard to browse, so I decided to make my own website for this.The website is www.dealforager.com"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"An aggregator ala reddit/hackernews/twitter that uses a market mechanism to better incentivise content discovery.One of the biggest issues with existing aggregators is that:- how well content performs is dependant on the attention it gets immediately after posting.- However, readers aren’t incentivised to sift carefully through new content, which is generally of lower quality than &#34;frontpage&#34; content- This means that how content performs is a lottery. Great content is often missed just by chance- This in turn means that there’s no platform that encourages unknown authors to create high-effort, thoughtful pieces. Instead it’s far more effective to blogspam.I&#39;m working on a platform that uses something similar to a prediction/stock market to incentivise people to search for high-quality content. Instead of upvoting, you effectively buy shares in new content, which you can then sell at a later point for a profit if the content proves popular. Equally you can buy &#34;downvote shares&#34;, which act like a short and help dampen rampant speculation.It’s early days still, but I’m hoping this could be a great way to encourage higher quality content creation.Draft paper here:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/15Hc6wAXlfl8x5C0w11m7ZOEpbjj...EDIT:Since this is a getting a bit of traction, if you&#39;re interested in testing it out when I&#39;ve got a prototype, I&#39;ve created a mailing list herehttps://forms.gle/EEMhkJRSUUAbwDgX6I think initial community is critical for getting these sorts of things right, so would definitely appreciate having some HN folks to test with."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ll believe it when I see it.  I could believe them getting rid of the touchbar, but bringing back magsafe?  I&#39;m sticking with my 2015 MacBook until it&#39;s irreparable, and I do like the magsafe port, but is there really any point in going back after moving to USB-C?  I think I just like magsafe because it&#39;s cool more than that it actually has some sort of superiority over USB-C.  I&#39;ve tripped over the USB-C cable to my work laptop(2018 model) a handful of times and somehow the cable always manages to unplug without flinging the laptop across the room or damaging the USB components themselves.  It doesn&#39;t seem like going back to magsafe would achieve anything."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know it&#39;s from Kuo, but these leaks don&#39;t pass the smell test for me. It makes no sense for them to add the touchbar to the base model 13&#34; MBPs only to remove them from the higher end versions. It makes even less sense to add more ports which aren&#39;t USB-C, as the bits about MagSafe and no dongles imply. Further, I don&#39;t understand what is meant by &#34;iPhone 12 like&#34; non-curvy design - I have a 2018 MBP 15&#34;, and the sides of this thing are pretty flat and not curved.I mean, these features sound like a dream come true, but I&#39;m having a hard time believing them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If anyone from Apple is reading, let me just say – this is exactly what I want. Magsafe charging. Function keys instead of the touchbar. 15-16&#34; screen. M1 CPU. 32GB Memory.I also prefer the 2015 keyboard, but it&#39;s not a dealbreaker.I&#39;ll pay for the kickstarter now if it means it&#39;ll come out in the next 18 months. Please make it happen."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been switched to DDG for about 4 months now. I am loving the Ads I get in youtube now that google doesn&#39;t know what I am interested in they have noting to do with anything I care about. It&#39;s wonderful. DDG still has a way to go for really technical queries. I just can&#39;t get the same results about this error or that in Java. Until then I&#39;m 100% DDG for personal and 100% google for work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve used DDG full-time for over two years now. I honestly don&#39;t miss Google.Every time I use !g I&#39;m reminded just how bad it&#39;s gotten. Between the SEO spam and ads I find myself scrolling at least halfway down the page to find anything even remotely relevant. I can&#39;t say that DDG always has the &#39;best&#39; results, but at least they seem appropriate to what I&#39;m searching for.One thing I do wish DDG has is webmaster tools. I know they don&#39;t do their own indexing, but it would be nice to have a way to get performance &amp; keyword data the way Google/Bing/Yandex etc present it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"After a few failed attempts to migrate from Google as my default search engine due to poor results, a couple of months ago, I decided to give DDG another try. Been using daily since, I don&#39;t even remember what Google is. Not sure if the service did improve that much or what, but I&#39;m glad I could move on. Youtube, you are next."</p>

Since the distro does not provide it for Debian 10, users of that version can download libfaudio0 packages from the OBS.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s also important to realize that the backup includes your encrypted iMessage messages, and the key required to decrypt them. Meaning that if you have backups enabled, all the &#34;end-to-end&#34; encryption in iMessage is defeated. Apple and by extension the FBI can read your messages. This is documented by Apple here: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202303Even if you disable backups, whenever you correspond with someone that has backups enabled those messages are still accessible to Apple."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Since user encrypted iCloud backups would prevent password recovery to access your data I&#39;m more inclined to believe the decision was made out of convenience for the end user.General public would hate it when the support won&#39;t help them recover family photos which are still stored in the cloud. Full encryption is nice to have, but overwhelming majority of users won&#39;t get any tangible benefits from that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It looks like the main &#34;about backups&#34; page [1] on Apple Support misleads about this issue:&gt; iCloud backups include nearly all data and settings stored on your device. iCloud backups don&#39;t include:&gt; Data that&#39;s already stored in iCloud... iMessages... Health dataOnly the more technical &#34;about encryption&#34; page [2] that most users wouldn&#39;t seek out contains the full story, providing a list of regular encryption vs. E2EE services and admitting the key issue:&gt; Messages in iCloud also uses end-to-end encryption. If you have iCloud Backup turned on, your backup includes a copy of the key protecting your Messages. This ensures you can recover your Messages if you lose access to iCloud Keychain and your trusted devices. When you turn off iCloud Backup, a new key is generated on your device to protect future messages and isn&#39;t stored by Apple.The problem is that the first page makes it sound like no iMessage related data is backed up, when the truth is that the messages themselves aren&#39;t but a backdoor copy of the encryption key is, and lists it along with other E2EE services like Health data that do not have a key backed up and remain E2EE protected with iCloud backup. A user would have no reason to even seek out the second article to learn that it&#39;s not the same.Concerningly, iCloud Photos are not E2EE at all. It&#39;s no more secure/private than Google Photos or any other app.[1] https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204136

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Author here!The article was published earlier this week and I have a quick addendum: regarding Erlang/Elixir, my goal has always been to bring new developers to the platform. After all, Erlang developers already have the most important part of Elixir, which is the Erlang runtime!There are also key people in both communities working hard to make sure the tooling is consistent across all languages. A lot of this effort happens under the Erlang Ecosystem Foundation (https://erlef.org/) too.All to say, regardless if you pick Erlang or Elixir (or Gleam, LFE, etc.), I hope you will fall in love with the platform as much as I did 10 years ago!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Happy Elixir user here. At work we have a use case that isn&#39;t covered by José&#39;s high-level overview of the domains Elixir&#39;s used in: we run a massive multiplayer game server on it.This is actually a really good fit. (It kind of rhymes with the original use of Erlang, being telecoms infrastructure.) We get outstanding concurrency support, high reliability, and really efficient development times. I can&#39;t imagine shipping this feature with a server written in C++ (the language I&#39;m most comfortable in), and I can&#39;t imagine scaling it the way we need to if we&#39;d gone for a traditional web language like Node, PHP, etc.If you&#39;re interested, you can see the RakNet (game networking protocol) implementation we use on the server here:https://github.com/X-Plane/elixir-raknetThe README gives a good overview of the full MMO server&#39;s architecture, too: each client connection is a stateful Elixir process (not to be confused with a heavy-weight OS process!), acting asynchronously on a client state struct; clients then asynchronously schedule themselves to send updates back to the user."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Meanwhile te company I work for is moving away from it. We cannot find enough people with enough knowledge to be already productive in it. Not many want to learn it because it is considered pretty niche, and the ones willing to learn will need many months or years to be productive and build with some level of quality, and once they learn they move away to bigger companies which pay more. We end up paying to people to learn to then &#34;graduate&#34; and we end up with a platform built by people that were learning.Some people here say the tooling is great. Compared to what? The editor plugins are terrible, slow, and blow away your CPU doing god knows what kind of indexing. Compilation is slow and takes a lot of time (in CI for example). Libraries for things you give for granted in other platforms (java, javascript, python, ruby) are non existent, implemented in erlang, unmantained, poorly documented, not popular enough, or a combination of these.People are using it for creating traditional CRUD apps, and it is totally overkill. Something you would do in a day with django or ruby on rails takes a lot of time. Ok, you have tons of concurrency and scaling and.....but... unless you are facebook or google or amazon you won&#39;t need this anyway.Probably all of these things will be solved in the future, but at this moment, using Elixir for real production code in product focused companies is just a terrible mistake in my opinion. Certainly the ideas, the technology, and the BEAM are awesome...and it is technically superior to everything I&#39;ve seen out there. But from a business perspective, it makes no sense to use it unless you&#39;re building the next whatsapp or similar."</p>
