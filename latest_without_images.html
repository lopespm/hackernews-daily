								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;To continue operating, it drew on a line of credit from six banks amounting to between $500 million and $600 million to meet higher margin, or lending, requirements from its central clearing facility for stock trades, known as the Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation.&#34;Non-zero chance had they not haulted trading on those symbols they would&#39;ve been insolvent by close of trading today, depending on the size of their credit line.I watched the CEO on CNN tonight, and while I found him pretty difficult to watch, this is a very difficult position to be in. If you admit on TV that your company is experiencing liquidity issues -- even if temporary in nature such as with clearing custodianship requirements -- you run the risk of triggering a greater panic through customer withdrawals/redemptions.This could turn into a run on the brokerage pretty quickly, and probably already has in some measure, especially after a day of massively lost customer trust. He certainly didn&#39;t help it by going on TV and lying about their liquidity issues. They probably would&#39;ve been better off by issuing a statement and keeping him off TV."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don’t understand how all of a sudden the shift was made onto the insolvency of RH and that the discussion is less about the original conditions that led up to this.I just finished watching a video from Louis Rossmann [1] as well as one from Bruce Fenton [2]. In his video, Rossmann covers the technicalities and systems behind actually __making__ a trade with an app like RH. The videos were very informative and I learned quite a lot.With the exception of his recent interviews, it isn’t exactly clear what Robinhood was supposed to do differently. If my understanding is correct, clearing houses required more money up front to perform trades - RH didn’t have it so they stopped the trades unidirectionally. People got upset that they couldn’t buy but could sell which made it seem like RH wanted to manipulate the price - but isn’t it better than the alternative, the inability to both sell and buy would seem to me worse than what was done. Imagine them closing both and preventing people from selling if a crash occurs. The discussion would simply be « Robinhood stole our gains and wouldn’t let us move our funds ».Now, should it be the case that more money is required up front, intuitively it makes sense, I mean, who is supposed to front the bill on those 5000% returns? The hedge fund that just went bankrupt? Where exactly does this money come from?Isn’t RH just trying to play within the realities of the current system?Genuinely curious.[1]: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MAqxQe0l4g0&amp;feature=youtu.be[2]: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RQTC5f_VR9I&amp;feature=youtu.be"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Okay kids, story time.After the crash of 2008, I spent some time working with Dick Fuld. Yes, the former head of Lehman Brothers. Yes, the one people describe as “disgraced,” among other terms. Here’s the irony, though — Dick was one of the only people I encountered at that level of business/finance who wasn’t a scumbag. Unlike so many virtue-signaling Silicon Valley darlings, the guy behind the curtain was an honorable dude. And again, that’s a direct account from someone who has no vested interest or a book to sell or anything of that sort.Dick and I worked closely together, one on one. After enough time, after he trusted me, I finally got to ask him about what the hell actually happened. The man had a ton of PTSD — and probably still does — but eventually it became clear that the real story was completely, utterly, unbelievably stupid.Yes, Lehman was doing a bunch of stupid stuff, and the management under Dick were behaving like cowboys. But at the end of the day, that was the entire market at that time. What sunk Lehman was, in the end, a decision by all of the other big banks and the regulators that they’d let Lehman die because of something that might be best summarized as “lol idk sorry Dick but we’re just gonna let you go and let the Fed bail the rest of us out sorry bro lol.” Like really. That’s how it went behind those closed doors in the lairs of the lizards that control the universe. Lehman had already  suffered near-death in 1994 — the world has now forgotten that Dick was the hero that saved the firm back then — and now it was to be made a sacrificial lamb for everyone else’s benefit.Why am I telling you this story? What is the point? Well, what I am trying to say is that these supposed “adults in the room” who are so much smarter and better than the the “retail investors” are pretty much the same sort of immature, self-centered children as the other side. The difference is, they’ve got the regulators  and the politicians in their pockets. So when they say “lol oops” and literally blow up the global economy to save face, nothing happens to them. But for some reason when it’s the retail guys, a moral panic ensues.In my eyes, the Internet-connected retail investor is learning the power of what I call “massively multiplayer liquidity.” Yes, there’s some growing pains, but let’s not kill this wild new phenomenon before we learn what it can do. Because, from what I’ve seen from the other side of things, I doubt these self-styled “retards” will ever end up as depraved and corrupt as the people they’re disrupting.Play ball, kids. And as Dick always used to say, “don’t get left with nothing other than a ham sandwich.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There’s a long history of similar occurrences that follow along a common line: whatever appears to support individual investors will be the path taken by politicians and regulatory bodies.Right now it appears that the public wants to be able to trade on their terms because there is this narrative that the little guy is finally sticking it to the big bad hedge funds. In reality there is probably very little truth to this. However, support for the individual investor plays extremely well which is why you see politicians from both sides joining forces on this issue. A rumor makes it halfway around the world while the truth is still putting its pants on. Nobody is interested in the subtleties around these issues where there almost certainly should be regulations in place or at least warnings from those who do actually know better. But late in bull markets when speculation is running wild those who try to be the voice of reason are run over by the masses until they shut up and go away.Galbraith wrote about this in the 1950’s and if you read his account of the 1929 crash the parallels are eerily similar. Nobody wants to be told they aren’t making money due to skill but because they’re caught up in a dangerous bubble. In the aftermath of a crash when tremendous sums are lost, nobody blames the speculators, they always find another scapegoat- the regulators, the brokerages, the hedge funds- whomever. It doesn’t matter so long as the speculator is held up as a victim. I expect this to end no differently."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Dark patterns are everywhere and I&#39;m afraid not enough people are raising a ruckus about them. For example, the &#34;Google Pay&#34; app in India, which works via the UPI system, shows its own &#34;scanner code&#34; in the app as opposed to the standard UPI QR code. Furthermore, you can&#39;t discover where the UPI QR code is, if you want to pay using BHIM - an app that works directly with UPI payments. If you&#39;re using GPay too, then you can access the scanner code. If not, you used to be able to select the UPI QR code from a menu and scan that. However, later updates have hidden that - not eliminated it, mind you, deliberately hidden that. You have to &#34;swipe left&#34; when you see the GPay scanner code to get to the QR code - not at all a discoverble act. My wife discovered it by accident after we were puzzled a few times about where the QR code that used to be accessible went (both of us use BHIM). As a consequence, folks who use GPay do not know about UPI. This is, in my books, malicious design. Hanlon&#39;s razor would ask me to try &#34;stupidity&#34; first. But no. This isn&#39;t stupidity. It is downright malicious (the benign term being &#34;dark pattern&#34;) to do this .. at least at Google&#39;s level."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s also worth mentioning that the misconception of thinking UX as being solely related to aesthetics is getting dangerously more and more common, even among professionals referring to themselves as UX designers.Aesthetics is important, but, in some sorts of systems, it has much lower priority than other non-functional requirements, like overall speed, maintainability, testability and so on.I don&#39;t know if my experience is the same of most of you, but I&#39;ve seen more and more systems getting aesthetic pleasant but painfully slow and/or buggy these days. It&#39;s easy when you can simply quit using the software, but when your bank, your broker, your airline, your accountant, the company that operates the subway ticket machines, when those sorts of businesses start to embrace such vision, things start to get complicated.And, unfortunately, all those examples I mention here are real and this is not an exhaustive list.Besides, I&#39;m not sure those companies (at least the ones in my examples) do that as an attempt to exploit users. I believe they do that due to plain lack of competence."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d actually argue otherwise - UX has gotten tremendously better in the last decade. Online products have been moulded perfectly towards improving the use case for their customers.The main issue though is that you aren&#39;t the customer anymore.Look at Facebook - they&#39;ve done an absolutely incredible job becoming a dream experience for advertisers. Youtube has catered to these advertisers as well and blocked controversial content that wouldn&#39;t look good next to their brand. It&#39;s a golden age to be at the head of a marketing team with a large ad budget. These companies have made golden escalators for getting sponsored content in front of the productized consumers.If you want UX to succeed and become something that benefits you as a user, then you should focus on platforms where you truly are the customer. Look at Square or Patreon - in both platforms you are truly the customer, and their UX is incredible."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is the equivalent of a negative research result that looked into whether there&#39;s anything more to explore here to produce the really juicy result like a true compromise, but instead shows that there&#39;s nothing that a set of highly qualified researchers can prove, at least.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This has always been my pet peeve with jobs that won&#39;t hire people without &#39;5-7 years experience with X&#39; - the vast majority of these jobs do not need an EXPERT on language x, or framework y. If they do, the rest of this post does not apply.You can learn enough of a language to be dangerous in just a couple weeks. Enough to be productive in 2-3 months. However, there are 3 other things you have to learn:1. How the code for the project you are hired for works. How it&#39;s laid out. All the weird shit about it.2. How the framework/libraries used by the project works. Nothing to do with the project, but maybe you haven&#39;t used Angular, Swing, or Boost before.3. How the data is laid out, and how it gets in/out of your system. What database tables are there, what&#39;s the workflow.Those 3 things are the hard part and what take 6-12 months. Learning Javascript, Ruby, or whatever language is the least of your worries."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Glamorous Toolkit (https://gtoolkit.com) by feenk, which embodies the thesis of this blog post, is in my opinion the most exciting working development environment in decades. I think in 5-10 years people will be pointing to it as having a huge impact on the industry.I implore anyone serious about changing how software development works to digest Andrei Chis&#39; thesis Moldable Tools: http://scg.unibe.ch/archive/phd/chis-phd.pdfOnce you understand the consequences of reducing the cost of specialised tool development by orders of magnitude, it becomes obvious that a qualitative change in experience follows, that brings us much closer to what people like Engelbart were searching for."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some of us (me, for example :) have to spend multiple weeks a year to draw the design architecture of certain parts of the product. During engineering meetings everybody raised the same question: i commit to new area in product, how can I understand what are the components and how to do certain things? You can ask your colleagues but they might know it as well.So I decided to document main flows and designs in PlantUML diagrams. having these diagrams greatly improved onboarding process, cause you can quickly glance what component does what and what are the dependencies (the code base was in JS, so it is usually quite limited on refactoring/figuring out wtf is going on).But the problem with such approach is: diagram quickly gets out of date. Someone makes the change and the diagram makes no sense at all now. With what I saw in Gtoolkit, you can always query the real source code and build custom dev tools that always produce current and real overview of the system. I would love to have a starter kit for JS projects that you can drag and drop and start building your own tooling for your product."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"FWIW I ran a startup that provided you with a program (single binary) that allowed you to run natural language queries on your database across most schemas. It had a full semantics layers which translated your query into a mixed-lambda calculus-prolog query, which is then translated into SQL as needed - you can see a sample of the semantics layer here: https://youtu.be/fd4EPh2tYrk?t=92.It&#39;s deep learning based with a lot of augmentation. Going from the OP&#39;s article to actually being able to run queries on any schema is quite a bit more work. I&#39;d love to see GPT3 handle arbitrary schemas.p/s: the startup failed. deep research based startups need a lot of funds."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Woah. I never gave it my database schema but it assumes I have a table called &#34;users&#34; (which is accurate) and that there&#39;s a timestamp field called &#34;signup_time&#34; for when a user signed up.I am definitely impressed by the fact that it could get this close without knowledge of the schema, and that you can provide additional context about the schema.  Seems like there is a lot of potential for building a natural language query engine that is hooked up to a database.  I suppose there is always a risk that a user could generate a dangerous query but that could be mitigated.Not related to the article but what exactly is &#34;open&#34; about OpenAI?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a use case where AI-powered SQL is a solution in search of a problem, and introduces more issues than just doing boring SQL. For data analysis, it&#39;s much more important to be accurate than fast, and this article is unclear how many attempts each example query took. GPT-3 does not always output coherent output (even with good prompts), and since not 100% of the output is valid SQL the QA and risk tolerance of bad output affects the economics.OpenAI&#39;s GPT-3 API is expensive enough (especially with heavy prompt engineering) that the time saved may not outweigh the cost, particularly if the output is not 100% accurate."</p>
