								<p class="story__comment_others">"They need to re-free up the API. Early adopters and hackers really did some great work using the API until they walled-gardened it and rate limited it to make it unusable.  They need to do this for goodwill at the very least, but I think it will spark the fire to make it popular with techies again.Based on the recently published discovery chats we will probably see:* High def video* Focus on music publication* The highest revenue sharing cut from any social media platform for content creators to get people to switch.* Removal of twitter blue but some kind of subscriptions to edit tweets* Paid push DMs to followers (e.g. follow this account for drops, then the tweeter has to pay to tweet to this group)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In the spirit of trying to be high-information and add value:Where Musk is going, there are no maps. So it&#39;s very very hard to project. But we can predict likely developments.At a very high level, it&#39;s going to involve: bringing back controversial personalities like Donald Trump; increasing Twitter&#39;s commitment to &#39;free speech&#39;; assuaging skittish advertisers; retaining users who might be concerned, while bringing in new ones; managing the exodus of users (size:?) that will happen regardless; cutting a large amount of staff, while keeping Twitter&#39;s lights on; open sourcing the code, discussing the impending rearchitecture; and - long term - folding this into Elon&#39;s vision of America&#39;s WeChat, and ultimately expanding Twitter, under X.com.That&#39;s a lot. But at a high level, I think that&#39;s correct.I would expect Elon to take the fight to the media. Whether he&#39;s going to focus on neutrally spreading a message, going more on the attack on media outlets that would support him, or doing something in between, is unknown.Musk has an unusually large amount of media power: that&#39;s his unique value add, in a way. I would expect this to be a &#39;bigger deal&#39; as a story, as multiple stories, than I would for any other company undergoing a takeover. We&#39;ll be hearing a lot more about Twitter in the weeks to come, since the developments will keep piling up, and the press/public loves to read &amp; discuss stories about Twitter &amp; Musk.We&#39;ll see how it goes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"~5 years ago, I hired three Indian developers. They asked me if we could set up an Indian legal entity, so that they could just get regular salaries in India with tax payments, deductions etc taken care of. I agreed and we got it done.One of the worst business-decisions of my life. The amount of red tape, stupid rules, corruption, signatures, stamps, showing up physically in a certain office etc etc... Mindblowing.I will not tire you with all the details, but to this day, Indian tax authorities still hold money hostage, that they agree my Indian company is owed (GST refunds). But all attempts to actually get the money back falls on deaf ears. We have sent experts to the relevant tax offices etc, but the ONLY guy who can handle it is never there, refuses to deal with it, then says we need to go somewhere else - where we are sent back etc etc. Sent around in circles, basically - with everybody recognizing the money is in fact owed...I will never do business in India again. Happy to work with Indian developers (I still do), but they will get paid as freelancers and deal with the red tape on their end."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"India&#39;s obsession with paperwork is unceasing and baffling. Everything requires an application, even when everything can be done digitally. You need letters and stamps to get anything done.Case in point: the &#34;company stamps&#34; that are required for everything you do with your business. From getting a debit card to changing the maturity instructions for a corporate deposit, you need to sign your name AND stamp it with your company stamp.The company stamp can be made by anyone for $1-2. It has no bearing on security at all. Yet, you need to carry it with you if you want to get anything done.It&#39;s utterly baffling. I can access my corporate bank account online and make any number of transactions, yet if I want to apply for a debit card, I need my company stamp and signatures from all directors.Why? I have no idea!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Previously on HN: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24106545 (with a few comments from the author as well).The author had added a correction to the post (12th August 2020) stating that this was a mistake, and that the actual procedure was much less cumbersome:https://web.archive.org/web/20200812093618/https://superr.in...&gt; It has been bought to my attention that there was a mistake by an entry level employee.&gt; So the Revenue Department itself was supposed to get all the NOCs required by going to all those offices, but an entry level employee forgot to add my file to the list of NA’s to be done.&gt; [...] But PLEASE UNDERSTAND that “it was a mistake” in filing by an Entry Level Employee and normally this procedure takes less than 2 months and all the heavy lifting is done by the Revenue Department, Collector Office.Tweet from the author about the correction: https://twitter.com/mrohanshah/status/1293170591441104902But the correction was removed after a while, so maybe a bit of clarification will help."</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33370870">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Here is my competing take:The biggest problem I see in developer communication is what I call the &#34;assumed context&#34; problem.As in, you talk/write to people as if they know all about your code, except the detail being discussed. In reality, they usually have much less detailed understanding, and you&#39;re making no sense to them.I&#39;m pretty sure this is related to people &#34;on the spectrum&#34; often having low &#34;theory of mind&#34; capabilities. People without that will just assume people know what they know, and proceed to fail at communicating with those who don&#39;t.It also makes it easy to think of those who don&#39;t know what is obvious to you as idiots.The workaround, if you want to communicate with the idiots surrounding you, is to start conversations by fact finding. The question &#34;so how much do you know about the flurbigator system?&#34; can help."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This has little to do w/ being a developer vs. being human.People joke about the programmer in a dark corner plugging away and never talking to others, but that&#39;s actually pretty rare. In 20 years I&#39;ve only worked with a handful of developers who don&#39;t want to socialize, collaborate, or solve problems together.The truth is that people - regardless of discipline - generally all want the same things from their work: to work on something meaningful, to be productive, and to be recognized for that work (both output and input).That&#39;s pretty much it. If - as a leader - you can do those, you&#39;re going to generally have rather happy employees.When it comes to this article, the issue is that there are a lot of people who believe that documentation and effective communication ARE necessary, but that work ISN&#39;T recognized, and (because it isn&#39;t recognized) steals time that could be spent being productive doing something that is.If you want effective communication, documentation, etc. at your workplace, it&#39;s incumbent on leadership to create that culture. Nurture it, get better at it themselves, and help those less eloquent to find their [written] voice."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who went from engineering to product management, partly due to having developed a skill of communicating effectively in writing and in speech, I would suggest perhaps the most important part of communicating effectively is storytelling.  If what you are sharing does not have a clear and obvious narrative arc, people are going to disengage quickly.  This is not necessary for short bursts of information in a high-context environment, but any time you need to level set and share context before communicating the critical information, you should do so in story fashion.If you want to level up your technical communication, I&#39;d highly recommend taking classes in creative writing, participating in things like NaNoWriMo, or taking a class in improv comedy/theater.  All of these things emphasize construction of narrative arcs and how to draw people through a story, which are essential communication skills. This gets more important the farther up the chain of command in a company you are communicating with."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; … support persistent client-side storage using available JS APIs. As of this writing, that includes the Origin-Private FileSystem (OPFS) [0]This is really good news, and exactly what the OPFS was designed for.You may have seen “Absurd SQL” [1] which was a proof of concept for building a SQLite Virtual FS backend using IndexedDB. It provided full ACID compliment transactions. Incredible work but a hack at best.The OPFS supersedes all that and makes it possible to have proper consistent and resilient transactions.WASM SQLite with the OPFS is the future of offline first web app development. The concept of a single codebase web/mobile/desktop app with proper offline storage is here.What I really want to see next is an eventually constant sync system between browser and server (or truly distributed with WebRTC). The SQLite Session Extension [2] potentially has the building blocks needed for such a system.0: https://webkit.org/blog/12257/the-file-system-access-api-wit...1: https://github.com/jlongster/absurd-sql2: https://www.sqlite.org/sessionintro.html"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is not about the colors, FYI. This is about someone referencing a specific Pantone product as a spot color. And the automatic conversion from that spot color name to the regular RGB / CMYK color values is now gone. But if you embedded the actual RGB/CMYK values into your file, then it&#39;ll still open just fine and display those colors just fine.Edit: Also, converting from Pantone to regular RGB/CMYK is a lot more lossy than one would think. If I reference a Pantone product, that pretty much covers all properties of the printed surface, including things like reflectivity angles, fluorescence and phosphorescence. A cheap xRite will already measure reflectivity in 13 wavelength bands. And then it&#39;ll average those 13 characteristics into 3 RGB numbers. Professional color measurement tools can have hundreds of properties per ink type, thereby making reduction to 3 values even more lossy.If I give you RGB, that merely specifies the color at direct reflection under normal light. If I give you a Pantone ID, you also now how it&#39;ll look from the side or under UV light. RGB specifies an averaged wavelength mixture, Pantone specifies a chemical ink mixture.Edit2: You know these car paints that have fresnel reflections, meaning they appear to have a different color of you look at them from a different angle? That&#39;s an excellent example of a case where you need to specify a specific ink type like Pantone, because the RGB value changes based on the viewing angle."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The comments here seem to be mostly litigating whether Pantone ought to be allowed to license colour names. To me though, the scandalous thing about this is that a piece of software which you paid for can work fine one day can stop functioning the same way the next because of a change in the vendor&#39;s license agreements. Like imagine if you bought a song which uses samples and one day the backing track just disappears because the artist didn&#39;t renew the sample clearance."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you are in the USA, then what you received are unsolicited marketing phone calls under the TCPA, a law which allows you to personally collect up to $1500 per violation of the law or associated regulations, per phone call that you received. If your personal phone is on the federal &#34;Do Not Call&#34; registry, it&#39;s possible that there are at least two violations of the law per phone call you received.I would suggest sending a demand letter to Meta&#39;s legal department offering to settle for somewhat less than $1500 per violation. Here&#39;s an example: https://www.junkfax.org/w/images/0/0b/SampleDemandLetter.pdfIf they ignore you, be prepared to file a local case in small claims court (which you can do yourself without an attorney). The court can force them to pay you if you present evidence of the calls and the law(s) or regulations that were broken.Disclaimer: I am not a laywer and this is not legal advice, but I have collected money from TCPA legal settlements in the past, each without needing to go to court."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just to be clear...You&#39;re absolutely sure, 100%, this is Meta employees themselves calling you? And Meta sending you e-mails?Not spammers, of which there are many, and they get your contact info from all sorts of places? And which often lead you to believe they&#39;re Meta when they&#39;re really just scamming you or trying to sell ad placement consulting/optimization services?Because with &#34;multiple&#34; calls and emails... this sounds like 3rd-party spammers, not something Meta does. And while Meta has been loose in the past with walling off information internally (to put it mildly...), it&#39;s not like they sell your contact info to spammers or anything (simply because it&#39;s not worth the effort, the money&#39;s way too small for a company of their size). Third-party spammers, on the other hand, will get your personal info from anywhere and everywhere.For you to make a credible claim that Meta is using your 2FA contact info for marketing, you&#39;ve really got to be sure that it&#39;s 1) actually Meta contacting you and 2) that they got your phone number specifically from 2FA and not just from looking it up publicly the way salespeople do."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a feeling that Meta has some kind of internal system for slurping up everyone&#39;s contact info, and that some kind of bugs/criteria occasionally cross some streams.Meta recruiting somehow got a hold of my name@amazon.com employer email -- which I have never posted publicly -- and started sending me recruitment emails to my work email. This struck me as incredibly unprofessional, though I understand it&#39;s almost certainly an automated system doing it.I still don&#39;t know how they got the email address (though I guess it&#39;s just lastname+first initial, so they could have guessed?). I may have DM&#39;d it to someone in a FB messenger chat? Maybe I used it in an &#34;work email&#34; field during sign up for some industry conference whose data later got hacked? A colleague accidentally merged their work/personal contact list and uploaded it somewhere? Who knows."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This sort of justifies the viewpoint that despite all his bluster, Elon will probably run Twitter the way a &#34;reasonable executive&#34; would.  Not just release the hounds.Keep the advertisers happy, but try to reduce the reliance on advertisers.  Keep moderating content to reduce abuse, maybe eliminate the high profile banning but a person on the ground will have largely the same experience. (probably less action on more contentious issues, but you still can&#39;t use racial epithets and call for violence).  Evaluate most employees or teams on the merits, there will be layoffs, probably big layoffs but they&#39;ll be managed incremental and strategic.  Build more products and pivot the product strongly but again, not in the image of a Parler or a Truth Social.
Twitter won&#39;t become a cesspool because he understands that people need to be able to control what they see or they&#39;ll leave.  Essentially try to create more safe spaces on twitter, not less."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I got a 7 day ban for a tweet that included “political suicide pact” as an idiom.I then got permanently banned for including the line, “sending their children to die in Ukraine” in a tweet.The “appeal” button causes me to get a denied email within one minute. This tells me no humans are in the loop on any of this.I don’t think these tweets were controversial or require any diversity of viewpoints. They just require appreciation that you cannot automatically moderate anything accurately unless you are prepared to be very very VERY relaxed about the rules.I’m not sure Elon is even interested in fixing this kind of problem. He seems focused on the politics and “cancel culture” type issues (whether they’re real or imagined)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Potentially of intellectual interest: Some people here might be wondering about speech that is &#34;harmful,&#34; with the famous quote about &#34;you can&#39;t yell fire in a crowded theater.&#34; That quote from the Supreme Court is commonly used to justify why there need to be restraints on free speech.This is actually a popular misconception. The decision where &#34;you can&#39;t yell fire in a crowded theater&#34; was from was actually overturned in almost entirety in Brandenburg v. Ohio in 1969. And even then, it was only an analogy, and never actually was the law. You actually, theoretically, CAN yell fire in a crowded theater. Websites on both sides of the isle have admitted it is a terrible analogy for defending censoring certain content for being potentially harmful. It is, quite literally, a legal myth. A legal myth that still affects our Congress today while they examine how to prevent the spread of misinformation [1].https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/why-falsely-claiming-its-ill...https://reason.com/2022/10/27/yes-you-can-yell-fire-in-a-cro...https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/11/its-tim...https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/01/shouting-f...https://www.whalenlawoffice.com/legal-mythbusting-series-yel...https://www.thefire.org/you-can-shout-fire-in-a-burning-thea...[1] For an example (out of many) of why regulating misinformation is legally almost impossible, see United States vs Alvarez, which ruled that the Stolen Valor Act of 2005 (which criminalized faking having a military honor) is legally protected speech and the act was a violation of the constitution. Since then it has been extended with a new 2013 act which requires intent to gain something by fraud, which hasn&#39;t been struck down (yet)."</p>

After 3-6 seconds, the timestamps pop in. I don&#39;t know if this is intentionally or a result of lazy-loading - but seeing that the video thumb, title, author, view count, and age all load instantly with the page, I struggle to come up with a reason it could be unintentional.This bothers me because I like to know how long a video is before I commit the time to sitting down and watching it. This feels like an attempt at a dark pattern with the intent to improve metrics - surely watch time is a metric youtube cares about."</p>

I wasn&#39;t aware of this particular one but it looks like it&#39;s going to have issues with recording anything that requires user input.My post describes how to make high quality recordings of terminal sessions that can be replayed in the terminal, or shared on the web. I&#39;m defining high quality as recordings with zero typos, and relatively controlled timing between commands.I&#39;m going to assume this works well because all the stuff from Charm seems to, BUT its limitations are ... problematic. I think the techniques i list in the post combined with agg[2] or gifcast[3] to covert it to a gif would be a better solution for non-trivial cases.I&#39;ll add notes about agg and gifcast to the post this evening hopefully.[1]: https://weblog.masukomi.org/2022/10/11/recording_and_sharing...[2]: https://github.com/asciinema/agg[3]: https://github.com/dstein64/gifcast"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This looks super useful. Tempted to go and add CI-maintained gifs to a whole bunch of existing projects now.Some ideas for new features:* If the prefix of the tape file is unchanged, reuse the intermediate updates through that prefix from a cache (edit: hmm, upon further thought this seems more difficult than I initially imagined, since the state would need to be cached to save time, not just the images)* Allow an option for using real-time delays in the gif or user-selected delays (I think currently delays are constant unless user-selected, but I don&#39;t see a way to use the real runtime delay in the gif)"</p>
