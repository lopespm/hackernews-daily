								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Folks - this is what we are outsourcing and externalizing.When foreign entities are able to bid for a lot less, and pay a lot less, a lot of it has to do with the fact that they will not bother with &#39;end of life&#39; for ships, or getting insurance, or worrying about the lives of people who are &#39;expendable&#39;.Those very nice buildings in Dubai come from some nasty labour practices.If every piece of this puzzle from end-to-end were to have happened in a &#39;rich country&#39; there&#39;d be legal issues, PR/media, litigation, and a separate kind of bureaucracy altogether, meaning the &#39;alternative&#39; for a lot of corporations is just &#39;wash their hands&#39; of it, pay 1/2 the price, and get all the ugly parts &#39;off the books&#39;.We are to the point now where we have ample material surplus - we don&#39;t need any more &#39;plastic stuff from China&#39; - it&#39;d be worthwhile to start integrating a lot of &#39;off the books&#39; stuff into trade deals. Ironically, it would be good for &#39;them&#39; as well, because in chaotic, quasi-lawless systems it doesn&#39;t make sense for participants to invest in anything further ahead than what is in front of their noses (i.e. don&#39;t hate the Lebanese shippers for doing the only thing they can do to remain profitable, i.e. don&#39;t hate the player, hate the game) ... forcing some degree of transparency and accountability in these systems might raise prices a little bit, but the benefits would likely be immensely positive in the system overall.It&#39;s nice that the story is made personal, about a real individual (think: that Tom Hanks film about someone stuck in international airport limbo) but that&#39;s not really the story here is it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"His ship has been sitting still for so long that you can see it on Google Maps:
https://www.google.com/maps/place/%D8%B3%D9%81%D9%8A%D9%86%D...Edit: a few more story details here: https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/apr/19/ever-giv... When he rows to shore to get supplies he can only stay for two hours at most as the area is a restricted military zone. Other crew members were repatriated in September 2019, so Mohammad was not alone for 2 years but only for 7 months (which is no less unacceptable). The only reason Mohammad was allowed to leave was thanks to a local union representative who agreed to take his place as the ship’s guardian."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is there something that could be done by people otherwise uninvolved - like myself, or my fellow HN readers - to help the other ~250 people who are currently stuck in similar situations?I don’t even know how to go about enumerating who those people are, their ships, or where they are anchored. With that information a well-organized and/or funded group could at least get someone out to these people to check on them, provide basic supplies, and perhaps some form of reliable communications.A lot of problems seem insurmountable large and complex, and even this one seems so if your goal is to free these people of their legal liabilities - but if you set aside trying to solve the reason they’re stuck onboard these ships in the first place, providing basic humanitarian aid to them seems doable.ETA: This looks like a good place to start - https://www.ilo.org/dyn/seafarers/seafarersbrowse.home"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"In case you don&#39;t know who Proctorio is:(like me)Apparently it&#39;s a supervision software that students are forced to install on their private computer and (as expected) it&#39;ll do its worst to invade your privacy and flag &#34;suspicious&#34; things, based on which the university might punish you.&#34;Suspicious&#34; here means wearing glasses [3] or looking around in the room or blinking too much [4] or having eye and/or skin colors [1] that are difficult for AI to track or reading questions out aloud [2]. Because everyone knows that a good student is white, sits in a bright room, and will continuously stare at his/her PC screen while thinking about a difficult math problem, I guess. WTF?I am so glad that this kind of abuse was not yet common when I was in university. I love sitting in the (dark) basement, it helps me concentrate. And I tend to close my eyes a lot because it helps me visualize the problem. I&#39;m sure this kind of misguided software would have failed me.And the worst part is: Bugs in this software will fail students in the real world. [4]So it is crucially important that this type of software receives a lot of scrutiny to make sure it works as planned. But it seems that Proctorio is suing this guy for doing exactly that: Documenting how the software is supposed to work by linking to Proctorio&#39;s YouTube videos.[1] https://twitter.com/uhreeb/status/1303139738065481728[2] https://www.insider.com/viral-tiktok-student-fails-exam-afte...[3] https://proctorio.com/frequently-asked-questions[4] https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/g2ub05/god_kicked_out_..."</p>

It&#39;s always been one of the minor annoyances in my life - clothing and clothing-adjacent vendors put these icons on their products, and I have no first clue what they mean, because which family of signs is used seems to depend on some combination of country of origin, target market, and the position of Saturn relative to Jupiter."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not a bad idea, but there’s dozens of other ISO symbols that I think should also be considered[0].Some are quite important; like safety symbols.One of my pet peeves has always been the difference between US emergency egress (“EXIT” signs), and everyone else in the world. In the US, they tend to be red, and the word “EXIT”. Everyone else does green, with the man running through the door.In Japan, medical facilities were denoted by a green cross. In the US, it tends to be blue or red.Color can be an important factor, but that’s tangential to the Unicode set.[0] https://www.iso.org/news/2013/10/Ref1787.html"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve shipped a commercial game in Godot 3.2. I&#39;m also well versed and shipped games in UE4.All I can say is working with Godot is an absolute bliss. Seriously, it&#39;s fun, it&#39;s &#34;easy&#34; and it gets out of the way. Within a couple of weeks, you can be focusing on making your game, rather than a constantly evolving tech-demo.There are only two caveats: understand what Godot is not good at, 3D open world / large landscape, and console development.Godot 4.0 was a total mess the last time I tried it though. The Vulkan stuff was completely half baked and the UI was acting out. Godot 3.2 though, solid fun."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve been using Godot for the last month. It’s been so fun to get back to game development as a hobby (it’s how I got into software development). I’ve tried many other game engines in the last few years but Godot just really ... works for me. It just clicks. Love it. Excited to try the new version!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Looking forward to checking this out. I&#39;ve been playing around with some physics based ideas in Godot but had issues with collisions. Hoping that the collision fixes mentioned in the changelog applies to what I&#39;m doing.I&#39;m very impressed with the quality of Godot and its continuous improvements."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Related question:What’s the state of the art for managing the running of, and the output from, multiple CLI commands at once?  Say I have a task D that requires a task A, B, and C, but for which A and B and independent.The naive solution (let the output interlace and just watch the exit codes) creates a substantial comprehension problem for my coworkers, so I don’t usually do it. But over and over again I find myself having a 20-90 second inefficiency or two caused by running two tasks that have to complete but the order doesn’t matter."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been using tmux for quite a while, though at a fairly casual level.The first thing I noticed is that this interface is discoverable - it shows me what I can do, which is incredible and makes me want to use it. The main reason I&#39;ve been a casual tmux user and not an advanced one despite using it for years, is because every time I want to try something new I have to google if it&#39;s possible.The second thing I noticed is that it uses ctrl-r as a core shortcut. Mega problem: ctrl-r is a built-in bash feature which I use every day to recall previous commands. This makes me think I can&#39;t use this tool at all.I would suggest to consider taking a page from tmux&#39;s book. Just use a global modifier key. Ctrl-b is what tmux uses, so you know it&#39;s safe. Other software being developed knows they should avoid it, because tmux uses it. By also using it, you&#39;d no longer have to dance around the global space of what shortcuts every software in existence is using. Additionally, if you use ctrl-b to enable your commands, you can minimize your interface. Currently you&#39;re using two entire lines to display your menu. That&#39;s going to become tiring as I use zellij 8 hours a day for years. I&#39;ll have to hide it eventually. Instead, what if you reduced it to zero lines? Put &#34;ctrl-b: menu&#34; in the upper right of your title bar. Pressing ctrl-b now enables commands and shows what your next keypress will do. You have now (1) avoided breaking existing shortcuts, (2) aligned with established standards (3) given some familiarity to welcome tmux users (4) expanded visible screen space and (5) simplified your menu system. You can also now remove ctrl-g since the interface is &#34;locked&#34; by default until I want to start interacting with it.Anyway that&#39;s my 2 cents. Thanks for this exciting demo."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love that the UI can be explored by the user, since it shows available keyboard shortcuts. This is something where GNU screen or tmux suck, because you really have to lookup how to operate these tools. In some manual or with google."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Pretty much any federal agency you have heard of has an investigative dept that employs federal special agents. These are law enforcement roles with the same training, authority, and responsibilities as investigative agents in the FBI, etc.They were created to meet the specific law enforcement needs of each agency. Dept of Education agents investigate misuse of Dept of Education funds, for example. The Postal Inspectors investigate illegal use of, or threats to, the mail system.After 9/11 a lot of these depts got new infusions of resources, and instructions to do a lot more information sharing. There was a feeling that the attacks of 9/11 could have been prevented if existing disparate info had been better collected and collated.So it’s not that surprising that these agencies will seem to stray out of their lanes. If Postal is monitoring broadly for threats against their systems, but sees other concerning info, they are supposed to share it.This is all intended to be explanatory; I’m not saying that it’s how things should be.I will say that personally I have fewer concerns about programs to monitor public content on the Internet, than programs that seek to access, monitor, and store content that people intended to be privately communicated to other people."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lots of sentiment today that the USPS is way out of its zone of expertise in doing this -- and that is possible.But it&#39;s worth noting that the USPS has had its own legion of postal inspectors going back to the 19th century, when they were a (comparatively) huge part of the U.S. government, and the FBI, etc. did not exist.Some 1,200 postal inspectors are still around, and they play important roles on federal prosecutions related to mail fraud, drug shipments, etc. There&#39;s a good Wikipedia entry on it all: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Postal_Inspectio..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a tough issue for a government. We do have crazies out there and we do need to investigate potential dangerous groups and individuals and reel them in before they do something crazy.On my FB feed I have seen friends and friends of friends call for armed revolt many times over the past few years. Most all of them are blowing steam and many are in their 60s or older and couldn&#39;t run a block in gym shorts, and much less if they were carrying any kind of real military gear, but they like to think they can. We all grew up with &#34;Rambo&#34; movies.But some of those who&#39;s comments I&#39;ve seen I don&#39;t know at all.The ordeal at our Capital proves there&#39;s a problem that needs to be monitored. Most of those who went there were not armed or dangerous, but there were enough kooks to cause some real damage and lives were lost. And last year we had the guy who blew himself and his motorhome up on a Downtown street.If we had another &#34;Timothy McVeigh&#34; event people would be howling, and if we had several they&#39;d be freaking out and demanding something be done.We all have good reason to be wary of &#34;Big Brother&#34; type surveillance but we also have to acknowledge that we have a problem with people getting crazy and shooting into crowds and blowing things up.There&#39;s not always a good solution to a shitty situation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"[DISCLAMER: I used to work at Google in general, but not at Google Cloud]I&#39;m not sure whether this has been discussed here before, but I&#39;d love to take this forum to share an angle from the tech side of things:IMO, Google is _cursed_ to keep deprecating its products and services. It&#39;s cursed by Google&#39;s famous choice of mono-repo tech stack.It makes all the sense and has all the benefits. But at a cost: we had to keep every single line of code in active development mode. Whenever someone changed a line of code in a random file that&#39;s three steps away on your dependency chain, you will get a ticket to understand what has changed, make changes and fire up every tests (also fix them in 99% of the cases).Yeah, the &#34;Fuck You. Drop whatever you are doing because it’s not important. What is important is OUR time. It’s costing us time and money to support our shit, and we’re tired of it, so we’re not going to support it anymore.&#34; is kind of true story for internal engineers.We once had a shipped product (which took about 20-engineer-month to develop in the first place) in maintenance mode, but still requires a full time engineer to deal with those random things all the time. Would have save 90% of that person&#39;s time it it&#39;s on a sperate branch and we only need to focus on security patches. (NO, there is no such concept of branching in Google&#39;s dev system).We kept doing this for a while and soon realized that there is no way we can sustain this, especially after the only guys who understand how everything works switched teams. Thus, it just became obvious that deprecation is the only &#34;responsible&#34; and &#34;reasonable&#34; choice.Honestly, I think Google&#39;s engineering practice is somewhat flawed for the lack of a good solution to support shipped products in maintenance. As a result, there is either massively successful products being actively developed; or deprecated products."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been in GCP support for over 4 years. My opinions are my own. I try to stay as impartial as I can about my employer. I know there are a lot of valid criticisms to be made about GCP. As one of the people often bearing the brunt of the fallout whenever there is a painful outage or deprecation, I share some of them.But it never gets easy to read posts like this. This one appears to be a collection of old hacker news posts. And I can&#39;t help but think about all the posts that are never written, submitted, or upvoted about every time someone had a good experience with support. No one talks about their GCE VMs with years of uptime.I&#39;ll spend hours on video calls with customers, going through logs, packet captures, perf profiles, core dumps, reading their code, conducting tests. Unpacking the tangled web until the problem is obvious. It&#39;s always a good feeling when we get to the end, and you get to reveal it like the end of a mystery novel. For me, that&#39;s the good part. Sometimes it takes a couple of hours. Sometimes weeks. Months even. And then the customer goes on with their life, as they should.That&#39;s how it always should work. But no one talks about when a process works the way it&#39;s supposed to. People want to read about failures. And trade their own analyses about why that failure happened and how Google is fundamentally broken for these N simple reasons.I don&#39;t want to diminish the negative stories as they are about people who went through real pain. I also realize that I&#39;m just one person, and I can only work with so many customers in my time here. I&#39;m not sure where I&#39;m going with this.I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is, keep an open mind. This is a highly competitive field. There are strong incentives for GCP to listen to its customers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me a bit of &#34;The game of life&#34; back in the 90sOptimizing life for filling the savings account as fast as possible at the expense of everything else has consequences and your game should reflect this.You should have stats including your characters age, health, happiness and social skills and have some kind of social media app with your friends constantly trying to invite you out for concerts, nights out, dating? and so on so that you have constant distractions to spend your money on to make it more challenging. Not building up the happiness and social skills stats should have consequences. You should be able to buy a gym membership to keep your health stat from deteriorating.The consequences of not building up those stats early in your life is poor health, shit social skills and no friends except for the people you work with. But yay, you&#39;re a millionaire I guess?The real game of life is that it&#39;s all a balancing act between having your financial house in order while also having a fulfilling social life, health, and happiness"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I played for around 10 minutes, quite fun. Some comments:- how would you get 4% gains in real life? it makes a massive difference, but you&#39;re unlikely to reach this unless the money is put into the stock market- was unable to sell my property (the &#34;request valuation&#34; button does nothing)- the university option never showed up- there were no further jobs after ~12 years of career (stopped at something like engineering manager at ~45k/year which is very low for London)- advancing month-by-month is pretty slow. there should be a way of fast-forwarding to important events (new job, promotion, housing market goes up/down, etc)- had to transfer $ to savings / pension in batches every year or so, losing out on a lot of interest. should be possible to set a monthly amount- the expenses are way too stable to reflect real lifeI ended the simulation at 35 years old, with €200k savings, €60k mortage equity, and €80k on a pension fund. Living on a €100k house, no car, no gifts, no travel, no family. It&#39;s not bad, but for someone saving fiercely from 18 years without any major expenses it&#39;s not a great result. Getting a high-paying job (80k+) around your 30s will land you in the exact same place, while giving you 12 years to live more liberally."</p>
