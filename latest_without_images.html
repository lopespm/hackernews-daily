								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It makes me sad that so many engineers seem to think cheating is a just and or good solution. Cheating is objectively bad system design (for society, we&#39;re designing our society with daily actions every day), as it rewards people without integrity who want the easy way out. Sure, you can blame the system for encouraging incentives that reward cheating, and there are benefits to thinking like a cheater to identify gaps and problems in design, but we only have one life, and one go at growing the society we want to live in.By cheating, you&#39;re voting for a society of scammers, and you think you deserve more than the honest student because you&#39;re willing to eat honor instead of preserving it and growing it for future generations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This happened to me in undergrad with an autograded class. I remember soloing the class and thinking that the assignments were super hard. They would post grade averages for assignments and I was doing worse than usual.I remember a TA posting about cheating being an issue. They even released a graph of anonymized student repositories with edges indicating a detected instance of cheatingTurned out that a HUGE cohort of people were cheating (I think maybe over half the class).The scariest thing about cheating is that whenever a bunch of people do it (and aren&#39;t caught), it screws up the class curve so much that people who don&#39;t cheat will be forced to put in way more time studying, which will then take time away from other classes. It also screws up metrics that the professors and TAs use to understand how well they&#39;re teaching material, which assignments to drop, etcimo this is why people shouldn&#39;t cheat. If nobody cheats, the grades might on average be lower but once the class is curved or assignments are dropped it will be a fair indicator of where everyone is at. If people cheat, it screws up the fairness and can encourage others to start cheating. If everyone (or most) are cheating, you have people who aren&#39;t getting anything out of the class, getting credits as prerequisite that they shouldn&#39;t be getting, moving on to future classes and continuing the cycle"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recently took a CS class at Stanford with an interesting policy on cheating. While cheating almost certainly happened during the course, at the end of the quarter the course staff made a public post allowing any student who cheated to make a private message to the staff admitting they&#39;ve done so.If a student admitted to cheating, while they would face academic disciplinary action (i.e. receiving a failing or low grade), they would not be brought up to the administrative office that deals with issues of academic integrity, and therefore would not face consequences like expulsion or being on official academic probation.However if a cheating student decided to risk it and not admit their guilt, they were at risk of a potentially even greater degree punishment. The course staff would run all students code through a piece of software to detect similarities between each other, as well as online solutions. Students who were flagged by this software would then have their code hand-checked by at least one course staff, who would make a judgement call as to whether it seemed like cheating.I found this policy quite interesting. As a former high school teacher, I&#39;ve certain encountered teaching in my own classes, and have historically oscillated between taking a very harsh stance, or perhaps an overly permissive one.The one taken by the lecturers of this course offered a &#34;second chance&#34; to cheaters in a way I hadn&#39;t seen before."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is the missing piece on cloud for masses  * we already have compute scale-to-zero (cloudrun, lambda, fly.io).

  * Network is default pay for use. Storage (S3) is default pay for use.

  * The only piece in the stack that was always-on was the database (only serverless db thus far was firestore, or something like sqlite+litestream)

With something like this we get a solid RDBMS engineered to be scale-to-zero, and with good developer experience.This opens up a world of try-out mini applications that cost cents to host. serverless db (postgres) + serverless compute (cloud-run) + use as you go storage+network. This is a paradigm-shift stack. Exciting days ahead."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Neon allows to instantly branch your Postgres database to support a modern development workflow. You can create a branch for your test environments for every code deployment in your CI/CD pipeline.&gt; Branches are virtually free and implemented using the &#34;copy on write&#34; technique.Unless I missed that everyone supports this, this here could be a killer feature and should be advertised higher."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just yesterday I was comparing managed serverless postgres offers and was sad to temporarily end my investigation with a compromise of using managed aws RDS for development, hoping that a fully serverless postgres with a nice free tier would pop up before going to production, and here we are!Congrats to the team for what feels like an amazing product. Signed up for the early access, can&#39;t wait to get my hands on this!For anyone interested, these ere the DB offers I looked into:* DO managed postgres, no free tier but price scaling was not too aggressive, the issue is that it&#39;s not natively serverless and we&#39;re gonna get 100s of ephemeral connections.* Cockroach, was the best option for our use case but it doesn&#39;t support triggers and stored procedures, so we can&#39;t use it right now (closely following https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/28296)* Fly.io price scaling is too aggressive 6$ -&gt; 33 -&gt; 154 -&gt; 1000s a month and no free tier that I could find.* Aurora serverless v2  is only for aws internal access and we are using gcp.* Aurora v1 was what we were gonna go with, but a lot of people online have showed their negative opinion around slow scaling. I didn&#39;t investigate enough but I&#39;m thinking we&#39;d need to setup RDS proxy for it handle all our connections, which would&#39;ve bumped up the price by a good amount. Also no free tier.* Alloydb looked promising but also no free tier and starting price is a bit much for our current phase of development, but it was definitely something we&#39;d look into in the future.And now Neon, natively serverless with a (hopefully) good free tier to test things out and some hints about cross region data replication, amazing stuff!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One unique Firefox feature I love that I don&#39;t see talked about often is how awesome Firefox&#39;s address bar suggestions are. I can type just a snippet of a URL or a web page title and it&#39;ll instantly show me all matching URLs I&#39;ve visited, whether on my desktop or on my phone. It&#39;s become my primary second brain for finding Google docs, or articles I&#39;ve read, or GitHub issues. It&#39;s usually only a few characters before it finds exactly what I want.Eg I type in &#34;Ed&#34;? It shows the URL to my &#34;editions in solr&#34; GitHub issues I&#39;ve been working on recently. I vaguely recall an article I read months ago on CSS grid? I type &#34;grid guide&#34; and bam it&#39;s the first suggestion. The spreadsheet I made about user languages? &#34;sheets lang&#34;. That vague API I can never remember the parameters to? Just type &#34;/query.json?&#34; And I get all my previous requests as examples!I find Chrome&#39;s address bar has been way less reliable and much more frequently just gives me Google autocomplete suggestions -- even when I know that I visited a URL recently that should match!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"FireFox Containers are a killer feature for me. It allows you to run sandboxed sessions. So you can ostensibly make every site a private tab by default but have a small few sites persistent.Eg I’ll have a work group with GitHub, Okta, etc in it so I only need to log in once a day. But random websites cannot track me between sites.Couple that with DNS blocking of trackers and ads, and the web is actually a lot more pleasant to use.Unfortunately you cannot fix everything locally though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I honestly want to ditch Firefox and try a Chromium browser for a minute [1], but I&#39;m stuck on Firefox because it&#39;s the only one with a killer feature: send a tab to/from iOS and my Linux desktop.I skip Chrome and Edge for privacy reasons, Brave have a crappy and buggy sync feature that I don&#39;t know what OSes it supports, but not my combination. Can&#39;t send tabs with them. Vivaldi doesn&#39;t have an iOS port. Impossible to do with Chromium.Firefox can send tabs to all my machines, and I use that feature multiple times daily, such as finding a cool article while I&#39;m sitting on the couch and sending it to my desktop so I can read it later. Mr. Eich, if you&#39;re around here, please please fix syncing tabs in your browser, it&#39;s the only thing stopping me from switching honestly.--1: I quite like Firefox, but it&#39;s in a dying spiral, and I&#39;m starting to see broken sites. The Web is such a complicated nightmare &#34;protesting&#34; won&#39;t change anything, and forking neither, because it&#39;s too bloody complex. Chromium has won. Our only hope is Mozilla takes their head out of their arse and start working on their browser instead of faffing about and making small, meaningless changes every release, but I don&#39;t see that happening any time soon."</p>

					<h3><a href="https://www.bejarano.io/terraform-stateless/">Terraform should have remained stateless</a></h3>

					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31537319">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The article misses a key bit of information TF needs when making a plan:   4. The previous Terraform configuration

This is effectively stored by state.We need this because if a resource is removed from the new config then Terraform needs to be able to delete the existing resource from the world. If we don’t have the state then Terraform must either:    1. Not delete it from the world

    2. Or risk deleting something not managed by Terraform

If everything were managed by Terraform then perhaps we would not need state, but this is not realistic in my view."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I respectfully disagree. If TF was stateless, you&#39;d have to manage situations by hand that involve changing the idempotency key, such as the name of a VM. You&#39;d also have to manage situations by hand where a resource is removed from the config.The whole point of TF is that it has state and doesn&#39;t require workarounds for these scenarios. Yes, you have to maintain state, but the state problems usually come from buggy providers, not Terraform itself. For example, try and use the GitHub provider to create a repo with GitHub Pages enabled from the gh-pages branch. It won&#39;t work because the authors didn&#39;t respect a fundamental rule of writing a provider: one state-changing API call = one resource. If you don&#39;t respect that, you have to do state handling yourself and you&#39;re almost certain to have state-related bugs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Having worked with both Terraform and Ansible code that created AWS resources - and operates very similarly to the model described here [0, see `filters` arg] - I generally disagree.For example, if you changed an ID in your stateless Terraform, you&#39;d have to insert some kind of code to destroy (or rename, if possible) the old resource. Or modify the Terraform DSL to include that kind of information, I suppose, and keep a historical record in the code perhaps. Then there&#39;s the question of what happens if someone modifies the physical resource out from under you -- could end up creating brand new resources rather than tracking the existing ones.Also, it&#39;s nice to know that your Terraform instance is what created a thing -- if you ran a stateless `terraform destroy`, it&#39;s possible you could be deleting resources that someone else created that happened to match what your Terraform code defined. More of an edge case, I admit, but at scale these things have a way of happening...That said, resources that don&#39;t have &#34;physical&#34; IDs work similarly to the stateless model by necessity. For example, VPC route table rules: [1, see the &#34;Import&#34; section].Refactoring Terraform code is super annoying because of state, though, I&#39;ll give you that.[0]: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/amazon/a...

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Well done and thank you. Not just for the work, but for the attitude
and courage of your convictions that come across clearly in your
comments here on HN.Search is presently a neighbourhood of technology that&#39;s fallen into a
downtrodden ghetto. Maybe you&#39;ve sowed some seeds that can grow
between the cracks. But I think there are gangs and pushers roaming
the streets that would be happy for it remain derelict.Thinking about the dynamics of open source, with respect to the many
different interpretations of search that create tension within such a
project: It occurs to me that whenever a somewhat mature project
enters the ecosystem a robust strategy is to immediately clone-fork
multiple identical copies of a project. This is like a &#34;backup
strategy&#34;. From there, form several loosely coordinated project groups
that can spread risk, share threat intelligence, but each work with
different models of crawling, filtering, funding, presentation and so
on. Keep the original as an upstream parent. One of the children may
survive."</p>

This entire project was motivated by another HN post where someone was asking where we can get information about architectures and system designs across our industry. Seeing there wasn&#39;t anything available, I decided to start it; glad to see its resonated with the community.I hope to create high quality posts from engineers that work on these systems and the challenges they are trying to solve. Really dig into the problems and the technologies and strategies they used to solve it.What they have learned? Where they have failed?I also plan to write up deep technical dives on technologies we all rely on and use everyday.If there is any feedback to improve or you have something you want to write up with me please reach out."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I read a lot of comments here wanting to block the connections, but wouldn’t be easier/better to switch to an OS that doesn’t spy you? The answers possibly is no, because they might use X or Y that requires them to use Windows, so a better question is, what holds you back to switch to Linux? (macOS also talks to a lot of servers and collect telemetry as Windows, maybe in a different scale, so isn’t an alternative if you are worried about your data being collected).I personally prefer Linux, but what’s holding me are the streaming services (netflix, amazon, etc), I can only watch SD content if I’m on Linux, so my second opinion is macOS, I can watch at least in a decent resolution and also their notebooks are the best ones out there (the air is amazing between price, performance and battery life) for my use case, that’s also work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There seems to be some degree of overcounting in the reported figures: the number of “hosts” is the number of unique hostnames in the table, but the number of “IPs” is a straightforward sum of IP address counts that the table segregates by service, and I refuse to believe that (e.g.) the IP address of login.live.com as resolved by OneDrive is always different from same as resolved by Skype.  $ curl -fsSL &#39;https://helgeklein.com/blog/windows-os-services-apps-network-connection-target-hosts/&#39; | pup &#39;td:nth-child(5)&#39; text{} | sed &#39;s/:.*$//&#39; | sort -u | wc -l

  2764

There’s also a fair amount of infrastructural stuff such as DigiCert’s OCSP service, and every shard(?) in the Windows Update, OneDrive, etc. CDNs is counted as a separate hostname.Not that I’m happy about of any of these connections, but the report looks much less interesting than the totals alone suggest."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s time we start legislating based on empirical evidence instead of lofty ideals. Yes, if everyone was responsible perhaps it would be OK for all of us to own firearms. But so many people are utterly irresponsible, and guns make that irresponsibility lethal.People should safely store their fire-arms, but they don&#39;t and guns get stolen and sold illegally, or used by their teenage child.People shouldn&#39;t point a gun at someone unless their life is in danger and they&#39;re prepared to take a life, but they do and people get shot by accident, or road rage turns deadly.Not to mention the suicides. If you own a gun ideation can turn into action in less than 30 seconds and it can seem like a painless, easy way to go.And when everyone is armed everyone wants to be armed. Cops pull their guns quickly out of fear of armed criminals. Regular people want to own a gun because they feel like everyone else does, and they&#39;re now less safe unless they also get one.Growing up outside the US I never saw any guns. I don&#39;t know of anyone who had a gun. I don&#39;t know of anyone who knew anyone who had a gun. I remember seeing military members in parades carrying guns because it was one of the few times I&#39;d actually seen one. Cops didn&#39;t walk around armed. There are other ways to kill people but guns are an especially effective, intuitive, and easy way to do so."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a foreigner, I do not see it as productive to seek any explanation or expect any reaction when yet another news story like this comes along.It&#39;s clear that this is the way Americans wish to live, and it is their perogative to do so."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think a good first step everyone can agree on to stop gun violence is: stop it&#39;s gamification.Almost every mass shooting in the last decade was someone looking for media attention and  high score. And yet, every shooting is followed by detailed biography and a tally of bodies.Something as simple as a one month moratorium on information for anyone outside the community would probably work wonders, as the public eye will have moved on by then."</p>
