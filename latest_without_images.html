								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Google&#39;s Knowledge Graph info boxes are automatically-generated and littered with errors. I&#39;ve been burned twice on operating hours, once for my local bank and once for a convenience store, driving over each time only to find the place closed. In both cases, the correct hours were posted on the business&#39;s website. I&#39;ve also seen bad KG results for medical conditions, listing the wrong symptoms or describing easily-treatable maladies as &#34;Incurable&#34;. Now I actively ignore the info box and intentionally click through to an authoritative non-Google website.To a non-technical user, I&#39;m sure the box looks like a human-curated result which they&#39;re more likely to trust. Maybe that&#39;s the goal of Google&#39;s UI choices. Couldn&#39;t be further from the truth."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You should seriously consider suing for defamation if this isn&#39;t fixed within a few days.  This is an egregious error, especially if it was done by an automated system (and this could be a systemic issue affecting many others).I think you have a decent chance of getting a five figure+ settlement from this. Talk to a lawyer about your options.EDIT: When I search &#34;Hristo Georgiev&#34; (from US IP) there is no longer an image in the infobox. (As of 21:55:10 UTC, June 24, 2021)I think a google engineer saw this HN post :-D(You could still talk to a lawyer - remedying it now does not alter the fact that you were previously defamed.  But Google has a stronger position having now remedied it)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; It turns out that Google&#39;s knowledge graph algorithm somehow falsely associated my photo with the Wikipedia article about the serial killer. Which is also surprisingly strange because my name isn&#39;t special or unique at all; there are literally hundreds of other people with my name, and despite of all that, my personal photo ended up being associated with a serial killer. I can&#39;t really explain to myself how this happened, but it&#39;s weird. In any case, I am now in the process of reporting this Knowledge Graph bug to Google.I believe that there is a simpler explanation.The Wikipedia article is there in that side box because it is the top hit for &#34;hristo georgiev&#34; on Google&#39;s main search page. The picture is there because it is the top hit for &#34;hristo georgiev&#34; on Google&#39;s image search page."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Utterly astounded and dismayed to see this much of HN&#39;s audience completely fail to comprehend what they&#39;ve read here and paint this as some sort of sinister theft.This is the law functioning as intended.  Thiel&#39;s case is a one-in-100-million+ event.  He may have the only Roth IRA in existence that&#39;s valued at over $5 billion.  But he didn&#39;t do it by exploiting some sort of &#34;loophole&#34; or paying high-priced accountants to shield his assets in foreign entities offshore.  He put his investments in a Roth IRA just like any of you can do.  The only difference is his investments were in the top 0.0001% in terms of performance.  That&#39;s generally how people get to be billionaires.And that&#39;s not even to mention that the assets in a Roth IRA are essentially worthless to him - he&#39;s not old enough to make withdrawals or take distributions tax-free and you can&#39;t borrow against a Roth IRA.  The funds are essentially unavailable to him for years to come unless he wants to pay taxes and penalties.Again - this isn&#39;t a tax dodge.  This is someone who used the law exactly as intended without any illegal or shady dealings and happened to be incredibly fortunate.The whole article is a hit piece designed to get whip people into a furor.  And lately I&#39;ve been noticing propublica publishing a lot of those."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"IANAL but this topic is of interest.Without commenting on whether this was legal at the time Thiel made this transaction, it appears it would not be permissible under current tax law. (Update: the relevant text in the statute appears to have been in effect as early as 1995: https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?hl=false&amp;edition=1994&amp;re...)
 Specifically, the law explicitly disqualifies anyone who is:&gt;an officer, director (or an individual having powers or responsibilities similar to those of officers or directors), a 10 percent or more shareholder, or a highly compensated employee (earning 10 percent or more of the yearly wages of an employer) of a person described in subparagraph (C), (D), (E), or (G)(Source: https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/4975)So the relatively plain language would almost certainly include anyone who&#39;s a co-founder involved in actively managing a company today.This kind of blatant tax avoidance is going to end badly for our tax regime, which is likely to overcorrect."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I don&#39;t understand about this whole maneuver is that Roth transactions must be made at arms length; ie, &#34;Transactions must be made at arm’s length and not involve the IRA owner or a member of his or her family.&#34;An example of this is that if you use a Roth to invest in property, you are not allowed to use it personally, not allowed to manage it or do maintenance yourself, etc.Prohibited transactions risk tainting (and thus exposing) the entire account.How is Thiel investing in his own company not considered a prohibited investment?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"NewsBlur&#39;s founder here. I&#39;ll attempt to explain what&#39;s happening.This situation is more of a script kiddie than a hacker. I&#39;m in the process of moving everything on NewsBlur over to Docker containers in prep for the big redesign launching next week. It&#39;s been a great year of maintenance and I&#39;ve enjoyed the fruits of Ansible + Docker for NewsBlur&#39;s 5 database servers (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Elasticsearch, and soon ML models).About two hours before this happened, I switched the MongoDB cluster over to the new servers. When I did that, I shut down the original primary in order to delete it in a few days when all was well. (Thank goodness I did that! It&#39;ll come in handy a few hours from now).Turns out the ufw firewall I enabled and diligently kept on a strict allowlist with only my internal servers didn&#39;t work on a new server because of Docker. When I containerized MongoDB, Docker helpfully inserted an allow rule into iptables, opening up MongoDB to the world. So while my firewall was &#34;active&#34;, doing a `sudo iptables -L | grep 27017` showed that MongoDB was open the world. More info on SO[1].To be honest, I&#39;m a bit surprised it took over 3 hours from when I flipped the switch to when a script kiddie dropped NewsBlur&#39;s MongoDB collections, and ransomed about 250GB of data. I am now running a snapshot on that old primary, just in case it reconnects to a network and deletes everything. Once done, I&#39;ll boot it up, secondary it out, and be back in business. Let&#39;s hope my assumptions hold.[1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30383845/what-is-the-bes..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From a quick skim through https://github.com/samuelclay/newsblur for models extending mongo.Document, it looks like the following private customer data has been breached:- all story content from all private feeds- any uploaded OPML files, including URLs for any private RSS feeds- User’s twitter/facebook account info and access tokens, if the user had linked those services with their newsblur account- all data that would be used to create a user profile page, including email address, whether the user had a public profile or notHowever most personal data, such as password hashes and billing info, was stored in postgres."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"10:35p ET: Looks like the snapshot will take 10 hours to make. Ordinarily this wouldn&#39;t be a problem becuase the service is running and a snapshot would be made on a secondary DB. But all of the Mongo DBs faithfully deleted their data, so I&#39;m taking a snapshot of a recent good backup. Once done, I can replicare the DB and we&#39;ll be back.9:54p ET: Holy moly, when I switched to a new Mongo DB server, a hacker deleted all of NewsBlur’s mongo data and is now holding NewsBlur’s data hostage. I’m dipping into a backup from a few hours ago and will keep you all updated.They&#39;ve also given some info on twitter https://twitter.com/NewsBlur that I haven&#39;t digested yet."</p>

They are just old fashioned.As a small indie developer, I could not afford to keep on fighting. I gave up. I was a psychological wreck. And since it is not binding, big entities can afford to sue you non-stop.Hamburg was the second time I was in a court. I got sued by the same big corporation.

We can vote for the Greens without &#34;throwing our left-of-centre&#34; vote away and still preferring Labor to Liberal. Ranking only up to 5 is reasonable - if you want the simplicity of the old system, and don&#39;t want to research beyond 3 candidates, don&#39;t!I can&#39;t see the weird complaining about having to learn more about candidates - there&#39;s usually only a few viable well-known candidates. You don&#39;t have to go research the Natural Law Party or Animal Justice or whoever.The only cautionary tale is the whole horse-trading element of preferences does lead to some weird candidates making it in at the margins. We had someone who was semi-famous for engaging in a Kangaroo poo fight get in this way:https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/it-was-people-play-w...But this &#34;preference whispering&#34; is more of a big deal when preferences were allocated by parties - we had an option where you could vote a single &#39;1&#39; for a given party and it was their preferences that wound up being automatically applied (if you didn&#39;t go through hand-numbering all the preferences).

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This isn&#39;t very good reporting by NPR.  The downsides they list are just straw men easily dismissed by RCV proponents, and they give an appearance of fair-and-balanced coverage while making opponents of RCV sound like Luddites.  (It also seems like they got all their information from, say, chatting with people from FairVote and not by actually reading online discussions like this one here.)RCV does have some serious problems.  Eliminating the candidate with the least first-place votes at each round means a high probability of rejecting compromise candidates that may be a lot of voters&#39; second choice.  Also, placing your first-choice candidate first isn&#39;t always a safe choice.  RCV is non-monotonic, which means it&#39;s possible that ranking someone first might actually cause them to lose.  That&#39;s weird, and I think it&#39;s a good enough reason to investigate other options.I think we should use approval voting in single-winner state and national elections.  It&#39;s simple and it solves the problem of 3rd party candidates being spoilers (which is why most voting reform advocates dislike FPTP in the first place) without introducing any new problems.  STAR is also a pretty good system.Approval voting is currently used in Fargo ND and they recently adopted it in St. Louis as well.There&#39;s a lot at stake when we change our election systems.  I think one of the biggest risks is that we adopt RCV widely and then when people figure out that it&#39;s not actually all that great, they aren&#39;t going to want to try something different.  They&#39;ll either say &#34;democracy just doesn&#39;t work very well and there&#39;s nothing we can do about it&#34;, or they&#39;ll go back to FPTP because they were misled by a successful PR campaign that sounds like it has the backing of voting system experts.  Voting systems should be changed rarely, and when it happens we should use the best available system, not chase the latest fad."</p>
