Now, even with little change to statutory law, most see that the best interpretation of the various traditional categories, exceptions, &amp; affordances of copyright law is the one that finds legal space for a Wayback Machine.Bulk-scanning books-still-in-copyright, even for private preservation/use? Was legally iffy when Google &amp; IA started doing it; now better recognized as legitimate.Accepting user/collector uploads of live concerts? Storing, serving, &amp; providing emulated environments for old still-in-copyright retail PC/game/arcade software? Bulk-archiving &amp; replaying TV news broadcasts? All iffy when IA started doing them, becoming accepted as reasonable over time by the demonstration-of-utility.An Internet Archive that waited for legal clarity before starting such projects would still be waiting today – and we&#39;d have neither the valuable projects, nor the accumulated experience/clarity, from the actual doing, about what is reasonable &amp; beneficial."</p>

Currently it&#39;s all located in the US and they have a huge focus on the US, both technically and politically.But why not try to replicate it all over the world? There seems to have been some smaller efforts inside the Internet Archive to make it more decentralized, but it feels like it should be a much bigger focus on it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My interest in science started when a friend and I folded a few paper planes, tested them over a small downhill section outside my house, made notes about what worked, tweaked and experimented with new designs, and so on. It blew my little mind that with structured experimentation you could design things that actually got better with each generation. Where would the improvements stop?With hindsight, I realise that most of the improvements we measured were really just statistical noise. We never had a control plane, so if one by accident flew better one test, then we would tweak something and then we would naturally see regression to the mean, but we would record that as a tweak that made things worse.To little me it was a lesson in deliberate design. To grown-up me I guess it&#39;s a lesson in how easy it is to delude yourself without proper experiment design and statistics.Anyway, then after seeing my interest my father brought me an early Windows program that contained animated instructions on some paper plane designs. One of them was vastly superior to anything I had ever seen. But with the years, I forgot how to fold it. I had been looking for it for over 20 years when a few months ago, I wanted to show my son (of two years) a good paper plane and guess what? I think I&#39;ve found the design! But it took a blurry YouTube video and some trial and error. I ought to write it down some day."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In fourth grade we had a paper airplane contest, but they had a restriction on the design: a circle about the size of a quarter was on the page, and no fold or crease could go through the circle.The circle was located a few inches above the exact center of the paper.Anyway I made a &#34;dart&#34;, and just offset the angle a little to avoid the circle. It was good, and most of the competition was incredibly bad. And a few maybe had a bad launch. One throw only.One clever design was submitted by a duo composed of my two worst nine year old enemies: Derek and Derek&#39;s sidekick. It was basically a UFO (saucer) made by carefully crumpling the edge until it was a nice size to throw. They threw it sidearm with one finger hooked around the rim.It really sailed, maybe went twice as far as the second best plane: my plane.But their plane was disqualified on the grounds that it wasn&#39;t a plane. So, I was deemed winner.For the announcements the next morning, my name was announced as the wrong-gendered version (something like Jesse announced as Jessica) and it definitely didn&#39;t feel like a win anymore.I still like paper airplanes, though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a kid I had a great book with lots of science experiments in it called &#34;Science Is&#34; (Author: Susan V. Bosak)It had an entire section on airplanes but there was one that absolutely destroyed my intuition about flight and to this day confuses adults whenever I get the chance to make it (something like a team building event where we need to make paper airplanes).It&#39;s literally two hoops of paper and a stick. Here&#39;s a page I found with the design.https://www.exploratorium.edu/science_explorer/hoopster.html"</p>

That was my catalyst to quit.I stood by the review and Glassdoor notified me that the employer pulled back on the legal action. My review is still there. And Glassdoor did their best to not reveal my identity under the threat of legal action -- not until absolutely necessary."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To everyone replying with their coffee preferences, you may be missing the point. This post isn’t about coffee, it’s about people and experiences in life being more important than products. It’s about a product’s quality being defined not by its substance but by its reminder of things that can’t be purchased. It’s one of the most beautiful posts I’ve seen in a long time. Hope you look beyond the coffee.Edit: Hope I didn&#39;t come across as too harsh to folks replying with their favourite coffee styles. I think I find myself in a near-constant state of, &#34;but what about the things that matter&#34; when spending time in VC/Startup/SV/AI/crypto/etc. culture. I know more unhappy-but-wildly-successful people here than I can shake a stick at, and I think we (as a community) are hugely complicit in pushing a consumerist culture where stuff&gt;people. I was deeply moved to see a piece surface to HN which poetically argued for the opposite value set, and I had a moment of frustration when it wasn&#39;t clear that it was coming across to people in the comments. :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve gone through several coffee phases, some bordering on extreme — extremely sensitive weighing, timing, $2,000 grinders, $10k espresso machine, etc.My happy medium is just doing basic pour overs, but with really good locally roasted coffee. To me, this is the cheapest and best approach.In fact, even if pour overs require too much work (weighing, timing), then just do drip. But do it with quality coffee.Quality is really about roasting time and date. You don’t want old coffee (anything older than a few weeks isn’t good), and low temp. Dark roast is burnt. It’s not a flavor. It’s used to remove the taste from shitty beans. If you use quality beans you want light to medium. This usually isn’t an option with quality beans anyway. They typically only sell the coffee roasted one way. So in most cases, you won’t even have to worry about.Anyway, I guess my point is the opposite of the article. You don’t have to drink shit coffee to save money."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This was a really beautiful post.As for coffee, like many other parts of life (movies, food, and music especially), I find that I like it very good or very bad—as long as it’s not down the middle, I can find a time/place to enjoy it.I have a fairly expensive Rocket Espresso machine, I’ve learned some latte art. I have every coffee making contraption out there. And I enjoy all of it, at times.When I’m in a hurry I’ll make instant or go to a gas station. Totally fine and the gas station coffee is kind of a favorite of mine for long trips in the car.What I almost never do is buy Starbucks because to me, it feels like that middle-of-the-road experience. I’m not making a statement about the company or the culture or anything like that. It just feels like going to Applebees or something (yes you’re out to eat, but shouldn’t you just go somewhere nice or, on the other hand, somewhere cheaper/faster where you don’t have to tip?). It’s too acidic and too expensive for what it is. I’d rather pay for something nicer or go cheap."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I read the books and enjoyed them.- To respond to one criticism seen widely here, the authors claim to have validated ages with historical municipal birth records in all the Blue Zones. I cannot speak to these particular zones, but I&#39;ve been doing genealogical research on my own ancestry and I am absolutely blown away by the ubiquity and detail of both municipal and Catholic church records in Sicily in the 1800s.  Preunification Italy was under the rule of various northern European countries and was heavily influenced by their standards of record keeping. I cannot say if this applies to the other countries in the book, but generally speaking, just because these records are old doesn&#39;t mean they are bad.- One thing that was very notable in the books but isn&#39;t discussed very much is that, with the exception of the Loma Linda cohort, the Blue Zone areas are all quite poor. They all primarily eat food they are able to grow or harvest themselves, out of necessity, which encourages simple and consistent diets. They have routine, simple lives that are made fulfilling by concentrating on community, family, and friends.  They are content with what little they have and do not strive for more than they need.I found the books quite inspiring.  I think the lessons learned are good, even if they won&#39;t get me to 100.  In any case I&#39;ve felt much better and lost weight on a closer-to-Blue-Zone diet than I did before."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One Ikarian in particular, Stamatis Moraitis, moved to America when he was 22 years old to pursue the American dream. He was a painter, and immediately started having success, bought a house, married, and had 3 kids. At the age of 66 years, he developed terminal lung cancer. Instead of dying in America, he decided to move back to Ikaria and moved in with his parents. He started breathing the air, drinking the wine, and eating a Mediterranean diet. After a few months, he planted a garden not planning on ever getting to harvest the vegetables; 37 years later he has a vineyard producing 200 L of wine a year. His secret he says? “I just forgot to die.”This is where I think the article loses its credibility significantly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I lived in Loma Linda for a few years (in Southern California, 60 miles east of LA), which is one of the blue zonesIt is predominantly a 7th day Adventist community. Notably they prioritize healthy lifestyle and typically are vegetarian as well as avoiding alcohol, caffeine, etc.There is also a big medical school and hospital complex in the city and many people that live there work in the healthcare field.There are of course plenty of other explanations."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I planted some thousands of trees in Iceland in the noughties. I believe the program was funded by Alcoa to offset the carbon produced by an aluminum plant they were building on the island. They paid farmers to plant trees on unused land, and the farmers hired and hosted us to do the work. It was an amazing way to see the country. We mostly planted larch, birch and alder from what I remember. It is a very beautiful country, like an arctic Hawaii."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Planting forests increases the overall amount of carbon stored in biomass, but the forestry program is also designed to harvest trees for use as fuel or building material (from the main article linked in the post):&gt; &#34;In the meantime, Iceland’s forests have begun to produce wood for a small timber market. Forests planted between 1950-1970 are now supplying around 5,000 square metres of wood per year: miniscule compared to industries abroad, but a start. The Icelandic birch, Siberian larch, Sitka spruce, lodgepole pine and balsam poplar are producing quality wood of equal or superior quality to that which Iceland imports from abroad. Yet an overwhelming 80% of the trees felled are burned as fuel in silicon smelting.&#34;Iceland has a silicon production industry, which relies on geothermal electricity interestingly enough.  The wood is included to grab the oxygen from silicon dioxide to produce elemental silicon metal (being emitted as carbon dioxide).  Overall, if they could eliminate the coal from the mix, this would be a carbon-neutral fossil-fuel free silicon production system:https://www.pcc.is/&gt; &#34;Silicon metal is extracted from quartzite, aided by the addition of wood chip and coal, in electric arc furnaces at temperatures of around 2,000 degrees Celsius. The new plant obtains its key raw material quartzite primarily from PCC’s own quarry in Zagórze, Poland. However, the related logistical costs are more than outweighed by the advantages of electricity procurement. And the dust emissions generated during silicon metal production are almost completely removed from the ambient air by high-performance filter systems installed in the PCC plant. Taken as a whole, therefore, the production process offers exceptional sustainability credentials.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just came from a trip to Iceland and most of the country had no trees. Some corners had a little, there were also obvious plantations. There was one place that had old forest and was in other respects very magical: Ásbyrgi Canyon. Just downstream from Dettifoss which was an insane experience by itself.From what I have gathered the biggest obstacle to tree regrowth in Iceland are sheep which can roam anywhere in the island for I think 4 months in the year and just eat saplings.Obviously the sheep farming industry does not want to hear about limiting their herding areas and you can guess the result."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My favorite feature is &#34;video-sync=display-resample&#34;. This gives you perfect frame pacing by synchronizing the video to vertical refresh and resampling the audio to match. If you set your refresh rate to an integer multiple of the frame rate, every frame will be shown for the exact same time. The audio resampling compensates for very small discrepancies between speeds by imperceptibly changing the audio speed. It&#39;s similar to the proprietary DirectShow filter &#34;ReClock&#34;, but AFAIK ReClock does not dynamically adjust the speed to compensate for clock drift like MPV does, in which case you could theoretically still get imperfect frame pacing. (I haven&#39;t actually used ReClock so I could be mistaken here.)Also great is MPV&#39;s support for arbitrary OpenGL shaders. This can include very complicated shaders, e.g. real-time neural network upscaling:https://github.com/igv/FSRCNN-TensorFlow/releasesSD video can look surprisingly good after upscaling with this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I highly recommend doing what I have done most of my career. Get a job at smaller to medium sized non-tech company. Every company, in any industry, has computers. They need you. You don&#39;t have to work with a bunch of tech or finance people. You can get a job working with chill people in some other industry with a better culture.When it comes time to negotiate, negotiate HARD. And not just for money, but especially time. Ask for so much that you think they will laugh or be scared away. If they say no, you lose nothing. Eventually the right opportunity will appear. I didn&#39;t think anyone would say yes to a 4-day work week, but I kept asking. Eventually someone said yes.The one worry I am having these days is how long this strategy will remain viable. As SaaS and low/no code solutions proliferate, it makes little sense for non-tech companies to build when they can buy. This is especially true as engineer compensation continues to rise. Engineers who congregate at SaaS companies can build better products than a handful out on their own who are building a solution for just one company. Increasingly, the only engineers that non-tech companies need are people to manage their data, people to glue the SaaS APIs together, and maybe some frontend people to put a custom interface on it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think most people here can. That&#39;s why, when people have enough money to retire, they DO retire, and not continue working. Work for most people is trading  time and physical and mental health for money. In our profession, we got it better than most, but the underlying principle is still the same.Also, there are definitely better and worse companies. I&#39;m currently in the best job of my life (well paying, fully remote, very little meetings, no micromanagement, using interesting and cutting edge technology), but it took me 15 years to get there. The catch is that such companies don&#39;t have to hire that often (because people don&#39;t tend to leave them), so most openings at the market in any given moment are from shit companies where average tenure is 18-24 months and half of the staff has low-grade depression. The job market is essentially a market for lemons, unfortunately."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel exactly the same. Programming professionally for a decade sucked all the joy out of it.My personal hypothesis is that we’re increasingly being treated like assembly line workers. We’re not paid to think but to implement the poorly thought out hare brained schemes from the higher ups who have no clue about programming. This externalizes all the cost of poor quality software onto the developers (unmaintainable code, constant outages…) while  reaping the short term benefits for themselves (promotions, raises)."</p>

It&#39;s true though - the Government missions involved, where this type of data is relevant, face rather compelling offerings especially in complex times; e.g. immigrant/refugee surges where understanding the flow of people up to the border is important for stability.All of this data comes from Big/Small/all tech; usually branded as &#34;ad tech&#34; or &#34;mobility data&#34;. And the supply chain is rather murky, masked, and rebranded/repackaged numerous times between a network of data providers &amp; downstream businesses.Working close to Government... I&#39;ve never seen any mission specifically seeking large-scale citizen-based tracking capabilities.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Aside stopping the use of Facebook, which of course is the best solution but not doable for many, the AdNauseam (.io, browser extension) approach to pollute their tracking data might be inspirational.
The gist is: can&#39;t eliminate ad links? Then have an app &#34;click&#34; all of them randomly so that counters become irrelevant. So there is this link that identifies user X?, well then write an extension that distributes and &#34;clicks&#34; it around on say 1000 other machines in a p2p way so that it becomes meaningless.I have no idea if it&#39;s doable in this FB context, but usually when links can&#39;t be anonymized, the next move is to make them produce irrelevant data by adding noise."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I haven&#39;t used Facebook in quite a while, but when I did I had a set of userscripts to defuse this tracking. It worked similarly to Google link stripping, by defusing the JavaScript that rewrote the link between the time you clicked it and when your browser opened it. Initially I built it because the free wireless internet in my apartment was unreliable and the redirects could be enough to prevent a page from opening. My method was pretty blunt - I removed element entities that held the target URL, and that broke the listener function. A later iteration would actually unset the listener event. This all worked because it seemed important to FB that you be able to see where the link would take you (e.g. by hovering). I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if Facebook&#39;s paternalism (and Google&#39;s for that matter, but I haven&#39;t seen it from them, though I mainly use DDG now) now led them to add this &#34;protection&#34; directly to links as they&#39;re served up. I can&#39;t tell from the article whether that&#39;s the case, and at this point I&#39;m not going to log in to FB to figure it out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I would love to stop using Facebook, Instagram or Whatsapp, but I would really need to criple my social life if I&#39;d give up on any of these. And I&#39;m not even a very active person, it&#39;s just that so many people I want to engage with have a huge chunk of their lives tied to one of these.I can&#39;t understand the people saying there is a free market choice here, this can only be solved with simple regulation that targest large platforms.If the SEC can use its judgement on what constitutes a security, than we can have a social media comission to oversee Facebook."</p>
