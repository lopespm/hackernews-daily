								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is good. The backing of stablecoins is a very real issue. As the Treasury points out, there&#39;s a very real possibility of a run. Two stablecoins have crashed so far, SafeDollar SDO, and $TITAN.  They went all the way to zero.Can Tether survive a net outflow? Probably not. They don&#39;t have the collateral.Dai is really a derivative of Etherium. Dai is backed by Etherium at 150%. So
value in Dai is at risk if the price of Etherium drops more than 1/3.  Etherium dropped by half back in May 2021, but recovered. DAI could have crashed at that time if it faced a net outflow. It didn&#39;t, though.The real question is what happens in the next recession."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; To address risks to stablecoin users and guard against stablecoin runs, legislation should require stablecoin issuers to be insured depository institutions, which are subject to appropriate supervision and regulation, at the depository institution and the holding company level.&gt; To address concerns about payment system risk, in addition to the requirements for stablecoin issuers, legislation should require custodial wallet providers4 to be subject to appropriate federal oversight. Congress should also provide the federal supervisor of a stablecoin issuer with the authority to require any entity that performs activities that are critical to the functioning of the stablecoin arrangement to meet appropriate risk-management standards.&gt; To address additional concerns about systemic risk and concentration of economic power, legislation should require stablecoin issuers to comply with activities restrictions that limit affiliation with commercial entities. Supervisors should have authority to implement standards to promote interoperability among stablecoins. In addition, Congress may wish to consider other standards for custodial wallet providers, such as limits on affiliation with commercial entities or on use of users’ transaction data.AKA StableCoin operators should be banks. (Stable Coins will be bank notes)?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting to read this with an eye on the authors&#39; mindset.  Their understanding of stablecoins seems largely centered on Tether (and to a lesser extent, BUSD/USDC).  A lot of their understanding is incorrect when applied to algorithmic stablecoins like Dai, eg. there is no central issuing authority; Dai is minted in exchange for Ethereum (and other cryptocurrencies), not fiat currencies; the effect of a run on Dai is unlikely to spill over into the mainstream financial system; a &#34;custodial wallet&#34; in DeFi is not a company but just an Ethereum address, i.e. a hash of a public/private keypair.Overall I get the sense that the government is still people/organization centric and cannot wrap its head around a future where reality is determined by computer code and people are bit players in the script."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This was a pretty interesting thing to mitigate - we added some support around it to GitLab after it was reported to us, which shipped in the latest security release: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/commit/3fb44197195b57... (you can actually see it in effect on that commit&#39;s examples, which is quite meta). These characters have valid use-cases in right-to-left languages like Arabic, Japanese etc, so it had to be configurable for project-owners if they have legitimate use-cases for it. Our focus was on making sure that repository maintainers could see these characters in code reviews.The homoglyph attack is interesting but it really should be noticed as part of a code review process, as it requires adding the imitation function calls at some point too. It&#39;d also likely be pretty frustrating to end users if we were to highlight every single unicode character that looks like the latin alphabet.It&#39;s certainly a good lesson in not copy/pasting random snippets from the internet and pasting them into a root shell, however :D (we do always highlight the bidi characters on GitLab snippets, though)Aside: this was a royal pain in the arse to figure out if I had live examples in the specs, because vim also just rendered them &#34;correctly&#34;. I ended up checking the files in Windows Notepad on another machine to sanity check them.Thanks to the authors for responsible disclosure."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As I previously noted on a related post:Interesting paper. Note, however, that the general problem is already known and there are a number of pre-existing works that discuss it. This is typically called &#34;underhanded code&#34; or sometimes &#34;maliciously misleading code&#34;. I&#39;m surprised that they didn&#39;t use the normal term for the problem nor cite the previous work on it - maybe they didn&#39;t realize this was a widely-known problem? Previous works on underhanded code didn&#39;t discuss Bidi to my knowledge (though other attacks on text like this have exploited Bidi).
Here are a number of other materials about underhanded code:The Obfuscated V Contest (http://graphics.stanford.edu/~danielh/vote/vote.html) was created by Daniel Horn in 2004 and is the earliest “underhanded” programming contest that I found. It was a contest to create source code that looked like it did one thing, but actually did another.Underhanded C Contest (http://www.underhanded-c.org/) has run in many years. Per its FAQ, &#34;The Underhanded C Contest is an annual contest to write innocent-looking C code implementing malicious behavior.&#34;My PhD dissertation &#34;Fully Countering Trusting Trust through Diverse Double-Compiling&#34; discusses how to counter the &#34;trusting trust&#34; problem &amp; includes a section about maliciously misleading source code. See: https://dwheeler.com/trusting-trust/The JavaScript Misdirection Contest announced the winner on September 27, 2015 http://misdirect.ion.land/My paper &#34;Initial Analysis of Underhanded Source Code&#34;, (by David A. Wheeler, April, 2020, IDA document: D-13166), discusses underhanded code and the effectiveness of several potential countermeasures. It also includes a number of citations to other works on underhanded code.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m not an economist. I am a consumer, though.  And I&#39;m older, so I have &#39;habits&#39; that don&#39;t tend to change.My rent has gone up 30%.  What used to cost me 100 something in groceries now regularly goes into the 200s.I&#39;m nothing if not an observationalist, but this CPI is horse dung.For someone like my family, I wouldn&#39;t believe any number less than 20%.The sad thing is, I&#39;ve never talked to a single friend or family member that said otherwise.So what is the government reporting?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Many older people saved large amounts of money in their bank accounts, and were expecting to live off the interest in their savings account once they retired. The interest they were due was effectively stolen when the central banks started giving away free money, it was a massive transfer of wealth.Many of that same generation counted on Social Security, and CPI adjustments to help save them from poverty.  The CPI numbers were pushed down to keep the costs of benefits those retirees were entitled to receive artificially low.  Another transfer of wealth / theft.Now the rest of the population has seen their crappy but steady wages evaporate on a whim, and will no longer settle for less than an actual living wage.  A rebalancing is going to have to take place, and somehow the wealth needs to be transferred back to the working class, or things will get very violent, very quickly. Once that kicks off, our near peers will funnel weapons into the US, and a civil war will make us the latest 3rd world country."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My read on this is that it seems like the equivalent of a subtweet about pay inequality.If that is indeed the case then they should be arguing for something I wrote the SEC about a couple of years ago which is to have public companies report their salary costs broken down by executive pay and non-executive management pay and non-executive non-management pay. And to report the population of individuals in each cohort.That &#39;pie&#39; of payroll costs can be split up anyway a company chooses, but the weighting of it will allow investors to understand the future prospects of a company that under pays its rank and file relative to its executives and management."</p>

And if it&#39;s not a small thing then you&#39;re just a conspiracy theorist that hates democracy.In the past the EU passed a directive that required all ISPs to save what websites you visited.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Probably what&#39;s going on is that someone on the board of trusties gets money from the political establishment in Florida and is worried that they&#39;ll lose it if the voting barriers are fixed and different leadership is elected.This has similarities with the shenanigans pulled by Sinema and Manchin around the Build Back Better plan. Political horse trading to advance the agendas of special interests, at great expense to millions of people.I wonder if the tech community could get involved to increase transparency around this stuff. Imagine if we had an open graph of the money flow so we could write a SQL query like (pseudo code) &#34;select * from donors where payee in (select id from trustees)&#34;. Let people crowdsource the data and then maintain a page of declarative queries so that anyone can instantly see the web of money around public officials. It could be part of a build system that automatically creates a NASCAR jacket for each official so we could see who their donors are in AR.Maybe such a thing already exists. It&#39;s traditionally been accomplished by investigative journalists and lawyers, but why couldn&#39;t it be public? It seems like it would be an effective way to end the bribe system."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For the lawyers:Can&#39;t a lawyer wishing to have these professors testify as expert witnesses merely motion for them to be subpoenaed?As far as I know, then by law the expert witnesses must testify else risk contempt of court, thereby negating whatever &#34;bar&#34; that the university seems fit to impose."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a colleague who does environmental litigation. (Think Erin Brockovich.) They have a big civil case against a large energy company in a southern, “energy-friendly” state. They had an expert witness all lined up - a professor at the (public!) state university. Well this expert happened to be up for tenure and was (allegedly) told in no uncertain terms that, should they testify as an expert witness in this case, tenure was off the table.It’s absolutely outrageous that we allow those in positions of power to manipulate the justice system in such a way."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have a Model 3. The autopilot was acting weird while driving on the freeway, sometime disengaging, but mostly not tracking the lane smoothly. For an unrelated reason, I opted to view my camera footage, and was shocked to find that my camera was completely blurry. I’m driving down the freeway at 75mph, being guided by a camera that couldn’t pass a standard driver’s vision test.Tesla came out to replace the camera, and it appeared that a film had been deposited on the windshield, obscuring the camera.Living in Phoenix, my car is parked outside, facing south west. During Covid, I’d go many days at a time without driving, and in the summer, the interior temperatures can easily rise over 150f. Within the camera enclosure, there’s a reflection absorbing material, which likely creates a perfect miniature greenhouse.I believe the glue in the camera housing melted/evaporated at these elevated temperatures and deposited on the windshield.Concerned that others would experience this problem, I opened a case with the NHTSA. Crickets.There could be many people driving around on autopilot, with obstructed vision, due to this same failure mode. It’s something Tesla could easily check, and something NHTSA should be investigating.For something as safety critical as a forward facing camera, you’d expect both Tesla and NHTSA would be investigating. I have no indication that anything has happened as a result of my filing. Possibly because nobody else has reported the issue - maybe because nobody else is actively viewing their camera footage? There’s no other way for a Tesla owner to be aware of the issue. Frustrating."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I drive a Tesla. If my car rear ends another car, that&#39;s my fault. Doesn&#39;t matter if I had Autopilot on or not.Imagine if you were rear ended by a Toyota and the driver said &#34;it was on cruise control, shrug.&#34; Would you talk to NTSB or NHTSA about that? Probably not.The only scenario I can imagine that&#39;d warrant investigation is if the driver were completely unable to override Autopilot. Similar investigations have been started by NTSB when Toyota had issues with their cruise control systems several years ago."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The driver said she was using Autopilot, that an OTA update had had a problem earlier in the day, and that she had actually had the same kind of collision on Autopilot previously!So she continued to use it? That&#39;s insane.It&#39;s worrying that there are tons of videos on YouTube reviewing Tesla&#39;s Autopilot and FSD where the cars do something incredibly scary and dangerous, and the drivers just laugh it off, go &#34;well, it&#39;s a beta!&#34; and continue using it instead of turning off the feature that almost got them into a car accident. I don&#39;t want to share the road with drivers who think dangerous driving is a funny game."</p>

You&#39;ll have significant responsibility, you&#39;ll be able to execute your own vision of the product, and you&#39;ll get to work directly with artists and designers as we explore what user interfaces can be.If interested, reach out to amol@soot.com."</p>
