								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is the most shocking article I have ever read in my life. I&#39;d ask everyone to please read it because it is incredible.One thing I did not realize is that US researchers who conducted gain of function research tried to downplay and discredit the possibility of the virus originating from the wuhan lab. There was an anti-lab theory Lancet statement signed by scientists, and &#34;Daszak had not only signed but organized the influential Lancet statement, with the intention of concealing his role and creating the impression of scientific unanimity.&#34;Plus there&#39;s all the stuff about the miners shoveling bat poop for weeks and then dying of coronaviruses, and the Wuhan institute collecting and doing gain of function research on these similar-to-SARS samples. And then several of the lab&#39;s gain of function researchers became ill in late 2019. And there&#39;s the weird renaming of samples to hide the unmatched closeness of the mine samples and covid. This is just the absolute surface of the article. There&#39;s too much to list hereEdit: here&#39;s another amazement for the list: &#34;Shi Zhengli herself had publicly acknowledged that, until the pandemic, all of her team’s coronavirus research — some involving live SARS-like viruses — had been conducted in less secure BSL-3 and even BSL-2 laboratories.&#34; And the article says &#34;BSL-2 [is] roughly as secure as an American dentist’s office.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While this article is quite illuminating on the political side of the lab leak theory, on the evidence side it&#39;s mostly a rehash of some long-standing speculations.The only recent evidence it contains is the fact that 3 researchers from WIV sought hospital care back in autumn of 2019 with symptoms similar to COVID. However, this piece of evidence is hardly consequential without further details:- First, most common symptoms of COVID are indistinguishable from common cold. If the researchers were known to have any &#34;signature&#34; symptoms like loss of smell the article would certainly mention it.- Second and more importantly, China doesn&#39;t have a robust GP/family doctor system found in western countries. As a result, many people would go to hospitals directly whenever they&#39;re mildly sick.Taking the evidence as we know it now, the straightforward explanation is that 3 researchers caught cold, got mildly sick, so went to the hospital to get prescriptions or doctor&#39;s notes for sick leave (in China it&#39;s common for employers to require a doctor&#39;s note even for a short sick leave).That said, I believe the lab leak theory is still plausible, and shouldn&#39;t be ruled out unless a clear transmission path from bat to human has been identified (which was done for the 2002 SARS outbreak). But I also think that we may never know. I trust that some theories put forward were in good faith, but so far they are little more than speculations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Assuming the chance of a lab leak is non-zero, it is worth considering how this will ever end.- If there was any hard evidence actually proving they had SARS-CoV-2 in the lab before the pandemic, it will be long gone. Only an independent full access forensic level investigation would ever find any sign that evidence was destroyed, and that is never going to happen.- It seems extremely unlikely to me that anyone from within China will A) blow the whistle or B) that we would hear about it.- If a whistleblower were to escape the country, China would be able to claim they are lying, and it is a plot by the West to oppress the Chinese people etc. The chance that the whistleblower would be carrying irrefutable evidence of a lab leak is again almost zero.We can keep shaking the tree, but I don&#39;t think anything truly satisfying is going to fall out. Consider that even if the USA for example had actual evidence of a lab leak, they would be better off using this as leverage over China secretly than releasing it publicly.What actually can and should happen, is that some major change comes to virology research to absolutely minimise the chance of another lab origin pandemic. Wherever SARS-CoV-2 came from, we have had lab leaks before and we will have them again, that much is certain."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So I was interested in how well Boom was doing in keeping to its timeline, and found an article from two years ago:https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/01/supersonic-passenger...Some side-by-side comparisons:2019 article:  &#34;Boom envisions its Overture airliner traveling at Mach 2.2.&#34;  2021 article:  &#34;a plane that could fly at Mach 1.7&#34;2019 article:  &#34;Its planes could be ready for commercial service in the mid-2020s&#34;.  2021 article:  &#34;It is targeting the start of passenger service in 2029.&#34;The 2019 article also says that Boom is constructing a 1/3rd scale version of Overture that could be making test flights later in 2019.  This article from October 2020 says that the 1/3rd scale vehicle was &#34;rolled out&#34; in 2020 and could be ready for test flights in Q3 2021. https://www.forbes.com/sites/erictegler/2020/10/26/boom-supe..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great to see so much innovation in aerospace. Boom has said they&#39;re going to reduce noise, but they&#39;ve also said they&#39;ll only fly supersonic over water with buffers between supersonic zones and populated areas. So the &#39;boom&#39;, as it were, is still a concern.I&#39;m super interested to see how quiet their planes are at subsonic. If you ever saw the Concorde flying subsonic, it was unbelievably loud. Nothing to do with being supersonic - their engines were just obnoxiously loud. Came into Cape Town a long time ago and made the whole town rumble on final.In this blog post: https://blog.boomsupersonic.com/booms-principles-of-sustaina.....Boom says: &#34;Today’s subsonic commercial aircraft are 80% more fuel efficient than those of the 1960s, and noise footprints have shrunk up to 90% in the last 50 years. This technological progress has fueled Boom’s efforts to design a supersonic airliner that makes economic sense for airlines and their customers. &#34;However, the innovation that enabled this is high bypass turbofan engines. Turns out if you move more air slower, it&#39;s way quieter and more fuel efficient because physics. Boom can&#39;t take advantage of this - at least directly, because they have to go supersonic. A high bypass turbofan engine is huge, by it&#39;s very nature. At supersonic speeds this presents a lot of drag. That&#39;s why I&#39;m super curious how they plan to be quiet and fuel efficient while also being supersonic."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Problems with supersonic (?):- Noise means you can&#39;t do US domestic- Concorde didn&#39;t have the range for Pacific- Costs didn&#39;t work for Atlantic routes- And airlines want lots of identical planes, not one special one for one routeWhich ones has Boom solved?https://twitter.com/benedictevans/status/1400425028022308874"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m surprised at how dismissive the comments are. We need many angles of defense against these criminals. Dismissing this because companies should do better security is like dismissing doctors because people should get more exercise. That&#39;s silly. We need preventative care and treatment and everything in between.I&#39;m not surprised by this announcement because the way that the pipeline-company ransomware hackers beat a hasty retreat was noticeably unusual, and already seemed to telegraph that the state was getting involved more...actively. Good."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What about the other side of this? Instead of seeking backdoors and using them to spy on Americans, the NSA should be stepping up their game and securing vital infrastructure and domestic businesses against these attacks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this is needed because the security industry seems to be well on the way to adopting paying off these people as a routine cost of business. That is going to lead to an absolute disaster if it is allowed to continue and grow.It needs to be a double edged sword though where companies are just as afraid of facilitating ransomware attacks as they would be of the consequences of facilitating terrorists. In other words, this will only work if it means company&#39;s are taking the threat more seriously, not less."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Reminds me of when Apple started providing &#34;smaller size updates&#34; to OS X.  I was curious about the details since my doctorate had touched on the topic, so I worked my contacts (I had a few in Apple engineering from the FreeBSD / OS X relationship) and after a few months I got back as answer: &#34;We&#39;re using a tool called bsdiff, are you familiar with it?&#34;  I was indeed, since I was the author of said tool.(Just to be clear, there was no license violation involved in this case; just a lack of awareness of the provenance of the open source software they were using.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I&#39;ve learned ... instead to simply say &#34;I have a lot of experience with that technology&#34; and leave it at that.Shows Brendan&#39;s maturity.I am not sure what should be the appropriate reaction or corrective measure in these situations. We should talk more about handling these unfair situations.Someone else can become more successful building on top of one&#39;s open source project. On a resume, a top contributor and a minor contributor to open source project might have same weightage depending on how you present it - making the situation unfair for a person dedicatedly working on a single project (quality) vs minor contributor to multiple projects (quantity).But deleting name and credits is wrong. An acknowledgement from the benefitting person (if not the recognition/reward) has far more positive impact on career than justifying to other&#39;s that your work was stolen.It was a bit strange to read some of the initial negative comments. I see Brendan being a sport. I would argue that reading the story as a report against unknown persons at Sun makes more sense. I don&#39;t see much sense in blaming victim. And, in my opinion, the VIP had a good run but he isn&#39;t the bad guy here."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m always amazed at how Peter Norvig continues to create the kind of content that a top grad student would do, even as his career and rank in the industry has skyrocketed.Back in university and grad school I would write tutorials and post them online (and still get thanks from random people many many years later).  I would explore random interesting subjects and dive deep.  I would constantly publish code and demos, etc.  As my career grew, one of one these started to fall off.  I look at my peers and it&#39;s the same story: they were all vibrant hot-shots in their early-mid 20s, and now are just weighed down by the teams and projects they manage.Peter is an inspiration.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I got reasonably far in stats -- up to a single grad level course.My biggest problem with the teaching of math (and I can weigh in on this a bit because I spent over a decade as a private tutor of math) is that math is often not introduced in a concrete manner, as well as in a way such that its utility is obvious.  These are two sides of the same coin.You can see this problem in most Wikipedia math pages.  I took more math than most physics majors and I find quite a lot of what I stumble across either baffling or of unknown utility.  Set theory is a great instance of this.  I rarely see multiple examples listed as it is explained, nor does anyone bother to tell me what it is for, other than to do more set theory.Stats at least has the benefit of having to stick closer to applicability, I think."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s not quite as simple as &#34;it works like &#39;Lord of the Flies&#39; or it doesn&#39;t&#34;.  Nicholas Christakis, in his book &#34;Blueprint&#34;, devotes a chapter to a database that he and his grad students made of shipwrecks, where the survivors lived long enough, in enough isolation, that they had to more or less put together a temporary society.  There were lots of cases where they turned on each other, and lots of cases where they did not.My review of Christakis&#39; book, in case you&#39;re curious: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2851365787"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It shouldn&#39;t be glossed over that these were six boys from a boarding school on a getaway. So, unless there were only six pupils in the boarding school, it would mean that this was a group of boys who like and trust each other enough to let in on a plan which could get them into serious trouble if the wrong person found out about it. Also, the school being a boarding school implies that the group had a preexisting social structure, and that they had been literally living together before the event.So, it&#39;s sort of a best case scenario of &#39;a group of boys forming a society on a deserted island&#39;.EDIT: Another commenter posted an audio interview with one of the survivors, highly recommended:
https://www.rnz.co.nz/audio/player?audio_id=2018746636"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s a wonderful story and and an uplifting rebuttal to Lord of the Flies.But to be fair, six Tongan boys were probably far hardier and well equipped than the typical British schoolboy of that time would have been. It seems they thought nothing of stealing a fishing boat and heading to sea, and they most likely had abundant life skills already - they basically relocated from life on one pacific island to another.So a great story but I don&#39;t know how much can be extrapolated from it about human behaviour in general."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m surprised at the negativity here. I agree with this decision.When I saw it was a 6-3 decision my first instinct was &#34;oh another conservative-liberal divide&#34; but no it isn&#39;t. I&#39;m actually surprised to find Thomas dissenting since he&#39;s just. a stickler for the literal text.To me the ruling seems correct: the offender may have exceeded department rules and such access by that measure was &#34;unauthorized&#34; but he was not an unauthorized user to the system.It&#39;s refreshing to see limits to the overreach on what constitutes &#34;hacking&#34;. This isn&#39;t hacking.Were this ruling in effect when Aaron Swartz was charged, I very much suspect it would&#39;ve invalidated the hacking charges under the CFAA (since he used a guest account he had access to)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am loath to defend agents of the government, law officers or otherwise; but I have to agree with the decision here.Van Buren violated department policy, and perhaps other laws in his conduct. But he did not gain unauthorized access to a system. He already had authorized access - he just used it improperly.Similarly, if I were granted access to my company&#39;s production database to perform some kind of operation that required me to read/write data, and I used that privilege to access financial records of customers, I would certainly be violating my company&#39;s policy and likely some privacy and financial laws. But it would not be gaining unauthorized access, as I was explicitly granted access to that system - just for a different purpose."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I guess this is the part that matters most?&#34;We must decide whether Van Buren also violated
the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 (CFAA), which
makes it illegal “to access a computer with authorization
and to use such access to obtain or alter information in the
computer that the accesser is not entitled so to obtain or
alter.”
He did not. This provision covers those who obtain information from particular areas in the computer—such as
files, folders, or databases—to which their computer access
does not extend. It does not cover those who, like Van Buren, have improper motives for obtaining information that
is otherwise available to them&#34;Thomas, Alito and Roberts dissented, and I hate to say it, but I agree with them.&#34;The question here is straightforward: Would an ordinary
reader of the English language understand Van Buren to
have “exceed[ed] authorized access” to the database when
he used it under circumstances that were expressly forbidden? In my view, the answer is yes. The necessary precondition that permitted him to obtain that data was absent.&#34;That&#39;s Thomas dissenting."</p>
