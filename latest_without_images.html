								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been using the alpha for the past 2 weeks, and I&#39;m blown away. Copilot guesses the exact code I want to write about one in ten times, and the rest of the time it suggests something rather good, or completely off. But when it guesses right, it feels like it&#39;s reading my mind.It&#39;s really like pair programming, even though I&#39;m coding alone. I have a better understanding of my own code, and I tend to give better names and descriptions to my methods. I write better code, documentation, and tests.Copilot has made me a better programmer. No kidding. This is a huge achievement. Kudos to the GitHub Copilot team!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hi HN, we&#39;ve been building GitHub Copilot together with the incredibly talented team at OpenAI for the last year, and we&#39;re so excited to be able to show it off today.Hundreds of developers are using it every day internally, and the most common reaction has been the head exploding emoji. If the technical preview goes well, we&#39;ll plan to scale this up as a paid product at some point in the future."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I was an undergrad at CMU, I learned how to work hard. Really hard. After having coasted through too-easy high school, I spent all day every day at CMU either programming, doing mathematics, or thinking about one of those things (to great effect: often the trick to prove a theorem would pop into my head while showering or while taking a walk). I would fall asleep while programming in the middle of the night, dream about programming, then wake up and continue programming just where I left off.One thing from this essay really stuck out to me:&gt; The most basic level of which is simply to feel you should be working without anyone telling you to. Now, when I&#39;m not working hard, alarm bells go off.One thing that always happened at the end of a semester is we&#39;d have a few days after exams but before flights back home. On these days I&#39;d typically try playing a video game (my hobby before college) and every time I would stop playing after just an hour with deep feeling of unease at the pit of my stomach. &#34;Alarm bells&#34; is exactly how I would describe it - a feeling at the core of my psyche that I have been wasting time and there must be something productive I should be doing or thinking about.Years later, having tackled anxiety problems that had plagued me most of my life, I came to recognize that my relationship with hard work during my college years was not healthy and that this deep seated desire to do more work is not a positive thing, at least not for me.I&#39;ve since reformed my ambitions, instead of looking to start a company or get a PhD in mathematics, I&#39;ve decided that hard work is not the love of my life and instead I should focus on my hobbies while looking for a career path that can be simultaneously fulfilling but laid back."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked my way through college as a mover (and came out the other side with high 5-figure debt). Many of the older guys I worked with had drug habits. I worked 16-hour days with those guys. They&#39;d get on me for not running up stairs, for packing with too little paper around glass, for setting things down more than once. None wrote articles entitled &#34;How to Work Hard.&#34; None knew Warren Buffet as a child (see Gates). None attended the most expensive schools, if they had they certainly wouldn&#39;t have chosen to drop out because they got bored or were unfulfilled (see Graham and Zuck). Take a look at the top 10 highest valued YC startups. All their founders came from schools with less than 10% acceptance rates.Privilege is what I&#39;m getting at. Having an income 300:1 your lowest paid employee is disturbing. Making millions or billions off speculative, debt-fueled VC is disturbing. Proselyting your brand of success is disturbing. Recommendation: every time a founder, investor or businessperson starts to wax poetic on virtue, look for an angle. Why do founders want to appear virtuous and hardworking? Why do we need that from them? How else can they justify making sometimes up to 50% of their companies entire payroll? How emotionally satisfying must it be for Graham and his ilk to tell you why they got what they have?What if most of serious wealth and success is decided at birth?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; It was similar with Lionel Messi. He had great natural ability, but when his youth coaches talk about him, what they remember is not his talent but his dedication and his desire to win.I can assure you, there are many kids that practice harder than Messi did when he was young. He is not a great player because of hard work, he is a great player because of luck. I know the VC thing about the importance of hard work. They love to promote hard work because that&#39;s how they make money. It&#39;s just plain silly to attribute Messi&#39;s greatness to anything other than luck - both his physical abilities and the environment that taught him how to fine tune his abilities.Hard work is useless without that special precise knowledge of which work you should be doing. Few young soccer players know how to practice in a way to become Messi, even if they have the right body to do it. It&#39;s useless without being in the right environment too.&gt; Now, when I&#39;m not working hard, alarm bells go off. I can&#39;t be sure I&#39;m getting anywhere when I&#39;m working hard, but I can be sure I&#39;m getting nowhere when I&#39;m not, and it feels awful.That, my friends, is what a VC would love for you to believe. There&#39;s nothing sincere when someone in his position writes something like this. Because hey, if you&#39;re the 0.1% of the time that it works out, he gets rich. And if you&#39;re the 99.9% that wastes their time (like all the kids that never play soccer at the highest levels) he loses nothing.I used to enjoy PG&#39;s writings. He&#39;s crossed a line where he believes that the only thing good in the world is what is best for VCs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s not all that great blaming the victim. They clearly made the right moves with at least some of their configuration decisions and leaned on the underlying platform not being bonkers (but alas, it was: https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/4737 and https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/22054).Should they have hardened in all the other ways for defense in depth, e.g requiring authentication from localhost? Sure. Should the attacker have not done the attack? Without a doubt. But should docker have not completely undone a security control?Yes, and the fact that docker seems to have persisted with the current state is the topic of discussion.Previously: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27613217"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Network services really should have auth by default even if they only bind to localhost. There’s so many ways that a localhost service can become accessible to attackers. Any process with network access, no matter what user it’s running as, can access a localhost service - UNIX sockets on the other hand can be restricted by the usual user/group permissions. A localhost service can be exposed by e.g. an SSRF bug from a web server on the same machine. Or, accessed by a browser on the same machine browsing untrusted sites (an attack model for desktop services which open local ports), and so on. (In case you believe that the HTTP protocol  restriction in the latter two cases protects you - protocol smuggling over HTTP is frighteningly effective!)Of course, as seen here, a network service binding to more than localhost is strictly more exposed - and auth should be required in those cases (even when the service should ostensibly be LAN-only).Secure-by-default is the best kind of security."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Crap like this is why I dont run docker.  I&#39;m glad RedHat took a principled stance on it and dropped it. Podman doesn&#39;t punch holes you didn&#39;t ask for in your firewall.  What a ludicrous anti-feature."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When they work well, they&#39;re really good, but when they work badly, they&#39;re _really_ bad.The other week, I went for dinner at a place that had a online ordering system. My experience was as follows...Arrive at the table, scan the QR codeNo phone signal in the restaurant, so I need to connect to the wifi.Connect to the wifi, get a captive portalNeed to put my phone number in to connect to the wifi; there is no signal, so I need to go outside, to receieve the confirmation code.Connected to the wifi, scan the code again, choose my food.Go to pay, need to register an accountPut my email address in, I already have an account on this food ordering service!?Do a password resetPut in my credit card details (why not use apple pay?).This whole time, we&#39;re sat at a table, in theory to meet friends, but we&#39;ve spent the first 15 minutes all glued to our phones!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s really interesting to see how a crowd of tech workers who generally are trying to pave the way are so quick to attack and be negative.Like all things in life, when its implemented well it works and when it does not it is terrible. I still think there is room for this to be the future though. I say this as a westerner but perhaps the west is not ready for it yet but I really enjoyed the experience of using QR codes in China. Go to a restaurant I just get shown where to sit and don&#39;t need to waste time with the host/server giving me menus or telling me anything. If I have questions they are there to answer the but I can also just sit down, scan the QR code, menu opens up and I can order food. Food just shows up minutes later. When I am done I go to the front and pay with Alipay.The benefits to me of not having physical menus is huge. From the business perspective there is less interaction time necessary to serve a diner. Sure if this is an upscale high touch experience physical menu is where it stays BUT the majority of dining experiences are not like this. The menu is up to date and easy to modify. Possible to include multiple pictures and information about the food.I might be wild but I really like the experience and wish more places would adopt it. Like all things I think here in the west its still too new so we have a mixed bag of good and bad implementations. Give it a few years and I think it will be narrowed down to the POS providers who offer it as a feature."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I gotta say, I disagree with this piece. I, for one, love QR code menus. I can pinch zoom rather than squint at a menu with small/unreadable fonts in dim lighting. I don&#39;t need to badger the already exhausted wait staff on a busy night when they forget to drop us a menu or two. When orders are taken online, rather than awkwardly force a friend to not go to the bathroom (or take their kid to the bathroom) until a server can take their order, they can just order and then go. I do think restaurants should handle payment themselves and have the option for paper menus or menus posted on a wall if needed, but otherwise I&#39;m a fan."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The more concerning security finding here is that Google sat on this for 9 months. Assuming the claims hold, this is a serious problem for any security-conscious GCP customers. What other vulnerabilities are they sitting on? Do they have processes in place to promptly handle new ones? Doesn’t look like it…"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While there are a series of vulnerabilities here, none of them would be exploitable in this way if the metadata server was accessed via an IP instead of the hostname metadata.google.internal.The metadata server is documented to be at 169.254.169.25, always[1]. But Google software (agents and libraries on VMs) resolves it by looking up metadata.google.internal. If metadata.google.internal isn&#39;t in /etc/hosts, as can be the case in containers, this can result in actual DNS lookups over the network to get an address that should be known.AWS uses the same address for their metadata server, but accesses via the IP address and not some hostname[2].I&#39;ve seen Google managed DNS servers (in GKE clusters) fall over under the load of Google libraries querying for the metadata address[3]. I&#39;m guessing Google wants to maintain some flexibility, which is why they are using a hostname, but there are tradeoffs.[1] https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/internal-dns[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance...[3] This is easily solvable with Kubernetes HostAliases that write /etc/hosts in the containers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While it certainly seems like a fairly serious vulnerability I think it&#39;s worth highlighting that this attack requires that either you already have access to a machine on the same subnet as the target machine or that the firewall in front of the target machine is very lax. That&#39;s a pretty high bar for getting the attack to work in the wild."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not surprising really.A few years back Hotmail/Outlook were returning people&#39;s Twitter/LinkedIn handles for emails sent/received. It had been noticed you could scrape that fairly easily at scale. With one email account you could check up to 30000 email addresses before being flagged by Outlook.Slightly longer ago you could simply iterate 1...n on LinkedIn URLs to find someone&#39;s profile, by converting the number to base12, you&#39;d be redirected to the person&#39;s public URL.Also their bulk contact upload. Take any data leak of email addresses, bulk upload them as contacts and then correlate email addresses to social profiles.Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn are all bad in that regard on the last method, though Facebook at least do not return people&#39;s URLs along with your contact upload (you&#39;re expected to know the person&#39;s face/name to decide whether you&#39;d want to connect). The take away is that once you sign up, whatever information you put on your profile/account is pretty much available to anyone who wants it enough - and clearly there are plenty bad actors who want it. Obviously these social networks want to expand their network, but they also make it much more easy for data harvesting at unprecedented scale."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This hack includes inferred salary, facebook username, mobile number, geo location...None of this is publicly available.None of this can even be downloaded by myself when I get a copy of all my data from linkedin...https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/50191/download...So I have no idea what information about myself was leaked in this hack"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"FWIW, I&#39;ve been scrubbing my social profiles. LinkedIn, Yelp, Facebook, etc.Barest of bones. Removing all connections, photos, posts, personal details. (I know the damage is already done. The aggregators never really delete anything.)Why not just out right delete my profiles? I&#39;m squatting. To ensure they&#39;re not used as socket puppets.After a beloved coworker passed, their profile got highjacked.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I dropped out of my PhD because I could not stand the pressure of having to do talks regularly. Even though I was pretty decent at it (I was told my delivery was fine and clarity was superb), and sometimes felt good (&#34;powerful&#34; for lack of a better word) while on stage, I would worry for months before every presentation, then basically get physically sick for weeks before, and take some weeks more to recover.Then one poster I submitted got upgraded to a talk, which brought me over the tipping point, and I quit.I keep wondering if I could have done more to desensitise myself to it, but the anxiety was never decreasing, if anything, it was getting worse each time. I tried therapy, medication, Toastmasters, martial arts classes and dance lessons (which became my hobby, incidentally), and even vocal lessons (since I was particularly self-conscious about my voice), all to no avail.So now I have a co-founder to do all and any public speaking, and I do not plan to put myself in front of a crowd ever again. But I feel I&#39;m missing a part of life by it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For me, it&#39;s somewhat ironic then that during my early software career (20+ years ago), Fowler&#39;s lucid writing helped me through a lot of the anxiety, insecurity and impostor syndrome I experienced.His work introduced me to eXtreme Programming, UML, Refactoring and more. Much of the agile tooling used nowadays are a consequence of effort he and the groups he was a part of put forth. The book Analysis Patterns is very underrated IMO and was a breath of fresh air after futzing around with the SAMS Teach Yourself series books that were undeservingly popular back then.I think of Fowler as a virtuoso when it comes to explaining practical software matters. I haven&#39;t watched much of his talks, but I&#39;ve read most of his books and PLoP papers.I&#39;m glad he&#39;s going to focus more on writing and helping others with theirs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"FWIW, these are classic panic attacks.Usually the stressor is obvious, but sometimes it&#39;s not and it&#39;s something you&#39;ve left unresolved that your subconscious gets caught up on from time to time.It might not be the talks themselves. It could be anything.If you&#39;ve never had a panic attack before and start getting these, it literally feels like you&#39;re going to die the first time you get one. Then you get used to them and start adjusting.I went through a period of panic attacks after acquisition talks with a giant corp fell through. I was messed up for years after that, with random panic attacks at all times of day.I worked on returning myself to my previously chill demeanor and haven&#39;t had one for many years now.I also stopped answering any VC/BizDev/CorpDev emails though. lol. But mostly out of a desire to optimize my time use for things that actually matter.Good luck Martin. Covid has certainly put the value of living the life you truly want for yourself into perspective and I hope you achieve that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some choice quotes from the ruling:&gt; The FTC is apparently unwilling to allege that Facebook has ever (pre- or post-Instagram acquisition) had something like 85% or even 75% market share; instead it hedges by offering only that the number is somewhere north of 60%.  The question naturally arises: which firms make up the remaining 30–40%? Although Plaintiff is correct that it is not required to identify every alleged competitor in its pleadings, its choice to identify essentially none is striking.&gt; The Court’s decision here does not rest on some pleading technicality or arcane feature of antitrust law.  Rather, the existence of market power is at the heart of any monopolization claim.  As the Supreme Court explained in Twombly, itself an antitrust case, “[A]district court must retain the power to insist upon some specificity in pleading before allowing a potentially massive factual controversy to proceed.” Here, this Court must exercise that power.  The FTC’s Complaint says almost nothing concrete on the key question of how much power Facebook actually had, and still has, in a properly defined antitrust product market.  It is almost as if the agency expects the Court to simply nod to the conventional wisdom that Facebook is a monopolist."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this is a good TLDR from WSJ:&gt; Judge Boasberg said the FTC’s lawsuit was “legally insufficient” because it didn’t plead enough allegations to support monopolization claims against Facebook. The judge, however, said the commission can try again and gave it 30 days to attempt to file an amended lawsuit."</p>

Given the immense trust funds held by Harvard and MIT, I had hoped money would not be a factor and these institutions would be able to develop their platform in the open.I&#39;d like to add .. non-profit does not mean free to end users. There are many good non-profits and there are many terrible ones (highly paid execs, insane amount of money spent on marketing)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m sad that all education endeavours eventually turn for-profit and then the goals get misaligned.Produce as many courses at as minimum cost as possible.
Enroll as many people as possible without regards for completion percentage.
Create an economy where random people are incentivised to create courses and then the course quality tanks.I wish this turns out differently.Even Udemy and Coursera have become commericialised with edX the last major standing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a huge bummer. edX was the prime example I would hold up when people said &#34;remote learning is terrible&#34;. Several of the courses I took on there ranked among some of the best classes I&#39;ve ever taken, in-person or otherwise.I agree with another commenter in that I had hoped it would persist since 1) education is ostensibly the business of Harvard and MIT and 2) Their pockets are deep enough to think long-term.I will admit that I haven&#39;t used it much in the past few years. Had been getting turned off by the credential chasing and access disappearing after some time.Tough to see an excellent path forward from here.
