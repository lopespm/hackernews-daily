								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My git productivity hack is `git diff --color-words`. Instead of showing the line-by-line diff, it shows only the words that changed. Especially useful if you have long sentences where only a comma changed or some other typo. With git diff, the two lines are shown, with --color-words, only the changed symbol is highlighted. The option --color-words also works with git show. I even made aliases for them: git cshow and git cdiff.Other than that, I recommend that people learn to use git properly. In my work, I often have problems with people overwriting their commits and trying to handle merge requests of commits where one commit message is &#34;did some updates&#34; and the other commit is &#34;some fixes&#34;. Getting to know git for an hour, may have prevented both issues. But I am biased, since I use git since my bachelor thesis."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; with git checkout you can create and switch to the new branch in one command using the -b flag:
git checkout -b new_branch&gt; You can do the same with the new one, but the flag is -c:
git switch -c new_branchIt&#39;s like they had a design meeting where they discussed this and said &#34;so  I propose switch -b newbranch to create and switch to a new branch&#34; and the objection was &#34;nah that would make it consistent with checkout, which is against the project policy&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You don&#39;t need -- as much in the &#34;git restore&#34; example. With git checkout it may be necessary to separate the branch and the paths with &#34;--&#34; but since &#34;git restore&#34; does not take a branch (except with -s), doing this is totally fine    git restore test.txt"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This problem unfortunately applies to a lot of remote access software, particularly when the web browser is the client.I know of one company that switched to Web VNC for accessing a specific piece of software. They had a lot of offices and the software was expensive (paid per machine). This way, they could switch to a much smaller number of licenses, letting any employee connect from anywhere and wait in line if necessary. A blind person has lost a job over this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thanks so much for holding Cloudflare accountable for this. It&#39;s upsetting that they had so much input from you leading up to it and now they&#39;re dropping the ball. A lot of accessibility stuff and mission statements just honestly amounts to virtue signalling with companies and sad to see that&#39;s the case with Cloudflare so hope they step up. It shouldn&#39;t have to get to the point where they&#39;re sued but I feel like more often than not that&#39;s the only thing that changes things like this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They wouldn&#39;t be the first. An SVP of a major SV company once told me &#34;[my company] doesn&#39;t give a shit about accessibility, and no one in Silicon Valley does.&#34; When I went to the CSUN accessibility conference that year, guess which company&#39;s logo was emblazoned across the lanyards? Yup, their marketing department was happy to write checks that their company had no intention of cashing.Silicon Valley is famous for its &#39;patina of accessibility&#39;: https://medium.com/@nicklum/silicon-valleys-patina-of-access..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a CS associate professor. I teach a course which consists in contributing to a free software, in third year at my uni. A few years ago a couple of students decided to make a contribution to GNU ls. The change was to have the output color independent of capitalisation (it is based on filename extension). Their code was accepted. It was a tiny tiny contribution, but it&#39;s probable that these few lines of code are and will be executed a few thousands times more than all other contributions my other students made."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I work in finance. About 5 years ago I started building a FIX library on my spare time, out of curiosity. Over the years it has been countless fin tech start-ups as well as big companies reaching out to me about the library, suggesting fixes and features. Since then I have long lost the interest in the technology which enables connectivity to financial exchanges to automate trades, but I keep working on the library for the benefit of others and just the joy of creating something. But what’s the actual impact? Enabling companies getting richer? Greed?https://gitlab.com/logotype/fixparser"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Companies isolate devs from customers by using Product Managers. PMs interview customers and then decide what to build. By the time the tasks get to the dev it’s hard to understand the motivation and impact. The best companies I’ve worked at put the engineers and customers in close contact so they understood the impact and shortcomings in their work. Alternately you need to foster a culture of shared purpose where you have “faith” that your work has impact."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Even if you think you’re well paid, now is the time to look around. I’ve had a lot of friends, mentees, and coworkers get huge bumps on total compensation even as relatively senior engineers and managers. Pay is jumping and companies aren’t doing a great job keeping that up for their people who have been around for a few years. As an employer, that should be the top worry, keep comp up, don’t lose your people because you’ve become complacent on pay and don’t understand that the market is changing right now"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"An interesting corollary is that certain types of business are no longer economically viable. If I have a business that competes with advertising companies for niche talent, my business model has to be able to generate the same outsized returns on that talent if I want to be able to afford them, so this limits the work I can do.I don&#39;t think people should work for below market wages, only observing how it can change what kinds of products and services are available. And in the case of tech talent, salaries are being driven up by a few key industries that arguably are not where society would like to see tech product and r&amp;d investment concentrated."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hate that the market is so great right now because I really can’t take advantage of it.I would love to start the process, to try and get a salary increase anywhere from 30%-100% but unfortunately I’ve stagnated sharply skills wise. Don’t qualify for the jobs I see I think I’d enjoy, and don’t even qualify for the jobs that meet my salary preferences that I’d otherwise dislike. I also would have to be looking at immediately remote roles which just makes things harder. I also am about 90% I could not perform on interviews at most places. Digging myself out of the aforementioned stagnation and prepping for interviews is likely to take years at this point and who knows what the market will look like at that point."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The more project management tools I have to work with, the less likely I am to work for or with a company.I have a somewhat similar stance on software architecture. Sure, I’m TOGAF certified but if you actually expect me to work with notation correct Archimare/UML/whatever and not just draw boxes on a napkin you’re either insane or sell a product with no competition.This is anecdotal of course, but after 30 years of working with hundreds of companies to supply our municipality with software, we have yet to see a correlation between quality and “best practices”. It doesn’t matter if companies do this or that testing and use the full confluence suite or if they just pull spaghetti out of their asses and support is a phone call… the quality is the same over time, hell, often we get more from the spaghetti companies than the “best practice” ones. You might think that it’s a short term thing and that the spaghetti and no testing catches up, but it doesn’t. Maybe because we don’t have to fund those 8 people, that you never really learn the role off but it sure isn’t technical, that sit in on every meeting as opposed to talking directly with the spaghetti slinger and a sales person? I’m not sure, and I’d love to tell people that following this or that “best practice” is the way to go, but that’s just not what our data shows."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I still think David Allen nailed it in Getting Things Done. Not the system necessarily, but he nailed the diagnosis of why we fail to get things done: an inability to be honest with ourselves about (1) the full scope and scale of the commitments we make, and (2) just how little time and attention we have at our disposal in meeting those commitments.Really, it’s the same sort of problem that is described in The Goal and The Phoenix Project, but on a personal level. Calendar timeboxing feels like a solution that actually addresses the real problem, although it is challenging to implement for people who are low in conscientiousness (or have ADHD)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good. When we die, we will still have a giant todo list, and that’s OK. That doesn’t mean we haven’t done things, it just means the list didn’t capture the entirety of our desires and goals.Maybe the point of writing them down is mostly reflective; to contextualize them as much as possible and do the ones that we find most important by some unconscious heuristic. That means there will always be uncompleted things.Also we have to see when we itemize things to do, we also objectify ourselves as a doer of those things. Which is OK for making things graspable, but ultimately we are not mere doer of things, we are humans in an existential context.Maybe it is a good thing that we left todo items unchecked, maybe that is our protest against being reduced too much, maybe that procrastination is an attempt at gaining our humanity back, maybe that resistive Netflix binge has some unconscious meaning that needs to be honored."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m not under an illusion that it does any good, but I swore off all Blizzard products after the Blitzchung incident. It doesn&#39;t feel right giving money to a company that would side with the CCP over human rights in Hong Kong. I&#39;d previously played Hearthstone and Overwatch, and I&#39;d been a Blizzard fan since the original Warcraft. That happy company is dead, and something ugly is animating its corpse.I think company founders are often great, idealistic people. People who genuinely want to make the world better.When they step aside, however, the people who take over after them tend to be terrifying: zero empathy creatures who favor profit maximization over any and all human cost. Does anyone know why this happens?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Blizzards reputation has been going downhill since the merge with Activision. Some of my veteran WoW friends returned with the release of classic and TBC classic, but no one stayed for long. Blizzard has been destroying all of their franchisesWoW - convoluted imbalanced hot messDiablo - repetitive. Diablo immortal.Warcraft III - buggy and laggy steaming pile of undelivered promisesOverwatch - imbalanced.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Asmongold on Blizzard Now Blaming Players for Being Too Toxic&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFqbfdcnNf8i saw the tweet by Blizzard dev. He blamed the players for Blizzard internal problem. this whole mess is Blizzard&#39;s own problem and he is dragging the players into it.he should just say due to internal problem. the patch for WOW 9.2 will be delay and leave it.Blizzard have been going down hill for awhile. They treat their players like cash cow and try to milk them anyway that they can.players = paying customers. if you can&#39;t cook the burger that a customer already pay for. your paying customer will leave. its simple as that.bottom line: Blizzard treat their employees and customers like shit."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This problem won&#39;t get fixed without legislation.  Single use plastic is cheaper, so of course companies will use that if they can.  Most people don&#39;t have the income to support &#34;voting with their wallet&#34;, and even those who do don&#39;t always have the option.  IF the best solution out there happens to use single use plastic, you&#39;re not going to opt for a worse solution just because it doesn&#39;t.And even if one company cares enough to do something, they will change their tune when they have to start charing more.The only way this will get better is if the external costs of single use plastic are borne by the companies that make them and consumers are subsidized to absorb the extra cost."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Pre pandemic, I&#39;d go often to trader joe, and they would give samples.  It was maybe a small bite of a food (ice cream, salat, or whatever else), and use a plastic fork for it.Just one bite, and you had to throw it out. It was more plastic than food.  Whole Foods was the same.  I think it is a crime against environment and I started feeling bad about it, and stopped taking samples when there were plastic utensils.It think behaviour like this should be legislated out.  For something like a sample, just a small wooden  spoon, or anything else renewable, should be enough.The externalities of that plastic, is something that neither Trader Joe or Whole Foods pays, but we all do in some way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;The pioneering 2015 study of marine plastic didn’t include illegal dumping and export of plastic waste. In the new analysis, the team considered those actions, but only for the U.S. They say data for other nations were inconsistent or didn’t exist.&#34;Doesn&#39;t this seem like it&#39;s saying illegal + legal plastic waste in the US is greater than legal plastic waste in other countries?  That seems like a much different claim to me."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One thing I’m always curious about is why we are so concerned with plastic waste.My local grocery store recently switched to paper bags. So I got curious. Turns out you have to re-use a paper bag 43 times for the energy use to be the same as plastic grocery bags. This is impossible since they are made of paper. Aluminum and glass bottles require several hundred times more energy to produce as well (between 170-250x).Then when you look at plastic pollution and see that for the most part North America is quite good at properly disposing of plastic you wonder why we are so obsessed with this as a problem.Plastic waste really isn’t a big problem unless you’re talking about developing nations. North America is responsible for about 3% of mismanaged plastic waste. Asia and Africa account for 86% of it.Don’t get me started on plastic straws. They make up 0.03% of plastic waste in the ocean.If we want to make a difference here we should be helping developing nations to better manage their plastic waste so that it doesn’t end up in waterways.The Yangtze and Ganges are releasing plastic into the ocean at a rate far greater than all of North America combined, and our response is to expend huge amounts of energy produced by fossil fuels trying to recycle our plastic instead of burying it in a landfill where it is unlikely to pose a major ecological threat.Like many environmental initiatives I worry that we’re more concerned about making ourselves feel better than actually solving the problem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was thinking these days, that when I was a kid some 20 years ago, people were all the rage against paper, because you had to cut trees and whatnot, everything was switching to plastic so you could &#34;save the trees&#34;I still wonder what that was about, all it did was screw the paper companies that had their own private forests, and cause the stupid plastic patch on the pacific ocean, and now everyone has to switch BACK to paper."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Pressure is also building for “polluter-pays” laws that would shift the cost of waste collection from taxpayers to the companies that make and use plastic. Earlier this month, Maine became the first U.S. state to pass such legislation… The American Chemistry Council (ACC), an industry group whose membership is dominated by plastics makers, says polluter-pays measures would hurt the economy.This is the kind of solution that seems to appeal to HN and appeals to me personally. It’s a system-wide incentives problem. So just change the incentives and price in the externality, right? Same goes for carbon taxes. I hope these kinds of laws catch on."</p>

Filesystems that Mac OS 9 should support were either not mounting properly or causing errors during file transfer when formatted on a modern Apple or Linux system (exFAT was the only one I could get to work for some reason). I’ve been casually looking around for some sort of NAS solution that would be compatible with older versions of Mac OS, but with native scp I can just download files from a Linux box (perhaps a dedicated Raspberry Pi) and skip right to the fun part: exploring all of the weird, cool and charming software and games from this era.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Western economies, particularly that of the United States, have been built in a very calculated manner on gratification, addiction, and unnecessary spending.Calculated, like in planned-economy, directive-from-the-top? I disagree. A lot of the &#34;fluff,&#34; as the author describes it, is excess capital finding its way to things people find pleasurable, whether it be dope, travel, beauty, or rock and roll. Purveyors of such pleasures have proved to be remarkably adept at creating &amp; providing these opportunities."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Unnecessary&#34; is such an odd category: humans could live in caves, for example. Who determines what is necessary? Is art necessary? Music? Nice food? This seems often tangled in some odd moral/theological origin, i.e. possessions are frowned upon.I like to be shown new things to try, for example. So some advertising I actually like. Is my life planned by large corporations? From my work there I would say not, as most campaigns tend to fail even in the short term."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The ultimate tool for corporations to sustain a culture of this sort is to develop the 40-hour workweek as the normal lifestyle. Under these working conditions people have to build a life in the evenings and on weekends.I slightly disagree with this point. The 40 hour work week is a rather recent development; in the past, people had to work a lot longer with no or only one day of. The trend actually goes in the direction of reducing it further (at least here in Germany), where 35 or 32 hour weeks are getting more common (depending on the job, of course). Plus, there are alternative models, such as 4x 10h days + 3 days off.Sure, the current model serves corporations, but it is by no means their invention. And while they are a big part of why it still is so large, the reason is most likely that they need the labor hours, not the specific consumption behavior."</p>
