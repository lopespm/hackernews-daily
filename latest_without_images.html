								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What&#39;s really striking to me about timelapse videos of the Earth is how, at a grand enough scale, the growth of human settlements on Earth really looks no different than the growth of bacterial and fungal colonies on Petri dishes.We think of ourself as special, as having conquered environments, technology and more - and when zoomed out you could explain everything we&#39;ve built and accomplished as the achievements of a sufficiently robust slime mold simply using available resources to continue growing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"With Timelapse in Google Earth, 24 million satellite photos from the past 37 years have been compiled into an interactive 4D experience. Now anyone can watch time unfold and witness nearly four decades of planetary change.This is amazing, will this be included in the VR versions of google earth? For those who haven&#39;t tried it yet Google Earth is the first thing I show friends who&#39;ve never tried VR before by giving them a Godzilla&#39;s eye view of Tokyo. I&#39;ve yet to find someone who doesn&#39;t &#34;:o&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google Earth may be one of the most wondrous things ever created. When else in human history can you zoom in on the entire geography of the Earth, and now the timelapsed geography of the Earth? Can you imagine what someone like Socrates, Newton, Galileo, or Darwin would say using this tool?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; For example, Pelosi in Dec 22 was against more stimulus. Her husband buys deep ITM TSLA and AAPL calls that day. December 23rd, she is suddenly for stimulus again, with those same companies ralling 5%, giving her an instant +30 return.&gt; Congressman Gottheimer is absolutely an incredible options trader. He’s been selling calls at peaks on $MSFT all 2021, &amp; seemingly buying back the contracts on dips. This in blocks of $250,000 - $5,000,000, which is incredible size given the amount of $MSFT shares he owns. For ex, on 02-12 he sold 500k $MSFT $160 strike expiring 06/18/2021. On that same day, he bought deep ITM calls of $1M-5M at $145 expiring 03/19/2021. The whale caught both of his movements as well.This is fucking unreal."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The very people whose job it should be to stop this sort of thing are the ones who are profiting from it. How do you change this?No really, how can we force congress to change the rules so that elected officials can&#39;t profit from inside information? Why would they ever vote for such a bill?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Of course if you actually work in financial services industry, your personal trading is extremely restricted.
This is regardless of being in no position to see positions/flow/etc that would give you any insider edge.The industry generally sees it as easier to show compliance by having locked down personal trading by employees.Usually this takes the form of - ETFs only, pre-clearance required, 30 day holding periods, limited to using only a list of 5 approved brokers.. and sometimes all of the above.The restrictions apply not just to spouses but to anyone in household, and you have to attest you are reporting any holdings of say.. your parents, if you still live at home.So the mother of a live-at-home college grad tech support analyst who plugs in phones at a bank has more trading restrictions than senior politicians :-)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s also really easy to have high quality audio! The author recommends a &#34;podcasting&#34; microphone, but a $35 standalone headset mic[1] is almost as good and much easier to use. If you want to hear a comparison, I got kind of obsessed with this problem at one point and took some comparison recordings here[2].(You need a standalone mic since most headsets, even really nice ones, have really bad mics because most headset buyers don&#39;t care about or even know how good their mic sounds. The one I linked is wired because wireless is evil[3] and in particular, Bluetooth will silently degrade your audio quality. If you want a pair of wired headphones, I like these[4] which are &#34;open back&#34; and therefore sound more natural + cool your ears better, although the open back also means they &#34;leak&#34; sound and are only suitable for working without people next to you. But you shouldn&#39;t be having calls with people next to you anyway!)[1]: https://www.amazon.com/V-MODA-BoomPro-Microphone-Gaming-Comm...[2]: https://www.benkuhn.net/vc/#get-a-better-microphone[3]: https://www.benkuhn.net/wireless/[4]: https://www.amazon.com/Philips-SHP9500S-Precision-Over-ear-H..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"People vastly undervalue good audio quality. It also often makes the difference (given equal visuals) between great amateur and pro in e.g. the YouTube scene.I didn&#39;t have data to back this up before, but I bought a good microphone specifically for this purpose. People will simply like the audio, and by extension what I am saying and also me as a person, better.Meanwhile, my ears will continue to bleed from the awful audio people broadcast into this world. I wonder, most people must notice how terrible everyone in e.g. video conferences sounds; why don&#39;t they make the connection that they themselves have it in their hand to improve the situation? Maybe it&#39;s like wearing masks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A cheap and usable condenser mic costs 30 bucks (e.g. Fifine), a lavalier mic costs between 2 bucks on aliexpress and 50 for e.g. from Rode. (I found that the ultra cheap aliexpress are the exact same like the no-brand 10 bucks on amazon, like so many things)I got both but mostly use the condenser mic and it is an absolute game changer. If you want to explain something it is so noticeable in the eyes of your conference participants how good they can hear you. And it makes a huge difference if you finally feel like what you are saying is not painful for others to endure.Check out this very lovely video series on how to pimp up your conferencing setup. Especially this episode about mics:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKOx4hZKmOsEdit: And this is the mic I can recommend using on Linux:https://www.amazon.com/Microphone-FIFINE-Computers-Podcastin..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I use Firefox. So does my family. Everything I make for personal use works in Firefox and I don&#39;t bother testing with anything else.However, almost every web site or web app I make in my professional capacity gets tested with, and is expected to work with, ~95% of browsers. That means testing against Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera, UC Browser, Samsung Internet, and Internet Explorer.
Edit: I forgot to add Safari, which I also test with.Anything less is not my brand of professionalism, because I am convinced my clients expect me to leave my personal thoughts and convictions at the door. If you want to only create sites that work in Firefox and maybe not elsewhere, then you can do that - but doing it ethically means telling the client upfront that you won&#39;t accept work that requires the site work for the widest audience reasonably possible.That said, there are two caveats.  The first is ethics. I do not leave my ethics at the door and if I am being asked to do something unethical I will refund the money and walk. If it is illegal it will be reported, as otherwise I am an accessory. Clients agree to this upfront. The second is client requests. If the client wants it to work in Firefox and they tell me not to bother with the other websites, despite my advice against it, then that&#39;s what I do."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I started displaying a banner on my website [1] a while back for visitors using Chrome/Chromium telling them to &#34;give Firefox a try for the future of the open web&#34;.I don&#39;t know how many people came across that or clicked the link, as I don&#39;t track that, but I enjoy doing my tiny part in letting people know.[1]: https://www.gkbrk.com"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"No thank you. I appreciate what DDG is trying to do but in the end, a search engine that makes money from selling ads trying to protect me from another search engine that also sells ads is just feeding the ecosystem.I am going to put my money into FF no matter how annoying some of the things in it are."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Postgres is the database I use for everything.I find databases of all sorts extremely interesting and I&#39;ve tried many of them, of all flavors.In the end, I always come back to Postgres.  It&#39;s unbelievably powerful, lightweight and there&#39;s not much it can&#39;t do.Why not use sqlite?  Here&#39;s one example - I like to access my database from my IDE remotely - my understanding is that remote access is not possible with sqlite.Another example - multitenancy is dead easy in postgres, makes things more secure and makes coding easier.Another is that Postgres had an extremely rich set of data types, including arrays and json.Also Postgres is designed for symmetric multiprocessing which matters in today&#39;s multicore world."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We&#39;ve been using SQLite as our principal data store for 6 years. Our application services potentially hundreds of simultaneous users at once, each pushing 1-15 megabytes of business state to/from disk 1-2 times per second.We have not had a single incident involving performance or data integrity issues throughout this time. The trick to this success is as follows:- Use a single SqliteConnection instance per physical database file and share it responsibly within your application. I have seen some incorrect comments in this thread already regarding the best way to extract performance from SQLite using multiple connections. SQLite (by default for most distributions) is built with serialized mode enabled, so it would be very counterproductive to throw a Parallel.ForEach against one of these.- Use WAL. Make sure you copy all 3 files if you are grabbing a snapshot of a running system, or moving databases around after an unclean shutdown.- Batch operations if feasible. Leverage application-level primitives for this. Investigate techniques like LMAX Disruptor and other fancy ring-buffer-like abstractions if you are worried about millions of things per second on a single machine. You can insert many orders of magnitude faster if you have an array of contiguous items you want to put to disk.- Just snapshot the whole VM if you need a backup. This is dead simple. We&#39;ve never had a snapshot that wouldn&#39;t restore to a perfectly-functional application, and we test it all the time. This is a huge advantage of going all-in with SQLite. One app, one machine, one snapshot, etc..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Cool article. I definitely agree that SQLite is the way to go in 99% of the cases you&#39;re making some kind of app.I have often seen Postgres, MySQL and MongoDB in places where they were really overkill and added unnecessary network and deployment complexity. And upon asking the designers it turns out they simply didn&#39;t know about SQLite...Small gripe in case the poster reads this: There&#39;s a malopropism in the opening bit:&gt; SQLite is properly the only database you will ever need in most cases.Should be:&gt; SQLite is probably"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I call it the privacy doom principle. Any information which separates you into a subset of a larger group can eventually be compounded to fully break your anonymity.I did a lot of work on privacy coins, and the power of statistics is staggering. Doesn&#39;t matter if you shield yourself by grouping with 100,000 people per transaction, if your anonymity set isn&#39;t _everyone_, eventually you can be singly identified.Same goes for browsers, tracking, and &#34;anonymized data&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Switch browser while you can. Firefox might not be perfect (or even getting slightly worse), but at least it&#39;s an alternative and I can easily say it&#39;s better than Chromium in most. At least ad blocking worka as it should."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google&#39;s FLOC has an unfixable problem. As soon as other advertisers create their own FLOC&#39;s, anonymity goes away. No matter how careful Google is to make sure these ID&#39;s aren&#39;t unique, as soon as users have several FLOC identifiers, maybe even two, they&#39;re uniquely identifiable.Behavioral tracking needs to die. It was a mistake created from lack of web security in the early days, nothing more. It&#39;s a bug, not a feature.Google is finally showing us what Chrome was meant to be. A browser monopoly to defend Google&#39;s user tracking interests."</p>

For other browser vendors, it is zero-effort to not support it.For Chromium forks, implementing it is zero effort but also comes with the same negative gain it would have for other vendors (that end-users are blind to).  Unless you consider &#34;more relevant advertisements&#34; a win for users.Although Chrome/Edgium have enough market share to make advertisers happy with this change, I see this entire concept as something that could further erode that given enough negative publicity.

And then Browsers address bar, tab bar, then we have the WebSite layout which is also taking vertical space at the top for navigation.1.3mm Key Travel. Which is the same as the old perfect MacBook Scissors Keyboard. Instead Apple went to 1.0mm Key travel in their magic keyboard just to save face.Sane size precision trackpad, no more absurdly large trackpad that has easy false positive when you are typing on it.Replaceable SSD, Keyboard, and Monitor for easy repair. Wow.Surface Connect - Is that Microsoft version of MagSafe?Larger sensor for better quality HD Video Call. They even compare it to MacBook Air 2020 LoL.I haven&#39;t looked at PC Laptop hardware for quite some time, but in mid 2010, Dell or HP&#39;s motherboard and Laptop layout just aren&#39;t anywhere near as good as Apple. But this Surface Laptop definitely took lots of clues from the old MacBook ( I am wondering if they have ex-Apple MacBook Engineers on their team ).Ignoring the Software, this Laptop looks exceptionally good![1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3N3u6NyWSY"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ll be skipping this and future MS hardware for a while.Using a Surface Laptop 3 right now and everything except for the display is pretty much a dumpster fire. The display hardware is incredible in every way. 3:2 is the correct aspect ratio for laptops if you care about running visual studio or other apps which gobble up vertical real estate.I have reloaded this thing from official image 3x and it will still randomly fuck up important things like hardware accelerated video playback and WiFi, both of which require a hard reset to resolve. There is also some really annoying bullshit with the ambient brightness adjustment feature where I have to manually disable it in the registry every time a driver or windows update hits.The most painful problem with the machine is that WiFi is entirely unusable if you are simultaneously using bluetooth. I have had to get external dongles to resolve this.All of that said, I have had few-to-no issues with the Surface Pro product line at work, and my sample size is 1. Might be bad luck or just really demanding expectations. I have been debating going back to Apple, but there are some HP/Asus machines that look compelling now."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; As described above, it is important to “warm-up” JavaScript when benchmarking, giving V8 a chance to optimize it. If you don’t do that, you may very well end up measuring a mixture of the performance characteristics of interpreted JS and optimized machine code.Since unwarmed first execution is a very common use case on the web, and a very intentional improvement for WASM, it seems foolish to discard that when comparing. I understand for benchmark determinism warming is important in long-running systems, but when parsing/warming is a common part of every run, it deserves to be factored in. I can make WASM look better by removing intentional benefits from JS before comparing too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Still, you can archive significant speed-ups with WebAssembly at some use cases.For example, I have a hash function library (https://github.com/Daninet/hash-wasm) where I was able to archive 14x speedup at SHA-1 and 5x speedup at MD5 compared to the best JS implementations.You can run the benchmarks on your computer here: https://daninet.github.io/hash-wasm-benchmark/"</p>

Instead of removing the checks, the compiler started marking them as “aborting”But this post, which also appears to be written by someone from google with access to v8 developers, states that :&gt; You never go out of bounds. This means TurboFan does not need to emit bounds checks [...]Does someone here know more about bound checks eliminations in TurboFan ?

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have yet to check it out, but it&#39;s very cool when people try to rethink SQL, and also revive Datalog. I (morally) support this effort.Myself, I would like to see data query/manipulation language as a total functional language, possibly based on the idea of categorical data transformations: https://www.categoricaldata.net/Also - bit of a rant - if you&#39;re creating a new programming language, consider making syntax and semantics separate in the specification. Lots of people get hung up on arguing about language syntax but it&#39;s really semantics differences that are important for compatibility. Lot of new languages comes up only to fix syntactic problems with existing languages but create small semantic differences in the process, making automated translation from and to existing languages difficult. I wish we could move to a world where syntax and semantics in programming languages are discussed separately from each other."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice to see Datalog being validated by a big name, though I don&#39;t see what&#39;s modern about Logica in particular, or why one should use it over plain Datalog (as syntactical Prolog subset) when the available backends are restricted to SQL rewriters or locked-in to BigQuery. Will have to look into the model for aggregate queries which I guess is a selling point for Logica (as is modularization/composition with optimization), and a weak point since typically neither in Datalog (the decidable logic fragment) nor portable.Edit: also I find the title a bit grandiose since this isn&#39;t about Logic Programming in general, but only database querying"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not a great introduction to the language, IMHO. There is not a clear use of logic to automatically reason about anything, just query composition. It seems the language is much more powerful than what this introduction makes it to be!&gt; English words (...) often capitalized to keep the old-fashioned COBOL spirit of the 70s alive!I like logic programming a lot but a convention not technologically enforced is a poor reason to argue for a language change. When arguing about SQL limited abstraction capabilities that space would have been better spent talking about CTE limitations, for example.Also:&gt; To make things worse, SQL code is rarely tested, because “testing SQL queries” sounds rather esoteric to most engineers, at bestSo nonexisting best practices require a language change, apparently. It was also not showcased how this can be done in Logica, beyond the table mocking that could be done with a &#34;with xxx as (values a, b, c) select (query to be tested)&#34; approach in sql."</p>
