								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This exact code can be found 1000 times on github and many of those are MIT licensed https://github.com/search?q=%22cs+*cs_transpose+%28%22&amp;type=.... Copilot, or any other developer or person, has no way of knowing where the original implementation came from or it&#39;s original license. The cat is out of the bag, get used to it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Howdy, folks. Ryan here from the GitHub Copilot product team. I don’t know how the original poster’s machine was set-up, but I’m gonna throw out a few theories about what could be happening.If similar code is open in your VS Code project, Copilot can draw context from those adjacent files. This can make it appear that the public model was trained on your private code, when in fact the context is drawn from local files. For example, this is how Copilot includes variable and method names relevant to your project in suggestions.It’s also possible that your code – or very similar code – appears many times over in public repositories. While Copilot doesn’t suggest code from specific repositories, it does repeat patterns. The OpenAI codex model (from which Copilot is derived) works a lot like a translation tool. When you use Google to translate from English to Spanish, it’s not like the service has ever seen that particular sentence before. Instead, the translation service understands language patterns (i.e. syntax, semantics, common phrases). In the same way, Copilot translates from English to Python, Rust, JavaScript, etc. The model learns language patterns based on vast amounts of public data. Especially when a code fragment appears hundreds or thousands of times, the model can interpret it as a pattern. We’ve found this happens in &lt;1% of suggestions. To ensure every suggestion is unique, Copilot offers a filter to block suggestions &gt;150 characters that match public data. If you’re not already using the filter, I recommend turning it on by visiting the Copilot tab in user settings.This is a new area of development, and we’re all learning. I’m personally spending a lot of time chatting with developers, copyright experts, and community stakeholders to understand the most responsible way to leverage LLMs. My biggest take-away: LLM maintainers (like GitHub) must transparently discuss the way models are built and implemented. There’s a lot of reverse-engineering happening in the community which leads to skepticism and the occasional misunderstanding. We’ll be working to improve on that front with more blog posts from our engineers and data scientists over the coming months."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just tested it myself on a random c file I created in the middle of a rust project I&#39;m working on, it reproduced his full code verbatim from just the function header so clearly it does regurgitate proprietary code unlike some people have said, I do not have his source so co-pilot isn&#39;t just using existing context.I&#39;ve been finding co-pilot really useful but I&#39;ll be pausing it for now, and I&#39;m glad I have only been using it on personal projects and not anything for work. This crosses the line in my head from legal ambiguity to legal &#34;yeah that&#39;s gonna have to stop&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Love htmx and this talk is a brilliant run down of where it works well.But as always it’s about choosing the right tool for the job. Server rendered pages/fragments solve so many issues around security and time to develop a product, however it only gets you so far.Ultimately I think the decision when choosing a stack comes down to how much state you need to managed in browser. The vast majority of sites needs very little client side state management, htmx and other tools such as Alpine.js are perfect for this. But eventually as you reach a more “app like” experience with multiple layers of state control on the front end you need to reach for a front end JS framework.Now that doesn’t always mean going all in on a full SPA covering the whole of your product. It could just be a small fragment that requires that level of interaction.Point is, don’t pick a tool because it’s “in vogue”, pick one because it lets you build the best possible product as efficiently as possible. For 80% of websites that could be htmx, and for the next 15% htmx probably works for 90% of their pages. It’s the 5% where htmx is not one of the right choices at all."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some years ago, a bright guy created something called 7 GUIs. It’s a collection of seven problems that all UI systems must successfully implement, and it was intended to act as a guide for comparisons.Unfortunately I think the author has passed away, but it would be interesting to see it rekindled and used for baseline comparisons like these.https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"People forget that React can be used for just the complex components that require it.  Your entire page need not be a React app just because you use it for one component.To me it&#39;s bonkers that all web sites seem to be moving towards SPA when they don&#39;t benefit from it at all and require so much frontend work when a little bit of simple HTML and Javascript could do most of the work. It feels like the whole industry is Reactifying everything because they&#39;re scared that if they don&#39;t they won&#39;t look professional."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"After seeing this, I can&#39;t be the only one who got curious as to how many emojis there actually are on iOS.Obviously, a quick google doesn&#39;t work right now.So I did this to try to figure out: emojipedia.org, the site that supposedly breaks google, has a page that appears to show all the available emojis on iOS [1]. On this page, all except the first 21 emojis are displayed in a way that uses lazy loading of the images. These images are contained in &lt;li class=&#34;lazyparent&#34;&gt; elements. Assuming that there are no other &lt;li class=&#34;lazyparent&#34;&gt; elements on the page, we should get the number of emojis on iOS simply by counting those elements.Opening up the console and running  document.getElementsByClassName(&#39;lazyparent&#39;).length

gives us 4037. So the total number of emojis on iOS should be 4037 + 21 = 4058. If the above method is correct, that is.[1] https://emojipedia.org/apple/"</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33215770">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"[Firebase founder]I no longer work at Firebase / Google, but two points:1. There may be issues with the GCP integrations &amp; UX/DX, but GCP integration is good for many customers and necessary for the future of the business.One of the common failure modes for the 2011-2014 crop of Backend-as-a-Service offerings was their inability to technically support large customers. The economics of developer tooling are a super-power-law. So, if you hope to pay your employees you&#39;ll need to grow with your biggest customers.Eventually, as they become TheNextBigThing, your biggest customers end up wanting the bells and whistles that only a Big Cloud Platform provide.This was a part of the reason we chose to join Google, and why the Firebase team really really really pushed hard to integrate with GCP at a project, billing, and product level (philosophy: Firebase exposed the product from the client, GCP from the server) despite all the organizational/political overhead.2. I&#39;m excited to see the current crop of app platforms emerge. It has been 10 years since we launched (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3832877) and there are now some great innovations in the space. I like the way Supabase (https://supabase.com/) has exposed Postgres and InstantDB (https://www.instantdb.com) graphdb+realtime is really promising."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s funny because Google pretty much invented this model that users want and love. App Engine was launched in 2008, before GCP, before docker and before Cloud was a term, basically. It had a globally replicated persistence layer, job queues, auth, scale to 0, a generous free tier, a fully fledged local dev server and a single command to deploy, and all config lived in a single file. At the time it was really innovative, and attracted a lot of hip startup- and college grad types.The reason people liked it is, imo, because it was a single product with multiple features. GCP OTOH, has been about decoupling (or loosely coupling) the product suite, and users are supposed to pick and choose from a giant array of half-products. Simply being aware of all products, their interoperability and predicting the cost is a full time job, easily (it&#39;s mostly large enterprise who can absorb that cost). There&#39;s nothing wrong with the pick-and-choose model, if your products are simple, low level, and interoperable. But the product suite has grown organically, seemingly without coherence, so there&#39;s very little in terms of paved paths to walk – it&#39;s so confusing. When a shining star like Firebase comes along (2014) Google clearly knows not to mess with it too much. But even Firebase isn&#39;t strong enough to resist the gravitational pull of the GCP behemoth."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For me, Firebase is mostly about convenience/development ease:
1. Authentication? Firebase Authentication2. Database? Firebase Cloud Firestore. Sometimes, you don&#39;t need SQL.3. Push notification? Firebase Cloud Messaging4. File storage? Firebase Cloud StorageAll of my needs are served by single platform. Seems like Supabase handles all of them, except #3. Let&#39;s try :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It was electrifying. Understand that by 1984 there were millions of Americans using computers with a command line interface. While they could all do game graphics, you always started out in text mode and had to learn incantations that are familiar to many users of this site but which are no longer a part of most users’ daily life: dir, cd, del, etc.Seeing how dramatically different a computer experience could be was like opening a door to an alternate universe for people. The day after the Super Bowl in 1984 when their famous big Brother commercial ran, my girlfriend’s computer-illiterate father announced to us “I know how to use a computer now” and of course I knew exactly why."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is also my experience dealing with unions.  Management is legally required to make concessions during collective bargaining, so anything that can be considered an improvement to mandatory bargaining topics (pay, benefits, or working conditions) gets held back for the contract negotiation.In one case, management wanted to purchase sit/stand workstations for employees, but HR pointed out that this was a change to working conditions and should be included in the collective bargaining negotiation.  However management had already started taking measurements for the tables, so the union knew what management was intending.  During the negotiations, the union decided to try and call HR&#39;s bluff and refused to ask for the workstations as a concession.  So in the end, the whole plan was scrapped so that HR would have concessions available for future negotiations."</p>

If you want more perks, ask your union reps to bring it up in the next contract negotiation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There seems to be a lot of confusion in this discussion about what the change is and how egrep and fgrep work. These are not symlinks like some have suggested but rather shell scripts. You can see the exact commit diff here:https://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=grep.git;a=blobdiff;f...I remember around ~10 years ago being told &#34;you should never use `egrep` because it is slower than `grep -E`.&#34; precisely because the former requires extra forks() compared to the latter. However I&#39;d counter that advice saying &#34;if you&#39;re concerned about the performance of forks() then why are you running your code as a shell script to begin with?&#34;... and I stand by that assessment now. In fact it would probably take me longer to type `-E` than it would for any modern system to run fork() (and I&#39;m sure as hell not planning on using `grep` inside any hot loops!)I think what will likely happen here is that distro maintainers will either remove that warning themselves or take ownership of the `egrep` and `fgrep` shell scripts. I&#39;d be surprised if that warning made its way to the mainstream distros. I also wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the GNU grep maintainers did a u-turn on this change -- though it has already been committed to git for more than a year now and this is the first I&#39;ve heard people complain about the change."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I use fgrep all the time.  Why should I spend time converting scripts, and retraining my fingers, and forever after taking longer to type grep -F?  This is a breaking change that has no upside, only downside.  It is idiocy.Just to elaborate, there must be many thousands (hundreds of thousands? millions?) of shell scripts out there that use fgrep.  For no reason at all (whatever maintenance burden fgrep represents must be far outweighed by the time wasted debating this issue), these scripts will no longer work.  There is no guarantee that defining an alias somewhere is going to fix all your usages of fgrep.  And even if it did, the cost for every single installation that is affected of someone realizing there is a problem, finding the source of the problem, figuring out that an alias will fix it, making sure that that alias gets preserved after updates, and testing that everything now works will exceed the benefit to the maintainers of grep (which is actually negative, as explained above).  So looked at from a community-wide perspective, the cost is many thousands of times greater than any possible (but actually non-existent) benefit.And as the post mentions, there are also all the books, and all the stackoverflow answers, that use fgrep, and which will now have non-working code.As for the argument that this is open-source software maintained by volunteers, who can therefore do whatever they wish - if you are a maintainer of widely-used open-source software, and decide that you personally are not interested in working in a manner that benefits the community of users, then you should resign and let someone else take over."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On my system, egrep and fgrep are _already_ shell scripts, just changed to add the stupid warning:    $ cat =egrep =fgrep
    #!/bin/sh
    cmd=${0##*/}
    echo &#34;$cmd: warning: $cmd is obsolescent; using grep -E&#34; &gt;&amp;2
    exec grep -E &#34;$@&#34;
    #!/bin/sh
    cmd=${0##*/}
    echo &#34;$cmd: warning: $cmd is obsolescent; using grep -F&#34; &gt;&amp;2
    exec grep -F &#34;$@&#34;

Looking at src/egrep.sh in the git repo[1], I see that before this warning was added in 2021, the last change was back in 2015. In fact, since the git repo history began in 1998, there have been a total of 4 changes to this file. Clearly the maintenance burden of these scripts is not sufficient to require the maintainers to drop them. My guess... this is being done out of some weird sense of purity over practicality. Bad call by Paul Eggert IMO[2].1: https://savannah.gnu.org/git/?group=grep2: commit a9515624709865d480e3142fd959bccd1c9372d1 added the warnings"</p>
