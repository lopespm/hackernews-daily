								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve read this book and taken this course twice, and it is easily one of the best learning experiences I&#39;ve ever had. Statistics is a fascinating subject and Richard helps bring it alive. I had studied lots of classical statistics texts, but didn&#39;t quite &#34;get&#34; Bayesian statistics until I took Richard&#39;s course.Even if you aren&#39;t a data scientist or a statistician (I&#39;m an infrastructure/software engineer, but I&#39;ve dabbled as the &#34;data person&#34; in different startups), learning basic statistics will open your eyes to how easy it is to misinterpret data. My favorite part of this course, besides helping me understand Bayesian statistics, is the few chapters on causal relationships. I use that knowledge quite often at work and in my day-to-day life when reading the news; instead of crying &#34;correlation is not causation!&#34;, you are armed with a more nuanced understanding of confounding variables, post-treatment bias, collider bias, etc.Lastly, don&#39;t be turned off by the use of R in this book. R is the programming language of statistics, and is quite easy to learn if you are already a software engineer and know a scripting language. It really is a powerful domain specific language for statistics, if not for the language then for all of the statisticians that have contributed to it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some caution with cloudflare:Because they give a lot away and post blog posts attacking AWS folks think they are cheap. But a lot of their free stuff may be in the marketing budget. The issue here is:1) Their paid offerings for their core product, CDN, does not have a public pricing guide. That&#39;s a BAD sign if they claim to be competing on price. So we can pretty safely assume their paid service bandwidth charges are NOT the 80X cheaper than amazon despite their claims here.2) They hype their bandwidth alliance. I tried following this up on Azure, it&#39;s basically all call a sales person / maybe you&#39;ll get a deal type stuff. Smoke and mirrors again.3) If you actually try to use their CDN to serve something high bandwidth (games / software updates / video streaming) that is going to violate some type of clause which says that the free CDN is not REALLY unlimited.4) Financially they spend a mind boggling amount on sales costs. Between sales costs and cost of sales I think they are negative relative to revenue.BTW - If you try any of the other &#34;free&#34; and &#34;unlimited&#34; providers (for $5/month etc) you will also find out once you try to move some real data volumes (video etc) - it&#39;s all a lie over and over.Same things with geo issues. Cloudflare claims to have &#34;one&#34; price globally. These are almost alwyas false claims. It&#39;s easy to test - setup a stream into a high cost area, stream a bunch of video there - you&#39;ll usually get a call over some tricky TOS issue they pull out.In short, if you want pay and forget, there is a reason the big cloud players have a business still."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Using Cloudflare to proxy B2 content seems like it directly violates Cloudflare&#39;s ToS.https://www.cloudflare.com/terms/&gt; 2.8 Limitation on Serving Non-HTML Content&gt; The Services are offered primarily as a platform to cache and serve web pages and websites. Unless explicitly included as part of a Paid Service purchased by you, you agree to use the Services solely for the purpose of (i) serving web pages as viewed through a web browser or other functionally equivalent applications, including rendering Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) or other functional equivalents, and (ii) serving web APIs subject to the restrictions set forth in this Section 2.8. Use of the Services for serving video or a disproportionate percentage of pictures, audio files, or other non-HTML content is prohibited, unless purchased separately as part of a Paid Service or expressly allowed under our Supplemental Terms for a specific Service. If we determine you have breached this Section 2.8, we may immediately suspend or restrict your use of the Services, or limit End User access to certain of your resources through the Services.If this was truly acceptable and not in some grey area, why doesn&#39;t Backblaze simply route all downloads through Cloudflare by default, rather than having each individual customer go through the hassle of setting this up?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This B2/CloudFlare combination is a good one.CloudFlare are about to launch their own object/file store with native CDN called R2. They have even come up with a wonderful trick for migrating to it from S3 and it’s looks like it’s going to have an incredible generous level of free egress. I suspect that it will beat out the B2/CloudFlare combination once it launches.https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-r2-object-storage/Edit: Typo"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"My favourite part of Task Manager lore are nearly undocumented keyboard shortcuts:
- pause updates by holding CTRL pressed,
- hit F5 for refresh (standard binding, isn&#39;t it?), or hold F5 to get refreshes way more frequent than with View &gt; Update Speed &gt; High.They might have been visible in menu mnemonics in past versions (?), or might have been mentioned in the help, but now, while still working, there is no clear way to learn them from current Windows 10 Task manager graphical interface.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I also spent quite a lot of time during the Windows 10 preview phase, and a while after release, diligently reporting bugs, and voting on well thought-out feature requests. But after noticing that none of these bugs ever got any attention, and how the Feedback Hub was mostly just noise, I started to wonder why I even did free work for a multi-billion dollar company, on my own time. Right around that period I switched to Linux and now only use Windows for some games that absolutely won&#39;t work on the former. This way I no longer care how bad the UX of the system is, and how many bugs there are, as long as my games launch."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Former MSFTy, don’t bother wasting your time giving feedback. Nobody cares, those that cared left. Microsoft has a weird culture, very top down, very passive aggressive between departments. For a brief while I would diligently prepare bugs for the dog food software. I would even walk over to visit people responsible for it and chat about it. Even for software where ‘zero bugs’ was important they’d just delete a whole bunch of bugs and see if any bounce (come back). Eventually people get sick of refilling so they get to zero bug bounce by exhausting the very people trying to help them.Enough social media pressure may end up risking a line item in a PMs yearly goals. So that might get looked at.Even the some of the most backward laggards (e.g. government departments) are sick to death of Microsoft and have long been introducing policies that all new software has to be web only.Those pointing to Azure as the future should known that they have very aggressive sales who often vastly oversell to customers. Customers aren’t renewing at the same level. Plus I don’t see them being able to compete with Amazon long term. You can only buy Skype for the bundled government customer so many times."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It seems Feedback Hub is a way to give people the feeling that they have somewhere to be heard, without them actually making any difference.It&#39;s a bit like with online petitions: most people feel they have done something after signing a petition, but the vast majority of petitions don&#39;t change anything."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is basically what Strong Towns harps on: the infrastructure for super low density development is extremely costly relative to how much &#39;stuff&#39; you&#39;re building the infrastructure for.Initially it&#39;s not so bad, because it takes decades before you need to do replacement-level repairs/maintenance, but eventually it catches up with you. Some cities escape it (at least for a while) by building even more or by simply having a fantastic economy, but the ones that don&#39;t...it&#39;s not pretty."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It seems like the root problem is that the way property taxes are assessed doesn’t actually line up with how much demand a given development puts on the city for services/infrastructure. Property taxes are based on, “how much would someone else pay for this”, which isn’t the relevant metric from the city’s perspective, it should be, “approximately how expensive is this property to service year by year, including eventual replacement of infrastructure?”If you did it that way, low density developments would pay their true costs, and would become more expensive to the ‘end user’ and thus less popular. And if they didn’t, well, they&#39;re paying their true costs anyway, so problem solved."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I saw a few articles like that on Strongtown. They make for a good story but frankly economically they do not make sense for me. In my surburban town with pretty big lots, school taxes are 2/3 of property tax and things that are more expensive in surburban setting than in the city (roads, sewer, electric, gas hookups) are something like 10% of taxes.Even in this story, city currently spends 3.2M/year maintaining the roads. City has 15k housing units so city currently spends roughly $200/house on roads. It&#39;s $16/month. Author thinks city actually need to spend 4.2M - this is $280/year per house which is only $23/month. That&#39;s really not much even if cost need to be doubled. Hardly unaffordable. This is per dwelling - not even per person and does not count that commercial buildings pay more so residential rate is even lower.Electric/water/sewers generally pay for themselves thru user fee - I think average is $20-60/month/house for sewer/water in US and electric is thru usage fee. School busing in rural setting is probably a bit more expensive but is still rounding error in overall school budget.Everything else - school, governance, police, fire are probably about the same in rural areas and in the dense city. SF is a shit city with 15k/year spending per person and most rural/suburban areas are much nicer on a fraction of that spending.Overall rural lifestyle does not cost much more than the city in infrastructure costs - and I did similar calculations for previous strongtown articles. On a feeling level it make sense that dense city should be cheaper but reality is frankly it&#39;s not.US cities has a lot of problems but frankly cost of maintaining roads is not the  thing that will bankrupt them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"All I want in life is a Linux distro with a package repo full of meticulously reworked &amp; reconfigured packages that make all the keyboard shortcuts across the entire system and every application be like and be as consistent as my old Macs.I&#39;ve been full-time Linux (Kubuntu) for a few years now, and I&#39;ve hobbled together something that only irritates me to death about 30% of the time rather than the 100% of the time it used to before spending days and days fiddling with a bunch of different flavors of remapping at nearly every layer of the system.If I&#39;m ever fabulously wealthy, I already know I&#39;m just going to finance an open source fastidious spiritual successor to MacOS 10.6I&#39;m going to give Pop_Os a try, but I suspect I&#39;m going to run into the same problems I always do. The trouble with Linux as a desktop for me isn&#39;t weather it&#39;s beautiful or not. The problem is how disintegrated everything is and the thousand papercuts ways in which it works.That said, I absolutely consider it basically an incredible miracle that the experience is as good as it is, frankly. So, I keep at it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can&#39;t say much about the MacOS side of things (I do use a Mac at my day-job, but only because the choice is Mac or Windows, no Linux option). But as far as PopOS goes... I&#39;ve been using it full-time on my personal laptop for several months now, and I&#39;m very happy. Surprisingly so, you might say.Why &#34;surprising?&#34; Well TBH, I always looked at PopOS as kind of a niche / oddball thing, along with any other distro that exists only because a device manufacturer is pushing it. I had assumed that when I got my System76 box I&#39;d immediately install Fedora or something. But when it got here I felt too lazy to do that on &#34;day zero&#34; so I figured &#34;Aaah, heck, I&#39;ll keep this PopOS thing around until I get some spare time, then I&#39;ll do a reinstall.&#34;  Fast forward 6+ months now and I&#39;m still running PopOS and am pretty happy with it. It mostly &#34;just works&#34; and I have access to basically all of the same packages as Ubuntu so everything I&#39;ve needed to install (modulo a very small number) has been right at my fingertips, a quick &#34;apt install&#34; away.Net-net, if anybody out there is thinking of trying PopOS, I&#39;d encourage you to give it a whirl. Note: I am not associated with PopOS or System76 in any way, aside from being a System76 customer. I have no financial stake in this discussion."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recently installed Pop_OS on a new Workstation and wanted it to look and feel like MacOS as much as possible. It&#39;s surprisingly easy.

(The NRC says the same)There was a large amount of hand-wringing about the risk of avalanches and other natural disasters that were extremely low probability.They were skimpy on interesting details about the reactor such as &#34;What do you do if the sodium coolant catches on fire?&#34;  (e.g. sodium burns in water,  sodium burns in air, sodium burns in carbon dioxide)  There are good answers to that in the U.S. and Russian experience.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The classic Rickover quote, from the 1950s:An academic reactor or reactor plant almost always has the following basic
characteristics: (1) It is simple. (2) It is small. (3) It is cheap. (4) it is light. (5) It can be built very quickly. (6) It is very flexible in purpose. (7) Very little development will be required. It will use off-the-shelf components. (8) The reactor is in the study phase. It is not being built now.On the other hand a practical reactor can be distinguished by the following
characteristics: (1) It is being built now. (2) It is behind schedule. (3) It requires an
immense amount of development on apparently trivial items. (4) It is very expensive. (5)
It takes a long time to build because of its engineering development problems. (6) It is
large. (7) It is heavy. (8) It is complicated.The tools of the academic designer are a piece of paper and a pencil with an eraser. If a
mistake is made, it can always be erased and changed. If the practical-reactor designer
errs, he wears the mistake around his neck; it cannot be erased. Everyone sees it. The
academic-reactor designer is a dilettante.&#34;Little that’s happened in the 60 years since suggests Rickover was wrong.&#34; -- Kennedy Maize, 12/30/2014, Power Magazine contributing editor."</p>

Micro-reactors like Oklo (1.5 megawatt electrical output per unit, compared to 1000+ megawatts for Generation III reactors currently being built) would be hard pressed to produce electricity suitable for an industry that seeks globally-cheapest prices. Announcing a &#34;20-year commercial partnership&#34; to supply 100 units to a mining firm, before they&#39;ve built a single unit, is optimistic to the point of recklessness.The Oklo founders [1], Caroline Cochran and Jacob DeWitte, have no industrial experience, according to their LinkedIn profiles. They met at MIT while TA&#39;ing and went straight from graduate school to founding Oklo.I just don&#39;t think that Oklo knows what they are doing.[1] https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/28/oklo-planning-nuclear-micro-..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Something I&#39;ve been thinking about lately is how browsers have essentially become a dependency for any sort of auth on the internet. Pretty much everything uses OAuth2, which requires you to be able to render HTML and CSS, and in many implementations JavaScript.That&#39;s ~20M (Firefox) to ~30M (Chromium) lines of code as a dependency for your application, just for auth. This applies even if you have a slick CLI app like rclone. If you want to connect it to Google drive you still need a browser to do the OAuth2 flow. All of this just so we have a safe, known location to stash auth cookies.It would be sweet if there was a lightweight protocol where you could lay out a basic consent UI (maybe with a simple JSON format) that can be rendered outside the browser. Then you need a way to connect to a central trusted cookie store. You could still redirect to a separate app, but it wouldn&#39;t need to be nearly as complicated as a browser."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like the idea of this. There&#39;s so much information on the web, but we still need a way to bring that information to other applications, without being tied to a particular source. That was really the dream of the semantic web, after all.This kind of idea would be really nicely paired with good Microformats[1] support, which continues to be a very good idea. That way we can find, say, a recipe or an address on a web page in a reusable way and without needing magical heuristics.(Of course, &#34;reusable&#34; in theory, with the caveat that everybody forgot about microformats around when Google decided they could machine learn their way out of everything).[1] http://microformats.org"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow! I actually love the idea of being able to interact with websites via a standard API rather being forced to use web-based UI they provide. It opens up a whole lot of possibles for things like alternate clients, standard UIs for interacting across multiple sites, etc. Also eliminates the possibility of sites engaging in annoying or abusive behavior by putting users in full control of the client rather than the site operator. Obviously it can&#39;t work for every site, but it&#39;s quite the interesting concept."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been critical of Tesla before for various reasons, &#34;Building throwaway cars&#34; being one, and people keep insisting that, no, really, this year, Tesla has fixed their problems and such.If you can deliver a car without a brake pad, that speaks to epic quality control failures (EDIT: A comment in the article points out the green &#34;quality control&#34; mark that is obvious on the caliper, which should indicate that everything was assembled properly - so things are seriously broken if it can be assembled wrong and then have a QC mark applied while still being entirely wrong).  I cannot imagine Honda or Toyota shipping a car without a brake pad.  I can&#39;t imagine Ford or GM doing it either.  I&#39;d be down into the &#34;Uh... I think I&#39;ve heard of you once...&#34; non-western car manufacturers before it wouldn&#39;t surprise me.Then, the absolutely horrid service center experience of &#34;Oh, no, you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about, that&#39;s normal, and we can&#39;t fix it any time soon anyway&#34; is just absurd.I know Tesla likes to rag on the horrors of the dealership model, but, seriously, I can&#39;t imagine getting this treatment with a legacy automaker.  Not that I worry about them forgetting to put pieces in, either."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I picked up my model 3 long range in december also and it was also missing parts. Mine was missing USB ports in the center console and the wireless charging pad for the phone. When i questioned them about they tried to lie about it and said that my phone was the problem. I demanded to speak to the manager who admitted right away that the car was indeed missing a part and that they would fix it later. My front bumper was also scratched and missing paint. They fixed that by replacing the entire bumper. Buying from them is a nightmare."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;(...) and finally request a video of the issue.Gillmore recorded the above video to send to her Tesla service advisor, who claims multiple technicians listened to the video, only to declare &#34;the brakes sounded normal for a performance Model 3.&#34;Watch the video. It&#39;s incomprehensible how could anyone who has some experience with cars say that such sound, while breaking, is normal. If I was Elon, I would seriously question whoever at Tesla had said so. And by that, I mean, literally just fire them, because, damn, how can one be so ignorant when it comes something so crucial to safety?"</p>
