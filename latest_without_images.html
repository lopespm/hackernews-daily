								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Something very similar happened to me with Amazon. I used a new debit card from an online bank to purchase an expensive item and deliver it to a foreign address (which is admittedly suspicious). The payment bounced, Amazon immediately locked my account and requested to see a card billing statement sent to my home address to reactivate it. Upon login I am presented with a stern request for documentation, a pdf upload field, a tweet-sized text field for comments, and all communication comes from a noreply@amazon.com address. All my kindle/audible/etc media immediately became inaccessible.I went through every possible channel to explain that the card does not send me a billing statement and I cannot possibly produce one, requesting to be called or at least emailed by a human, to no avail. After spending tens of thousands of dollars on Amazon over the course of fifteen years I couldn&#39;t even get a personal call from the case manager, and all my purchased media is gone.To this day I have found no resolution, and the only next step is to contact them through a lawyer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of people in this thread talking about losing their store credit and app/content purchases. I&#39;d imagine the worst case scenario could be much worse.  Apple runs fairly popular cloud storage services that are strongly encouraged to you for your photo storage and files.  The photo storage especially has an option to automatically delete your local media because it&#39;s already backed up on Apple&#39;s servers.  Will these all be locked out without warning or recourse for a miscellaneous card whoopsie?Even standard files on iCloud.  Who knows how important the average users&#39; cloud files are to them?  (I don&#39;t use public cloud storage at all anymore because of this exact fear - what if some arbitrary billing/transaction error locks me out of everything without recourse?).To be fair I&#39;ve no idea what the person in question got their account locked for and if there was any shadiness involved but I doubt they&#39;d write about it publicly (or get access restored) if there were, which implies that at any time your account and your data can be taken away for something entirely mundane.It makes me really concerned in fact how Google would handle something similar to this - given that for Chromebook users everything (literally EVERYTHING you would normally do locally on a computer) is in/via your Google account."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Every company (Apple, Google, Amazon, etc) is guilty of pulling this non-sense on customers. It is too easy for them to wipe out thousands of dollars of value with no meaningful explanation (read the Terms and Services and go away? seriously Apple?) and no accountability.IMO, states should enact laws where you can take the company to court in your local county and no contract can override that right. If the termination is found justified, the company must refund all account assets at fair market value and any remaining balance. If it was not justified, the company must reinstate the account, pay all court and legal fees, and a reasonable amount of mandatory punitive damages.Also, I don&#39;t get why Apple et al pull these stunts anyways. They already have a huge &#34;regulate me&#34; post it on their back."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Many years ago I had a job offer at Badoo in the UK. After many rounds of going back-and-forth with the contract, me trying to better understand certain clauses, them going back to the lawyers, etc. I told them I&#39;d be happy to sign if they removed the caluses that stated pretty much anything I created on or off hours belonged to them.They went back to the lawyers and came back to me saying that this is not the first time this has been brought up, that the contract was standard across the org and was originally written for managerial types and C-suites, and that the company had never even considered taking over an employee&#39;s off-hours work, open source or otherwise.I said good, then it should not be a problem to remove the clause. They said they would have another discussion and would really like it for me to join. I said great, then once you issue me a contract with that clause I&#39;ll be happy to join, assuming I hadn&#39;t found something else.They never came back to me. For years I wondered if anything had actually changed. Reading this tweet I&#39;m glad I declined."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A note to Bumble, this makes me not want to work for you or anyone who is currently in a related leadership position at Bumble (ie: eng leadership, etc.). Given the lack of supply in engineering the bad publicity is going to cost you more than any miniscule gain.edit: And I don&#39;t even publish OSS anymore but if you&#39;re willing to go after an employee for something this petty what else would you go after them for."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked for a company once that had this sort of &#34;we own everything&#34; IP clause. They tried to get me to sign it after I had already started. I crossed out that part, initialed the change, and sent it back unsigned. Ended up going back and forth a few times, and then it got dropped behind a desk or something and we all forgot about it. Not surprisingly, I suppose, that company turned out to be a bit of a mess for other reasons. When I went to leave several months later, I got a note from the CFO&#39;s admin.&#34;We don&#39;t seem to have a copy of your employee agreement on file. Could you please sign the attached copy and return it?&#34;Haha, no. What are they going to do, fire me? I went down and explained the situation to her, and we had a good laugh. Never did sign. All of the company&#39;s own IP turned out to be worthless BTW, and they were lucky they didn&#39;t get sued for misappropriating IP from the CTO&#39;s previous employer (DEC). Companies doing this is a huge red flag not only because of its grasping nature but because it often reveals a general kind of awfulness among its principals and/or backers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The new worldgen is incredible, both above and below the surface. Hats off to everyone at Mojang that worked on this!One of my favorite game memories of all time was the first time I played Minecraft during the alpha days and immediately got lost in the world. For me, going into a 1.18 world and finding a giant mountain chain and then finding a cave on the peak of the mountain that falls all the way into a giant underground ocean at the bottom of the world in a huge cavern complete with underground vegetation… it brought me right back to that sense of exploration and wonder that I remember from the very first time I played Minecraft.Also, I found this datapack (sort of like a mod but doesn’t require patching the game since the game natively supports loading datapack files) called Terralith [1] that extends the 1.18 worldgen with even more cool stuff. Wandering around the new 1.18-style mountains is incredible, and then stumbling across something the resembles Yellowstone National Park added by Terralith is even more incredible. It’s worth a try if you like just wandering around in Minecraft marveling at the scenery.[1] https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/terralith-overworl..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Man. I really do want to like it, but this update is the first one that gives me the Microsoft-finally-took-over vibes. Traversal and with that exploration just became so much harder. The landscape is now riddled with holes that you either build scraggly bridges over, or lead to massive detours. The sides of bodies of water are much higher and steeper on average, making it impossible to see the landscape you&#39;re passing, and getting up there to take a look is tedious.So you&#39;re basically stuck near spawn unless you want to spend much more time getting around.A lot of surface iron was replaced with copper, which is useless, meaning progress is now slower than ever, and grinding becomes even more of a necessity. Generally, many of the items that now clutter the inventory are mostly useless, and the inventory needs constant attention.Minecraft is a fantastic game that I have spent well over a thousand hours on over the last decade, with many more to come very likely. That being said, with the account transition to Microsoft/Xbox and this update that gives me personally the &#34;Microsoft knows whats best for its users&#34; vibes that I still distinctly remember from WLM and Skype, I am definitely less optimistic about the game&#39;s future than I was a few years ago. I do hope my caution proves to be unwarranted."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you like voxel world generation, I strongly advise you to check out Veloren[1], it has a much much deeper worldgen that what Minecraft offers.[1]: https://veloren.net/ the game is still under development but it has been playable for more than a year now."</p>

Moonshot ideas are exciting, but untangling the nationwide chokehold of shipping failures would be such a tangible, rewarding project to work on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Amazon is such a remarkable company. I may have underestimated their long-term prospects. I&#39;ve been skeptical they would be able to maintain a monopoly for a few decades, but even without Jeff Bezos at the helm, they got enough foresight to continue to expand their operations nonstop.Color me completely impressed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Did anyone else find this somewhat surprising:&#34;The seasonal workers are unloading and loading, picking and packing at more than 250 new facilities Amazon says it’s opened in the U.S. just in 2021...&#34;250 new warehouse facilities opened in the United States in 2021.  Five new facilties per state?  And, obviously, some states would only have gotten 1 or 2 (or maybe less) - so some states would have been getting 10-15....That just seems like a suspiciously high number to me, I&#39;m not sure if I buy it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There was a comment on the recent Blender 3.0 thread posted here wondering why there isn&#39;t an equivalent program for audio. This looks very polished and much more approachable compared to Ardour or LMMS, and seems like a good candidate. But one feature I really wish my dream &#34;Blender for audio&#34; had would be the convenient device view that Ableton and Bitwig offer for working quickly with effects. It&#39;s so much faster than the type of effect chains offered by DAWs like FL and makes it fun to mess around and experiment with effects-based synthesis. Looking at the screenshots and videos it looks like Zrythm doesn&#39;t have this feature, although I understand how tedious it would be to implement because you would essentially have to write your own effects or create wrappers around others to expose an interface that can fit in a device view. Probably not high on the list of priorities for a work in progress DAW"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Looks nice, particularly the piano roll.Do any Free DAWs have Ableton-like VST &#34;hiding&#34;? I can&#39;t leave Ableton because of how insane window management gets on complex projects when 10 different VSTs are all fighting for screen space. Even the screenshots for this app look chaotic from all of the VSTs covering the screen at the same time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not the only approach that&#39;s possible. There&#39;s quite a few lifts in France that pull a similar trick, but with only one cable.They solve the problem by having the bar below the clamp be a flexible section, as the bar approaches the turn, a section a static rails forces the bar to rotate 30-40 deg around the cable, moving the protruding part of the clamp out of the horizontal plane. Then the cable passes around a large diameter wheel, also 30-40 from vertical, to create the turn.Because both the bar and the wheel are both 30-40 degrees from vertical, the wheel meets the top of clamp, rather than the side, but cable can still make a turn in the horizontal plane. They&#39;re a little uncomfortable for the rider, because the bar you holding onto gets jerked left and right, but you make around the bend just fine, and without an elaborate 2 wire system.I think the Chardonnet ski lift at  Val d&#39;Isère is an example of this type of lift, but I can&#39;t find any photos of the corner unfortunately.For chair lifts, the lift at Ski Dubai has turn half way up, and their chairs are permanently clamped to the cable. For going up the chair just goes around the outside of normal wheel. For going down, to passes around an elaborate wheel with cutouts to make space for the chair clamp and bar. The running surface of this wheel is made up of smaller rollers, and there&#39;s a big friction break on hub. So a computer watches for incoming chairs, then slows the big wheel down as needed to align the chair with a cut out. You can catch a glimpse of this here (best video I could find)[2].[2] https://youtu.be/M7ghP4YTk3M?t=204"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s BTW also possible to make a left turn on a single rope if you push something against the t-bars.  In German it&#39;s called &#34;Bachmannkurve&#34; and it uses a giant wheel.  You can see it in action here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfw4em7e2OQVideo quality is bad, but this is what it looks like on a picture: https://blog.jacomet.ch/wp-content/20170120-schwanden-052.jp..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In Japan, there were a couple of ski lifts that make almost 90-degree turn, called &#34;bending lift (屈曲リフト)&#34;. Near the turning point they put up a warning sign like &#34;please hold tight or you might be thrown off&#34;. As a kid I always enjoyed the experience though. Sadly all of them have been torn down by about a decade ago, due to its high maintenance cost.cf. http://cable.cocolog-nifty.com/sakudo/2006/02/post_d5e1.html"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I worked at WhatsApp between 2011 and 2019. This FAQ had very specific instructions for how to opt out of sharing that were only available for a limited amount of time. The FAQ serves as documentation of the product and there&#39;s no need to keep online specific instructions that can no longer be followed.In order to opt out, you needed to have an existing account and take specific actions around the time you agreed to the 2016 new terms of service. Based on the internet archive, this article was removed after April 20, 2018, and before May 5, 2018. When it was most likely obsolete (I don&#39;t recall the specific deadlines for accepting the 2016 TOS)On the plus side, the various terms of services are all available without digging in the internet archive https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/terms-of-service/revisions"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Old habits and mindsets never seem to change despite corporate pronouncements and PR puff pieces written by stenographers. The regulators (and legislators) are either the biggest dupes, or much more likely in on it.Let’s not forget the FTC hookup for Netflix by Obama and the eventual payout when he left office.Or Ajit Pai who came from Verizon to run the FTC and undid the Obama era changes favorable to Netflix and inimical to Verizon.——-I hardly see any of these events as triggers for the mass migration to apps like Signal. The network effects seem impregnable for now."</p>

But the site implies that option is only available for the first 30 days.And even if you, despite their best efforts, opt-out, it&#39;s a very limited opt-out:The Facebook family of companies will still receive and use this information for other purposes such as improving infrastructure and delivery systems, understanding how our services or theirs are used, securing systems, and fighting spam, abuse, or infringement activities.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s worth noting that dig (and host) bypass the normal DNS resolution mechanism used by most programs on the host. i.e. These tools aren&#39;t using getaddrinfo/gethostbyname.Sometimes, I want to see the results from getaddrinfo, which are impacted by caching on the host itself and/or OS-specific configuration settings that dig and host know nothing about. (scutil --dns on macOS, systemd-resolvedand nscd on Linux, etc.)In that case, I usually use ping. e.g., waiting for a DNS change to propagate to a host, I might use:    while :; do ping -c 1 hostname; sleep 1; done"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Dig is great and DNS is hella underrated. It seems like not nearly enough folks know how to wield it. At both $lastco and $thisco people just used a mess of configuration to point to service IPs/URIs. I showed them how to set private zones and records for both A and SRV and suddenly everything is just using sane defaults.Side note: does anyone know why dig&#39;s output is so...eye-bleeding? Why does it show so much info by default? +short should be the default. Why the ;; &#34;comment&#34; prefix?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This comes up every year so I ask a question:If you could fix copyright, how would you do it?Here is what I would do:1.  All works must be registered in a government registry.If it&#39;s not in there it&#39;s not copyrighted.  If you want to register a work from before the law passes, you have to prove you own it under the current system.  This would solve the orphan works problem -- if no one can prove they own it, it becomes public domain.  Basically, ownership should be recorded like actual property with a proper chain of title.  It would be published on a public ledger.2. You must renew your registration every three years.  The fee for renewal will be X% of the revenue from the work, where X = years since first registration - 5 (edit: With a minimum fee of $100 to discourage hoarding useless IP).  First renewal is at 8 years.  Your registration fee would be recorded on the public ledger.If you want to continue to derive benefit from your work you have to pay for the privilege.  After 105 years it will obviously no longer be worth it, but probably long before that.  This would be reported like income taxes -- you self report your profits but if the government thinks you&#39;re cheating, they can audit you.  If you have multiple works in one product (think Marvel movies) then all revenue goes to the oldest work (that way you can&#39;t avoid the fee by putting new and old characters together).If you don&#39;t renew, the work goes to the public domain.How would you fix copyright?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t think they even tried to read the ISA spec documents. If they did, they would have found that the rationale for most of these decisions is solid: Evidence was considered, all the factors were weighted, and decisions were made accordingly.But ultimately, the gist of their argument is this:&gt;Any task will require more Risc V instructions that any contemporary instruction set.Which is easy to verify as utter nonsense. There&#39;s not even a need to look at the research, which shows RISC-V as the clear winner in code density. It is enough to grab any Linux distribution that supports RISC-V and look at the size of the binaries across architectures."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"RISC V is an opinionated architecture and that is always going to get some people fired up. Any technology that aims for simplicity has to make hard choices and trade offs. It isn’t hard to complain about missing instructions when there are less than 100 of them. Meanwhile nobody will complain about ARM64 missing instructions because it had about 1000 of them.Therein lies the problem. Nobody ever goes out guns blazing complaining about too many instructions despite the fact that complexity has its own downsides.RISC-V has been designed aggressively to have minimal ISA to leave plenty of room to grow, and require minimal number of transistors for a minimal solution.Should this be a showstopper down the road, then there will be plenty of space to add an extensions that fixes this problem. Meanwhile embedded systems paying a premium for transistors are not going to have to pay for these extra instructions as only 47 instructions have to be implemented in a minimal solution."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So this is one tiny corner of the ISA, not something that makes ALL instruction sequences longer - essentially RISCV has no condition codes (they&#39;re a bit of an  architectural nightmare for everyone doing any more than the simplest CPUs, they make every instruction potentially have dependencies or anti-dependencies with every other).It&#39;s a trade off - and the one that&#39;s been made is one that makes it possible to make ALL instructions a little faster at the expense of one particular case that isn&#39;t used much - that&#39;s how you do computer architecture, you look at the whole, not just one particular caseRISCV also specifies a 128-bit variant that is of course FASTER than these examples"</p>
