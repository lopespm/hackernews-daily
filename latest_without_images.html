								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There are two statements here regarding things that have happened:&gt; the Core Team placing themselves unaccountable to anyone but
themselves&gt; we have been unable to enforce the Rust Code of Conduct to the standards the community expects of us and to the standards we hold ourselves toIt&#39;s possible that there were CoC violations that they were not able to moderate, that the actions available to them were limited (e.g., they would have initiated a ban but they were not able to ban a core team member), that a core team member intervened to prevent effective moderation, or that the core team prevented the mod team from being able to access official core team channels in order to moderate.Seems to be a wide variety of possibilities and leaving the nature of the situation ambiguous* will likely make it difficult for a new mod team. I hope the now-former mod team are open and direct with new or potential mod team members about the environment they&#39;re entering.* I do think it&#39;s right for the mod team to not reveal the specifics in public; that would likely provoke targeted harassment and make the situation much worse"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is there any good way to craft a message like this?If they outlined specific issues then it would invariably devolve into armchair quarterbacking of those issues rather than the the underlying question of what kinds of checks-and-balances should exist for the Core Team -- gossip, accusations, and political discussions are a lot more fun than debating governance structures.On the other hand, if no specific issues are raised then people are frustrated by having only a partial understanding. Because it&#39;s a lot simpler to evaluate an argument if you already know whose side you&#39;re on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have used Rust for years, but I never bothered with looking into the governance structure.How are team members selected? Who has authority to kick someone off a team? How are team leads selected? Who can remove team leads?Is it the core team? If so, who picks the core team?I can&#39;t find anything online, except this very bare-bones WIP stub. [1]This seems to be a glaring and surprising oversight.Especially at this point, with Rust becoming more and more popular, the foundation in place for almost a year, and corporate interest flooding into the project, I would have expected proper procedures to already be in place for quite some time.There certainly seem to be other cracks in the system. See for example &#34;I refuse to let Amazon define Rust&#34; by core team member Steve Klabnik, extensively discussed here on HN.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My favorite photograph of a fingerprint is when the Chaos Computer Club reproduced the German Foreign ministers fingerprint from a photo. So much for military grade security.https://www.dw.com/en/german-defense-minister-von-der-leyens...-The core problems with biometrics are that:1) Not revokable (unlike compromised credentials)2) Not a secret3) Usually trivial to reproduce and spoof (even &#34;liveliness&#34; tests)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fingerprints are usernames, not passwords. Here is an excellent (and timeless) post on this fact:https://blog.dustinkirkland.com/2013/10/fingerprints-are-use..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The huge advantage of biometrics (fingerprints, FaceID, etc.) is the ease with which a user can unlock their phone.  A passcode may be better than a fingerprint, but a fingerprint+longer passcode is better than a shorter passcode (or no passcode at all).Having a 12 character alphanumeric passphrase you enter each time you want to unlock is not something most users want to do.See e.g.: https://www.businesstoday.in/technology/news/story/what-kick...Only about 49 per cent of the users were setting a passcode, which meant that the remaining 51 per cent were not benefiting from the data protection mechanism. When Apple dug in to understand the reason, the findings revealed that users unlock their devices a lot - on an average about 80 times a day. And about half of its users simply didn&#39;t want the inconvenience of having to enter their passcode into their device, at times. At that time, in 2012-2013, the default passcode length for iPhone was four digits, which happens to be six today.Apple realised that it needed to come up with a mechanism that&#39;s fast and secure, and doesn&#39;t involve typing in the passcode. That&#39;s when Apple introduced Touch ID, which was easy, fast and secure. The way that biometric authentication worked on Apple platforms was that the user must set a passcode to be able to use the biometrics. And just as Apple thought, there was a much higher adoption of biometric-based TouchID. Apple says over 92 per cent chose to use Touch ID and had therefore set the passcode, which in turn meant users were able to use Apple&#39;s data protection encryption system."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Another article that may be useful:&gt; Americans do not understand the difference between a road and a street.[...]&gt; The value of a road is in the speed and efficiency that it provides for movement between places. Anything that is done that reduces the speed and efficiency of a road devalues that road. If we want to maximize the value of a road, we eliminate anything that reduces the speed and efficiency of travel.&gt; The value of a street comes from its ability to support land use patterns that create capturable value. The street with the highest value is the one that creates the greatest amount of tax revenue with the least amount of public expense over multiple life cycles. If we want to maximize the value of a street, we design it in such a way that it supports an adjacent development pattern that is financially resilient, architecturally timeless and socially enduring.[...]&gt; In the United States, weâ€™ve built a 45 mile per hour world for ourselves. It is truly the worst of all possible approaches. Our neighborhoods are filled with STROADS (a street/road hybrid) that spread investment out horizontally, making it extremely difficult to capture the amount of value necessary for the public to sustain the transportation systems that serve them.* https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2011/11/21/a-45-mph-worl..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t think this article is making the point veey clearly, but it is a very important point: roads are for long distance connections at speed, streets are for local traffic: reaching houses, shops, people. These stroads try to do both and fail at both because the goals are contradictory; you can&#39;t have high speed traffic with lots of side streets and crossing traffic, bikes and pedestrians. It will be too slow for a road or too dangerous for a street, and probably both.Separate traffic that requires different speeds."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The essay &#34;Consider the Lobster&#34; by David Foster Wallace came to my mind. In that essay he describes how extraordinary the nervous system of a lobster is and how mindlessly and cruelly we boil them live. If David were still alive, he would definitely welcome this development. I really miss David. I am awestruck by his other essay &#34;This is Water&#34;. I am amazed at his deep insights into human nature and how well he describes it, kindly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Extracts from the LSE report summary:Recommendations relating to specific commercial practices- Declawing. We have high confidence that declawing (removing one or both of the claws from a crab before returning it back to the water) causes suffering in crabs.- Nicking. We also have high confidence that the practice of nicking (cutting the tendon of a crabâ€™s claw) causes suffering and is a health risk to the animals.- Wholesale and retail. We recommend a ban on the sale of live decapod crustaceans to untrained, non-expert handlers.- Stunning. Current evidence indicates that electrical stunning with appropriate parameters for the species can induce a seizure-like state in relatively large decapods, and that stunning diminishes, without wholly abolishing, the nervous systemâ€™s response to boiling water. We interpret this as evidence that electrical stunning is better than nothing.- Slaughter (decapods). We recommend that the following slaughter methods are banned in all cases in which a more humane slaughter method is available, unless preceded by effective electrical stunning: boiling alive, slowly raising the temperature of water, tailing (separation of the abdomen from the thorax, or separation of the head from the thorax), any other form of live dismemberment, and freshwater immersion (osmotic shock). On current evidence, the most reasonable slaughter methods are double spiking (crabs), whole-body splitting (lobsters), and electrocution using a specialist device on a setting that is designed and validated to kill the animal quickly after initially stunning it.- Slaughter (cephalopods). Various different slaughter methods are currently used on fishing vessels in European waters, including clubbing, slicing the brain, reversing the mantle and asphyxiation in a suspended net bag. We are not able to recommend any of these methods as humane. On current evidence, there is no slaughter method for cephalopods that is both humane and commercially viable on a large scale."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s better to be decent in a lot of areas than to be great in one area and terrible in another. If A, B, C, D is how much value you provide in different areas, you should try to maximize ln(A)+ln(B)+ln(C)+ln(D) rather than A+B+C+D. Also see &#34;Law of diminishing returns&#34;, &#34;All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.&#34;In creative fields nobody knows what they&#39;re doing and most time and money is wasted. It&#39;s often as important to think about what thing to do as doing the thing. You will most likely provide great value to your company/work a few days of the year (the days where you implement some feature your customer really needs or where you fix some potential or ongoing big production problem) and most days you will provide break-even or negative value. Also see &#34;Impostor syndrome&#34;.Always automate manual or boring processes. Do not think too much about ROI calculations, they don&#39;t work because productivity in creative fields is very non-linear. Instant feedback is very important for concentration and morale.If you&#39;re prone to anxiety, saving money and building skills allows you to act without fear of major setbacks.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So, after looking over the docs, here&#39;s my comparison list between Remix (which I haven&#39;t used) and other things that I&#39;ve used.- Forms seem better in Remix. Remix seems focused on progressive enhancement here, rather than fetch. Imagine if Next supported POST endpoints, and the idiomatic way of making your site was to use that instead of API endpoints. I hope that we soon see a Remix-compatible form validation library (e.g. something that takes a zod schema, validates it on the server, and handles client-side validation and state tracking).- The nested routes feature sounds interesting, but the docs for it are completely devoid of actual code, so I have no idea how ergonomic it will feel compared to something like Relay (requires complete buy-in to the ecosystem) or Suspense (extremely ergonomic black magic).- The error boundary feature is a very nice touch and this should definitely be ported over to Next."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This sounds more like &#34;socially awkward but want to talk to lots of people&#34; than strictly introverted (which itself generally gets used to mean many things). I have some &#34;introvert&#34; traits: talking to people tires me out, I have no interest in low quality conversations - I dont like chit-chatting with strangers. If this is what&#39;s going to happen at an event I&#39;d rather avoid it altogether than have a pretext for people to come talk to me.But I&#39;m not socially awkward really (imo) more just conserving my energy because I do find talking tiring.So all that to say I&#39;d rather focus on high quality interaction - smaller groups with mutual interests, vs make bulk unsolicited networking easier for me. I can see the article makes sense for the author and would work for people who for some reason want to have idle banter with others."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The biggest challenge is getting people to read what you wrote, and care enough to respond.I started a blog recently where I want to write notes for my writing practice and explore different subjects I&#39;m interested in. Of course it&#39;d be nice if someone had actually read it, for my personal vanity, and all those conversations and opportunities people claim blogging leads to.But it&#39;s not the kind of project it would make sense to drive ads to, or even to niche down and grow an audience around a specific topic, since the whole point is to write whatever &#34;gratifies my intellectual curiosity&#34;. But you can&#39;t really submit this kind of thing to reddit or to forums, they ban &#34;blogspam&#34; for very good reasons. There&#39;s no obvious way to promote it and put it in front of people.Instead of blogging I could try engaging in conversations here and on reddit (and maybe on discord or twitter), and that, at least HN and reddit, works amazingly well for having good discussions (if not for making personal connections).But the biggest problem with engaging in social media is that it quickly becomes extremely unhealthy and addictive (in the way that blogging doesn&#39;t). I want to write, and I want to talk to people, but I don&#39;t want to get addicted to refreshing my profile page to look for upvotes and comment notifications (I do have a big problem with the internet addiction).I&#39;m not sure what the right solution to that would be. Does anyone have good ideas? How do you make actual human connection over the internet and engage in intelligent conversations, without getting your dopamine hijacked and skinnerboxed by the social media algorithms?Maybe there&#39;s a space for a platform that would encourage thoughtful discussion somehow, and limit the immediate rewards that make social media so addictive. But then nobody would use that platform, right?"</p>
