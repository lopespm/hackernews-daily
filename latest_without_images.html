It&#39;s like Google Product Search that is actually successful and widely used for searching for specific products, or Amazon that doesn&#39;t swindle you left and right.It&#39;s basically just a large catalog of products, filled by third-parties a-la Amazon now, only it didn&#39;t sell anything itself (until recently). Instead, it had detailed characteristics for a lot of products, with corresponding filters in the catalog; and good user reviews. Since Yandex is good at dealing with unstructured text, even poor data exports by vendors end up organized decently on the service. Since Yandex had millions of users on its other services, they all could leave reviews without much hassle. And since Yandex is primarily a search engine, it knows when a bogus review is spammed across the web.Alas, it&#39;s only available in Russian since it works with Russian shops. Every time I need to look for a product on the English web, I lament that there&#39;s no service that is quite that solid. Amazon has filters, but search results usually look like simply a bit better Aliexpress. In regard to Google Product Search I don&#39;t even know anything particular—I tried to use it a couple times, and my general impression is that it... exists. Not much else."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a home automation protocol that&#39;s been around for over 20 years called KNX. It&#39;s backed by big names (ABB, Hager, Gira, Osram, Mean Well) however outside of Germany it&#39;s pretty much unknown. Compared to ZigBee or Z-Wave it&#39;s wired and the config is stored in the devices themselves, so there&#39;s no single point of failure. It has strict certification requirements so you can be guaranteed that products from different manufacturers will work together (this does mean its more expensive though). The quality of the hardware (esp. motion/presence sensors) is a lot better than what you can buy from Amazon or the &#39;smart home&#39; section in your local Walmart.There&#39;s plenty of content (in German) on YouTube about it, and forums:https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCiCPbFz0Ld6mera2fNDRWzwhttps://knx-user-forum.de/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve found my experience designing gearboxes for Boeing has applicability to software design. For example, the fundamental idea with airplane design is not to design components that cannot fail, as that is impossible. The idea is to design the system to be tolerant of failure. Every part in the system is not &#34;how can we make this part never fail&#34; but &#34;assume it failed. How does the airplane survive?&#34;This is a fundamental shift in viewpoint.It seems pretty well established that making secure software is impossible. Time to pivot to designing software systems that are tolerant of inevitable security breaches.One example of this is compartmentalization. A single breach must not have access to all the sensitive data. Another is backups must be air gapped (or put on physically read-only media) so ransomware cannot compromise them.Compartmentalization is used in battleship design, aircraft design, spy networks, etc. Time to use it in software systems design.P.S. Just to be clear, one still strives to design airplane parts so they won&#39;t fail, it&#39;s just that one does not rely on them never failing.P.P.S. It&#39;s really really hard to sink a battleship as they are so compartmentalized. See the sinking of the Bismarck and the Yamato."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Largest impact, sure. But architecturally it was a relatively simple formula - compromise a widely used package and sleep on it until it was pervasive enough to be a valuable hack. I disagree with this being the most sophisticated though. Unless I&#39;m missing something about this hack, the Stuxnet[1] architecture, complexity, and long term planning feel far more sophisticated than the SolarWinds hack.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I mean, it&#39;s 100% going to happen again, and it was plainly obvious it was going to happen to begin with. We did a Black Hat talk about this (checks notes) 14 years ago, after being paid by a client to audit something like 12 different agent-based management systems:https://web.archive.org/web/20061215050427/http://www.matasa...Agent-based endpoint management is super convenient and is mainstream in modern IT management. But nobody grows up wanting to write the communications software for enterprise server inventory software, so the code quality on these products, which are ubiquitous, is awful. But 99% of enterprise buyers aren&#39;t even slightly motivated by software security when making purchasing decisions, and everyone knows it, so vendors buy fig-leaf audits from vendors who will sell public-facing documents for 2p1w engagements, and IT purchasers, whose performance reviews are based on completing projects and not protecting their companies from $500,000 purchase orders for what is effectively malware, accept those bogus reviews and get on with their lives.Nothing is going to change about this, because nothing is going to alter the incentives. Reporters like Nicole Perlroth will try to blame it on ex-NSA hired guns (as if you needed the exploit chains NSA buys to break any of these systems), but I can&#39;t think of any realistic policy that could be applied to stop these kinds of attacks, not without massively disrupting the technology industry at the same time.Best get used to it, is I guess my point. I mean that sincerely, not as a sort of appeal to right the ship; the ship is already upside down."</p>

(https://www.brusselstimes.com/news/belgium-all-news/154626/c...)Fast rollout. Involve pharmacies. Involve the army. Distribute widely and efficiently. Prepare for months before the vaccine is here. Follow-up campaign to convince vax holdouts. A real War Effort.There&#39;s barely any calls for volunteering here in Belgium. Hospitals and vaccination centers will complain to the government that they are understaffed but you seldom hear them urgently asking for new volunteers to assign to COVID teams and vaccination centers. We spent a ton of time debating whether the social bubble should be 2 or 3 large, whether kids should be 12 or 14 before they count for it, etc etc and those spending that time were the same people who didn&#39;t prepare for the eventuality of a vaccine, and started doing so in late December.Sorry this has veered off topic. The number of articles that can be summed up to &#34;Vaccines work, are good, and israel is doing it right&#34; frustrate little european me. :("</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The vaccine has 95% efficacy in initial controlled trials. It is almost impossible to reach (within 1%) of that same level of effectiveness in the real world as claimed here. The real world has a big chunk of the population with an immune system that doesn&#39;t respond nearly as well to the vaccine (such as the elderly).Here is an overview of an Israeli study that was finding a more realistic effectiveness of 70% https://dalewharrison.substack.com/p/israeli-vaccination-dat...If anyone has a link to the actual study, please post it! It is really annoying to see news articles posted about studies that don&#39;t link to them or even provide any basic information to find the study."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Related fun (and sad) fact: In Norway, the tax submission forms are online and so user friendly that you don&#39;t need a tax filing program like this. Edit: Here is a link to an explanation for the form, in English, which was revamped in 2020: https://www.skatteetaten.no/en/person/taxes/tax-return/tax-r...The submission form is essentially a wizard that asks you questions related to your situation and your past year. Depending on your answers, it expands different parts of the form. Other parts, such as tax exempt donations are automatically filled out based on information that the recipients filled out for you.I visited the UX department of the Norwegian equivalent to the IRS (Skatteetaten), and they had almost every device you could think of (eye-tracking being the most fun). No wonder they made good forms.I understand that some people object politically to taxes, but as long as it&#39;s one of the certainties of life (death being the other), I cannot understand why filling out the submission seems so hard in most countries..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is really cool, and I&#39;d like to encourage work like this. I currently don&#39;t think I can recommend this to others because:It isn&#39;t immediately obvious who is running the site. whois info lists a Canadian privacy company. The site doesn&#39;t have an about page. Github has contributor info, which may help. Tax returns need to be private and accurate. If it&#39;s hard to verify that the authors are even in the US, it&#39;s had to know if this is a scam.I think the project is still young, and the above is likely something addressable.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve brought this up before, but I wonder if a &#34;JS constraint spec&#34; could be added to the JS standard that guarantees against this sort of (already uncommon) dynamic behavior in certain cases, so that code can be more aggressively optimized when possibleIf you&#39;re already using TypeScript to constrain your code, why couldn&#39;t it generate interpreter/compiler hints?These could take the form of a language-agnostic metadata file, similar to source maps, that optionally ships alongside the JS bundleEdit: Several people have misunderstood, so I must not have articulated this well. What I meant was not a new/stricter subset of JS that forbids certain dynamic behaviors across the board. What I&#39;m talking about is having TypeScript (or otherwise), which knows things at compile-time about how specific pieces of code are and are not called, manifest this information in a way that V8 can digest and act on directly, for that specific codebase. V8 already tries to guess this information and uses it to decide which things to optimize and how, but it&#39;s treating the JS bundle as a black box even though in many cases, an earlier stage of the pipeline already had this information on-hand and threw it away.In addition to being more granular, this (like TypeScript itself) would allow parts of a codebase to continue being fully dynamic while other parts are well-constrained."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve been coding JS for a decade. Nowadays I wish JS was simpler. I’m fine with ES6 syntactic sugar. I just want the language to do be stricter, safer and faster. I don’t want to transpile TS into JS. Just make JS strict with monomorphic types.One thing that really impressed me is how crazy fast golang is. Not just at runtime but compile time too. Esbuild is like 20x faster than webpack. That’s nuts. I see a webserver running on 512MB ram and single core, serving 10s of thousands of requests a second without batting an eye. Just rock solid reliability and performance.I want to build web apps with low memory, cpu, and bandwidth profile. Give us a simpler language that doesn’t need crazy complicated hotspot profiling JITs. Just make the default, simple thing insanely fast.Give us better fundamental primitives that don’t need a gajillion build tools.The JS ecosystem is so complicated nowadays. It just seems we’re patching shit on top of each other without reasoning from first principles.Disclaimer: I am not saying this specific improvement isn&#39;t worth it. I love v8, but I feel we can make magnitudes of higher performance gains by removing things and simplifying such that you don&#39;t even need top level complex optimizations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"By putting the number of arguments onto the stack, we end up making the stack larger for every single function call.   We also require every access to any stack variable to do math to figure out where on the stack it&#39;s arguments are.That seems an insane overhead for the common case...  If this really does make benchmarks faster overall, it suggests an even better solution might exist out there that does not add overhead for the common case...Perhaps it might be worth keeping track of how many arguments a function is typically called with, and recompiling code for each case?    Then all the checks for argument counts can be entirely removed in the optimized code."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Salary is a negotiation between parties. Looked at soberly, you&#39;re the business, your employer is your customer, and the salary they pay you is really the price you charge for your services.They have no obligation to pay more for your services than they think they have to, compared to alternatives on the market. And you have no obligation to charge less for your services than you can get from other &#34;customers&#34;. Either of you can negotiate the price up or down, and the other is free to take it or leave it.It&#39;s not about who &#34;deserves&#34; what. It&#39;s a simple negotiation, like every other business transaction.The more valuable (and less replaceable) your services are, the more pay you can successfully negotiate for. I guarantee you there are plenty of people at these &#34;location-based pay&#34; companies who&#39;ve negotiated for considerably higher pay than others in their location. Just as there are many businesses (e.g. Apple) who&#39;ve found a way to charge more for their products than their competitors have.So it&#39;s worth learning to negotiate. And, perhaps more importantly, it&#39;s worth learning to provide massive value that&#39;s hard to replace. Or accepting the tradeoffs if you choose not to.Let&#39;s say you mould your skillset to fit perfectly into a commonly-open job description: front-end software engineer. Well great, the benefit is you have lots of jobs you can apply for, so you can easily &#34;fire&#34; one company to go work at another. The downside is you&#39;re now in direct competition with a million other people who&#39;ve shaped themselves to have the same common skillset, so it&#39;s easier for companies to fire you. Competition drives prices down and makes you more easily replaceable. But it gives you some safety due to redundancy. That&#39;s often a reasonable tradeoff to make, but you should be aware you&#39;re making it. If you want the big bucks, it helps to be rarer, and to work at places and in roles where it&#39;s easier to demonstrate your value."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a Bangladeshi, I can tell you that the workers in my country don&#39;t have proper unions. They can&#39;t negotiate. Salary is the last thing on their minds, they can&#39;t even negotiate safe working conditions. They are uneducated, so they don&#39;t know what they deserve. See here -&gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Dhaka_garment_factory_fir...So, the cheap stuff that you&#39;re getting is because someone is getting a super bad deal, by exploiting the heck out of workers. Same in China.The garments factory owners are walking away with tonnes of money, leaving the workers high and dry.The more _subtle_ point that the author is making, is that, &#34;wait, if people realize that they can get awesome developers in developing nations for a lower price, I&#39;m not going to get hired any more in my over-priced city&#34;.Good, move to a place where your salary is worth more, and work to enrich that community. Why should SF and NY get all the benefits of economic growth?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you&#39;re running a remote company, there&#39;s another reason (besides fairness) that location-based pay is a bad idea: it makes it harder to create a compensation structure that incentivizes high performance.If Person A is outperforming Person B, but is getting paid less because they happen to live somewhere else, you lose the ability to claim that you compensate people for performance without sounding like you&#39;re talking out of both sides of your mouth. Not only is Person A not going to be happy about that, Person A is not going to believe that compensation at your company is based on performance.Companies that want to hire and incentivize the best people need to be congruent in their messaging around compensation and performance. Claiming that compensation is performance-based and then including a factor (location) that has no bearing on performance is incongruent and will not help to develop the right culture in this regard."</p>

One would think that &#34;functional programming&#34; _is_ using those functions. That FP is all about Iterators and what things you can do with them.But I never see contrived real-world examples, those that really show how things are different from imperative or procedural programming. I want to see how you use stateless functional programming to control a garage door actuator. Or how you model a Car which can have their doors open or closed either by the class itself or external actors. How do you receive UDP packets, including a buffer implementation that is able to sort out-of-order packets and send retransmission requests for missing ones? That kind of stuff.Are there any resources that show these kind of &#34;here is a list of problems, how they are typically solved, and how you could solve with FP&#34; style examples?EDIT: This message was actually to say thank you and that TFA is an awesome resource to help understand how the Iterator methods work!

Double doses, 5x what was needed in monkeys, gold standard adjuvants.I would not be amazed in the slightest if they decide to half-dose the vaccine or do away with the second shot or even both. They probably didn&#39;t have time to run the trial any other way"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So many people in the comments are just certain that more money wouldn&#39;t have made any difference to vaccine production, and that economic considerations had nothing to  do with it. The arguments they make fail to simple comparison tests:&#34;If we paid Tesla 2x as much per car, could they really not produce more cars?&#34;They also fail to privileging the status quo - &#34;If we paid Tesla half as much money, would they produce fewer cars?&#34;Obviously, they would. Money influences how easily they can produce cars.  At the margin there must be decisions related to turning money into efficiency every day. And the same thing must apply for vaccines.  The best vaccine expert in the world asked for a yearly sabbatical - 200k wasn&#39;t enough to keep them.  Double that to 400k?  Oh actually it can wait til next year.The question for people who deny money&#39;s ability to produce more vaccines is: why do you admit that any lower price for a vaccine would reduce supply - but you deny that any higher price would increase supply.  What magic is this?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The results in Figure 3 are certainly promising. Has anyone been able to find the mentioned supplementary material though?&gt; A post-hoc exploratory analysis of immunogenicity in subgroups of participants aged ≥55-&lt;65, ≥65-74 and ≥75 years was performed (Tables S6 and S7). Increases in levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2-spike bAb and nAb at days 29 and post-second vaccination at both the 50 and 100 ug doses were generally comparable across the age subgroups and with those observed in the younger (18-55 years) study participants. Seroconversion rates were also comparable across the age groups and with those in the younger participants. It should be noted that the small size of the ≥75 year-old subgroup (n=22) precludes definitive conclusions to be made.There doesn&#39;t seem to be any link to supplementary material at either the Elsevier page [1] nor the NIH page [2]. The clinical trial registration [3] suggests that there was an update just a few days ago, so perhaps they&#39;re just waiting to upload a new PDF?[1] https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X2...[2] https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7871769/[3] https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/study/NCT04405076"</p>
