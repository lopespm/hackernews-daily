								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"On our product (air quality monitor[1]) we made the concious decision to design it for long life and repairability by e.g.:- using no glue or snaps- all components on one PCB, no thin cables that can break- standard philips/torx screws- four screws to open the enclosure, four screws to take out the pcb- expensive sensor modules on pin sockets for easy reaplacement- only using components that are certified for longe lifetime -even if they cost a few dollars more (e.g. DC to DC converter)- not using plastic for packaging and we ask our supplier to not use plastic when sending us the parts (e.g. no bag around the USB cable etc)We wrote about this [2] and often do presentations for customers and have a slide about this and it gets a great response and I believe gives us an advantage compared to competing products on the market. As the market more and more appreciates this, Apple probably also realized that this can be a competitive advantage and give them positive press.[1] https://www.airgradient.com/airgradient-one/

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Apple started offering home repair kits for iPhone this year, but they’re super difficult to use: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/25/technology/personaltech/a...There’s speculation that offering the kits is an attempt to head off right-to-repair legislation. But seeing this redesign, I wonder to what degree the repair program is incentivizing repairability within apple’s corporate structure. Now that “profit/loss per self service repair” is tracked in a spreadsheet - does repairability matter more?Anyways - it’s great to see some improvement here, for whatever motivation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This has got to be one extremely expensive toolchain and supply chain redesign to do, but since they have done it a few times before (instead of incremental changes) I suppose the money department has worked out when it is feasible to do that kind of thing while keeping the people in charge happy.I&#39;m curious to see if this is a &#39;test&#39; to see if this doesn&#39;t have too many downsides, I imagine ingress area increasing this much might be a point of worry (well, there are flexible seals for that now), and instead of having a one-way stack you now have a two-way stack so tooling and workstations around that (even if we just think in terms of assembly and rework) are going to be a PITA to convert or completely replace.Either this will be a success and allow for the architectural change to be applied to other products, or it&#39;s a medium-success in which this only works for specific parts/antenna/power envelope configurations and we won&#39;t see this design in other form factors.What does itch a little is iFixit whining about the parts needing be a signed set to work together. Nobody has come up with a better integrity protection method, and no-protection isn&#39;t an option either for the ecosystem. Besides, instead of having a &#39;safe&#39; and &#39;unsafe&#39; option for which practically no user will ever be able to make an informed decision, you can simply choose not to buy it if this is a feature you seriously despise."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What&#39;s interesting is that saving the results of a previous operation to memory and recalling/clearing them (M/MR/MC buttons) has been standard in calculators since the very beginning. It just has the most non-obvious user experience in the world so most people don&#39;t even know about the feature."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; For example, if a user calculates &#34;89 x 15 = 1335&#34; on one calculator and taps the arrow key, the result &#34;1335&#34; will be displayed on the other calculator, allowing the user to continue a problem while the previous equations are still shown on the screen. This makes it easy to notice errors.While the UI is very different, the key benefit described here reminds me a lot of Soulver: https://soulver.app/I love Soulver for how quickly it lets you throw together quick guesstimates and sanity checks. The ability to incorporate previous results by reference and update those on the fly greatly improves the clarity and my confidence in my experience."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I haven&#39;t used this app, but something that makes me smile is that the paid version is only 563KB (the paid version is 4.6MB, and I suppose it&#39;s pleasant that the ad SDKs are &#34;only&#34; 4 megs). After seeing every major app take up 100MB+ for years, I had just assumed that there was some kind of static packaging inherent to all iOS apps that jacked the deliverable size up so high. I don&#39;t know whether Ueda was deliberately trying to get it as small as possible, or if his design is so elegant that it just naturally led to such a tiny artifact. Either way, as long as the 3.5&#34; floppy is still in its sunset period[0], I suppose it&#39;s nice that there&#39;s modern software that will still fit on it.[0]https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-62749310"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Pretty cool.The program itself was written in an existing intermediate language called URCL, which was then compiled to CHUNGUS2 assembly. CHUNGUS2 is the processor made with Minecraft&#39;s redstone mechanics. The processor was emulated for development, but the demo is running on MCHPRS, a Minecraft server that uses Wasmtime&#39;s Cranelift to JIT the redstone operations, which are represented as a weighted directed graph. Before MCHPRS, optimizing redstone performance using compiler techniques was not thought to be possible. With MCHPRS the demo takes 9 hours to run, it would take decades using Minecraft.https://github.com/sammyuri/minecrafthttps://github.com/MCHPR/MCHPRSAs for CHUNGUS2 itself, it&#39;s a proper RISC processor, it has a 4-stage instruction pipeline, 64 byte 8-way associative data cache, even branch prediction.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDiapbD0Xfg"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is truly amazing.Comment from one of the creators;This build does NOT run in real time. It runs on MCHPRS,   the server developed by StackDoubleFlow, which speeds up the game roughly 10-20,000x while running redstone. That brings the framerate to a much more reasonable 0.1fps, so the long timelapses in the video only took 9 hours to record in in total."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked on a CPU in Minecraft years ago and designed it to be a 7-bit CPU. I chose that number because it gave me the an appreciable number of operations plus space for arguments. I had only 6 bytes of RAM and about 32bytes of ROM. The ROM was just a circle of transparent blocks (zero) and solid blocks (one) pushed around by pistons.The whole thing was real slow, but it was so much fun trying to design something that would perform interesting calculations. I stopped working on it as at the time Minecraft had some odd bugs with pistons that would cause non-deterministic behavior.I think the most challenging aspect wasn&#39;t the programming or circuits, which were well understood and mapped out, but trying to create modules I could copy-paste inside a special Minecraft save editor to make the machine quickly, then manually dragging out data/command lines to hook the modules together."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Really love the idea, and the passion behind it. Def could have legs.Here’s the pitfalls I see you falling into:(1) seriously, what data are you collecting? “Everything” isn’t a great answer (who’s supposed to use ‘everything’, anyway? “Anyone”?). “Apples-to-apples police misconduct statistics” is a good one.(2) it’s important to clarify 1 because you need to know who you’re serving, and why. Different activists need different data. “Have all data” sounds good until you need to decide how to allocate your resources.(3) more deeply, data is the land of edge cases. Even just with police misconduct, you need to get DEEP to rigorously compare seemingly-simple stats like “# of unjustified police killings”. If you don’t start narrow, you’ll never show value. If you don’t show value, nobody will ever care you exist.When I look at the data you’ve collected, it ranges from annual reports, to municipal contact info, to crime stats. What’s important to collect at scale? To whom? What do they need it for?Again - great, ambitious idea! But $250k goes fast. Show value before it runs out!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You might try defining what the &#34;ideal&#34; department&#39;s data would look like: what categories of data, what columns each record has, what the values are for each, etc. Ideally you&#39;d stamp it with a year and give it a spiffy name so it could be the National Police Data Reporting Standard 2022 (NPDRS.2022) or something.Departments that are trying to be transparent (or who just don&#39;t want to deal with figuring it all out from scratch) may be happy to adopt something considered a &#34;standard&#34; for tracking and reporting data. In some cases it means it is a checkbox they can check without having to deal with annoying people and their annoying questions... but that hardly matters so long as the data is made available. It would also give companies developing software for police departments a target to aim for."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is important. Locally, we had a sheriff who was being heavily, heavily criticized due to several deaths at the county facility. This was at the height of the protests a few years ago.It was a lot of work to find data on policing nationwide, because the question really was &#34;Is the sheriff doing a bad job, or do bad things happen sometimes?&#34;After some hard work trying to identify other cities with similar socioeconomic circumstances and populations, it became clear that our local sheriff was actually better than average, and that much of the outrage was fabricated.That&#39;s also when I learned that many people don&#39;t want to listen to statistics unless they agree with their own preconceptions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I can&#39;t wait to get home to play it.Secret of Monkey Island 2 was my first PC game on a 486SX and VGA monitor.  The sound came out of the PC speakers... One day I got an Adlib card and was blown away.  Go ahead and download the remake on steam and notice something that kind of doesn&#39;t exist in any game (that I know):  when you enter the scene on Scabb Island, the relaxed reggae beat changes ever so subtly depending on the  bridge, the carpenter shop, the mapmaker, the bar, etc.For example, you enter the mapmaker and the Wally music comes on, which is the same reggae bagdrop to a clarinet or oboe, the music is a little deeper in the carpenter shop, there&#39;s an evil background tone when Largo LaGrande shows up and a more subtle one in the hotel, etc.With gorgeous hand painted digitized art.They don&#39;t make games like that anymore.  Can&#39;t wait to see if they actually did."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Two hours in and I&#39;m enjoying it.So far the puzzles have been fun, but not very difficult. The plot is a bit heavy with references to the story of the earlier games, but perhaps not too much (my partner enjoyed it too, having only played The Curse of Monkey Island, but not the others).The &#34;new&#34; art style is a bit odd at first but it&#39;s nice and consistent and it has a style of its own. All the earlier games had a different art style to each other too, partly because the early installments had technical limitations they had to cope with (and then there was that thing with the 3d graphics).The sound track is very nice with some tunes you&#39;ll probably know.I&#39;ll rate it four monkeys and a pegleg."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have the same problem (i.e. terrible short-term memory, though my long-term memory is fine), and I&#39;ve picked up a number of compensating behaviors over the years. By far, documentation is my #1 go-to strategy. I document code extensively, even if I&#39;m the only person who is ever going to read it again. People have mocked me for this, but I believe it&#39;s a superpower.Most programmers believe a number of blatant falsehoods about documentation, with the most prevalent being &#34;comments go out of date quickly, so there&#39;s no point in investing in them&#34;. Maybe I&#39;m just hyper-aware of it because my short-term memory sucks, but code comments have saved me on so many occasions that they&#39;re simply not optional.You can document your code. You can keep it up to date. It isn&#39;t that hard. You just don&#39;t want to."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve noticed as I&#39;ve gotten older that I lean more on remembering pointers to information rather than the specific information. I know something exists and can find it quickly, but may not know it off the top of my head.For example, how to get the length of an iterable in a given language. I may not remember the function name (or if it&#39;s a top-level function vs a method) but I know I can search &#34;string length in $LANGUAGE&#34; and find it. This scales better than memorizing every language feature I&#39;ll ever use.---PS: Dash is a great mac app, highly recommend. Your job will likely cover it if it&#39;s something you think you&#39;ll use."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wrote Private Comments[1] specifically to address this problem in code. My coworkers can maintain context about how a given thing works months after the fact. I can&#39;t. So, I leave private comments throughout the code. Things they&#39;d never want committed, but save me hours of re-leaning when next i encounter a given piece of code.Currently has plugins for Vim (proof of concept) and Emacs (actually good). It&#39;d be lovely if one of you folks would make a VSCode plugin for it. I&#39;ve thoroughly documented the API and diagrammed the code flow you&#39;d need[2], so that this would be as easy as possible to add to your favorite editor.[1]: https://github.com/masukomi/private_comments[2]: https://masukomi.github.io/private_comments/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Blanket statements like this just show that people don’t understand why people stuck with a language.I worked in C/C++ for a long time, though it’s been a while now. I just went to look at whether Rust had any bindings for MPI. It does - rsmpi. But they’re not fully implemented, and only support a restricted subset of MPI implementations which are pretty much the latest versions. Some others might work, but it is not explicitly tested against them. Without that, there’s a whole class of distributed applications that you’d be ill advised to write in Rust using that library, because it’s such a fundamentally core library for distributed applications, which needs to be compiled differently and with specific versions to handle the specialist interconnects on HPC systems. If you only support the latest versions, your code is not very portable to other machines."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I recently tried switching to Linux with a few different distro&#39;s (Ubuntu, Elementary OS, etc.) and use Wayland.The thing that sticks out like a sore thumb to me, and which I&#39;ve been unable to solve, is that apparently it&#39;s not possible to configure trackpad scroll speed. At all.From what I was able to gather, Wayland/libinput say they shouldn&#39;t be responsible for handling it and instead window managers should[0][1], meanwhile gnome says wayland/libinput should handle it[2] and ultimately - several years later - it&#39;s still not possible to in pretty much any Linux distro that uses Wayland(?)When I switch to my Linux laptop to test things, my trackpad is bonkers and I have to move my finger in like 1mm increments because otherwise I&#39;d scroll like 10 pages in Firefox. It&#39;s infuriatingly frustrating.[0] https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/libinput/libinput/-/issues/18...[1] https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland/-/issues/87[2] https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-control-center/-/issues..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Wayland
&#34;The X11 protocol was designed around running graphical apps across the network. While some people use this feature, it&#39;s far from common. Wayland drops this requirement as a way to greatly simplify its architecture.&#34;X client and server are usually the same machine, but they don&#39;t have to be.  While on the road, you can use your notebook to open a Gimp session on your home machine and edit an image stored there.  That is, the Gimp runs on your home machine while your notebook has the GUI.This is a lot to give up for cool compositing effects..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The thing I dislike about Wayland is:  Sometimes the server will crash. Video drivers or something. Hasn&#39;t happened much with 22.04, but used to happen more frequently before. Both with Intel and AMD.When this happens in X11, the server restarts, I see the screen go black for an instant, that&#39;s it.When this happens in Wayland, all my open programs are killed. No save prompts or anything, just insta-killed. This makes Wayland unusable unless they can guarantee no crashes, ever."</p>
