								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I know the privacy approach Apple has been pushing was just marketing, but I didn&#39;t care too much because I enjoyed my iPhone and M1 macbook.Because of this decision (and the fact that my iPhone more-or-less facilitates poor habits throughout my life), I&#39;m considering moving completely out of the Apple ecosystem.Does anyone have any recommendations for replacements?* On laptops: I have an X1 carbon extreme running linux, but it&#39;s entirely impratical to take outside of the house: it has terrible battery life and runs quite hot.  I also cannot stand its trackpad.  Is there any linux-capable device with an okay trackpad?* On phones: are there any capable phones out there that aren&#39;t privacy nightmares?  All I want is a phone with a long lasting battery that I can use with maps, a web browser, and texting.* On cloud: I&#39;ve considered executing on a NAS forever, but I&#39;m unsure where to start."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why do people still think they have _any_ power over user-hostile corporations and its proprietary code?Apple can (and likely will) say they won&#39;t do it and then do it anyway. It&#39;s a proprietary platform. They already have it, now. All they are claiming is an excuse not to be caught in a certain way they wouldn&#39;t like at a later point."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recently listened to a Darknet Diaries episode on messaging app Kik. This app is apparently being used by many people to trade child pornography. In this episode, there was some criticism expressed on how Kik doesn&#39;t scan all the images on their platform for child pornography.I would really like to hear from people who sign this open letter, how they think about this. Should the internet be a free for all place without moderation? Where are the boundaries for moderation (if it has to exist), one-on-one versus group chat, public versus private chat?To quote this open letter: “Apple is opening the door to broader abuses”. Wouldn&#39;t not doing anything open a different door to broader abuse?Edit: I would really love an actual answer, since responses until now have been &#34;but muh privacy&#34;. You can&#39;t plead for unlimited privacy and ignore the impact of said privacy. If you want unlimited privacy, at least have the balls to admit that this will allow free trade of CSAM, but also revenge porn, snuff-films and other things like it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The issue here has nothing to do with children, they would always use &#39;children&#39; as excuse. The issue here is installation of Spyware Engine.The very fact of existence of such Spyware Engine has effect that each person would behave as &#39;someone is looking&#39;.This means zero privacy. This means &#39;no privacy&#39; feeling. Everyone is more &#39;careful&#39; when people around. And this has prolonged effect on society&#39;s freedom, democracy and rights of individual because independent thinking happens when true privacy is there.Even a fear of false triggering the system and exposure of one&#39;s private thoughts/pictures/events to other people during &#39;sorting out false alarm&#39; would make people behave differently. Even if they have nothing to do with any children the fear that their private moments can become public just because some AI would decide so would make each person think twice about each step.This is a huge attack on privacy of individual and should not be taken lightly. The effect will be also huge. Just imagine what they will do next if they get away with this. Just imagine what other companies will do once this is accepted for apple devices.I think this can/should also be considered as a fraud because when one bought apple device one was never told that spyware would be installed some day later.Edit: I think it should be illegal/made illegal to install any spyware on any device for any excuse without warant. Spyware is a Search of &#39;home&#39; without warrant to some degree, isn&#39;t it? Done through the hands of some private company under some excuse...  What about Fourth Amendment?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Im really starting to develop a visceral hatred for Apple.They are talking sanctimoniously about privacy out of one end of their mouth, put on a family friendly face by banning anything offending prude sensibilities, while having no qualms about doing as much business as they possibly can in China. Now this.They are the ultimative dystopian corporation, I find them even worse than Facebook in that regard, at least Facebook has some interest in free speech and does not operate in China.I guess the reason I am so angry is that I like the devices and engineering marvels they can produce. But I cannot be a customer of this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t know about you, but I just decided to switch from an iPhone back to a Nokia feature phone (where is mobile Linux when you need it?) and start backing out of Apple&#39;s ecosystem. I&#39;m quite positive I can live without apps, just as I used to before Y2K. And, in case you&#39;re wondering, no: I have nothing to do with illegal adult imagery. [Edit #1] This article gets (at least) one thing right: when it comes to certain kinds of crime, an accusation is ALL it takes to destroy your life. [Edit #2] I used to laugh at all the &#34;we have your password, send Bitcoin or...&#34; spam. The first &#34;you have a picture of a gray cat on your phone, send Bitcoin or...&#34; message would give me a friggin&#39; heart attack."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"CalyxOS is an awesome project. I have worked with the lead developer a bit over the past few years and it&#39;s been such a pleasure. We share some bits of code between our projects here: https://github.com/AOSPAlliance.If anyone is interested in building their own custom android OS in the cloud (AWS) with same ability to lock your bootloader like CalyxOS, you can checkout my project I&#39;ve been maintaining for a few years now called RattlesnakeOS: https://github.com/dan-v/rattlesnakeos-stack.And if you prefer to not build in the cloud, there is also a really great project called robotnix (https://github.com/danielfullmer/robotnix) which provides a way to build many flavors of OS (AOSP, GrapheneOS, LineageOS, etc)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I purchased a Pixel phone to test this stuff on.I installed LineageOS and found I couldn&#39;t run some google apps. I reinstalled LineageOS with https://opengapps.org added during the install and made the mistake of transferring from my old phone which brought all the google services and everything back to the phone (mostly).I then installed CalyxOS - much easier install process than lineage. Really liked the defaults. Could not get many apps that relied on google play services though. If I didn&#39;t need so many Google-tied apps I would pick this as my phone OS for basic stuff like messaging and browsing.Installed LineageOS again, found there were a couple apps I could not get working after all (50 different apps installed).In the end I gave up and re-flashed Google firmware back onto the phone. I spent about 10 hours on all this stuff and simply ran out of time for now. I though I could get away from Google but I didn&#39;t realize how much my apps needed Google."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you&#39;re unfamiliar with the context: Calyx Institute is a 501(c)(3) with a digital privacy and security mission. For a while they&#39;ve offered, for a few hundred dollars a year donation, unmetered access to sprint&#39;s network. I don&#39;t know the details but I think they have retained access to the network through the merger due to some non-profit provision (something like the sprint merger was allowed with stipulation that certain agencies using the network for certain purposes would be grandfathered over). There&#39;s apparently more history related to the founder previously running an ISP under gag order, which drives their mission.Access to the network is only possible through wifi pucks. I asked if I could register the IMEI of my ThinkPad&#39;s modem/radio, but they wouldn&#39;t allow it citing the usual &#34;we are responsible for the behavior of the devices on the network so you have to use our certified device&#34;. Sadly, these phones do not participate in Calyx&#39;s data network, they require a traditional carrier. Maybe it&#39;s part of their roadmap to eventually offer their data services on these handset form factor devices? But until then, I don&#39;t see a huge point. It would be really awesome to say &#34;I get my network access through a privacy oriented non-profit&#34; (:"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This reeks like a con-artists rephrasing perfectly normal and mundane observations into scary-sounding situations so that people would buy the air-filter companies that are funding your research.I&#39;m all for cleaner air and I don&#39;t doubt that the already well-established negative effects of high CO2 or VOC concentrations on us, but can we at least keep any discussion to non-anecdotal, strong scientific evidence? None the articles linked both here show any rigorous statistics that pinpoint cause and effects, it&#39;s all handwavy conjectures with &#34;common sense&#34; evidence and statistical dressing to show correlation. Correlation doesn&#39;t even necessarily mean causality. Some of the articles even have *may&#34; in the title, you can be the judge.Probably an unpopular opinion given the large amount of anecdotal science already posted.Dust on carpet is bad and particularly if you don&#39;t clean it and let stuff grow - we all know that already and we don&#39;t need a laser pointer to show kids how scary it is. Just because you can see it doesn&#39;t necessarily mean it&#39;s worse, and just because you can&#39;t see it doesn&#39;t necessarily mean it&#39;s better.It&#39;s just insanity that everyone is suddenly a scientists with a few anecdotes or links to articles that show correlation but not causality."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve been harping on this since learning covid was aerosol based early 2020.I like to tell new parents a trick that worked well for us: use a nice filter-based air purifier for white noise. It has deep bass, and it keeps the air near the child extremely clean. We have been doing this for our kids for almost 10 years now since birth.A fun experiment for kids: if you have a laser pointer, shine it close to the ground indoors and kick up dust near the floor. If you see any light in the air, that is all stuff you are breathing in (works really well on carpet)…Air quality associated with:Alzheimers: https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-new-alzheimer...Cancers, plural: https://www.aacr.org/patients-caregivers/progress-against-ca...Sperm Quality: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4443398/#sec995...Female Fertility: https://www.newscientist.com/article/2207560-exposure-to-air...Autism: https://www.sciencealert.com/particulate-matter-in-air-pollu...Bipolar/Depression: https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/air-p..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Do they look at the relative contribution between CO2 and VOCs? These two require very different solutions. The first is about ventilation in closed spaces, and the second can be solved with only a $300 air purifier.EDIT: Here is the original study: https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/ehp.1510037I really don&#39;t understand their methods pertaining to VOCs. Maybe someone can fill me in. Their method pertaining to CO2 seems straightforward."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A somewhat oversimplified summary of the new UUID formats:UUID6: a timestamp with a weird epoch and 100 ns precision like in UUID1, but in a big-endian order that sorts naturally by time, plus some random bits instead of a predictable MAC address.UUID7: like UUID6, but uses normal Unix timestamps and allows more timestamp precision.UUID8: like UUID7, but relaxes requirements on where the timestamp is coming from. Want to use a custom epoch or NTP timestamps or something? UUID8 allows it for the sake of flexibility and future-proofing, but the downside is that there&#39;s no standard way to parse the time from one of these -- the time source could be anything monotonic."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a quick reference for readers:The UUID specs use the terms &#34;variant&#34; and &#34;version&#34; a little funny; &#34;variant&#34; is essentially the revision (so all modern UUIDs have variant=0b10 to specify RFC 4122 UUIDs), and &#34;version&#34; is a 4-bit number identifying the sub-type within that variant:    UUIDv1 time-based
    UUIDv2 legacy DCE security thing, not wideley used
    UUIDv3 name-based with md5 hashing
    UUIDv4 randomness-based
    UUIDv5 name-based with sha1 hashing

This draft registers a few new sub-types:    UUIDv6 sortable time-based, Gregorian calendar
    UUIDv7 sortable time-based, Unix time
    UUIDv8 sortable time-based, custom time"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The problem of hash or NN based matching is, the authority can avoid explaining the mismatch.Suppose the authority want to false-arrest you. They prepare a hash that matches to an innocent image they knew the target has in his Apple product. They hand that hash to the Apple, claiming it&#39;s a hash from a child abuse image and demand privacy-invasive searching for the greater good.Then, Apple report you have a file that match the hash to the authority. The authority use that report for a convenient reason to false-arrest you.Now what happens if you sue the authority for the intentional false-arrest? Demand the original intended file for the hash? &#34;No. We won&#39;t reveal the original file because it&#39;s child abusing image, also we don&#39;t keep the original file for moral reason&#34;But come to think of it, we already have tons of such bogus pseudo-science technology like the dogs which conveniently bark at police&#39;s secret hand sign, polygraph, and the drug test kit which detect illegal drugs from thin air."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Given all the zero day exploits on iOS I wonder if it&#39;s now going to be viable to hack someone&#39;s phone and upload child porn to their account. Apple with happily flag the photos and then, likely, get those people arrested. Now they have to, in practice, prove they were hacked which might be impossible. Will either ruin their reputation or put them in jail for a long time. Given past witch hunts it could be decades before people get exonerated."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I do not know as much about perceptual hashing as I would like, but have considered it for a little project of my own.Still, I know it has been floating around in the wild.  I recently came across it on Discord when I attempted to push an ancient image, from the 4chan of old, to a friend, which mysteriously wouldn&#39;t send.  Saved it as a PNG, no dice.  This got me interested.  I stripped the EXIF data off of the original JPEG.  I resized it slightly.  I trimmed some edges.  I adjusted colors.  I did a one degree rotation.  Only after a reasonably complete combination of those factors would the image make it through.  How interesting!I just don&#39;t know how well this little venture of Apple&#39;s will scale, and I wonder if it won&#39;t even up being easy enough to bypass in a variety of ways.  I think the tradeoff will do very little, as stated, but is probably a glorious apportunity for black-suited goons of state agencies across the globe.We&#39;re going to find out in a big big way soon.* The image is of the back half of a Sphynx cat atop a CRT.  From the angle of the dangle, the presumably cold, man-made feline is draping his unexpectedly large testicles across the similarly man-made device to warm them, suggesting that people create problems and also their solutions, or that, in the Gibsonian sense, the street finds its own uses for things.  I assume that the image was blacklisted, although I will allow for the somewhat baffling concept of a highly-specialized scrotal matching neural-net that overreached a bit or a byte on species, genus, family, and order."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have to say, LÖVE 2d holds a special place with me because it&#39;s the first &#39;real programming game engine&#39; (as in language only no accompanying ide or such) I ever actually developed anything that I would consider a fully fledged completed program I made entirely by myself with.This looks pretty awesome and all but I can&#39;t see the benefits over something like unity or unreal or the amazing for the cost and features Godot.I really like Lua. I&#39;ve always recommended it to beginners or anyone curious about programming for fun over every other language. I&#39;ve used it myself extensivelyBut in this day and age, I can&#39;t really see recommendating this or even LÖVE2d anymore to anyone interested in getting into game programming.There&#39;s just too many high quality alternatives these days."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This framework is what I use for most of my hobby projects. There are some videos here: https://twitter.com/j_miskovI went through Unity and Godot before picking it up. I like LOVR because it&#39;s so code-based, with boring boilerplate parts hidden away. I&#39;m no artist and I prefer simple code editor to full engine IDE. The Lua API is easy to understand and remember, and even the framework code is simple to read and modify as needed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is cool, but I find it hard to find any use case for it. I did plenty of work as an indie game dev in the past, shipped and made money out of games based on my own C++/OpenGL game engine and also shipped a few indie games with some external indie game engines. Then I moved away from gamedev, but recently started playing around with Unreal engine again and was blown away by how much Unreal does for you. It felt like with Unreal engine, game dev is mostly about art and game design and not so much about programming anymore. Given game dev has become so much more competitive and harder to do than in the old days, and the fact that you can get a AAA game engine like Unreal for free (and only 5% royalty after 1-5M in sales), it doesn&#39;t make any sense to use anything else other than Unreal/Unity IMO."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Author here, thanks for posting.Here&#39;s some more color on the reflection on comments, straight from the Linux Kernel documentation that capture my intention much better:&#34;Comments are good, but there is also a danger of over-commenting. NEVER try to explain HOW your code works in a comment: it’s much better to write the code so that the working is obvious, and it’s a waste of time to explain badly written code.Generally, you want your comments to tell WHAT your code does, not HOW. Also, try to avoid putting comments inside a function body: if the function is so complex that you need to separately comment parts of it, you should probably go back to chapter 6 for a while. You can make small comments to note or warn about something particularly clever (or ugly), but try to avoid excess. Instead, put the comments at the head of the function, telling people what it does, and possibly WHY it does it.&#34;[0][0] https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.10/process/coding-style.h..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I agree with almost all of these viewpoints. The comment one though isn&#39;t quite right.Sometimes you just need a comment. For example, I was writing some code to an API and the company was offering a private experimental feature. The API was JSON, but this one feature was enabled by adding a small stringified JSON object to a field of the larger JSON post body. If a developer looks at it, they&#39;ll think &#34;this must be wrong&#34; but with a comment that briefly mentions why, everyone will be saved some time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Know when to break the rules. For rules like &#34;don&#39;t repeat yourself,&#34; sometimes a little repetition is better than a bit of dependency.Glad to see DRY called out here. I&#39;ve seen so much crazy code simply to avoid breaking, The Rule."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So I was scratching my head for a good couple of minutes trying to figure out how this works, being familiar only with HTTP Response Splitting/HTTP Cache Poisoning.So it seemed that somewhere along the years while I haven&#39;t been paying any attention to websec, it became a common practice to send requests from different clients through the same TLS connection. And due to the non conforming way HTTP 2/1.1 interop was implemented by these webservers/load balancers request boundaries were not delimited correctly, making it possible to inject requests on behalf of followup clients.Fine I get the issue. Sounds like another &#34;good enough&#34; optimization that backfired.What is the solution aside from playing the patching wack-a-mole game? Should maybe a HTTP2.1 protocol work without a strict TLS requirement so that protocol downgrades aren&#39;t necessary to squeeze out extra performance (unless I misunderstand why the HTTP2/HTTP1.1 bridge was in place). Or is the problem that some application servers still don&#39;t support HTTP2 out of the box?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"@albinowax_, can you say anything more about how widely you have investigated the prevalence of the &#34;H2.X via Request Splitting&#34; vulnerability?Although all of your attack vectors are fascinating, this seems to be the one which is particularly terrifying. It seems like one single request can basically mess up user authentication across an entire website, and for every active user, until the server becomes resynchronized somehow. If I were running a large public-facing site or application, checking for this vulnerability would be my #1 priority this morning."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It seems most of the vulnerabilities here (at least, the first several that I read in the article) come at a point where an HTTP/2 request is transformed into an HTTP 1.1 request. So the insecurity seems to come at the point where a translation occurs and there is redundant information that can be handled in several ways, meaning that there&#39;s lots of room for bugs."</p>
