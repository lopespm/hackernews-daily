								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hello HN!Pony is a messenger without a send button. When you&#39;re finished composing a message, instead of sending it right away, you put it in your outbox. Once a day—in the morning (5:30am), afternoon (12:00pm), or evening (6:30pm)—Pony picks up anything that&#39;s in your outbox and delivers any new messages that may have arrived. You can edit a message until it&#39;s picked up, move it into drafts, or delete it altogether.I built Pony because email makes it hard to keep up lasting correspondences with people. I think the main reason for this is because email is dominated by &#34;transactional&#34; communication—time-critical messages that are tied to some particular interaction: order confirmations, password resets, etc. All of these things tend to bury interpersonal correspondence. The same goes for texting and chat platforms: they may be good for keeping in touch with people and for making plans, but messages come and go quickly and they&#39;re not really spaces designed for more thoughtful correspondence.Pony, on the other hand, encourages thoughtful communication and acts as a barrier to anything time-sensitive. It&#39;s a highly predictable space and unless you&#39;ve received a delivery, you know that when you open the app, nothing will have changed. And although Pony encourages you to take your time and not communicate reflexively, it also sets a &#34;micro-deadline&#34; every day, which creates structure that helps keep the correspondence going.I&#39;ve started a blog, so if you&#39;re interested in reading more: https://www.ponymessenger.com/blog/2021-11-15/humans-are-not....

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The idea/term of &#34;Outbox&#34; really reminds me of email of the old days (in the 90s) where you have a desktop email client (e.g. Eudora, or Internet Mail and News, or even earlier versions of Outlook Express) that don&#39;t do auto-sends, and only connect to your POP3/SMTP servers when you click Send and Receive. This was probably due to internet being on dial-up and being billed by the minutes was common so users limited their internet time (e.g. disconnect from internet if writing a long email response, etc.). I have a lot of nostalgia from those days vs the always-on culture now.I like that you were able to spot this particular usage pattern as something to narrow in on for your product. I don&#39;t know if this would catch on as a trend (for example, like ephemeral messaging did when Snap came out), but I wish you all the best!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This concept for a forum could be interesting.I sometimes write thoughtful replies to HN submissions many hours later, after ruminating, but HN has moved on to the next new thing. (It is a &#34;news&#34; site after all)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This paper jumps the gun. Detecting wash trading by examining distributions over rounded order prices is a strong and dubious claim for which they provide little evidence. The author&#39;s equate wash trading to non-rounded, clustered prices which really just indicates automated trading. Now automated (&#34;bot&#34;) trading is a technology needed for exchanges wash trading sure, but not exclusive evidence of it.Automated trading strategies (e.g., &#34;grid trading&#34;) are really popular and there are many third party bot providers that integrate in multiple exchange APIs. Maybe the unregulated class of exchanges here just has more permissive APIs/automation than the regulated ones. Automated trading is still legitimate trading where a party puts their capital on the line.I agree that the lack of rounding and trade size clusters is a likely approximate indicator of non-human orders. The presence of automated orders does not automatically mean there is fraudulent wash trading by the exchange.The authors also do not cite previous research or evidence of their methodology working for traditional finance. It all makes for weak evidence of actual wash trading."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recently had to go through extensive KYC/AML email conversations and phone calls with bunch of exchanges like Coinbase and others. Got me interested how wash trading could happen, when they were so strict with me, and which exchanges were investigated.These seems to be the exchanges they investigated. Would be interesting to see a breakdown of percentage per exchange, as I still don&#39;t understand how wash trading can happen at Coinbase since they seem to be very strict.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is why Uniswap&#39;s data is much more valuable than  centralized exchanges.  On-chain trading permits a degree of transparency and trustworthiness not readily feasible with centralized exchanges.Centralized exchanges are incentivized to doctor their data and lie about their volumes.  The larger the volumes an exchange publishes, even if fake or gamed, the more relevant an exchange appears.  Users must blindly trust whatever data exchanges can manufacture.Uniswap charges a flat fee to every trade for all user.  It&#39;s objective.  There&#39;s no special back room trading rates, there&#39;s no ability to lie about volumes, there&#39;s no bonus for having high frequency bots trading.  If you want objective data, Uniswap (and other on-chain exchanges) are truthful."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I experimented with something similar with a Linux distribution&#39;s package binary cache.Using `bup` (deduplicating backup tool using git packfile format) I deduplicated 4 Chromium builds into the size of 1. It could probably pack thousands into the size of a few.Large download/storage requirements for updates are one of NixOS&#39;s few drawbacks, and I think deduplication could solve that pretty much completely.Details: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/89380"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Somewhat related (and definitely born out of a very similar use case): https://github.com/mhx/dwarfsI initially built this for having access to 1000+ Perl installations (spanning decades of Perl releases). The compression in this case is not quite as impressive (50 GiB to around 300 MiB), but access times are typically in the millisecond region."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This seems very much like the Git repository format, with loose objects being collected into compressed pack files - except I think Git has smarter heuristics about which files are likely to compress well together. It would be interesting to see a comparison between this tool and Git used to store the same collection of similar files."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"At the end of the day, it doesn&#39;t matter what process is used for coming up with estimates and delivering.Regardless of what you think your process is, somewhere near the top of the leadership pyramid, it all boils down to a customer promise upon which hinges your organization&#39;s reputation.In non-dysfunctional organizations people at all levels can understand and adapt to curveballs that cause deadlines to slip. In such places you make estimates to the best of your ability with limited time and resources and communicate constantly with stakeholders on how things are going.The hard thing is it all requires honesty.Probably the most angry I ever got at work was once when, at the end of a project, I was on one of those bullshit status update conference calls with 20 people on the line. Throughout the project the team was I was on was led to believe that we were constantly behind and the deadline was from the beginning impossible to meet yet magically got pushed out several times to give us &#34;grace-time&#34;. We cut corners like mad-men, amassed insane levels of tech-debt, and all but put a midget in the machine to make it work. What happened on the call? The product management team congratulated the PM for delivering so far ahead of time. I was so angry I couldn&#39;t even talk. Basically, the PM got accolades, the customer got shitty product, and we hated our jobs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"An estimate is usually the sum of a bunch of smaller estimates. Those estimates have a probability distribution that is asymmetric. While sometimes they can be quicker than anticipated, the lowest they can go is zero (turns out we don&#39;t need it, cut it) and that kind of thing is relatively less common than a blowout the other way. Those blowouts are uncapped, while zero time is a minimum there&#39;s no maximum. The unknown unknowns are the things that get you. Seems like it will take X but the frobnicator was broken in ways we couldn&#39;t have anticipated so we had to get a different thing and then hack it to make it do what we actually needed etc etc. Each individual item has a low probability of that happening to some extent. When you have a bunch of things in sequence one of them probably will if not more.IIRC each item is described by a poisson distribution. (Have I got that right, mean, long tail). Nobody models estimates as a sequence of dependent, poisson distributed events, that I&#39;ve heard of at least. If you did you might at least get a range on the estimate. Between 2 and 20 days. That would be more accurate. Useful to anyone much? Unclear."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Years ago, when I was working at a company, I did a detailed estimate of a large project.I broke it down into components and individual tasks, then put estimated hours against each one, then put it all into a giant spreadsheet, to track planned vs actual times.If I remember rightly, it totalled about three months of elapsed work time.  And it took me over a week to compile the estimate.I also remember that I hit the predicted end date to within two days.But the interesting bit was each individual task was inaccurate - lots were wildly underestimated, balanced by those which were wildly overestimated.  Stuff like things I thought would take a day taking 15 minutes, other things I thought would take an hour taking a week."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have a developing conjecture that in order to address the perceived problem of higher male per capita in certain occupations, attracting males into occupations with higher female ratios is as important as incentivizing female participation in high-male occupations.I&#39;m no mathematician but I see it in terms of system numbers: Given a set of occupations with different sex ratios, to change the ratio of any specific occupation the ratios of other occupations must also change.Incentivizing a specific sex population into an occupation may work for a while; they can boost the overall population in that occupation over the occupations the incentivized population would otherwise enter. However, the true outcome is an overpopulation in the incentivized occupation and underpopulation in others. The difference between incentivized and &#34;natural&#34; population size for an occupation becomes headwinds for any person to enter an occupation resulting in reduced incentive efficiency.In a simplistic rational &#34;Homo economicus&#34; world some portion of the male population that would enter the female-incentivized occupation would move to other occupations and the sex ratios would change. If it is true that males are discriminated against in occupations with high female ratios, then this would represent an even higher hurdle than the factors that result in sex ratio variance in occupations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article goes farther, saying:&#34;There was no evidence of discrimination against women in male-dominated professions or in mixed-gender professions, but the researchers did find evidence of discrimination against men in female-dominated professions.&#34;Sweden, though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"“that, at least in Sweden and the occupations we study, hiring discrimination in entry level jobs is primarily a problem for men in female-dominated occupations,”That&#39;s interesting. I work in a female-dominated occupation (libraries), but, it&#39;s only female dominated at the lower levels. Historically, at least, directors/managers and the upper level folks tended to be men, and those are of course the only jobs that pay very well. So while there&#39;s waaay more female librarians, there&#39;s way more male library directors. I think that&#39;s been slowly changing recently. I don&#39;t see that they look at libraries in this study, nor do they mention managers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have these kinds of feelings a lot.  It is hard to feel useful in this day and age of a ubiquitous globally connected society because for anything you attempt to do you have instant access to the top 0.0001% of the Bell curve who you have no hope of ever beating.I find comfort in that I am not alone, thinking of all the peasants and regular workers across history who didn&#39;t amount to much either, but still mostly fought on and had a good life.  Plenty of examples in immediate family as well.And lastly, I found that there is one thing that one can do that is absolutely unique that nobody can match anywhere in the world, and that is - as corny as this sounds - kids.  It may be a touchy subject or not for everybody.  But raising a human with the best possible effort you can muster is an accomplishment at least one person will remember and value 100000x more vs. any world champion in solving IOI problems or writing clever functional code :-)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My recommendation: feel your feelings, all the way through.There might be some tendency, when you feel small, to feel bad about feeling small — as though it is further evidence of your worthlessness — and that itself makes you feel worse, and down the spiral you go... Been there (:But if you make space for (or even _welcome_) those feelings, even if you don&#39;t like them, then in my experience you end up at a better place.I only mention this because you seem to be beating yourself up about this (&#34;I feel shallow/dumb&#34;).
You can feel bad and still be a good person; it&#39;s an easy mixup to make.(I am reminded of this funny image: https://i.redd.it/9ubhqov2u9k01.jpg [1])Also, not that this makes your feelings go away, but looking at people who are rich/smart/influential/famous is looking at outliers, and people who likely had a lot of luck in their background, upbringing, genes, education, being-in-the-right-place-at-the-right-time, etc. etc. to achieve their success, on top of their hard work. For every succesful indie video game, there are 1000 people who worked just as hard on theirs but didn&#39;t get a big break. The same is true in all sorts of areas of life, big to small. And just in general, FWIW, I don&#39;t recommend judging your self-worth by comparing to others, whether they&#39;re outliers or not (:But sorry you&#39;re feeling down; *internet hug*.[1] (in case the direct link dies) https://old.reddit.com/r/wholesomememes/comments/82lny8/i_wa..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I use “cargo … —-locked” to install things using the dependencies from the Cargo.lock file, which includes specific commit hashes for dependencies. Avoids things like the 0.0.1 problem or even replaced crates. Need to be careful to watch for actual security updates, though.I really wish crates.io would have at least launched with a name spacing feature. This wouldn’t solve every spoofing or typosquatting issue, but it would go a long way toward improving the situation.There’s a separate issue of crates.io squatting. One person famously registered hundreds (or thousands? Tens of thousands) of common words as crate names on crates.io and has been squatting them ever since. Those names are effectively unavailable for use but also completely useless because they don’t contain anything.It’s also becoming a huge problem for abandoned crates. New forks have to choose a completely different, less intuitive name because they can’t just namespace their alternative. As old crates get abandoned, this leads to weird situations where the newest, best maintained crate has the least obvious crate name. It takes work to find the good crate some times because the best named crates might just be the oldest, most abandoned ones"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s why I started https://github.com/mimoo/cargo-dephell and https://github.com/diem/whackadep btw, to try to get a sense of the risk in our Rust dependencies. Whackadep runs a a webserver that updates periodically and shows you what&#39;s up with your dependencies. If there&#39;s a new update, the idea is to estimate a sense of urgency (are we lagging behind? Is it a major version change? Is there a RUSTSEC advisory?) and a sense of risk. For example, it&#39;ll tell you if a new dependency version touches a `build.rs` file. I wanted to add more rules, like the ones mentioned in the article, but never had the time to do it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; crates.io matches the code on GitHub,There is no tight coupling between GitHub and cargo/crates.io (sure it uses GitHub internally but that is an implementation detail).But not only has it no tight coupling with GitHub it also doesn&#39;t require you to use git, you can use whatever version control you want and at worse you don&#39;t get support for &#34;detect dirty repository&#34;.Similar git tags are fundamentally unreliable as you can always &#34;move&#34; some to any arbitrary commit.So IMHO the problem here is relying on code you didn&#39;t got from github which might not even use git to match a arbitrary tag on something on github which might not even be from the same author (but e.g. a mirror on GitHub from whatever VC the author uses).But uploads to crates.io are immutable and are source code uploads, so you can just review them.In general (independent of cargo) do review the code you use not some code you got form somewhere else which you hope/believe is the same."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really hope that the hype around web3 from techies and developers translates into it becoming a reincarnation of the &#34;old web&#34;.AKA I don&#39;t see the general public moving away from centralized web2, but I do think it would be nice if developers created a decentralized alternative to Facebook, YouTube, Reddit, etc. which being made by individuals and mostly comprised of other developers, is very similar to old-school message boards.I don&#39;t think this decentralized platform will necessarily involve blockchain, just peer-to-peer interactions. The &#34;web3 movement&#34; could simply be getting more people to join a decentralized network like the Fediverse, and improving said network, so it becomes a common peer-to-peer developer version of Twitter, Youtube, etc. Blockchain makes it easy to pay people for being part of the network, but you could do the exact same thing with stablecoins or Stripe payments.Right now most techies and developers use YouTube and Reddit and Twitter even though they publicly loath and complain about these platforms (ironically on the platforms themselves). Because it&#39;s impossible for a small group to create anything remotely competing with a large centralized platform. But a decentralized platform, just maybe, could attract enough people and produce enough content to not be obscure.Ultimately, I think most of the interest in web3 comes from nostalgia. Old-school developers look at the rise of &#34;Web 1.0&#34; (the original Internet) and &#34;Web 2.0&#34; (Google, Facebook, YouTube). They remember everything being so new and exciting, and recognize how much opportunity they missed. Well, in the past few years the internet hasn&#39;t &#34;really&#34; changed much, supposedly it&#39;s been much more boring. People want more novelty and excitement and opportunity, and they think and hope it&#39;s going to happen again in something they will call &#34;web3&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The fundamental power of the internet is its interoperability. It was born out of the ability of different networks to talk to each other using common protocols.The interoperability is what we&#39;ve lost in the Web 2.0 era. Even such quintessential thing as a web API has no well defined standard or protocol, just a very vague concept of REST or RPC.I want Web 3.0 to get interoperability back. We badly need commonly accepted standards and decentralized protocols: for web APIs, for identity management, for message queuing, for web callbacks (webhooks), for online transactions, for semantic web and ontology, etc.Take, for instance, web APIs. It&#39;s barely usable nowadays. Imagine if you had to write a special browser every time you need to connect to a new website. But this is what already happens with APIs. Accessing programmatically any web-service requires custom coding an API. Insane!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I mostly agree with the OP. web3 &#34;feels&#34; like trendy possible next gen plumbing that something (don&#39;t know what yet) will be built on much later. So all these kids are busy building things in it and experimenting and I think that&#39;s awesome. All of this is mildly interesting...but...Web2 isn&#39;t going anywhere. It&#39;s not about some ephemeral future of web3, but more about stuff most people care about works in web2. Which is mainly, stream a flick, buy a pair of pants, watch football, order food. Web3 really doesn&#39;t influence any of those basic needs. And social networks? web3+Facebook would be EVEN WORSE. Hard pass.Tokenizing humanity is _not_ the way to go."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a lot of negativity in the comments here, and many of them have merit. However, the thing that is interesting to me about OpenAI, AI21, Cohere, and all the other LLM providers is that they are broadly useful, and often helpful. Perhaps they don&#39;t live up to the marketing hype, but they are still interesting.For example, I used to have a biology blog, and I&#39;ve been thinking of starting it back up again. I&#39;ve been using OpenAI and Mantium (full disclosure, I work at Mantium) to generate the bones of a blog post so that I have something to start with. Coming up with ideas for my biology blog posts was almost 50% of the work.If you&#39;re interested in judging the quality for yourself, I have a biology blog post generator here: https://f0c1c1e0-f6b6-46bc-81a1-eff096222913-i.share.mantium...and a music blog post generator here: https://8aaf220e-4aff-4d4e-ae61-90f08011c9ac-i.share.mantium...(they were both &#34;created today&#34; because I moved them from our staging environment)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s very good that OpenAI is relenting and opening up the API; however the Content Guidelines are still too onerous such that even if you can think of a good use case it will be a liability at best even if your app gets approval.At this point (1.5 years later), if you&#39;re looking to make a sustainable business on AI text generation, you may want to experiment working with large-but-not-as-large models like GPT-J-6B; it&#39;ll be much cheaper too in the long run."</p>
