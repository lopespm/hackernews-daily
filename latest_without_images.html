								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Serious question: if I were to use this, would Microsoft collect analytics on me (code written, keystrokes, mouse movements, sleep/work schedule, productivity metrics, etc) and monetize that data by using it to build some AI product like Copilot, or build a productivity dashboard so managers can fire people for not being productive enough (like Xsolla did), use it to serve me ads, or do some stupid/irresponsible/unethical thing with it that will ultimately end up hurting me in the long run?Because I feel like the answer to that is yes, and I can already see myself in the future writing something angry in the comments section of an article on HN that exposes some evil/stupid shit Microsoft did with this, or happened as a result of this.I&#39;m not against the concept of using a thin client for development, but it just doesn&#39;t seem smart to me do it in such a way where you have to place trust in a company that, throughout their entire existence, has consistently proven that you should not trust them, because they have no incentive to (and thus never will) act in your best interests. It&#39;s like if Facebook released their own web browser and &#34;promised&#34; to respect your privacy; you&#39;d be an idiot to believe them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; My friends, I’m here to tell you I was a Codespaces skeptic before this started and now I am not. This is the way. ~@iolsenI don&#39;t actually doubt that this (and the 4 other glowing employee quotes) are real, but even assuming they are, I can understand people remaining skeptical about the sample size of 5 being broadly representative of the 100s (1000s?) of engineers at the company.Also slightly hilarious that &#34;This is the way&#34; is a Star Wars callback referring to a character blindly following dogma before eventually realising the error of their ways...On the other hand, there&#39;s quite a few &#34;hints&#34; littered throughout the article that their current setup is a bit of a beast, so I can definitely imagine some engineers being relieved to be able to get such a behemoth off their physical laps/desks: I guess if the local development experience is sufficiently brittle &amp; frustrating, any alternative may seem welcome."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So you&#39;re telling me that the next GitHub outage could take out my dev environment and give me an afternoon off? Time to convince management that we need to switch to Codespaces!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’m 61 and have been working in high tech since 1983 or so, writing embedded software, doing system administration, and managing people.The article strikes me as good advice. I didn’t find anything to disagree with in it.Ageism is a thing. People have all kinds of biases of which they may or may not be aware. You have them too, and so do I.A line from another source that I keep in mind is this: “If you’re always getting angry, you’ll turn your nature against the Way.” [1] It doesn’t pay to be the angry, unapproachable person in life.[1] https://www.dailyzen.com/journal/bloodstream-sermon"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This captures a lot of what I have always wanted to express. I am of same cohort as the author, and aside from being laid off once (which, honestly, was wonderful) I have managed to stay well employed 30 years in tech.  I hold no degree. I have no specific super powers.  But, yes... everything stated here rings true for me.  I would, humbly, add some of my own.Learn the people patterns.  Every where I have worked has at least a few, if not all, members of Typical IT Cast Of Characters.  There is the &#34;know-it-all-but-does-not&#34;, &#34;wise old sage&#34;, &#34;management climber&#34;, &#34;new guy&#34;, &#34;one-job-and-doesn&#39;t-want-to-change&#34;, &#34;hockey-jersey-guy-who-smells-but-knows-too-much&#34;, etc.   Pick your own.  Most of these people will avoid, tolerate, get along with, or maybe love the others.  Or some combination thereof.   I have found being the impartial mediator to be advantageous.  Be the &#34;Ferris Bueller&#34;.Know the business as well as the tech.  Technologists that can dive into the business language and work with both groups are invaluable.Diagrams. Work hard on developing the capability to express ideas/concepts/flows in a diagram that fits on one sheet of paper.  Do this all the time...even for one-offs.  As the author states, it helps build your brand.  It&#39;s advertising. When I see a one-pager I did 6 months ago on a desk covered with coffee stains, or pinned to the wall above monitor...I know I have made an impression.  I worked with a few masters of this craft, and honestly, they are all magic on any team.Share credit constantly.  Don&#39;t ever appear that you need validation.  Give good ideas away for team members to catch and grow. You will build a community around you that seek you out for guidance.  Time passes quickly... that junior dev you credited for a schema re-jig 5 years ago is now a VP at BigCo.  She didn&#39;t forget.  Keep in touch, right?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s a great article.I&#39;m 59, and have been out of the &#34;market&#34; for the last 4 years. I have no intentions of ever working for anyone else again. I&#39;m fortunate, in being able to do that.What did it for me, was the atrocious way that I was treated, when I went looking for work, after leaving my previous employer; just shy of 27 years. I stayed that long, not because I&#39;m a &#34;clinger,&#34; but because I was damn good at my job, and they valued me.It seems that us &#34;olds&#34; are not popular. It appears to be personal and emotional; not based on any empirical data (Did I mention that I&#39;m actually fairly good at what I do?). Quite strange, in an industry known for its data-driven approach.It didn&#39;t take me long to figure out that the current environment does not want me around. I won&#39;t go, where I&#39;m not wanted, and I&#39;m incredibly grateful to have the means to do this. I am quite aware that most of my peers do not have this choice, and it hurts my heart to know that they will spend their final years of employment, being treated in such a shoddy manner.But that won&#39;t stop me from working. I just had to set my own agenda. It&#39;s coming along nicely. I tend to develop rather ambitious stuff, and the last few years have been fun. I would not have done it, if I hadn&#39;t been pushed; so I guess it&#39;s all good."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I guess I’m the outlier in being very happy with 1Password and fine with paying for the subscription service. Not only is 1Password the best password manager I’ve used, but it makes it seamless to share stuff with my wife. I don’t care if 8 is an Electron app either, considering I usually interact with it via the browser anyway with their extension. (Also I know that the majority of what they wrote for it is Rust and fast, and I generally trust the engineers to do a good job since they’ve done a good job with it in the past) Also they make a CLI tool for accessing passwords allowing you to integrate password management there: https://1password.com/downloads/command-line/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am a 1PW subscription user and am happy with the product (however, seeing they are moving to Electron means that is very subject to change...)butSaying that &#34;customers voted with their wallet&#34; and chose subscriptions is disingenousEver since they&#39;ve had subscriptions they&#39;ve made the standalone license page extremely difficult to find on their site. They really didn&#39;t give regular users a &#34;choice&#34;- they dark-patterned them into thinking subscriptions were the only optionAs forthcoming / down-to-earth as these posts from the company seem- they are full of spin. Their impossible-to-find standalone license page is a topic they seem to be avoiding.Edit to add this small addendum: It just really bothers me on an emotional level to constantly run into this juxtaposition as a user of software/hardware: liking a product but being extremely disappointed in the company offering it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I cannot find any source files for the FPGA code in the repository (no .v .vhd .vhdl files and I can&#39;t see anything by looking around manually). The FPGA directory [1] contains some binaries and some documents relating to commercial code from a Swiss firm [2].I&#39;ve seen plenty of projects described as open source when the firmware is open source and the hardware is closed but this is the first time I&#39;ve seen one where the schematics and board layout are open but the firmware is closed. Note that the hardware itself is quite simple, the smart stuff happens in three modules: GNSS receiver, precision clock and FPGA. To me, the contents of the FPGA source code are the only interesting part of this project. Additionally, you won&#39;t be able to meaningfully modify or reuse this project without editing the source code.The hardware module these FPGA binaries seem to be compiled for is described as an AC7100B, the source given for these is a defunct ebay link [3] [4] :-O This project uses two and half grand&#39;s worth of atomic clock and the heart of it runs on a module that fell off the back of a lorry!?[1] https://github.com/opencomputeproject/Time-Appliance-Project...

[4] https://www.ebay.com/itm/XINLINX-A7-FPGA-Development-board-A...Edit: I realise this comes across as quite negative. This looks like a neat project, one I would actually use, but only if it were meaningfully open source."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What&#39;s interesting to me is how the form factor of timing GPS modules has stayed constant over the years.  I started my GNSS timing journey with a used Trimble GPS from the 2000s, and it has the same form factor and pinout as the modern multi-constellation timing GPSes from uBlox.I&#39;ve had a GPS clock going for several years at this point, and without an atomic clock or really any fanciness (just LinuxPPS and Chrony), I see about +/- 380ns, which is pretty good.  NTP to the Internet gives me jitter in the range of about 20ms-70ms, about 5 orders of magnitude worse.(The version a few iterations ago looked like this: https://github.com/jrockway/beaglebone-gps-clock.  But I now have a uBlox multi-constellation GPS, which is much more accurate with my limited view of the sky from my Brooklyn apartment.  And I 3D printed the case, so it actually looks presentable instead of like some crazed madman that attacked a plastic case with a hacksaw -- which is exactly how I made the first case.  As for the DS3231 RTC that I added... that seems to be stable within about 1.5us, which is pretty impressive.  I tuned it a little bit with the trim register, though.)My takeaway from this article is that the project seems quite compelling, but a lot of cost is added to support PTP.  I see why Facebook needs that, but to sync time precisely throughout my lab, all I need is a coaxial cable with 10MHz on it.  I don&#39;t mind if my workstation is 20ms off UTC."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Man, tough crowd here. And someone who&#39;s been following precise timekeeping tech for 25 years now.. this is really cool! I think it&#39;s great some smart engineers have built a new reasonably compact and low cost very precise bit of timekeeping hardware. Thank you for sharing it open source!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Since leaving Australia (and started living in Europe) I have come to the conclusion that Australia is not a &#34;real&#34; country - it is just a continent owned by corporate interests that happens to also have people living on it.Corporate interests own the media, politicians, food production, education etc. and no one cares, because Life Is Good. Why expect anything to change, or people to care about strong democratic institutions, when there is no incentive for them to care about abstract concepts such as privacy or governmental oversight.Decades of bull markets, house price increases, a decline in public education, torpedoed communication infrastructure and complicit &#34;independent&#34; media has resulted in a wealthy, ignorant and complacent society who allow their representatives full control over their lives. It is not that they don&#39;t care about these issues, they are not even aware they are issues at all.But who cares, when you can go to the beach?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Since 2015 and the meta data laws it’s no wonder things have continued to get worse.There was practically no opposition to the meta data laws. No popular resistance. No protests. It’s a non-issue for the public or political class.The extent to which non-tech people in my social circles care is to switch to signal. Not that they’ve stopped using the other tools.There seems to be a “what else can we do” attitude.Unfortunately, there is also no other party to vote for, as both major parties (liberal and labour) hold the same policies on ‘national security’."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Australian tech workers, get out get out get out get out…I can’t stress this enough. The Australian tech industry is a failing joke. You are being grossly underpaid. The country _is_ an authoritarian surveillance state and has been for years and years. The frog boiled and died years ago. Peace out, and find somewhere that will treat you well."</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28143261">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A lot of the discussion here is treating impostor syndrome and qualifications as binary: You&#39;re either qualified or not. And your evaluation of your skills is either above your actual skills or not.But it&#39;s more nuanced than that.I&#39;m a Principal Engineer at a FAAMNG company. I have impostor syndrome all the time. Why? Because I measure myself against 1) role models that are ahead of me in many ways - I&#39;ve always done that, and it&#39;s how I grow, 2) against those with strengths in areas that I have weaknesses.I think my impostor syndrome is absolutely fact-based. I am not as good in the technical areas I care about as those I measure myself against.My fallacy is that there is a billion things that I am good at, but I don&#39;t consider them difficult (how could they be, if I am good at them), or I consider them insufficient to a fully rounded engineer, if I don&#39;t also have the skills that I know I&#39;m missing (but some of my peers are not).It doesn&#39;t help that I&#39;m the epitome of a &#39;Generalist&#39; - I&#39;m good at a lot of things, but I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m the BEST at anything.I get lots of positive reinforcement - from my management chain, and from those more junior than me. But it never resonates. I always think &#34;damn, I&#39;ve actually fooled them all&#34;. And then I feel guilty that the management is putting so much trust in me, and that the juniors actually look up to a fraud.The only feedback that resonates is from my technical peers. Luckily I get this just often enough that I don&#39;t fall into a catatonic mess of anxiety. And sometimes I believe it..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I guess I just don&#39;t really believe this. It sounds nice, and it might even be a good falsehood to tell yourself for personal motivation—but that doesn&#39;t make it true.Yes, of course if you&#39;re an actual fraudster intending to commit fraud, you&#39;re probably comfortable with committing fraud. But feeling &#34;impostor syndrome&#34; colloquially means  second-guessing whether you&#39;re good enough to deserve your position.There are absolutely lots of people who are better at their jobs than they think they are. But I have to imagine there are also lots of people who are just as bad as they think they are, if not worse."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The title is somewhat misleading, because it&#39;s talking about two different types of imposter.The &#34;imposter&#34; of &#34;imposter syndrome&#34; believes others didn&#39;t figure what they really are, that they&#39;re flawed, underskilled, will fail, etc. ; and that makes you somewhat of a fraud, i.e. an imposter, because they&#39;re secretly not the skilled person that was hired.The &#34;actual imposter&#34; from the &#34;imposter syndrome&#34; would be someone who actually lied about their skills and flaws, or at the very least don&#39;t have these skills. I don&#39;t know if these &#34;imposters&#34; have the imposter syndrome or not - but for the sake of argument I would assume that they have the same doubts as everyone else and that they do have imposter syndrome.The &#34;actual imposter&#34; who the author is mentioning is a con, someone who was secretly malfeasant and there for their own benefit. What&#39;s more is that from what the author is saying, they seem pretty skilled, and confident. So of course they don&#39;t have imposter syndrome: they fixed an organization, bring in money, their plan is going well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Kim Stanley Robinson&#39;s recent book The Ministry For the Future starts with a very disturbing scenario: A heatwave  with a &#34;web bulb&#34; temperature of 35 Celsius.It turns out, in those temperatures, even young and healthy people can&#39;t survive. Combined with power outages, as happens in the book, everyone living under such a heat wave will likely die.It&#39;s looking increasingly likely that such heatwaves are possible in the future, and possibly quite deadly. This could result in the mass deaths of many people, especially in poor tropical countries that don&#39;t have a stable infrastructure to cool most people during such a heatwave. I hope a mass death event from a &#34;web bulb&#34; 35C heatwave never happens, but I&#39;m losing hope, especially with the increasing global temperatures, and the very lackluster progress being made on carbon output."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are two cities in India that are pretty close by where this difference is very clear. Chennai is on the coast, while Bangalore is inland at a higher altitude while they’re both pretty much the same latitude.The difference in perception even if the dry bulb temperature is the same is insane. In Bangalore I can always find shade and it’ll be cool instantly, but in Chennai my whole body is always soaking wet, my clothes are drenched with my own sweat and I still feel like always about to faint.I used to take long walks during the day when I lived in Bangalore (it has other man made problems like traffic which are still irritating) but here I Chennai I can’t walk or jog outside even if I wanted to.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Similar question to this that I&#39;ve been wondering this wildfire season -- at what point is  AQI  (Air Quality Index) too severe for human tolerance? The scale tops out at 500, what happens to a person if the air is even worse than that?Some sensors near Medford, OR are reading in the upper 400&#39;s and even low 500&#39;s -- what happens if it hits what would be the  1000&#39;s if the scale went that high?I&#39;m mostly thinking of particulates, but AQI includes other gases like CO, SO2,  NO2 so maybe those would be more dangerous than particulates (and certainly harder to filter out)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s plenty wrong with Ethereum, but casting miners as &#39;the working class&#39; is a flawed analogy. The mercantile class would be closer to the mark. Notably, their hashing power is based in real world economic power and they extract an annuity from capital expenditure on mining operations and hardware.I also question whether miners are really providing the labour power, as you might expect the working class to do. They build the roads and keep the lights on but the means of production of value is (or ought to be) the services provided by those writing functionality that makes the network useful, i.e. the smart contract writers. Whether one thinks smart contracts on Ethereum have any value is another question but that was at least the vision.A move to proof-of-stake does not remove the role of miners/validators. Validators will still earn a reward from validating blocks. So it&#39;s not as if this &#39;class&#39; is being disenfranchised totally.Finally the social class analogy entails disjointness of classes, this is certainly not the case for miners, many of whom are major token holders, and some of whom are involved in governance (of course by miners we are taking about the humans controlling the mining rigs not the computers themselves)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Something here seems awfully similar to the system that crypto-currency was meant to fix. It was meant to eliminate rulers. It was meant to make everyone accountable for their actions. It was meant to reward the intelligent, the hard working and the capable, and not reward the incompetent, or the makers-yet-breakers of promises. However, this repeat of the broken old system seems to be playing out again.&#34;One response is that the promise was not well thought through. The idea was to replace &#34;rulers&#34; (human beings who make decisions to take care of a system) and &#34;law&#34; (written rules interpreted by humans) with code. But (a) code is written by humans who make mistakes; (b) the world changes, and systems need to update to respond to that; (c) somebody has to be responsible for dealing with a and b. As a result, currencies need central organizers to look after them. And those central organizers need to be motivated, i.e., paid. Old-fashioned currencies have sovereigns to back them, and the sovereigns are paid by the monopoly of taxation and/or the ability to issue money. Inefficient, but it works.From this perspective, bitcoin et al. look like technical solutions to social problems. In particular, bitcoin is designed to have nobody taking care of public goods problems on its behalf. That&#39;s a flaw![1][1] https://wyclif.substack.com/p/thought-bubble-defending-bitco..."</p>

I did not want to, given the 30 minute play time estimate, but I ended up playing the anxiety demo [0] on the same site, and spending about an hour total.... it was incredibly informative and eye-opening.[0]: https://ncase.me/anxiety-demo/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve played this and it’s fantastic. Do play it to the end.I found it extremely insightful and their observations connected long standing disparate dots for me. It’s as if a big jumbled up puzzle suddenly clicked into place."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The &#34;language models don&#39;t really understand anything&#34; corner is getting smaller and smaller. In the last few months we&#39;ve seen pretty definitive evidence that transformers can recombine concepts ([1], [2]) and do simple logical inference using contextual information ([3], &#34;make the score font color visible&#34;). I see no reason that this technology couldn&#39;t smoothly scale into human-level intelligence, yet lots of people seem to think it&#39;ll require a step change or is impossible.That being said, robust systematic generalization is still a hard problem. But &#34;achieve symbol grounding through tons of multimodal data&#34; is looking more and more like the answer.[1] https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/

								<p class="story__comment_others">"A warning to devs building on OpenAI APIs:
We spent months developing a chatbot using GPT3 for our game and released a video showcasing it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnuSQvoroJo&amp;t=264sAfterwards OpenAI then added GPT3 chatbot guidelines disallowing basically anything like this.
We were in communication with them beforehand, but they decided later that any sort of free form chatbot was dangerous.What they allow changes on a weekly basis, and is different for each customer. I don&#39;t understand how they expect companies to rely on them"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m still surprised by the approach. I mean, great that it works this well -- but program synthesis is one of those rare domains where you can observe exactly what the outcome is after you generate something. You can see execution traces, variable values, what the JIT produced, etc. And all of this is relatively cheap -- often executing a code snippet should be far cheaper than an extra pass through a giant DNN right? So it&#39;s fascinating to me that they train entirely from dealing with code as text.Imagine learning to develop recipes, not by ever cooking or eating or even seeing food, but only reading a giant library of cookbooks. Or learning to compose music but never hearing or playing anything -- only seeing scores."</p>
