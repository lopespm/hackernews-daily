								<p class="story__comment_others">"Can someone help me understand Robinhood&#39;s POV?  This just seems so outrageous that there must be some sane rationale that I&#39;m not seeing.Why do Robinhood, Reddit, Discord, etc feel like they have to respond to this?  Whether the investments being made are responsible or not, it doesn&#39;t seem like it should be their place to intervene.If the hedge funds over-shorted GME and WSB recognized that and traded against that bad analysis, then that&#39;s great!  If the pendulum swung the other direction and WSB is trading into some momentum, how is that any different than the hedge funds doing the same with shorts?  Why should Robinhood pick a winner (siding against their own customers)?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Robinhood got about 40% of their revenues from one of the hedge funds that just took a dive on Gamestop.  Highly recommend an investigation.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The failure (our failure) to make the ideals and ideas of freedom in the digital age accessible and present in politics is a disaster. FOSS ideas, open culture ideas. What the world wide web actual is... It&#39;s not even that they disagree, they aren&#39;t even aware.We spent decades fiddling arguments with one another while  events just took their course. Politicians don&#39;t understand or care about any of these ideas. The public doesn&#39;t either. When &#34;something must be done&#34; about this or that... because digital culture progresses to some point, the deep well of ideas that dominated web culture have zero impact.Ultimately, the encryption argument is being had between spooks and tech monopolies. Politicians are bystanders. There is no &#34;freedom of speech&#34; equivalent, no idea of the current technological age to guide them. No flag for the public to rally to.The right to privacy is great, but we can&#39;t just keep arguing by analogy. We need modern age thinking to define this for modern circumstances."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I always say if politicians want to ban encryption being absolute (by making it insecure): you first. Lets see how well it works by implementing encraption in your systems and email and seeing if your backdoor deals and illegal activity winds up in the public eye for all to see."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Put simply, the resolution is no different from the previous proposals which generated a wide backlash from privacy-conscious companies, civil society members, experts, and MEPs. The difference this time is that the Council has taken a more subtle approach and avoided explicitly using words like ‘ban’ or ‘backdoor.’ But make no mistake, this is the intention. It’s important that steps are taken now to prevent these proposals going too far and keep European’s rights to privacy intact.”"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi, Litestream author here. I&#39;m happy to answer any questions about the policy or the project itself. I was apprehensive about adding the closed-contribution policy but I&#39;ve seen overwhelmingly positive support for it since I released.Some commenters have noted that I could use another free code hosting platform. That&#39;s a valid criticism. However, I like the tools and workflow that GitHub offers personally. The GitHub Discussions feature in particular has been a nice step toward improving communication. GitHub Actions have been really nice for a CI workflow too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Github really needs to allow people to disable the &#34;Pull Request&#34; tab on repos, to reduce the stigma around not accepting pull requests.https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/1191 3 years and counting.Some people are resorting to adding bots which auto-close PRs with a message like &#34;Sorry, I&#39;m not accepting PRs at this time&#34;, but that only triggers once the person has put in the effort to patch your project, at which poi t they may get annoyed to be suddenly told that PRs aren&#39;t welcome.Best solution is to keep code somewhere other than github. Is sourceforge still around?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This was a problem for us and the lack of the ability to switch off PRs continues to cause problems.Community submissions are virtually always throw away, particularly on a complex code base. We ended up saying it&#39;s a legal problem [1], which it partly is. But throw away not only because of quality issues, always because of project scope issues.Yes, you feel the project is completely useless unless emoji icons animate in diagrams. That&#39;s great, fork the project and kill ours off by adding the feature (which they won&#39;t and it won&#39;t).When you know what the project scope is, tight enforcement of that scope is critical to prevent the complexity of the project from running away and ultimately killing the project entirely.https://github.com/jgraph/drawio"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;a workable plan that enables more free speech, [...] That approach: build protocols, not platforms.  To be clear, this is an approach that would bring us back to the way the internet used to be. The early internet involved many different protocols—instructions and standards that anyone could then use to build a compatible interface. As I&#39;ve commented before[1][2], discussing protocols and advocating for them is a popular topic but it does not make progress.The real issue is funding and trying to make humans do what they don&#39;t want to do.If HN is overrepresented by vanguards of decentralization and free speech, why are a lot of us here on HN instead of running USENET nodes and posting to a newsgroup such as &#34;comp.programming.hackernews&#34; to avoid being moderated by dang?If most of HN knows how to set up git and stand up a web server, why do most of use Github instead of running Gitlab on a home pc/laptop/RaspberryPi or rent a Digital Ocean vps?It&#39;s because &#34;free &amp; open protocols&#34; weren&#39;t really the issue!A lot of us don&#39;t want to run a USENET node or manage our own git server to share code.[1] the so-called &#34;open&#34; internet of free protocols: 
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20231960[2] free &amp; royalty free protocol like Signal still doesn&#39;t solve the &#34;who pays for running the server&#34; problem:  https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20232499"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;After a decade or so of the general sentiment being in favor of the internet and social media as a way to enable more speech and improve the marketplace of ideas, in the last few years the view has shifted dramatically—now it seems that almost no one is happy.&#34;10 or 15 years ago people looked at web 1.0, saw many good communities and valuable conversations and said &#34;we need to protect free speech&#34;.Today people looks at Twitter/Facebook/YouTube/Reddit, see mismanaged cesspools and declare that we need centralized speech control.This is understandable, but highly reactionary and irrational. Speech control is facilitated by big tech at their own discretion. Advocating for more of it means you&#39;re advocating for giving more power to the companies who fucked up the system in the first place."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I read, and re-read the article and I am yet to understand how a protocol will help what the author describes in the first few paragraphs. (BTW very nicely walked around that hot bowl of mess!)First, Usenet was just as much of a dumpster fire as Reddit et al. in some branches (alt. I am looking at you).  The rest (comp. soc. sci. etc) were heavily self moderated.Second, I am not sure the author is clear on what is the primary product of social media, as I see it. We, the users are the product.  By moving to a protocol, there is little to no opportunity to capture private information about the product. (Not complexity, too big, or filter bubble.)Why would a platform give up such income stream?Am I misunderstanding what the author means by protocol here?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation settles most listed securities transactions in America; in 2011, it did $1.7 quadrillion [1]. You&#39;ve never heard of it unless you&#39;re a professional trader, but it&#39;s actually quite fascinating to read up on.Trading looks instantaneous. But settlement takes a few days. In between are a series of credit agreements. From your broker to you. From the clearinghouse to the brokers. DTCC is the clearinghouse. Robinhood is the broker.There are rules and contracts between DTCC and its members, including Robinhood [2]. Those contracts ensure that when you buy shares through your broker from a Robinhood customer, if Robinhood falls down two days later, there is collateral sufficient to make you whole. Those collateral requirements change in reference to, amongst other things, the volatility of the security. (If a broker falls down, the clearinghouse liquidates their collateral and makes their counterparty whole. More volatility means more chance the collateral will be insufficient.)In this case, collateral requirements on GME went up. Because of its volatility. So while before Robinhood had to pony up collateral for a few shares of GME for every hundred it traded, it now had to, at close of business, pony up one hundred shares&#39; worth of collateral for every hundred it traded. That creates a cash crunch. One that exacerbates itself with every additional trade in the security. If Robinhood fails to satisfy those collateral calls, they go out of business overnight. Into receivership. Done.Most brokers have policies for these situations. Higher brokerage fees for securities on a schedule. Not making shares and cash from trades available until the trade settles, sort of like what banks do for large cheques. But I don&#39;t know if Robinhood is able to do that quickly. So instead they pulled the plug.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depository_Trust_%26_Clearing_...[2] https://www.dtcclearning.com/products-and-services/settlemen..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I suspect this will be lost in the hysterical clamour, but yes, it is in fact true that trading platforms have to worry about systemic risk and their ability to work with certain capital obligations. The idea that this just boils down to some good old boy phoning up RH and asking them to pump GME doesn&#39;t stand up to very much scrunity at all. But such is life- the baseless conspiracy is easier to believe if you don&#39;t spend time understanding how these companies work."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The RH apologists are going on long winded explanations about clearing houses (and to some extent there’s elements of “it’s too complex for your little brain”). But even to the extent it’s true, if I put in 5k from my checkings into RH and buy stock, why does Rh need all this liquidity to get orders filled? I understand turning margin accounts off, but that’s it . Past that, at best robinhoods business model is highly flawed , at worst it’s fraudulent. Because ultimately, all the finance whiz bang talk doesn’t change common sense that only allowing trades in one direction is unfair, and is incredibly bad optics when that direct benefits a huge player filled with conflicts of interest. But honestly I think the “robinhood is committing fraud” is being underweighted amongst “serious “ discussion."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s been a while since I did this, but last time I transferred shares from one brokerage to another, it took several days.It seems to me that if you are holding GME, the last possible thing you want is being stuck in a position for a while.For this particular case, it might be a better choice is to liquidate your position, cash out and just open another brokerage account. I know this is the total opposite of what the WSBs are looking for but the alternative is transferring a position with $50k and when you can trade again its only worth $500."</p>
