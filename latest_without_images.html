It was phpBB."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This also happened to me back on Nov 10, 2021. I had an old LastPass account, wasn&#39;t using it, when all of a sudden i get an email:--
Login attempt blocked
Hello,Someone just used your master password to try to log in to your account from a device or location we didn&#39;t recognize. LastPass blocked this attempt, but you should take a closer look.
---Like you, it told me that the attempt came from Brazil, using an IP address starting with 160. I have no idea how they would&#39;ve gotten that password. Made me wonder if LastPass had some issue, but nothing was in haveibeenpwned"</p>

  Location UNITED STATES
  IP address 107.173.195.83

Actions taken, in this order:  - Head to *Advanced Options* -&gt; *View account history* to see if anything suspicious is going on (nothing so far)
  - Disable Lastpass MFA and use Google Authenticator (Authy)
  - *Account Settings* -&gt; click on *Show Advanced Settings* -&gt; *Destroy Sessions* (to see if anyone is actively logged in)
  - *Account Settings* -&gt; click on *Show Advanced Settings* -&gt; *Country Restriction* to my country only (luckily not in the US as the bot was)
  - Change Master Password

Also moments earlier:  - Investigating all Mac processes
  - Disabled all Chrome extensions and deleted most (should have made a list)


Let&#39;s hope it&#39;s not as bad as it seems.Edit#1 | Following IP addresses are reported in the thread so far:  160.116.88.235

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29697828">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"PSA: In a lot of country, non-competes agreement are illegal, at least in the form they usually take. In many jurisdiction,  non-compete will only apply when specific condition are met. For example, in France[0], all non-compete have to have :- a &#34;reasonable&#34; time limit- a specific geographic region (i.e: only in France, U.E, etc...) -&gt; this is very often omitted, and &#34;the whole world&#34; is not valid.- The non-competition has to be for a specific activity. This is often not understood and instead you find something like &#34;not work for our competitor&#34; or &#34;not work for a company in this field&#34;. This is not specific enough and will be thrown out in court.- There has to be a financial compensation.Despite this, almost all the company that I worked for in France had non-applicable non-competes agreement in their contract. None of them offered a financial compensation and none had a specific region.As far as I know, this is not a France-only thing, and non-competes creeps in almost any employment contract in the world, especially in the tech field. Learn your rights.[0] https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F1910"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Employees not succeeding at disconnecting from work is often unintentional, and caused by subtle, pernicious effects of middle managers simply existing and following basic incentives (such as &#34;my boss just sent me an email after dinner, guess I should act/forward it along&#34;).Forcing companies to write down their policy on this seems like a pretty good idea, because it forces HR to actually decide how they want their employees to be treated, and enables middle managers to be held accountable for their actions along this axis."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reading the text, they didn’t actually create a right to disconnect from work. They only require employers to write down their policy and share it with employees:&gt; The legislation offers no guidance as to what must be included in the policy, and simply provides that the policy must include &#34;such information as may be prescribed.&#34; This was apparently intentional as noted in the legislative summary in an effort to offer employers flexibility to develop a policy appropriate to its operational needs.So unless I’m missing something, a company can write down “Employees must be available as needed” or something equally vague and they comply with the policy.In practice I would expect most employers to write a lot of vague wording about how employees aren’t required to be active online in their off hours, but they’ll leave the door open for emergency communications as needed. No sane company is going to write down a legally binding policy that nobody is going to contact anybody else at certain times. Imagine how easy it would be for a manager to break such a restriction by accidentally tagging an employee name in Slack at the wrong time of day, for example.The “right to disconnect” seems largely symbolic.On the other hand, banning non-competes is a big deal. They are effectively banned in my location (and several other states in the United States) and it’s great to not worry about it at all."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I feel a bit disappointed by the number of people suggesting that an NFT would somehow help here.An NFT is just a fancy signed receipt. I can mint an NFT saying the OP owns a bunch of Ubisoft games and give it to him, but his account will still be closed. Ubisoft could mint an NFT saying he owns a bunch of games and give it to him, but his account will still be closed. (He probably still has the receipts from when he bought the games in his inbox somewhere, but of course, his account is still closed.)We can store whatever records we like in a fancy distributed database, but his account will still be closed. The only fix here is Ubisoft needs to not close peoples accounts.Somewhat amusingly Ubisoft is in the process of launching an NFT system (https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/12/ubisofts-first-nft-pl...) and as anyone paying attention would no doubt expect, it doesn&#39;t solve anything related to this; up to an including the fact that if you get banned you...lose your NFTs.There is no technological problem to solve here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article is a great example of why we need legislation around ownership of digital items. I generally hate getting the government involved in things, but if you&#39;re paying money for goods, there needs to be a way to be credited or receive your digital goods in a way that still works without your &#34;account&#34;.Personally I always get kind of nervous around buying things on PSN, Xbox, Stadia, Steam, Oculus, etc. If they ban me, do I lose my thousands of dollars of games? That doesn&#39;t seem right (and no, I don&#39;t really care too much about what the Terms and Services say)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; We may also close long-term inactive accounts to maintain our database.How many kilobytes takes too store ownership data? I can just imagine that tracking data is thousands of times bigger.&gt; The crazy thing about this is that it’s perfectly legal for video game companies to delete your account regardless of whether you’ve spend zero or a thousand dollars on their gamesIt&#39;s a shame that we are going to fight for our digital rights because currently we have almost none because  justice does not understand technology."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hey, great project - the more competition in this space the better. To be honest, at the moment the algorithm doesn&#39;t return any sensible results for anything (at least that I can find), but I hope that you can find a way past this as it&#39;s a great place to have a project.I&#39;ve included some search terms below that I&#39;ve tried - I&#39;ve not cherrypicked these and believe they are indicative of current performance. Some of these might be the size of the index - however I suspect it&#39;s actually how the search is being parsed/ranked (in particular I think the top two examples show that).&gt; Search &#34;best car brands&#34;Expected: Car ReviewsReturns a page showing the best mobile phone brands.then...&gt; Then searching &#34;Best Mobile Phone&#34;Expected: The article from the search above.Returns a gizmodo page showing the best apps to buy...  &#34;App Deals: Discounted iOS iPhone, iPad, Android, Windows Phone Apps&#34;&gt; Searching &#34;What is a test?&#34;Expected result: Some page describing what a test is, maybe wikipedia?Returns &#34;Test could confirm if Brad Pitt does suffer from face blindness&#34;&gt; Searching &#34;Duck Duck Go&#34;Expected result: DDG.comReturns &#34;There be dragons? Why net neutrality groups won&#39;t go to Congress&#34;&gt; Searching &#34;Google&#34;Expected result: Google.comReturns: An article from the independent, &#34;Google has just created the world’s bluest jeans&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; We plan to start work on a distributed crawler, probably implemented as a browser extension that can be installed by volunteers.Is there a concern that volunteers could manipulate results through their crawler?You already mentioned distributed search engines have their own set of issues. I&#39;m wondering if a simple centralised non-profit fund a la wikipedia could work better to fund crawling without these concerns. One anecdote: Personally I would not install a crawler extensions, not because I don&#39;t want to help, but because my internet connection is pitifully slow. I&#39;d rather donate a small sum that would go way further in a datacenter... although I realise the broader community might be the other way around.[edit]Unless, the crawler was clever enough to merely feed off the sites i&#39;m already visiting and use minimal upload bandwidth. The only concern then would be privacy. oh the irony, but trust goes a long way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A laudable effort. Two questions:1. What is the rationale behind choosing Python as a implementation language? Performance and efficiency are paramount in keeping operational costs low and ensuring a good user experience even if the search engine will be used by many users. I guess Python is not the best choice for this, compared to C, Rust or Java.2. What is the rationale behind implementing a search engine from scratch versus using existing Open Source search engine libraries like Apache Lucene, Apache Solr and Apache Nutch (crawler)?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A few days ago I finally stopped doing something very similar.As fascinating as the data could be (I never managed to transform it like this), the constant recording of every single thing made me stop enjoying things. It made me hyper-conscious of everything going on in my body as the primary goal was to figure out some health issues. Everything I felt or did seemed to have an &#34;event handler&#34; attached to it.I now just stick to one line a day in a spreadsheet as a sort of diary.To anyone attempting it:1. Figure out what you want to do with the data first. Even if you just want some pretty graphs, create some random test data and set everything up so you can see these graphs. Don&#39;t just throw data into a black hole for years.2. Make sure recording the data is as easy and comfortable as possible. That android app from the article looks good, but you have to be absolutely sure it&#39;s okay to use many times a day. Be aware that there&#39;s no good answer to &#34;why do you keep reaching for your phone all the time?&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been using Daylio [0] for the last 2 years to track my mood and activities. It&#39;s less comprehensive than the system described here but much simpler to implement. It lets you set up a reminder with a mood selector, and you then select the activities you have accomplished. The activities are completely configurable. I&#39;ve started by tracking just a few habits and I&#39;ve added more along the way.I can&#39;t praise this app enough. Main pros:- all your data is stored locally not in the cloud, but you can easily back it up on Google Drive- it lets you export your data anytime- It comes with nice dashboards, weekly, monthly and yearly reviews. It let&#39;s you see the impact of each activity on your mood. It really gave me some interesting insights on my mood patterns.My only complaint really is that the only numeric value you can track is your mood, everything else is yes or no.A year or so ago, I&#39;ve also started using Clockify [1] to track the time I spent on each activity. Again, I don&#39;t track everything, only a few habits I want to improve on. It has a mobile and desktop app. The UI could be improved but all the features I need are free, and most importantly data export.It&#39;s the perfect time of year to set up a tracking system. My recommendation is start small. Track only a couple of activities first and add more as you build the habit.[0]: https://daylio.net/[1]: https://clockify.me/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had a list from every year from 1952, which I seem to have lost.Anyways: First experienced memory on that list was when I realized winter was reoccurring thing in spring of 1955.

I then suddenly remembered that this has happened before, but very long time go, maybe half a life-time ago."</p>
