								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I work at Gumroad, mentioned in this article.Sometimes, I read things by CEOs about how a company works on the inside and I wonder if it really looks like that, or if it is a view from the top that doesn&#39;t reflect what it&#39;s really like.This article, with its discussions of the upsides and downsides, is accurate to my experience and my understanding of other people&#39;s experiences. For many people, Gumroad wouldn&#39;t be a great place to work, but for those of us who want to work like this, it is exactly what we need. Very glad to be working at Gumroad and working in the ways the article describes.Edit: Following up with a few FAQs from posts in the thread:* Health Insurance: I&#39;m personally lucky enough to still be covered on my dad&#39;s health insurance until I turn 26, thanks to the ACA, though for supplementary (vision, dental) I make more than enough to afford proper health insurance on the open market. Everyone at Gumroad is paid very well and should be able to afford the same.* Regarding overtime, benefits, etc: we make very competitive rates as contractors. I sincerely appreciate your concern, though.* On the shift from full-time employees to contractors, the company declined and was rebuilt over a period of five years. I&#39;m a relatively recent addition, so I only know Gumroad as it is now, I cannot comment on how it was. All I can say is that it&#39;s not like Sahil went out and fired everyone and then the next day it was a bunch of contractors."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I work for a large SaaS company with hundreds of engineers and a very healthy revenue. It&#39;s widely acknowledged that the company would continue to function exactly as it is now for a very long time if they fired 95% of the staff. Heck stability and uptime would probably improve due to fewer deployments/no new feature adds. So the graph with declining expenses and increasing revenue isn&#39;t at all surprising.The problem with this model is that you are coasting on the work done by your full time staff in the initial few years, whom you fired and replaced with part time contractors who get no benefits. Even putting the ethical issues with this aside, if a competitor takes interest in your space and has a large war chest, you&#39;d be powerless to compete with them. And when your tech is dated and current/new customers want innovation, your low-price contracting firms working a few hours per week certainly aren&#39;t going to be able to offer that.So while I&#39;m happy things are working in this case, no new company that starts with the environment you are describing is going to be successful."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In years to come we will look down on the 5 day working week in the same way we currently do with 15hr factory shifts during the industrial revolution.It absolutely blows my mind that 99% of office roles are still 5 days / week, Monday to Friday - why is there basically no variation on this model? I&#39;d be more than happy to work a job for 80% salary for 4 days per week...So much so, I&#39;m about to launch a website listing remote software jobs with a 4 day work week:https://www.28hrworkweek.com/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Where is the &#34;Don&#39;t switch&#34; option? Because as much as I hate that Facebook bought them, they&#39;re part of what I would call &#34;critical social infrastructure.&#34;Asking to leave WhatsApp is like cancelling your contract with your ISP and going offline just because you don&#39;t like the company."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Telegram is a great IM experience. The client is good, feature set is good, the stickers are amusing (if you&#39;re into that kind of thing), the feature set is complete and everything is polished. Telegram is, I think, going to be one of the easier sells if you&#39;re trying to convince non-technical users to switch from WhatsApp or FB Messenger.The privacy, security, and governance story is not great though. If you care about such things, I think Signal wins hands down. And the UX is fine, just not quite as good as Telegram in my view.(A third option not in your poll that might be worth evaluating is Wickr. I haven&#39;t used it personally, but I&#39;ve seen it come up in these sorts of discussions.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the listed alternatives, only Matrix is the one that actually solves the issue of not having to trust our communications to any single monopolistic entity.You could add XMPP there as well, but it really doesn&#39;t matter. What does matter is for us to start pushing for openness and start evangelizing/helping others to adopt anything that puts us back in control of our communication.This is the one thing to fix, and the one opportunity that we are getting now to do this right.- Element&#39;s client is not &#34;nice&#34;: we can fix it. We can not fix closedness.- Not everyone is using it: we can fix it. We can not fix privacy abuse from Facebook.- It&#39;s work to run/manage a server: find a hosting provider (cough https://communick.com cough)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I know Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Reddit and all the rest don&#39;t count as broadcast media but I feel like we got here in part because the 1987 elimination of FCC&#39;s fairness doctrine slowly allowed a shift in how we communicate with each other.We went from specious claims and conspiracy theories being the subject matter of newsletters to their public broadcast to millions via talk radio ~and Fox News~, thus allowing people to descend into their own bubbles without ever having their views challenged.  Now people seem to rely on social media to give them the same experience.  When challenged too much people just pull up stakes to insulate themselves: voat, parler, and private facebook groups are only three recent examples.It&#39;ll be interesting to see if whoever replaces Ajit Pai holds a different view on public intercourse over the airwaves.Edit: Well as some people have pointed out, Fox News would have been exempt from the Fairness Doctrine as a cable network, i.e. it doesn&#39;t use the public spectrum.As Wikipedia says &#34;The channel was created by Australian-American media mogul Rupert Murdoch to appeal to a conservative audience, hiring former Republican media consultant and CNBC executive Roger Ailes as its founding CEO.&#34;  So my personal view that Fox (among others) is responsible for a) exposing millions to fact-free content without opposing views and b) people got used to that and don&#39;t like it when it&#39;s challenged created the bubble we have today. I&#39;m wrong that the Fairness Doctrine would have prevented Fox, although it might have prevented talk radio."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is so Facebook.* Enables and encourages (and makes money off of) spreading hate messages on their platform for years* Hamhandedly does a full reverse and bans of one of the leading spreaders only after it&#39;s too late to make a difference.* But just in time to curry favor with the groups newly in power.A twist to the old cliche: too much, too late.How cowardly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Regardless of being the right thing to do or not, it is very interesting to see a software platform banning a president of a country.Interesting times."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Instead of debating whether social media platforms should or shouldn&#39;t have silenced the president, and what their role was in inciting the crowds to &#34;insurrection&#34;, shouldn&#39;t we be discussing instead how to completely remove them from the political sphere? Never before in human history have we had privately operated for-profit organisations with so much power and influence over the running of countries. Social media platforms should never have been allowed to become the arbiters of democracy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The violating content they removed was trump repeating the same stolen election crud he&#39;s been saying for a month and then __urging the protesters to go home peacefully, preserve law and order, etc__.Here is a copy: https://files.catbox.moe/71gfr1.mp4For those that don&#39;t want to play a video this is an unabridged transcript:&#34;I know your pain. I know your hurt. We had an election that was stolen from us, it was a landslide election and everyone knows it especially the other side. But you have to go home now. We have to have peace. We have to have law and order we have to respect our great people in law and order. We don&#39;t want anybody hurt. It&#39;s a very tough period of time, there has never been a time like this where such a thing happened, where they could take it away from all of us, from me, from you, from our country. This was a fraudulent election but we can&#39;t play into the hands of these people. We have to have peace. So go home, we love you, you&#39;re very special, you&#39;ve seen what happens you&#39;ve seen the way others are treated that are so bad and so evil. I know how you feel. But go home and go home in peace.&#34;I was watching a live stream from the mob and the protesters (the buffalo costume guy, in fact) were trying to get other protesters to leave on the basis of trumps message and people were believing the claim was fake because twitter restricted sharing so the only way to see it was to directly go to the page.Seems like an odd choice."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s amazing that the reactions to this are both &#34;should have banned him years ago for violating their rules&#34; and &#34;this is blatant dangerous censorship.&#34; Whichever side you&#39;re on, this is a lose-lose situation for twitter."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Cities Skylines is very nice for such traffic simulations.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yITr127KZtQ (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17182008) (https://www.reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylines/comments/7h6zr0/traf...)https://www.youtube.com/c/BiffaPlaysIndie/search?query=lane+...This is frequently posted here on HN.
E.g. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25632642."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Things like this are cool. What I would be curious to see though, rather than setting global parameters (i.e., politeness), would be to have each agent have its own politeness score (as well as other attributes). Models like the one linked to here work as if each agent is a particle, rather than autonomous decision-maker adapting to their circumstances locked in long-term, iterated games with other anonymous drivers.This way, agents would adapt their attributes to maximize their own local advantage, and therefore could see how large scale trends develop. I&#39;ve driven in many countries and regions within countries, and it&#39;s just wild how &#34;driving cultures&#34; vary so much. Some places the drivers are so polite to the point it really makes things dangerous, other places the drivers are vindictive (distinct from being aggressive driver). It would be interesting to model how driving cultures emerge.Edit: I guess the short story is I&#39;m really curious why some places, like Bangkok driving is chaotic, dangerous, gridlocked, and no one adheres to traffic laws much or yields to pedestrians, but relatively devoid of road rage (and people will let you merge over if you need to). In DC, people carefully adhere to red lights, stop signs, pedestrians, etc but will go far, far out of their way to block you from changing lanes once they see your turn signal go on.Also, exploring the game theoretic (probably prisoner&#39;s dilemma?) aspects of tailgating and how that seriously depends on the driving culture. When someone tailgates, the tailgatee can slow down (everyone loses), speed up or move out of the way (tailgater wins/tailgatee loses), etc. If everyone slowed down when tailgated, there would be no benefit of tailgating; if enough people give in when tailgated, that keeps rewarding the behavior. Anyway, that would be something fun to explore in one of these traffic simulations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love these little simulators because while they purport to show that slower more polite driving is more efficient, more often than not they show the exact opposite.  Want to shove the most cars through per hour?  Remove the speed limit.  Accelerate and brake like every intersection is a drag race.  Leave absolutely no distance between cars.  And dump any notion of polite lane changes.  NASCAR was right:  Minimize unused pavement.  The most efficient way to move large numbers of cars down a road is at 200mph with only inches between each car."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;Some speculate it might descend from PowerVR GPUs, as used in older iPhones, while others believe the GPU to be completely custom. But rumours and speculations are no fun when we can peek under the hood ourselves!As per IMG CEO, Apple has never not been an IMG customer. ( Referring to period between 2015 and 2019.) Unfortunately that quote, along with that article has simply vanished. It was said during an Interview on a British newspaper / web site if I remember correctly.&#34;On 2 January 2020, Imagination Technologies announced a new multi-year license agreement with Apple including access to a wider range of Imagination&#39;s IP in exchange for license fees. This deal replaced the prior deal signed on 6 February 2014.&#34; [1]The Apple official Metal Feature set document [2], All Apple A Series SoC including the latest A14 supports PVRTC, which stands for PowerVR Texture Compression[3].It could be a Custom GPU, but it still has plenty of PowerVR tech in it. Just like Apple Custom CPU, it is still an ARM.Note: I am still bitter at what Apple has done to IMG / PowerVR.[1] https://www.imaginationtech.com/news/press-release/imaginati...[2] https://developer.apple.com/metal/Metal-Feature-Set-Tables.p...[3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PVRTC"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; This suggests the hardware is superscalar, with more 16-bit ALUs than 32-bit ALUsTo me, it sounds like it might mean 32-bit ALUs can be used as two 16-bit ones; that&#39;s how I would approach it, unless I&#39;m missing something? The vectorization can also happen at the superscalar level, if borrowing the instruction queue concept from out-of-order designs: buffer operations for a while until you&#39;ve filled a vector unit&#39;s worth, align input data in the pipeline, execute. A smart compiler could rearrange opcodes to avoid dependency issues, and insert &#34;flushes&#34; or filling operations at the right time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Yet Metal optimization resources imply 16-bit arithmetic should be significantly faster, in addition to a reduction of register usage leading to higher thread count (occupancy).I believe this is a difference between the A14 GPU and the M1 GPU; the former&#39;s 32 bit throughput is half its 16 bit throughput, whereas on the latter they are equal."</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25658098">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There are two interesting things in this post.The first is that a senior developer at Facebook believes every single senior developer looking for a role at Facebook can revise the same things. Clearly the author believes that Facebook are looking for programmers who fit a very specific mould, to the point that they&#39;re willing to go out in public and state exactly that. I&#39;d argue that points to a massive monoculture problem at Facebook, but I&#39;m massively anti-Facebook so I&#39;m biased.Secondly, the author believes that senior developers, who likely have 10+ years under their belt if they&#39;re senior, need to spend a solid month revising in order to be successful landing a role there. Maybe that&#39;s worthwhile as FB pay well, but that&#39;s a hell of a time investment if you&#39;re not planning to stay at FB for a long time. That would certainly make me think twice if I was going to apply."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Every time I read these posts I find them very depressing. Crunch through an enormous  bunch of algorithm problems in order to perform well on some unrealistic whiteboard programming (I think the system engineering problems are actually more useful though) - as usual we&#39;ve focused on the easy to measure metric rather than anything actually useful. Maybe these things are meant to be a proxy for how good you are at other development tasks, but it has never seemed to work out that way to me. Some of the very successful people I know at FAANG companies have told me that they would not pass the algorithm interviews without months of preparation and that they don&#39;t really use those skills."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Besides the usual advice, this observation is very interesting:&gt; Applying for senior engineering positions (&gt;E4) in FANG companies is one of the best ways to get into them.This comment by a veteran senior engineer confirms to me that Facebook, just like most other FANGs, does a poor job of promoting from within.There are multiple comments to the same effect from many other FANG employees: It&#39;s much easier to get recruited for senior roles from the outside, then get promoted from the inside.The result of this failure is that job-hopping is the most valid career strategy for aspiring seniors."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been a Simple customer for awhile and it&#39;s kind of a bummer and kind of a hassle that this is happening.I became a customer many years ago while I was homeless and due to a string of incredibly bad luck and wildly poor decision making, I had been unable to open a checking account at any major bank. For whatever reason they gave me one.Not having to walk 3+ miles to pick up cash from a Wells Fargo spot and having a debit card were literally lifechanging differences.Nearly a decade later I&#39;m in a much better place. Thanks, Simple."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a Simple customer and incredibly upset by this decision.  For those not familiar with their value add, Simple is essentially &#34;envelope budgeting&#34; built into a banking application.  Sure, it&#39;s a bank and does bank things.  What sets Simple apart is that I can allocate $n/month for an expense and it takes it out of my paycheck and puts it into that expense &#34;envelope&#34;.  When a charge comes in for that expense, it pulls from the envelope.  Other budgeting tools like mvelopes.com and YNAB are great for visibility/tracking, but they don&#39;t move your money around.  The alternative I used prior to finding Simple was having about 10 different checking accounts and manually transferring money every few weeks.  I really don&#39;t want to go back to that setup after tasting the good life.My pitch to the Simple team, or anyone interested in taking this on, is to take the app and build it on top of Stripe Treasury (https://stripe.com/treasury)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t know how many Simple employees are in this thread. I&#39;m very sad to hear this news, and I&#39;m sure you were too. Just want you to know that you all made a really meaningful difference in the lives of at least my wife and I. Before I switched to Simple, I had a really hard time budgeting for things/planning for expenses, and was frequently toeing the line of overdrawing my account. I was essentially financially illiterate.Simple made it incredibly easy for me to get my shit together and start being proactive with my money, so there was really no excuse to not do so. Now, my wife and I are well on our way to an early payoff on our mortgage (~18 years early), paying off our vehicle loans early (~2 years early), having a pretty good safety net in the bank, and being otherwise debt free.So if you haven&#39;t heard it above the sadness of losing Simple: thank you. Seriously, thank you. You really did something great and you should all be proud of what you&#39;ve accomplished."</p>
