								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting how the three separate R/G/B images are taken independently a few ~seconds~ milliseconds apart, with a different color filter placed over the image sensor.I assume this is to maximize resolution, since no Bayer interpolation [0] is needed to  demosaic the output of a traditional image sensor that integrates the color filters onto the sensor pixels themselves. As these satellites are not intended to photograph things in motion, the color channel alignment artifacts seen here are a rare, small price to pay for vastly improved resolution and absence of demosaicing artifacts.[0] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_filter"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m impressed more by the comments than the article itself. Some people insist they make progress and listen 3x, but nobody showed any practical measurements of own skills.A personal example: I used to listen to a famous linguist, and everything seemed nice and clear, but then I decided to go in details on one particular question (I think accentuantion), and opened his book. It was like if you showed your programming code to a farmer: incomprehensible stream of linguistic terms. My complacency was shattered in 1 minute.There&#39;s some scientific evidence as well:1. Lectures are proved to be a bad way to learn things. https://www.science.org/content/article/lectures-arent-just-...2. A nice experiment showing that if you enjoy a lesson, it usually means you make no progress, meanwhile hard practice actually does make you progress: https://www.pnas.org/content/116/39/19251I suppose, those who insist they learn something, do make progress at memorizing trivia, but not at practical skills or any systematic understanding.This kind of knowledge feels firm only until it&#39;s tested by practical task or by serious questioning."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I get the point you&#39;re making - but honestly I have to raise the counter argument, which I think is equally valid. Take for example, the average lecture video. The information density is so low, that I&#39;d imagine that a 60 minute video could be compressed into 10-12 minutes without any loss of information. It really depends on what you&#39;re listening to/watching."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article isn’t just about playback speed. It’s a well-written piece about the importance of direct experience and not rushing through spoken lectures alone.It’s extra ironic, then, that much of the comment section here only seems to have absorbed the headline but not the content of the article.I have noticed that my most voracious podcast and book consuming friends seem to have developed a lot of surface-level knowledge about a lot of subjects, but it’s difficult to discuss even the content of the books they’ve read. Listening on 1.5X or 2X speed is a common boast for them, as is the number of books or podcasts they’ve consume in a year (which is tracked for some reason). It seems the goal has become quantity, or simply filling time and providing background noise instead of studying a subject."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am glad to see HTTP Toolkit back on HN: The author is an old friend who dedicated a lot of time and resources to make this tool and as someone who fiddled with it, it&#39;s a great alternative to Postman - which I used to love but now it&#39;s a little bit too heavy on pushing their marketing agenda.
Also how on earth is Postman a $5.6 billion dollar company - I am super curious to see how much money Postman actually makes from enterprise sales - it must be a lot from the looks of that valuation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve been looking for an alternative to postman that isn’t so insanely geared to monetization. I feel postman compromises it’s entire UX to force a simple offline tool to be cloud based."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know it&#39;s probably a losing battle at this point, but —Would you consider using the more correct terminology &#34;Fake&#34; instead of &#34;Mock&#34;?In software testing, the two terms mean different things.  A &#34;fake&#34; is a thing that takes the place of a service; you call it and it returns a fake result.  A &#34;mock&#34; is a thing that enforces expectations of its caller; you specify a sequence of calls that you expect, then you run the caller and it verifies that the calls occurred in the manner and order expected.  They are used for different purposes, and it&#39;s useful to have the clarity of two different terms for two different things.In particular, it is usually a better testing practice to use fakes instead of mocks.  But now there are some testing libraries that create mocks (and call them mocks) and other testing libraries that create fakes (and also call them mocks), which has confused the issue and made it harder to speak clearly about a fairly important testing strategy decision.What HTTP Toolkit does is produce fake replies to HTTP requests.  So &#34;fake&#34; is the best term for what it does, and thus I make this earnest plea to use that term to distinguish it from mocking, which it doesn&#39;t do."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My family used to do this all the time when we were kids. We&#39;d go along the ditches on the side of the road and make a family outing of it on weekends. At the beach my brother and I would drag big plastic garbage bags around and collect as much as we could from people who were happy to help some kids out and also happy to be rid of the bottles and cans. You could make some decent coin at it, but that was also in the 80s when 5c a can and 10-20c a bottle was worth something.It gets into your bones. Even today with 25 years software dev experience under my belt, I still feel the twitch whenever I see a discarded bottle or can."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here is a story of a man who collected cans and bottles for cash and invested the money he got in the stock market, he died a millionaire.&#34;Curt Degerman, known to many as &#34;Tin Can Curt,&#34; Degerman spent nearly 30 years roaming the streets of Skelleftea in northern Sweden collecting tin cans and bottles for cash. Those who passed him by simply assumed he was another ordinary street bum.But to the surpise of many, when Degerman died in 2008, he left more than $1.4 million to his cousin. In between collecting cans, Degerman spent a lot of time in his local library reading business papers and studying the stock market. &#34;He knew stocks inside and out,&#34; said his cousin.By immersing himself in an education of thrift and smart investing, Degerman used his tin-can earnings to purchase mutual funds. He bought 124 gold bars and also expanded his cash with a savings account. By riding a bicycle and not having a mortgage on his house, his savings were made even easier.But in 2008, Degerman died of a heart attack, leaving his entire estate to a cousin who had visited him regularly during his last days. He died a millionaire.&#34;Sources:https://www.nydailynews.com/news/money/tin-collector-dies-mi...https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-WHB-2895https://archive.md/kB5F4"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have not thought about collecting cans in a very long time. Decades ago you could make a decent bit of cash collecting aluminum cans. It was a common past time for poor people and undoubtedly contributed to the very high recycle rate for aluminum since it was a source of income for many people. This was widely known, so people would often go out of their way to make their aluminum trash easily available to be collected. It was kind of low-key charity of sorts.At some point this just kind of dried up. I suspect it coincided with municipalities selling the rights to collect recyclables to waste management companies."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am not sure how relevant this is, but I recently published a proof a concept library  that converts SVG documents into simulated machines. See the link below.https://www.getlazarus.org/videos/physics/blueprint/The rendering in my library relies upon OpenGL and the NanoVG library. My library is called Tiny Sim. All of these nano tiny and vg names seem to be colliding adding a bit of confusion in my opinion."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This looks nice, i was thinking of adding some vector support in my Little Forms[0] GUI toolkit at some point but everything feels overcomplicated and bloated - however this looks quite nice at a first glance. As i don&#39;t have any advanced vector drawing code at all (aside from the basic &#34;draw line, draw circle&#34; etc needed to draw the GUI itself) it can work as a template for what to put in there.[0] http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lforms/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are many other popular vector graphics formats beyond those mentioned here. Lottie has already displaced SVG for animation/motion graphics, and for static content IconVG exists and is backed by Google. There&#39;s also PDF, PostScript, Flash, the glyf format in OpenType, etc."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I used to think exa was a good ls replacement, but I found out that it&#39;s significantly slower than ls[0]. Heck, it&#39;s even slower than lf[1]. Quite frankly I didn&#39;t know what to think, but I removed the alias ls=exa.0: https://asciinema.org/a/454216 vs https://asciinema.org/a/4542171: https://asciinema.org/a/454213"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Non-positive opinion ahead.Personally I can’t find a use for it. Colors are so vast that I can’t figure out which means what (and they rarely play nice with a custom bg color). And then, all I have to know is whether a file is “-&gt;”, “*”, “/“ or “”. Tree+git view could be useful, if not node_modules, .git and other tree spammers. Of course there is an option to ignore, but then my .bashrc grows again while all I need in a project dir is covered by git status -s (yes I can read these capital letters since svn).It is modern in a sense of presentation, and I see how it may appeal to someone, but not in a sense of ls being old or something. It feels to me like a strange tool that does everything but nothing specifically, as if someone always wanted a nice gui file explorer, but had no courage to admit this “lameness”.Why spend your time squinting at black and white text?*I usually spend time on colored output trying to read blue/lightgreen/etc on #444, and because my b/w tools are separated by colored PS1, which emphasizes important* things like hostname, user, cwd, exitcode and puts a newline so that each command is lined up and ends with an additional \n. File being a green file or a blue dir is not as important as me patching a wrong instance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I always find pitches like this a little obnoxious:&gt; You list files hundreds of times a day. Why spend your time squinting at black and white text?Uh, `ls` has colors, if you know how or some benevolent distro-maintainer did.Now there&#39;s a ton of value in sane defaults and cutting out cruft and targeting specific use-cases, so not here to criticize the tool, at all. Just the marketing. Why not talk about what&#39;s actually special and different about it?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is news just because it&#39;s an Apple device being used for something that was already trivially possible.GPS trackers designed to be magnet-attached to a car which report their location via cell signal cost ~$20 on Amazon. You then tend to need to pay for either a SIM card or a subscription to the device maker&#39;s service 
-- bringing you up to about the cost of an AirTag. These are much harder to detect, as you might imagine.The Apple device does try to make itself less useful for abusive purposes. Nearby iPhones will notify you if there&#39;s an AirTag following you. Apple released an Android app to scan for them (manually -- it&#39;d probably be nice if they released something that did the same passive scanning as iPhones get, but there&#39;s battery trade-offs there, and obviously most people won&#39;t have that app). AirTags will also beep if they&#39;re separated from their owner.In fact, this is news we&#39;re hearing about because of the steps Apple took to make it harder to use these devices for bad purposes. The tweet author got a warning about the device following them.It&#39;s tricky to make something that lets you find where you dropped your keys while walking the dog that can&#39;t also be used for nefarious purposes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While it’s theoretically possible that this happened, I think this particular story was made up. For a number of reasons: 1) How did the stalker know that that’s her car? She said she was on a night out. Unless she went back to her car all the time, he must have seen her arrive in it. 2) Sticking an AirTag to the inside of the front wheel well isn’t easy. There is dirt and grime there and the surfaces aren’t flat. The stalker would have had to use a very strong adhesive to make the AirTag stick while the car was moving. 3) While it’d be a smart idea to not drive home while a foreign AirTag tracks you, who is alert enough after a night out AND happens to have friends in the vicinity that you can wake up at what must have been a very late hour? 4) Her friend who found and removed the AirTag took no photo. Really?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The interesting thing is that I have seen multiple reports of this ( think this is is the third), but in every case, they have destroyed it, lost it, or thrown it away before hand - not given it to the police.Apple can&#39;t tell who the devices is from signals in the wild, but they can figure out who it is if someone gives them the physical device. (Apple tracks the serial number of the device, and from what I understand, can provide purchaser/activator information based on the serial number)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Background: I&#39;m a qualified accountant, and have taught courses on accounting and finance.My thoughts on OP:I read through the first two parts of the first course on this site:- Part 1 Introduction to Accounting Basics, A Story for Relating to Accounting Basics- Part 2 Income StatementBased on what I read, I could not recommend this. You could get to the end of the &#39;income statement&#39; part, without encountering any definition of &#39;profit&#39;, which is the very thing that the income statement is meant to show.If you want a solid introduction to accounting, I&#39;d recommend Frank Wood&#39;s book &#34;Business Accounting 1&#34;. You don&#39;t need the latest (15th edition). The principles haven&#39;t changed. I used the 10th edition: Business Accounting Volume 1 https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0273681494/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a software engineer who moved into freelance consulting a few years ago (I do back-ends and front-ends for mobile and web, nothing finance specific other than occasional credit card payment integrations). It&#39;s been a roller-coaster in many regards and one of the highlights is having learned a lot about bookkeeping, taxes, financial planning and everything that comes with running a small business in general. (Aspects which I initially despised but now I&#39;ve accepted as necessary and doing them as routine.)During these years I started playing with the idea of training myself in basic/intermediate accounting and/or finance. The motivation is twofold: run my own business better (and maybe stop paying an accountant to do my taxes) and maybe work on software projects in finance (where I suspect there is good money to be made).I&#39;d be interested hearing stories from fellow software engineers who did similar training!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are other online resources to learn accounting. A lot of them are listed on https://hledger.org/accounting.html#accounting-links .https://www.dwmbeancounter.com/ is often mentioned on similar threads. People also like to link to beancount&#39;s manual http://furius.ca/beancount/doc/double-entry .But I agree with mindslight&#39;s comment. They all kinda suck. Reading an actual textbook like the top comment suggested is probably better."</p>
