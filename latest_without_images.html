Here&#39;s a  brief refresher: Curious conversation is good. Substantive comments are good. Thoughtfully sharing personal experience is good. Flamebait is bad. Personal swipes are bad. Ideological boilerplate is bad.I don&#39;t mean &#39;good&#39; and &#39;bad&#39; absolutely—that&#39;s above my pay grade. I just mean good or bad for HN, relative to what we&#39;re trying to optimize for: https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;sor... If you want to smite enemies or fulminate snarkily, that&#39;s your business—just please don&#39;t do it on HN. It&#39;s not hard to find platforms that welcome that sort of engagement; we&#39;re trying for something different on this one.Edit: this thread has over 1000 comments now; if you want to read more of them, you need to click More at the bottom of the page, or like this:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26612918&amp;p=2https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26612918&amp;p=3"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A quick reminder to read the article before commenting. HN usually has a better track record of this, but this is a particular issue people are sensitive about so don&#39;t draw your conclusions from the title alone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Female founder friend (non tech space) was in a female focused incubator / competition. She got only one set of somewhat critical feedback - ie, lacks experience in X and Y which are key in product space Z.She posted a comment on her social media focusing on this feedback as &#34;criticism&#34; that came from a sexist guy &#34;of course&#34;. It was pretty easy to draw the line to the three panelists, one of whom was a guy. Ouch.In a previous life, I&#39;d worked in a awesome (female led!) product company. While I had no experience prior to this, I quickly realized that the product itself and its quality etc was almost irrelevant to success, the X and Y mentioned by the male panelist was unfortunately everything, which you&#39;d only know if you were in the space itself. The female led company I worked for was bought out by a (male led) competitor, who then using much strong x and y skills - cleaned up. Company I worked for got basically nothing.Fast forward - my friends business not doing so great, she asks me for feedback. I said nothing other than enthusiasm. Partly because I was really enthusiastic - she&#39;d put her heart into this project. But her comment on social was in my mind - I had no desire to be next sexist guy &#34;shooting down&#34; an ideaShe&#39;s out of the business I think mostly. Anyways, this parallels the take of the article."</p>

If you don&#39;t want to find yourself a victim of these kinds of people, then you better keep these two links as a reference, and always take them to heart:Narcissists Online: http://www.issendai.com/psychology/narcissism/narcissists-on...What to Remember When Dealing with a Narcissist: http://www.issendai.com/psychology/narcissism/narcissists-wh...People who do this sort of stuff have narcissistic traits at minimum, which of course is an armchair diagnosis. But, these people really do not need to meet the criteria for narcissistic personality disorder. All you need to know is that they are people who will harm you in some incredibly hurtful way, because they have contempt for you being yourself.Some of these people have antisocial traits, and are malignant narcissists. Some of them outright have both narcissistic personality disorder and antisocial personality disorder.Regardless, these people tend to masquerade as &#34;entrepreneurs&#34;, &#34;researchers&#34;, &#34;thinkers&#34;, &#34;doers&#34;, or as &#34;authors&#34;, when their entire works are just plagiarized material from others. People make entire livings off of such grifts and it becomes a central identity, if not their only identity. Of course, it is always about getting the next award or accolade, even though it is &#34;empty&#34; to them because they have intrinsically low self-esteem and an unbelievably fragile ego. But, of course they would never want you to know that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For the curious: this emerged as a twitter thread back in Jan https://twitter.com/mattlodder/status/1350192856154198016 .

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reminds me of something I experienced on HN and Reddit, though my case was a far less significant level.I posted a comment on HN in response to some article about Emacs.  Later that day I saw someone had copied my comment word for word in reply to the same article on Reddit.I still have no idea why someone would do that.  I thought at first it was some kind of karma farming operation but the post history of the Reddit user didn&#39;t really fit that profile.  Plus,it seems like r/emacs would be a really poor choice for that.I&#39;ve always been curious to know why someone would do something like this.  It&#39;s interesting to read about it happening on a way larger scale."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Doomscrolling caused by &#34;engagement&#34; metrics.When engagement is all that matters, the most engagement comes when people are divisive, mad/angry or even pushed to extremes.When you feel yourself getting bothered, angry and you have to prove someone wrong on the internet, step away. You are taking valuable time from your own projects and quality of life.People can have different opinions and that is ok, your ideas and opinions are what make you, see that as your unique tool to success. On top of that many &#34;organic opinions&#34; are actually astroturfing and PR designed to promote or get you to &#34;engage&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"100% agree with the premise. Outrage culture is ruining all reasonable discourse in this country (and world), and is now massively fueled by politicians, corporations, media for their own gains.I do not, however, agree with their solution. Turning off the news/Facebook/Twitter and ignoring everything happening around you is not going to make things better.The world has made a lot of progress over the last few centuries (as the article calls out), but all of it has been driven by common people like you and me getting outraged over things that might not directly concern us. Anger is sometimes justified.Instead, when you read something that angers you, take a few minutes and do that extra step of research. Could it be completely fake? Does the headline reflect the contents of the article correctly (it is normally not written by the author)? Is the data researched and sourced? Is what you are reading heavily opinionated? Are you subscribed to a healthy mix of sources?If enough people actually did this (instead of reading the title and going straight to Twitter/Reddit/HN), meaningless outrage will disappear without the trade-off of not being informed about the world. You will organically discover that everything is a lot more reasonable and moderate than people want you to believe. And if something actually isn&#39;t, you will be able to see it."</p>

Too cooperative. Talks too much.  Talks too little. Gets his story perfectly straight. Fucks his story up. Blinks too much, avoids eye contact. Doesn’t blink.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Because in 2021 developer tools are fundamentally not profitable. Jetbrains is the exception, not the norm. Developer tools are loss leaders for large corporation to acquire developer goodwill and mindshare. Previously we sold developer tools/PaaS. Programmers do not like to pay for their tooling. You have to sell to management, and when your target is management, then the metrics are completely different from what developers want.This is why no-code and low code are so much more successful than developers tooling startups in terms of revenue and profitability. The people using are the same people who are running the business. The value proposition is clear. &#34;Better developer experience&#34; alone is not sufficient for selling to enterprise. And programmer productivity cannot be quantified in lines of code written. This is hard point to explain and get across on HN because this forum is inherently dismissive of the value of RPA and RAD software."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The kinds of tools like those in the article suffer from being outside of the &#34;main loop of coding&#34;.What is the main loop? Well, as it&#39;s defined since the rise of interactive computing, it&#39;s typing in the editor, compiling, then testing and debugging.Thus we optimize for:1. Typing code fast(or typing less code)2. Compiling code fast(by doing less compilation)3. Minimizing testing and debugging time(by narrowing our definitions of testing to that which is easy to automate).The main loop of coding is not software development. It does not study the domain problem, define new benchmarks for success, untangle communication issues, or refine principles of development. It is a path to coder flow state, feature factoryism and shipping the org chart. These things sort of resemble development - a happy coder delivering features within a definite architecture does serve someone at some point - but also manifest dysfunction. Development failing is just shrugged off as bad programming or bad management.Tools like a Whyline or Reflexion models are not in the main loop. They are an invitation to look carefully at whatever horror has been wrought and address it at a deep level. But that really needs a  researching mindset, not a shipping one.In practice, the available tools very slowly move in the direction of the suggestions of research. There are improvements, but they need projects that put together the pieces and make it a goal from the language design(the main interface) upwards."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As many on this discussion have noted, JetBrains tools not only don&#39;t collect dust, they are widely used, and the company is profitable. The company is privately held. I hear that they are constantly turning down investments. This proves 1) there is money in tools; 2) The VCs who routinely say &#34;there is no money in tools&#34; are insufficiently imaginitive, which is not surprising if you&#39;ve spent any time with VCs.Why is JetBrains so successful where others have failed? A few thoughts:- Intellij was released in 2001. Eclipse was a close competitor for a while, which made no sense to me. Intellij just worked, and it was intuitive. I found Eclipse to be uglier, slower, flakier, crashier, and far less intuitive. Haven&#39;t heard of it in years.- It was always the case that at least some version of Jetbrains tools are zero cost. I got hooked on it early on. I have been using emacs far longer, and yes, while a sufficiently dedicated developer can make emacs behave like an IDE, it really isn&#39;t one. Intellij just worked out of the box. In the preceding two decades, there were high-end development tools available (Lisp machines and their all-encompassing environments, Lucid for C++, Purify for C/C++ memory problems, Atria, Rational. Trivia: Did you know that Purify was founded by Reed Hastings, the guy who went on to found Netflix?)  The tools were expensive, and I don&#39;t think there were free versions. These companies all went out of business, or were acquired.- Jetbrains is incredibly focused. Having been through several VC-funded technology companies, I can easily see how VC brain farts can destroy a company&#39;s focus. (This dynamic isn&#39;t entirely the VCs fault. Founders stretch the truth to get funded, and then VCs insist on the fairy tales they&#39;ve been told.)- Jetbrains has expanded to other languages, and other kinds of tools (besides just refactoring Java code). The number of languages, technologies, and frameworks that they support is just mind-boggling.- Consistent focus on improving developer&#39;s lives, through steady improvements in functionality, performance, and quality, over 20 years at this point. They started far ahead and have widened the gap.OPs tools look useful. I suspect they would attract a much wider audience if made available through Jetbrains products."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is why I use Framer, they have a built-in export to React function that is really powerful for early startups (as the whole tool is built on React)My team has been using our Framer export (with a few tweaks) as the actual final UI for our early product. Designing is as easy as in Figma, with the advantage that you have actual React components out of the box (working chart libraries, video components... any package you want to use). Whatever you design is responsive, can be connected via API to any database, and all of this is done collaboratively in the same document.It has been a mind-blowing experience in terms of product shipping speed, and as a designer, it really makes you connect in a deeper way with the complexity of the final code."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can see a bright future for this approach. Figma is very &#34;constructional&#34; design tool, encouraging the use:- variablized colors and fonts, that can become CSS variables and classes- Components and component hierarchies, that can turn into React components- Auto-layout that is based on Flexbox- Component propertes (Variants in Figma, but with enough effort it can turn into attributes for React components).With a bit of annotation inside Figma, I can easily see pretty good results for this conversion."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If Figma has their eyes open, they&#39;ll run with this idea. Design once in Figma, generate UIs for React, Vue, Jetpack and SwiftUI. Designers become way more productive, doing part of the work of front end devs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a good read. For a long time I explained to people that the value of search advertising was that it matched a buyer who had just asked a buying question with advertisers who wanted to answer that question. This was HUGELY different than previous Internet &#34;banner&#34; advertising. Think of it this way; I put a poster up in the metro that says &#34;Best Deals on Rolex watches&#34; and a million people a day  &#34;see it&#34; but a vanishingly small number want to buy a Rolex. However, if Google gets a query &#34;Where to buy a Rolex&#34; or &#34;best deals on Rolex watches&#34;, well you know that person is perhaps already considering buying a watch, so you want first crack at the deal.The secret sauce was instantly pairing &#34;commercial intent&#34; (or the intention to do some commercial action, buy, sell, hire, Etc.) with vendors and firms who can satisfy that intent or &#34;aspects&#34; of that intent. (You might get an Uber ad on a query for &#34;restaurants near me&#34; for example)Amazon has that in spades. If you are on the Amazon site, that is a huge signal that you are intending to make a commercial transaction. Either with Amazon, or perhaps you are reading reviews of things you can get locally, but the probability that you are about to do something commercial is much much higher. (So does Facebook along a different vector but that is a different post for a different time.)I know from experience at Blekko that one way to piss off Amazon is to out advertise them :-). That just told me that they considered Ads strategic and selling stuff was secondary to that goal[1].[1] I reasoned it this way, if selling stuff was primary then any additional exposure is &#34;good&#34; even if you have to pay affiliate fees for it. If advertising was the money maker, then someone doing it better than you (converting your ad revenue into their affiliate revenue) then you respond harshly to that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked in the ads org at Amazon an year ago and yes I can tell you the revenue generated by ad products across their services is insane. It&#39;s a well executed operation and it is only growing rapidly year over year. From a customer perspective they are also very relevant most of the time.The remaining part is making sure they don&#39;t upset customers way too much since that would conflict with the idea of &#34;customer satisfaction&#34; the company has."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some articles&#39; job is to spark a great rebuttal. This is a great read, and great debating.  Nerd-bait-ey information density so high.The economic equilibrium of the Bitcoin economic model is as follows: the total cost of all electricity invested into the network over a 10-minute period strives to be equal to the present financial value of 6.25 Bitcoins. If electricity becomes cheaper, then more electricity gets poured into the system, producing the exact same output. That is why Bitcoin is not a battery — Bitcoin is a sink: its economic output is constant, regardless of the amount of resources poured into it.³ When miners pour more electricity into Bitcoin, they don’t get more Bitcoin; instead, the entirety of the Bitcoin network becomes more secure. Security is not a commodity,.... Bitcoin is indeed incentivizing the creation of cheap power sources, but those sources are not going to be used for anything...I learned more about bitcoin in a few minutes than so many hours of people talking while saying so little. Glass of ice water in hell. I can now deduce that the &#34;equilibrium energy cost&#34; of bitcoin is currently $45m per day."</p>
