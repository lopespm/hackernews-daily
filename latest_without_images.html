								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; During last year’s election campaign, Trudeau’s party also proposed a ban on “blind bidding” for houses -- the prevailing system by which offers are kept secret when someone is auctioning a home.This is such a huge deal. Anyone who has had to go through the process of buying a home through a bidding war knows how unfair and one-sided this process is. It take a high-pressure emotional situation, and gives all of the information to one side (the sellers), while leaving the buyer stuck guessing at what the real price for the house is supposed to be. An absolutely horrible process that should be banned. Banning this is such a simple reform. I sincerely hope it happens, though I doubt it it will."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don’t know the specifics on Canadian real estate market and the specifics of the problems there, but based on my understanding of the problems facing your neighbors to the south - I feel like it’s almost an attempt to appease citizens by blaming the issue on “foreigners” (always a move that is popular with politicians) to redirect attention from the much more likely cause - massive investments made by hedge funds, private capital, REITs which does not appear to be addressed at all?Thought I do agree that a non-primary-resident investment, whether from citizens, foreigners, or capital should be greatly limited overall and these rules should only loosen to direct investment towards areas that are in dire need of an influx of capital for redevelopment. That is - if it’s not distressed, and it’s not going to be your primary residence - GTFO, you should be last in line to buy.And I say that as former landlord. I just believe that if I was looking to make some money - I could probably do just fine under these conditions. I don’t see an issue of buying a distressed property needing a rehab, and I think doing so benefits everyone.I am getting real tired of society getting ever more dystopian just so that someone can make a buck.https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/r..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Originally released in 1993, the Onyx from SiliconGraphics was an absolute powerhouse. The machines were powered by between one and four MIPS processors (originally the R4400’s) — ranging from 100 MHz to 250 MHz.250 MHz in 1993 is insanity, considering that was the 33 MHz 486 era.&gt; The RAM on these machines were not industry standard [...] and could handle up to 8 GB of RAM. 16 GB in the rackmount version (yeah, there was a massive rackmount version).8 gig of RAM at a time when home users didn&#39;t even have 1 GB hard drives.  16 GB of RAM at a time when a home user&#39;s desktop could read memory at &lt; 100 MB/s.Having those specs then would be like running a 37 Ghz CPU with 16 TB of RAM now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked at Rareware in that same era, similarly ridiculous amounts of SGI hardware in the building.  As I recall each artist had an SGI Indigo2 and later on the SGI O2 because the standard artist workstation.  I believe our lead artist used an SGI Onyx.  Programmers had Indy2&#39;s with the internal N64 development boards.There were at least 2 rack mounted SGI machines used for large-scale rendering jobs (ie promotional images, magazine covers etc).  May have been SGI Challenges (I know one certainly was) and were kept off-limits to most staff, at the time they were rumored to cost $250k each."</p>

The &#39;90&#39;s were a blast.But still, I&#39;m sad to see SGI go, as their funky shaped and brightly colored workstations and monitors had the best industrial design[1] in  an era of depressing beige, grey or black square boxes.[1] https://preview.redd.it/tt3ziuwt98o31.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=e5cc61..."</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30944524">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"These articles typically come in the form of, I was paying for my brand name when I was number one on organic search. I wasn&#39;t validating any of my other ad spend, I stopped and didn&#39;t see any negative impact, therefore advertising doesn&#39;t work/is a scam.As someone who&#39;s worked in the industry a while, I agree that it&#39;s a sad state of affairs generally but when people extrapolate that this means all advertising is bs it&#39;s just not true. Fundamentally business orders should track results from their ads the same way they look at impact anywhere else in their business."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I probably hate ads more than most people but when I hear or see an ad, it kills my willingness to engage with a business. I mean, this isn&#39;t entirely conscious. I was thinking about whether my kid would like those creative boxes from KiwiCo that I heard good things about organically. Then, I heard an ad for them on a podcast, and I noticed a new extra resistance and hesitation to buy anything from them.I don&#39;t want to be a sucker for ads. I don&#39;t want to support businesses that support our ad-polluted world. With my limited capacity to donate directly to creative work (which I&#39;d incidentally rather do as part of a coordinated general public than just unilaterally), I favor donating to those who forgo ads rather than reward or support anything that accepts ads.Now, I&#39;ve hated ads for a long time. But I was still surprised how much I no longer feel fine considering KiwiCo. Now that I heard their ad, I feel like I don&#39;t want to be one of those people who is seen as following ads, and I don&#39;t want to support them. I imagine there&#39;s other products that don&#39;t budget as much for ads that I should go out of my way to seek out instead.So for anyone like me, if you do paid ads, you just harmed your credibility with me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Though only in a single industry and an n=1 case, we got to see what would happen if a movie went into wide release with no advertising. Would enough people see the movie poster or listing for what&#39;s playing at the theater and be curious enough to see the movie? Or would the lack of advertising doom it?&#39;Delgo&#39; was released to theaters on over 2000 screens with an all-star cast in December of 2008 and virtually no marketing budget. It averaged roughly two paying customers per showing. More people saw Conan O&#39;Brien making jokes about it on his show than saw it in the theaters. Though critically panned as derivative and several years out of date with its CGI, movies with far worse reviews have done much better. The real difference seems to be that no one knew that it existed.That said, a new Star Wars movie with no advertising likely would still end up with plenty of ticket buyers. Existing brands can much more easily get away with taking their foot off the media buying accelerator but how long could they do it before a slow-down occurred? Seems like Marvel and DC still purchase lots of advertising for their well-known and currently popular franchises. What would happen if they stopped? Not sure if we&#39;ll ever know since they&#39;re unlikely to take that risk."</p>

For his triumphs and his failures merge, and one is no more the occasion for pride or shame than the other; and he is neither the hero who proves himself against those forces, nor the protagonist who is destroyed by them.- John Williams in Augustus"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is always a tough subject for me because everyone seems to have at least an idea of what they want to achieve.When I was younger I had these silly dreams of moving to another country, getting married, becoming a programmer to make games, have my own company and get rich (haha).I did become a programmer and got married, but never left the country or became rich. Now on my 30s I know how limited my options are.I could focus on my craft. But I don&#39;t have the same drive as before.
I could try to progress my career, but I&#39;m already earning good money and I know to earn more I&#39;d have to either start job hopping or study some leetcode to get into a FAANG.
I could try to focus on my hobbies, but you realize very quickly that to get good at anything, you need hundreds/thousands of hours.
I could try to start a company, but I know that&#39;s extremely hard to do and also requires a shit-ton of luck to work out.After all that, I realize that I have no real objectives to strive for. Some of the dreams I realized and they weren&#39;t that satisfying. Some I discovered were not worth pursuing.And now what?In the end, I&#39;m just a blip in the universe and when I&#39;m gone it will be unchanged, the same as if I had never existed. Yet we focus on these artificial goals set by childish dreams, society or life events.What&#39;s the point of it?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Growing up, the idea of a career in computing was implausible. The only computing course my school offered was scheduled against doing a full science course, and they had nothing for the 16-18 range. The local night school programming class I signed up for was cancelled because I was the only person who signed up for it. My parents made it extremely clear that the idea that I could ever make money writing software was unrealistic, which meant I was 27 with a PhD in genetics before I jumped ship into software full time.And maybe because of that, I&#39;m pretty ok with things? Every day I&#39;m aware that I could do more. I know people who could take over my job right now who are 15 years younger than me. And that&#39;s ok, because I have achieved so much more than ever seemed possible to me as a teenager, and every time I stare out the window and realise I&#39;m in San Francisco and part of the industry that was so far away when I was growing up I have to take a moment to come to terms with the fact that this is actually reality.I know this article is satire, but I also know that many people hold themselves against standards that are not realistic. Almost none of us have achieved everything that we could be, and that&#39;s just fine. If you&#39;re spending a lot of time troubled by the fact that you feel like you&#39;re falling short of your potential then this is a great time to find a therapist who can help you work through that. It&#39;s ok to want more than you have, but if you&#39;re objectively in a basically good place then you really shouldn&#39;t be constantly aware of that in a negative way. I&#39;m at peace with the fact that I&#39;m never going to found the next unicorn company or be CEO of Google or even write some software that a lot of people care about. Let&#39;s be kind to each other and ourselves about what we&#39;ve achieved, rather than holding ourselves to a model of what we could theoretically be if literally everything had gone our way."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I went looking for a fully remote position last year, I was worried that exactly this might happen.Then I heard that Shopify had literally shut down and sold their offices. It&#39;s not actually possible for the company to go back to the office because they don&#39;t exist.So that&#39;s where I work now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I&#39;m not sure what the compensation model for recruiters is, but it seems to encourage bringing in as many candidates as possible over treating them with honesty and respect.From experience dealing with recruiters for the last 25 years they universally lie to both sides to pocket the commission at all costs.I drove 400 miles once to do an interview for a solution architect position. Got there and the company were recruiting an Oracle DBA. The recruiter had plain up lied because I had some Oracle experience on my CV. They assured me they would ream the recruiter and bought me lunch and gave me an Amazon voucher to cover the fuel and time though which was nice."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is very anecdotal, but I have a friend that interviewed at Google for a Remote SWE position - everything indicated that it was remote: the posting, the recruiter and the hiring manager.Now they announced RTO, his manager said: &#34;We&#39;re excited to have you at the office&#34; - he was really confused about this messaging, so they forced him to apply to work remotely (even if he had been hired as such) denied his application on the grounds that this SWE role that requires a lot of cross regional interaction and virtual meetings - requires &#34;intense collaboration that you can only get in an office&#34;. Total BS.Needless to say he&#39;s leaving. This is such a travesty, total misdirection."</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30947595">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was an engineer at Fast for over a year and wanted to clarify a few points--
- engineers did have access to data and could write their own queries to check revenue (but few people did until the article came out).
- the strategy leadership decided on was to go after massive enterprise sellers which would, in theory, result in step-change functions in revenue. Many people knew about the low numbers but were willing to let the strategy play out for a while. There was a lot of excitement internally around closing the first $1B+ seller
- Internally, the culture was something akin to &#34;toxic positivity&#34; which meant that we weren&#39;t willing to discuss failures or misses in a productive way
- The company spent a lot of money on marketing events including sponsorship deals with the Tampa Bay Lightning and the rumored million dollar concert by the Chain Smokers. People are talking a lot about high engineer salaries but IMO those were far from the biggest problem (possible biased view)The story is a lot more complicated and nuanced than the headlines you read in publications but I will say that Fast was full of really talented folks who I&#39;d be happy to work with again. For me, a big lesson I took away from this experience is the perils of an overly positive fully remote culture. It&#39;s very easy for leadership to hide things from people when information doesn&#39;t easily spread across different organizations"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the most applicable warning for engineers when it comes to the actual work, as opposed to whether one should join a particular startup, is this:&gt; Engineers calculated the load Fast had in needing to serve their traffic. The Fast button was rendered less than 500,000 times per day - rarely needed to ever serve more than a few requests per second.&gt; One of the few warning signs engineers noticed is how Fast spent far more on infrastructure than the scale of the operation would have called for. Engineers sometimes brought up suggestions to scale infra down, and save costs - given there was not much revenue generated.Sounds like the whole thing could have run on a single cheap VM, perhaps with a second one for redundancy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oof, just one of our customers pays about the same as their full revenue, and we&#39;re a cockroach team.The real thing here is they&#39;re not that surprising. A lot of companies with their kind of funding use enterprise sales to force say $5-10M ARR, but there&#39;s only so much VC money can force for a leaky funnel, broken product, and overall incorrect market + fit. I didn&#39;t appreciate this until maybe a year or two ago. Valuation multiples in 50-100X range are super common (and even wackier numbers in seed/a). Think make believe stories like &#34;well with another 12-18mo of growth  this really just a bit over a 30X on some future forward revenue multiple...&#34;. The cash almost always leads to overspending, and it&#39;s highly unlikely the next 2-3 raises won&#39;t blow up and everyone goes home. I&#39;m actually super impressed by the Docker team because they&#39;ve been one of those rare cases of crawling out of that trap, even if with a lot less of the team.We get job candidates with high competing offers for companies I know to be rotten inside, yet there&#39;s only so much I can say. &#34;Our new hires are getting paid from customer revenue and with equity that doesn&#39;t have $50M-$500M of investor thumbs on the scales already cutting you out in 95% of the likely scenarios&#34; generally doesn&#39;t punch through the kool aid."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Just like the author, I too am quite particular about empty space in my MP3 files.When I was ripping my CD collection, I religiously tagged the MP3 files with ID3v1. Later on, I had some tracks whose titles were just a tad longer than 30 chars so I had to use ID3v2 for those and I noticed the file size grew by _a lot_.Frustrated by this, I opened them in a hex editor and learnt that ID3v1 was a fixed format of 128 bytes, but v2 was variable. I also found out that the software had added a 4KB zero-byte padding to the v2 tag, which was &#34;necessary&#34; because the tag is now at the front of the file, and this padding allows more tag data to be added easily later on.I tried various ID3 tagging software at that time and all of them added a padding. So I learned about the tag format and wrote a tagger myself that didn&#39;t add any padding. It was a great learning experience, and I managed to shave those useless zero bytes from my MP3s."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked with the FLAC format and it also recommends padding to make it easier to edit metadata. I think libflac reserves 4 KB by default.&gt; PADDING: This block allows for an arbitrary amount of padding. The contents of a PADDING block have no meaning. This block is useful when it is known that metadata will be edited after encoding; the user can instruct the encoder to reserve a PADDING block of sufficient size so that when metadata is added, it will simply overwrite the padding (which is relatively quick) instead of having to insert it into the right place in the existing file (which would normally require rewriting the entire file).-- https://xiph.org/flac/format.html#format_overview"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If only Apple had some way to store metadata for a file separately from the content. Something like files with a &#34;data fork&#34; and a &#34;resource fork&#34;, maybe."</p>
