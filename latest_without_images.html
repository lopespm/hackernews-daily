								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article conflates NFTs with cryptocurrency, in a way that looks to me to be intentional in order to bolster his argument that crypto is for rich people to conspicuously consume and to pump and dump on the plebs.NFTs aren&#39;t money, or currency and just because they can be created on some blockchains doesn&#39;t make them so.I also don&#39;t see a genuine effort from the author to really understand why proponents think that this technology will positively change the world. You might not agree with them, but at least then rebut their arguments instead of creating straw men.Bitcoin is open source, the original founder is nowhere to be found, there were no VCs involved in its creation or in the distribution of the coins and the entire network is run out in the open. The Bitcoin network is a commons.The permissionless, decentralized, p2p and stateless aspect of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin is as revolutionary as it was 12 years ago, and in these 12 years &#34;normal&#34; (i.e. non-rich) people had access to them as much as anyone else. Heck, 10 years ago there were faucets that would hand out 5 bitcoins if you solved a captcha.The people who are today involved in the creation and distribution of fiat money have incredible power, a power which is largely hidden from view, but which actually drives and shapes a lot of what we see. Of course these people won&#39;t take an open source competitor lying down."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was involved in a blockchain (DeFi) startup. All the blockchain companies are mostly a huge pyramid scheme. The company I worked for has a lot of big claims, raised millions, wanted to solve world hunger, prioritized partnership, marketing, while having no working implementation. Others in the eco system are the same.The NFT scene is even more BS. It could destroyed uninformed people&#39;s life, just like gambling. However, this kind of gambling is public on the internet with little regulations.I hope more tech people speak about this instead of just ignoring them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel the IPFS blog post gave me a glimpse of how blockchain can be cool. In certain cases, the need for decentralization is so strong that it makes sense to build a blockchain system for it (or other secure P2P network thingy).For example, authentication/identity using blockchain technology seems interesting to me.[1] https://blog.ipfs.io/decentralizing-the-internet-s-root/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I won&#39;t claim it&#39;s more or less impressive, butLuis Antin van Rooten&#39;s Mots D&#39;Heures is at first glance abstract (bordering on the nonsensical) French poetry ..But is actually a homophonic translation of English nursery rhymes - that is, if you read the French aloud, it sounds as if you&#39;re reading the rhyme.Example:    Un petit d&#39;un petit
    S&#39;étonne aux Halles
    Un petit d&#39;un petit
    Ah! degrés te fallent
    Indolent qui ne sort cesse
    Indolent qui ne se mène
    Qu&#39;importe un petit d&#39;un petit
    Tout Gai de Reguennes.

(If you read it aloud you will recognize a well-known scrambled egg...)The effort is in making the French poetry make any sense, which van Rooten (a Hollywood character actor in his spare time) does admirably.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mots_d%27Heures?wprov=sfla1"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is so weird for me.Where I work (backend software development), we do video calls and meetings all the time. Probably an hour every day or more is spent in direct contact. I see this as absolutely essential to get people on the same page - but none of the reasons that people have listed in this thread for why people prefer personal meetings apply to me. For instance, I am extremely grateful if someone writes up meeting notes, I read text documents all the time, and I often require continuous uninterrupted time and respect it in others, and I still prefer voiced meetings.I think the primary reason is if I am trying to clarify an idea for a design or an approach, I will go to the people who have also touched that field of difficulty, and try to explain what I am trying to do to them in advance. The spoken medium in that case gives room for interruptions, immediate elaborations and feedback. A write-up either convinces or it doesn&#39;t; it can be edited but it has feedback cycles on the order of tens of minutes to hours. Spoken communication has feedback cycles of seconds, so even if I was going to write something up, I&#39;d talk it through verbally first, anyways."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author wants to educate people on the benefits of (more) text communication, but I don&#39;t believe it will change minds.Reading the sibling comment from papaf[1] and also a previous reply to me by jakubp[2] about talking things out instead of email, it seems like the higher meta-analysis is that some people have a predisposition to prefer synchronous (videoconference, phone call, cubicle visit) over asynchronous communication (email, chat).One group really prioritizes synchro comm for &#34;emotional nuance&#34; etc.  The other group prioritizes written text&#39;s dense information content and searchability.So if the company has folks like papaf and jakubp, it doesn&#39;t matter if you have a blog article recommending structured emails over video calls.  Some employees prefer not to communicate that way.  In fact, the blog article just makes them express their disagreement with it.  E.g. papaf saying we&#39;re not &#34;efficient robots&#34; and jakubp advising me that I should accommodate his communication style of in-person cubicle visits.To prevent clashing, I guess the higher-level advice is to hire a team where everybody likes to communicate the same way.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28651678[2] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20583427"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In my experience, many people prefer meetings over asynchronous communication because they can&#39;t write. I&#39;m not referring to grammar or to spelling, but to being able to communicate effectively without a continuous feedback from the recipient of the message. When these people are asked to write documentation, the result is usually very sparse text with too many bullet points, table and images.
Good asynchronous communication requires a high degree of introspection, clarity of mind and empathy, that not everybody has. A meeting allows you to pass your message through successive approximations, as in adjusting what you are saying based on the reactions of the listeners and being pushed in the right direction by their questions. Unfortunately it is also much more time consuming, because everybody has to stop whatever they are doing and listen for 1-2 hours, while reading 2 pages of text would taken them 30 minutes and they could have scheduled it at their convenience.I don&#39;t see much of a difference between older vs younger generations nor between native and non-native English speakers.I&#39;m open to accept that it&#39;s just my own experience and that it doesn&#39;t generalize."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; I tried a few of those Kinesis split keyboards. Too squishy for me. Not far enough apart. The CherryMX Kinesis split keyboard was is too clickey for calls and screenshares. Muscle memory made it difficult to switch.This is a really cool hack, and I’m happy that the author found a solution for their pain that works for them, but this bit confused me.Kinesis are keyboards with separated key clusters, but not split keyboards. When one says split keyboard I think they are normally talking about things like the Ergodox EZ/Moonlander which have two physically separate bodies, one for each hand. There are many different models of these with various shapes and sizes, and you can separate them as much as you like. The normal advice is to set them up around shoulder width apart so you aren’t rounding your back to bring your arms together.Most of these kinds of keyboards also support whatever key switches you prefer, and there are plenty of options that are sufficiently quiet for zoom (pretty much anything linear should do the trick)I have been using a Moonlander for a couple of years now, and an EZ before that. They are expensive at around $400 but I don’t think I can ever go back. Most of these split keyboards also run QMK so you can setup binds, layers, and generally configure them however you like."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are probably multiple different causes for RSI in programmers, but for me, a regular keyboard is fine. Even my slouch is fine. I type with my elbows on the table and it&#39;s fine.It&#39;s the mouse that killed me. A handful of years after graduating from college, I thought my programming career was over because the pain in my neck and shoulders was so bad I couldn&#39;t type. I went to a bunch of doctors, neurologists, physiotherapy, etc but nothing helped, not even medication.It turns out twisting my right hand outward in order to accommodate my mouse to the right of my keyboard was the culprit. I changed my entire set up so that my mouse is away from my keyboard when I type, and when I need to use the mouse, I push my keyboard away and have the mouse on the table in the center of my body, with my wrist slightly twisted so that it mimics writing with a pencil. That&#39;s also why Macbooks and similar laptops are fine with my because it&#39;s in the middle.Once I switched to this technique, my carpal tunnel went away. It&#39;s been over 25 years now with no pain. Like I said, different people probably have different causes of carpal tunnel, but for me this was the precise reason."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find it really odd that the OP is staring down the barrel of an RSI that&#39;s going to inexorably lock them (presumably) out of their career and passion, but the learning curve for a proper ergonomic keyboard seemed to high. I was up to an acceptable 40WPM on the Ergodox a week after switching, and his complaints about &#34;the Cherry MX&#34; switches fall a little flat since there&#39;s about a dozen different kinds, all with different noise and tactile characteristics.I just can&#39;t fathom all that unused space on my desk (two halves of two keyboards, going totally unused!) when the investment in some natural-feeling typing infrastructure was relatively small given how much pain I&#39;ve avoided, and will continue to avoid.Edit: clearer word order"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This seems like the antebellum for an IP reckoning similar to what resulted in the DMCA in the United States in the late 90s. The technology is getting to the point where it makes the law as it stands pretty nonsensical in the face of what can be doneThe scope of patents in software and technology is already absurd, both because 12 years is an eternity for how quickly that industry moves, and because increasingly trivial &#34;inventions&#34; have been let through as the ability for patent officials to interpret complicated digital innovations according to patent law and policy has increasingly fallen behind the field. This is already a serious problem, but currently still takes expensive lawyers to take advantage of. Even if we make legal precedent that says that AI can&#39;t own patents, the advent of better purpose-specific text generation will quickly put patent trolling in the hands of laypeoplePersonally, I think the DMCA was a horrible mistake. The provisions it added to copyright created a ton of horrible precedent that led to the draconian control private companies exert over the lives of billions of people worldwide, justified in law by their intellectual property concerns. I believe that if Intellectual Property ever served a legitimate purpose, it has now run its course and needs to be dismantled. I hope that this new challenge moves us more in this direction, rather than some new awful legislative band-aid that attempts to preserve the status quo by destroying more of our rights"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The applicant recorded his AI as the inventor for some reason (*).  Had the applicant recorded himself as the inventor having used the AI as a tool to invent, then the application probably would have been allowed.Using a mechanical process to search a large possibility space to find a patentable subspace is not new. For example, testing chemical compounds to find a mixture with optimal properties or testing drug dosages to find the most effective treatment is common. The resulting narrow range of mixtures or dosages is patentable so long as it is new (not done before), non-obvious (inventive), useful, etc. Also, if I hire other people to do the lab work at my direction, then I am still the inventor, not the lab technicians. Similarly, AI is just another tool.Edit: (*) After looking into this more, the applicant here is on a crusade to have an AI recognized as an inventor. https://artificialinventor.com/patent-applications/. That web site contains nonsense like the following:&gt; Arguably, DABUS may be considered “sentient” in that any chain-based concept launches a series of memories (i.e., affect chains) that sometimes terminate in critical recollections, thereby launching a tide of artificial molecules. It is these associated memory sequences, and the accompanying simulated neurotransmitter rush, that are considered equivalent to subjective feelings in humans (i.e., sentience). In this way, DABUS has an emotional appreciation for what it conceives."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am a research fellow at a large tech company and part of my job is to produce a certain number of patents per year. I have used AI as an &#34;aid&#34; to developing a patent several times but never thought for one minute it would make sense to list AI as the inventor. That is ridiculous. I have used Excel, R, Google Search, Mathematica, Python and several other modeling tools etc. to develop new IPR, obviously no one would list any of those. It was me doing the inventing, I am just using tool like any other."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If your attacker is both sophisticated and able to access your hardware directly, the game is over; nothing we can do can currently avoid this.What we can do is address the scenarios in which an attacker is either unsophisticated or remote.  Normal network security takes care of the latter case, and for unsophisticated attackers, a good FDE (Full Disk Encryption) system covers it nicely.  For laptops you can either live with typing in a password at every boot, or get a USB key of some kind.  For servers with FDE you might want to use something to enable remote and unattended reboots, like (shameless plug) Mandos¹.1. https://www.recompile.se/mandos"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Only had time to skim it, but even without all the details it is an excellent overview of the state of the art regarding secure boot chain. You can learn many of the points by looking into the Android boot sequence but this is a more generic and &#39;everything in a single place&#39; write-up. Especially the mechanisms behind dm-verity seem to be not widely known and - in my view- underappreciated.&gt; *This is all so desktop/laptop focused, what about servers?I know that some of the more powerful and Linux based automotive embedded systems use a similar design. While important for desktop/laptop and servers the mentioned points are crucial for systems where physical security of the hardware is limited.Oh, and BTW, if 0pointer.net i doesn&#39;t ring a bell: The author is Lennart Poettering."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"An option that wasn&#39;t at all considered in the article is to have the initrd and (optionally) the secret key used for decrypting the disk on a separate device (or devices), for example on an 1 GB USB drive. This way the big disk can have full, real FDE (not LUKS). To an attacker not in possesion of the USB drive the big disk just looks like random data. And the USB drive can be kept on one&#39;s own person and easily destroyed if necessary.The main part is having the initrd on an external, small, device. The secret can be either a regular passphrase, or stored somewhere on the small device.Works fine on my Archlinux. I mount the initrd file system to /boot when I need to update it."</p>
