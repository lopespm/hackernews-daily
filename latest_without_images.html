								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’ve been watching this project for a long time and personally am very excited. The fact that it’s #1 on HN today (congrats!) makes me think I’m not the only one.There are also a lot of valid concerns in these comments about privacy and use of algorithms. A lot of it depends on what you’re looking to gain by adopting a new service/switching away from something else and individual concern.Personally, I’m looking for a place to store personal photos: friends, family, travel etc. Critical needs
- easy sharing ideally not locked into Apple’s ecosystem
- not to have my photos mined for advertising and social graph data (most important)
- ideally around for the long haul but in my mind this is for sharing, not backupI’m not particularly concerned about warrants, government surveillance etc. Again for me this is about sharing so the expectation of true privacy is low. Any photos I considered sensitive I would store elsewhere.For me, the biggest point of confidence I have in this project is that they charge money from day 1 and don’t have a forever free plan. I’m excited about projects that offer the benefits of “social” but where the software, not my data, is the product."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting but prices is high!Guys if you need to hide sensitive information while screen sharing or video recording, check this https://blurdata.net/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The monthly storage costs are too high. For the price of 1TB from you (15€), I can buy more than 2 TB just about anywhere else.Commercially, Apple and Google are both 2TB for 10 CHF and Amazon gives you unlimited as part of a Prime membership. Storage providers like Backblaze and Wasabi both charge around $5/TB and that&#39;s really the table-stakes price. For the more DIY-inclined, Hetzner sells a 2TB OwnCloud instance for 9.90€/month.I&#39;d prefer to buy software from you than storage. It&#39;s out of the question for me to pay you per TB but I&#39;d consider paying a flat rate for software I then host myself."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Was listening to Ben Evan&#39;s podcast earlier today and he had a stat from the Apple / Epic trial that shook me a bit - in a given month in 2016 something like 0.05% of Apple users were spending in excess of 450 USD on in-app purchases.  And that was 54% of App store revenue.This is basically addicts gambling.  Its the sort of numbers you see at Casinos and online casinos, and ... i dunno. It saddens me.  Yes the vast vast majority of players have a &#34;bit of fun&#34;, most never pay for anything, but all the profit comes from the addicts.Even in IOS App Store.  Which really did look like it was trying to avoid that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Happy to chat about it, HN, since otherwise I&#39;d just be playing more Genshin Impact.My capsule review of the game nobody asked for: if you like Breath of the Wild, you&#39;ll likely enjoy it a lot. It is not as pure of an exploration game at BotW is, and the emergent game mechanics that made BotW such a joy, a toy which produced its own unique stories with every player, are mostly absent. The exploration doesn&#39;t tie in closely with the plot like it does in BotW.But, other than that, it&#39;s an extremely, extremely effective game. Excellent art and music design; the graphics compare favorably to anything I&#39;ve ever seen in an AAA game if you like this anime-inspired visual style.I find the combat similar to single-player WoW with more interesting strategic choices (regarding party comp, etc) and less interesting tactical choices. Harder encounters are fun puzzles to solve.While the actual story in the game is nothing we haven&#39;t seen done better before, the character interactions are an extremely interesting Chinese take on Chinese/Japanese/Western fantasy tropes. Someone could get an East Asian Studies thesis out of it fairly easily. It&#39;s amusing to &#34;read&#34; with that cultural commentary lens on; the localization is also surprisingly well done (including both English and Japanese, to the extent you credit me with being able to perceive that).The metagame about how to progress as quickly as possible, and where to invest your resources / how to harvest them efficiently, also pushes my buttons very effectively."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Gacha games are named after the onomatopoeia describing vending machines in Japanese malls and arcades which dispense toys and trinkets for, typically, 100 to 200 yen (about $1-$2). The pool of trinkets is displayed prominently on the machine; which trinket you get is effectively randomized. If you had your heart set on a particular one, you might spend much more than $1 on getting it, and some children (and adults!) very much do. Many very successful games have a monetization strategy which descends from a variant of this.I am sorry to say this as someone who usually agrees with &#39;patio11 on everything, but both gacha and the &#34;monetization strategies&#34; inspired by it (be they hawking in-game currency or trying to mine email addresses) sound like a terrible idea.I don&#39;t want gacha, or any of these monetization strategies in my ideal consumption model. I want to look at a toy in the store and buy it while knowing what I am getting. This gacha model sounds like it&#39;s incentivizing gambling from a very young age.Am I too close-minded? Idealistic? Missing some crucial part of the article? I&#39;d like to hear, because nothing seems good about this at the moment."</p>

It looks super combined but can be combined into three or maybe four commands.I think it would be massively helpful if the devs would upload a DEB/Flatpak file somewhere instead of having compilation instructions as the primary install method. Sure, if you run a funky Linux like OpenSUSE you need to follow and convert installation instructions, but for Ubuntu (which the guide is targeting) you really don&#39;t anymore.That being said, on Arch (and Arch-derived) systems you can find this in the standard software store under the name snis-git if you&#39;ve enabled the AUR."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is actually better for most consumers. The SLC cache was increased nearly three fold and the controller is a superior one (it now uses the same one as the 980 PRO). TechPowerUp[0] has a much better post on this, and you can clearly see there that the new one is better in most cases than the old one.The only ones disadvantaged by this change are people who constantly write &gt;42GB which I would think are video editors. (The old version would get a speed reduction to 1500MB/s after overflowing the SLC cache (42GB), the new one goes down to 800MB/s after overflowing (115GB))P.S.: Not defending this, just clarifying because most posters here seem to believe it&#39;s a straight up downgrade. Should also be worth noting that Samsung changed the product box, product number, firmware version and the spec sheet for this change. So they&#39;re significantly better than the others who have done similar moves. That said, I still believe that they should have called this the 971 Evo+ or something, as it&#39;s genuinely different.[0]: https://www.techpowerup.com/286008/et-tu-samsung-samsung-too..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used to work in their SSD vertical on the software side. For what it&#39;s worth, SSD/memory business unit is their pride. They never used to cut corners and do rigorous testing to ensure their customers aren&#39;t screwed over. Even when a bad batch of SSDs were shipped by mistake, they would recall/refund all of them proactively. When ever a new model is released, they would first ship limited units to a set of SSD enthusiasts including gamers in Korea. One such time, there was a BSOD reported by a single tester in some edge case - &gt; they sent a lot of team members in person to chase and fix that issue.So I really doubt they would do anything stupid to get some quick bucks at the cost of reputation.On the other hand, their smart tv division is absolute garbage and employees themselves wouldn&#39;t buy Samsung TVs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The reporting is this case is a little dramatized IMHO. As you can read here [0] they actually use the controller from the 980 Pro and more dense NAND, Billy Tallis from Anandtech filled in some missing technical detail. You actually gain performance in the random 4K case, which is important in day to day operations but you loose sequential write speed if you exceed the SLC-Cache of 115GB.This differs quite significantly from WD silently changing the Blue drive from TLC (okay with Cache) to QLC which nets you write speeds lower than HDDs after the cache is full. Crucial did TLC-&gt;QLC on the P2 too, but you could get those drives for 30% less up until a week ago.(edit) forgot to mention ADATA who switched the controller of their SX8200 Pro [1][0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28320640

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very few things surprised me as much as rail design when I was studying structural engineering. Surface tension and fluid dynamics were both trippy too, but I expected those things to be complicated and while surface tension blew my mind due to the relative simplicity of the proof, and fluid dynamics blew my mind because it was somehow 100x more complex than I estimated.Walking into rail design was hilarious. I worked on motorcycles and did some car stuff. I figured it was obvious, and sorta dismissed this assignment as a joke. Nope. My dismissive intuitions were just flat out wrong. It kinda leaves an impression on you to sorta avoid saying you know for sure before putting in some amount of work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another way to think of how this works is to look at crowned pulleys:https://woodgears.ca/bandsaw/crowned_pulleys.htmlIn the train&#39;s case (if we ignore the gap between the wheels), the pair of wheels work like a crowned pulley, and the track finds center like a belt."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Motorcycles turn at speed by a similar principle, though the cones arrangement is a bit flipped around.I usually demonstrate it with two solo cups put mouth-to-mouth, to make a pair of facing cones that represents the motorcycle tire.  The starting condition is that you&#39;re above parking lot speeds, and the bike is stable and is dynamically inclined to stay perfectly upright.  To go left, you turn the bars right to upset the stable bike onto the left cone, and it goes left.  To go right you turn the bars left and it upsets the bike onto the right cone, and goes right."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A better headline - users willing to give up privacy for convenience.Reality - there was a period where the icloud backups created backups that apple did not have access to. Critically, this mean that if you had any of a wide variety of things happen - unless you were very good about key management - your content was lost for good. ALL your photos (which could be heartbreaking) etc.It turns out this is NOT what people want. They want apple to have access to their content, so when they have a device stolen and don&#39;t have a super long recovery key properly saved, they are not hosed.Same issue BTW with bitlocker on windows. People DO NOT save those recovery keys, even if they should. Microsoft added a way to force a backup into an account admins and others would have access to, thank goodness, because otherwise users there would be hosed as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m continually surprised that people can&#39;t seem to understand E2EE. For whatever reason they assume it means a message is encrypted forever and unreadable by anyone.There is zero guarantee from any E2EE system that the data is encrypted at rest by the sender and receiver. In fact in most cases, the data is not encrypted at rest because people want to do silly things like read messages.The exact same vulnerability exists  on every platform that&#39;s automatically backing up local data to the cloud. Even if you disable cloud backups you&#39;re still stuck if whoever you&#39;re messaging has left them enabled.The only meaningful way around this hole when it comes to messaging apps is row-level encryption on the backing store. This has a lot of problems of its own and potential holes when it comes to indexing and searching."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I used to work with tungsten carbide cubes during my PhD thesis. They&#39;re used in multianvil high-pressure synthesis. With the right setup you can reach almost 20 GPa of pressure. Not as much as with diamond anvil cells, but you have more reasonable sample sizes (a few milligrams). And thats still like the pressure pretty deep into Earth&#39;s mantle.I also used the opportunity to snap a neat picture of a polished WC cube: https://imgur.com/C2YiMqb.jpgI always had fun handing them over to students because everyone is surprised by the sheer weight of these things.Tungsten carbide is actually quite dangerous after it has been subjected to a lot of stress (Such as being stuck into a 1000 t press for a high-pressure synthesis). They have the mean tendecy to explode into super sharp pieces when you&#39;re not expecting it, so wear goggles."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">" &gt; I struggled a lot with deciding to buy a cube. It felt wrong to spend so much money on a featureless hunk of metal.When I bought my cube, I used it as an exercise to fight back against my frugality.But it wasn&#39;t meant to be: it was delivered to the wrong address and I received a full refund.Then my neighbor delivered it to me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I got one as well, around the same time actually, as a gift. I also fell into a strange fascination with it and find it fun to hold in the exact same ways as the author. Folks tend to get me 1&#34; element (or sometimes non elemental but interesting in another way) cubes as gifts now which works out as it gives a great range of price to choose from while maintaining surprise with the guarantee I&#39;ll enjoy it.I&#39;ve had my sites set on something this size https://midwesttungsten.com/tungsten-cube/ for a while now. (about as much as I would feel safe setting down or handing to people considering the hard edges and chance of accidents) I&#39;ve more than had the spending money to do it for a long time but much like the author I&#39;ve just had a hard time justifying it. I suppose it&#39;s still less ridiculously than what many spend on car hobbies or whatnot. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll eventually get something of the nature.I&#39;ll also add I was extremely surprised others enjoyed it as well. Of all of my desk toys/models/prints it&#39;s generated the most talk amongst friends and coworkers.I&#39;d like to experience a sizeable amount of iridium some day  as well.Edit: One of the most fun gifts I&#39;ve received (beyond the tungsten cube) was a 1&#34; magnesium cube. Apart from being a ridiculous fire/blinding risk capable of easily melting through the tungsten cube if set off it is even lighter than  an equivalently sized aluminum cube."</p>

For example, when Mr Boudin ran on his platform of less punitive justice, San Francisco already had one of the lowest incarceration rates in the country. In 2019, 106 adults were in prison for every 100,000 people, one-fifth the rate in California and the nation. If the rest of the country behaved like San Francisco, the prison population would decline by 80%, says James Austin of the jfa Institute, a think-tank that evaluates criminal-justice policies.This seems like a very reasonable hypothesis"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interestin things about Ada:- language designer have a document where they explain their choices, the Ada Rationale:
http://www.ada-auth.org/standards/rationale12.html- there is an annotated version of the standard, and it&#39;s freely available as the standard:
http://www.ada-auth.org/arm.html- A language test suite was developped at the same time of the language:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Conformity_Assessment_Test...The last point was also in retrospect not sot good for the language ecosystem: buyers wanted a 100% on this test suite before considering your Ada compiler, which means dev had hundreds of compiler bugs to fix and no paying customers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked with Ada a lot during the 90s (and even maintained the Linux port of GNAT early on). This document does not address one thing that I am curious about. What does the modern, idiomatic Ada programmer do about memory management? Are library implementers still required to use Unchecked_Deallocation? I don&#39;t see how a language where Unchecked_Deallocation is used can be considered safe at a time when we have modern choices with automatic memory management.Edit: I guess another way to put this is, &#34;Can a non-trivial project be developed in modern Ada without using Unchecked_Dealloation?&#34; Because I don&#39;t see how I can consider a library safe if it is allowed to call Unchecked_Deallocation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I went to a college that taught CS in ADA, and I never took CS because I tested out of 101, but I ended up fixing attempts at the problem sets for about half my dorm section (this was okay as long as and they documented it).Well anyway, I found it to be very easy to pick up just by reading, hard to make semantic errors, and easy to modify without breaking things. The pace of learning for the entire cohort, mostly non-CS students, was, I think, much faster than e.g. C++ and possibly more complete than e.g. Python. It’s pedantic and exact, but it uses real english language keywords and modifiers.I went to a different school later where I did the same thing but it was taught in C++. It seemed like many students would get by purely by repeating patterns that they didn’t understand. And I started to catch myself in that trap as well, realizing that I had a lot to learn.But I wasn’t going to be a programmer; I was going to be a theoretical physicist cogitating on the deep mysteries of the universe. Fast forward…. D’ohhhh."</p>
