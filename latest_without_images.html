								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Honestly I&#39;m glad to see a non-insignificant amount of people in tech take this seriously, especially when the goal Apple announces appears to be for the greater good. It can be hard to stand on the side that doesn&#39;t immediately appear to be correct. We have already lost so many freedoms for &#39;national security&#39; and other such blanket terminology.Just be warned, there will be those that unfairly try to cast this as helping the distribution of CP. Expect a headline tomorrow: &#34;Edward Snowden et al Supports Child Porn&#34; - or some other hot take.A few other things:1. Vote with your feet - Put your money in the pockets of the people aligned to your values.2. Actively support projects you align with - If you use some open source hardware/software, try to help out (financially or time).3. Make others aware - Reach out to those around you and inform them, only then they can make an informed choice themselves."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Related but slightly off-topic: am I the only one that thinks more technology is not the answer to catching crooks?
 Can’t the police do good old fashioned police work to catch people doing these things?
Why does EVERYONE need to be surveilled for the 0.01% (or less?) who don’t behave properly.
To further this point: why do we need cameras on every street, facial recognition systems and 3-letter orgs storing huge data silos and maintaining lists etc etc…
One thought: is it because over 10, 20, 30+ years the police have been de-funded everywhere and become useless for difficult cases and/or militarised to deal with peaceful protesters instead?
Genuine questions.. I just don’t think this surveillance nightmare is the answer, and police could still catch crooks before the internet so what’s the problem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Notice, for example, that Thunderbird is sending file names and SHA-256 hashes when you open most (e.g. .pdf) attachments, in the clear, to Google. This seems worse to me (in the Apple case, the information is revealed only if enough files from one device match against a predefined hash list) and nobody really cares...I have just tested with a fresh profile with a freshly downloaded thunderbird-78.12.0.tar.bz2 (x64 Linux, en-US) using a Burp proxy. Here is the function that does it: https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/compone...Here is the about:config tweak to turn it off: browser.safebrowsing.downloads.remote.urlHere is an example request: POST https://sb-ssl.google.com/safebrowsing/clientreport/download...Content is Protobuf-encoded payload containing:- full path to the mailbox including the username and &#34;secret&#34; random profile name (e.g. /home/jenda/.thunderbird/ioi8uk0k.tbtest/Mail/hrach.eu/Inbox)- SHA-256 of the file- attachment file name (e.g. 10-test-blahblah.pdf)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Well, buried in the middle of this article is an important point:&gt; In fact, as of the fall 2019 semester, Gerber had been officially enrolled only at the university in China, not at St. Gallen.So he was a Swiss person doing a PhD at a Chinese university. His relationship with the professor at the Swiss university was an unofficial one, so the word &#39;dismissal&#39; here is pretty misleading. No information about what happened to his actual PhD program at the Chinese university that I noticed.The actual evidence of chinese influence?&gt; She said she had received a message from a Chinese doctoral student doing research at a Canadian university.So, it sure sounds like some people had their feelings hurt.My totally made-up hypothesis on this article: honest reporter researched a story, realised it was pretty weak, then when they wrote it up shuffled things around a bit to give an exaggerated impact, but couldn&#39;t bring themselves to lie or leave out any facts."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The professor should be fired and the university punished (doubtful), but the student was also an idiot to do what he did. It’s not like he was some random guy who just tweeted at China, he lived in wuhan for years and has actual family there now, being critical of a totalitarian government in that scenario is the height of monumental stupidity. It’s ironic that the article paints him as methodological and thoughtful because he seems anything but in his actions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is an article spun to make controversy out of nothing.The narrative is that a student tweeted something critical about China, and the CCP pressured his advisor into dropping him.The reality is that the student published a tweet that &#34;depicted a comic character that had been altered and had stereotyped Chinese features, with yellow skin tone and slit eyes&#34;. This understandably was perceived as racist by a Chinese student in Canada, who complained to the advisor. The advisor agreed and dropped her racist-seeming doctoral student.The CCP wasn&#39;t involved. Nobody cared about his criticism of China. It was his racist-looking tweet that got him dismissed.Edit: But yes, the CCP can have a chilling effect on free speech. See the Blitzchung controversy. This article is just a non-story."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Apple&#39;s mistake is that they seemingly believe there is pushback because people misunderstand how it works. The reality is more nuanced: People understand exactly how it works, and how it works is that it is turn-key onboard spyware, that Apple pinky-swears isn&#39;t being used wrong today.For example if the scope/mission expands (e.g. foreign governments), suddenly you&#39;ve created a drag-net for whatever &#34;badness&#34; is of interest in whatever today&#39;s moral panic is (e.g. terrorism after 9/11). Plus perceptual hashing, by its very design, is created to be less precise than traditional cryptographic hashing.A cryptographic hash + file size combo is unlikely to have a false positive within our lifetime (and it has been used successful by multiple companies to combat CP). The interesting thing about a perceptual hash is that the closer the source material is to the banned material in terms of actual content (e.g. nudity), the more likely for a false positive.Therefore, if Apple does mess up via false-positive and manually review your material, it is more likely to be sensitive private materials (involving consenting adult(s), not CP) because that is what the perceptual hashes are looking for similarities to.PS - If you think this concept cannot happen in a Western country, see the UK&#39;s internet filters as a textbook example. Originally started to fight CP, and now used to fight a ton of other stuff too with more proposals every year: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_blocking_in_the_United_Kin..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Take a close look at the way this works. If there are enough hash matches, Apple apparently gets to look at all the pictures on the phone. The description says &#34;threshold reached, all content visible and unlocked&#34;. &#34;All&#34;, not &#34;Matched&#34;.Matches can be forced from the outside, by sending pictures to the phone. They don&#39;t even have to be from the known-bad image set. Using an adversarial system to try to create hash matches might allow generating innocuous pictures which trigger a phone dump.Expect a toolset for doing that to be developed. Although it may take a while for word of it to leak out. This has applications for entrapment, swatting, political retribution, etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unfortunalty if our experience from the past with such events teaches us anything, it&#39;s that a minority of us will stop using apple products (or keep not doing it) but the rest of the world will quickly forget and carry on as usual.Worse, if your decision to not use an iphone makes others people life slightly anoying for 2 seconds a week, many will bash on you.As a FOSS user with no FB nor whatsapp account that ask to avoid photos to be taken of him with smartphones, I can tell you I pay regularly the price the price for what I think is doing the right thing. It&#39;s just easier to let the abuse go on.And we have other fights in life. I didnt pick up smoking (pot of cigarets), stopped drinking alcohol, became vegetarian. They all come with social challenges. Add then you have your familly, job, health and goals that needs your care, attention and time.At some point you just want to say &#34;screw them&#34;, create your own bubble of freedom and let them enjoy their distopia. Except we kind of live in it, don&#39;t we?I&#39;m usually an upbeat person but these types of event arrive in a never ending stream, and today I feel tired."</p>

					<h3><a href="https://www.governing.com/community/vehicles-still-firmly-in-control-of-city-streets">Surveys show Americans want more walkable cities</a></h3>

					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28093063">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Sometimes I think Americans don’t know how badly they want this.Americans will tell you how wonderful European cities are with their small streets and their public squares filled with great restaurants. They think we don’t have cities like that because we’re lacking some fundamental European-ness.No. We just put cars everywhere. Cars ruin everything. Now you have wider streets. Louder streets. More dangerous streets. Far less foot traffic which means very low chances of discovering a new favorite place. You have lower business density which totally changes the economics of an entire neighborhood. Etc.In this and so many other things Americans say they want what they see elsewhere but are uninterested in doing anything about it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Add up the roads, parking spaces, parking garages, gas stations (not to mention auto shops, drive thrus and car washes) and the total urban footprint is a gargantuan 50-60% by many calculations. That&#39;s not automatically a bad thing, especially if you are a car, but all of that space creates massive buffers separating all of the other stuff that humans want to walk to. To make it worse, those buffers are far and away the most dangerous thing in any urban environment.On the bright side, the pandemic seems have enabled many cities to finally reclaim some of that car land for use by people. Though it&#39;s not clear how long that will last."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like my car and I like driving.That said, I don&#39;t like driving _everywhere_. When I moved to university, it was incredibly freeing to just be able to walk somewhere I wanted to go rather than getting in my car and driving miles to get anywhere. I grew up in a suburb in Texas so walking anywhere except _maybe_ a friend&#39;s house was entirely out of the question.I visited Portland recently and it was lovely to be able to get around the whole city without a car. We didn&#39;t rent one, save for one day when we went &gt; 100mi out of the city. No Ubers, no Lyfts- just walking, buses, and lightrail.Just my experience as an American."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There is no such thing as a trustworthy third party and even trusting yourself is questionable at the best of times. We are constantly balancing a bunch of different considerations with regards to the way that we compute, purchase devices, and utilize services. Security and privacy are of course important, and Apple to date has had a fairly good (if shallow) track record in this regard, at least in the United States.With that being said, what Apple is doing here is just a blatant violation of that &#39;trust&#39; and certainly a compromise to their commitment to privacy. Under no circumstances is it justifiable to essentially enlist people&#39;s devices to police their owners, while using the electricity that you pay for, the internet service you pay for, and the device itself that you pay for to perform a function that is to absolutely no benefit to the user and in fact can only ever be harmful to them.It doesn&#39;t matter that the net data exfiltrated by Apple ends up being the same as before (through scanning unencrypted files on their servers). The distinction is so obvious to me that I find it incredible that people are legitimately arguing that it&#39;s the same, or that it in some way this is actually helping preserve user privacy.As mentioned in the article, this does absolutely nothing towards protecting children other than directing all but the biggest idiots towards platforms that can&#39;t be linked to them, which I&#39;d imagine, they already are."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So this new Apple stuff has made me decide not to buy an M1. I&#39;m leaning Framework laptop.For my phone though... no idea. My iPhone is honestly such a solid piece of tech. I don&#39;t _want_ to go Google either... so what else do i have?I know lots of people run de-googled Androids, which i guess works, but i&#39;d prefer to avoid them entirely. Is there anything that works?edit: I know of the Purism phone (https://puri.sm/products/librem-5-usa/) but that&#39;s the only one i know of. Anyone know of others?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Planting false evidence is getting a new twist here. The attacker doesn&#39;t even have to make a report! The victim&#39;s computer does it for him.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I used to donate to a lot of &#34;tech/free/open-source&#34; related and free speech non-profits to the amount of about $5,000 per year but this past year I ended up paring down my choices and only donating to Archive.org, Archive.is, FSF and Sci-Hub. I still feel like Sci-Hub is the least robust of the orgs and I feel like they need most of the help. I also use it at least once a day.My only child, a 5 year old girl, has a fairly rare degenerative disease and I&#39;ve been reading the latest research on it and have been using this knowledge to inform her physician about possible treatments. She ended up in a promising drug study because I kept on top of this field and ended up talking to researchers about it. In a large part, this is thanks to Sci-Hub.Nothing in this world is free.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I see a lot of people saying this seems not a big deal, or that his leadership deserved promotion.It’s because this is a second order article. The original, most substantive source that I could find is quite thorough:https://archive.is/wqdkF&gt; &#34;He would ask us to do personal things for him,&#34; one of these people said. &#34;He said, &#39;I need you to write a briefing for me on Russian history and politics.&#39; [...] We had absolutely no work in Russia.&#34;I originally made a joke in a now-deleted comment, but then was slightly horrified to hear people excusing this behavior. So here’s a serious one: if you get locked into a prestigious institution under someone like this, run.EDIT: I should have known this would turn into a sub thread about whether it’s ok to demand an AI researcher brief an executive on Russian political history.Here’s another one: gossiping about firing someone across the entire office, before you fire them. This article says he did that. I recommend reading through it. I have to go move into our house now, so I can’t paste everything. Suffice to say, the behavior patterns were not productive.I think people want to recognize DeepMind’s eventual success. Having worked under some effective YC founders vs some Suleyman types, I’ve learned that sometimes a startup can succeed in spite of flaws. And remember, DeepMind was bought by Google. At that point they were the anointed child. Their success wasn’t guaranteed, but it wasn’t as tenuous as pre-billions Google investment."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Everyone else has given you some good advice on your messaging, so I&#39;ll give you some business/technical advice as a former Netflix employee:Try to negotiate your contracts with global streaming rights.  It shouldn&#39;t cost too much more but will make your life a lot easier as you try to expand globally.  That was one thing that slowed Netflix&#39;s global expansion -- a lot of the content was not globally licensed.You will have to develop a very robust system for identifying a user&#39;s location based on IP address as well as advanced proxy detection.  Maybe not at first, but as you move up into more &#34;Hollywood&#34; productions they will require you to show that you are protecting their content from theft.  You will also have to show that you are encrypting everything with DRM, or they won&#39;t license content to you.Don&#39;t try to stream your video from AWS.  Netflix uses AWS as the control plane but built their own CDN, and some of how they build it is publicly available:  https://openconnect.netflix.com/en/appliances/. Before they built their own CDN, they used Akamai and Level 3.Try to build your system for future white label resale.  If you&#39;re successful, maybe some Asian or Hispanic filmmakers will be interested in a platform focused on their needs.  If you build it for white labeling you could potentially resell it for them (this is how HBO started streaming, by buying what MLB had built).Here are the Netflix black content categories that I know about, but there could be more:https://www.netflix.com/browse/genre/81299227https://www.netflix.com/browse/genre/81305957Good luck!  It&#39;s a hard space to compete in, and if Netflix starts to notice you I can see them trying to copy you, but hopefully you&#39;ll be big enough by then to fend them off!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Strategically, are you trying to be a brand, a studio, a platform, an marketplace, or maybe all the above? I think the question I have is what to try to build first.As a brand, I see you trying to become a trusted provider of content for an underserved black-identifying audience with diverse tastes. To build brand first, I wonder if you don&#39;t want to put BlackOak-curated content out on existing media platforms. That could be #BlackOakRecommends on twitter.As a studio, and one competing with other producers, how will you differentiate yourselves to content creators? I guess that starts with the ability to get one&#39;s content in front of subscribers, but is there something beyond audience (which you are building), and money (which you are growing), that you can offer creators? Maybe that is access to and information about audience.As a platform, you are starting with UScreen.tv, and categorically the questions I have are how does your consumption experience road map and analytics &amp; recommendations road map line up with theirs? How will you be able to deploy your own tech relative to theirs? Analytics might differentiate you. Netflix reportedly does not share much. How might you be able (through analytics) to inform creators about audience response through your platform?  Can you use analytics uniquely to reinforce and maintain the trust of your audience - e.g., when the platform recommends a video or creator to a user, be able to answer the user&#39;s question &#34;Why am I seeing this?&#34;As a market place, you are an intermediary between content consumers and content creators. How do they to find each other and be rewarded from that - how users browse and how you recommend would be central. Maybe you license curator channels on your site. Perhaps that is in part potentially how you are able to connect creators directly to audiences, i.e. like hosted artist&#39;s pages. Perhaps the &#34;BlackOak artist&#39;s page&#34; is the place that consolidates an artist&#39;s identity, catalog and channels - twitter, instagram, twitch, etc - vs the artist&#39;s own page, youtube channel, weebly, etc. So, that&#39;s MySpace, of yore, on BlackOak.If there&#39;s a theme to all this, I would say it is how to make consumers, curators, and creators more visible in relation to a consumption experience. Ideas are cheap! good luck with everything."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve always preferred Docker for setting up databases and database-like services on a development machine because then everything is nicely isolated. i.e no need to worry about random files in /etc/foo, easy to setup many versions per project etc.This is what I&#39;ve been using for Postgres:        docker volume create postgres
        docker run -d \
          -p 127.0.0.1:5432:5432 \
          -v postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
          --name postgres \
          --restart always \
          postgres

(this one is just latest, but adding a version is trivial)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love postgres.app, such a great solution. It always bothered me though that https://postgres.app would just 404 whenever I&#39;d go to look up the docs or go to install on a new machine.Hopefully a few other people have had their lives made a tiny bit easier by the redirect I set up."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It looks nice for beginners but personally I find that a simple docker-compose file per project that spins up a postgresql container works pretty nicely and is really easy to use. I just run `docker-compose up -d` and I have a database running. Docker containers also stay out of the way of the os and I can run the right versions for whichever project."</p>
