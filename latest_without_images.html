								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"9/11 was my birthday, and I was just outside of NYC in school that day.I was in math class. The phone in the classroom rang and my teacher turned on the radio (1010 WINS) immediately. After hearing what had happened she broke down in tears because her husband worked in WTC. My parents worked in NYC (as did most of my classmates&#39; parents) and was very concerned.The school district evacuated the elementary schools to the gym at the middle school because our town had a major dam and there were concerns that could be attacked too, which would&#39;ve flooded the low-lying areas where the elementary schools are. Eventually, school was dismissed and I ended up at my neighbor&#39;s house. Her husband was a FDNY Captain.So many people I know died or were permanently harmed (physically or mentally) that day.While nearly every second of that day is permanently etched into my brain, there&#39;s one day that&#39;s even more vivid. My FDNY Captain neighbor took me to ground zero in early November 2001. I&#39;ll never, ever forget the smell of burning flesh and the hundreds of firefighters using rakes looking for human remains. He told me to never forget, and I never will."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When reviewing 9/11 attacks (likely the biggest and most disastrous intelligence failure in U.S. history, give or take Pearl Harbor), it&#39;s worth remembering that it could have been much worse.  If the first plane had hit Indian Point nuclear reactor what, 30 miles from NYC and upwind?  It&#39;s likely a Chernobyl/Fukushima disaster would have resulted with an exclusion zone well into NYC.  That was reportedly part of the plan but as I recall they wanted a more media-friendly target.Additionally, the fact that members of the Saudi government aided and assisted the hijackers, and that they were tracked and monitored by both the FBI and the CIA, yet no action was taken to stop them, not even a simple warning to airlines to increase security after that Aug 6th Presidential Daily Briefing?  What a debacle.We should have left Iraq and Afghanistan alone and done the regime change op in Saudi Arabia, except that Wall Street likes its petrodollars so Washington props up the House of Saud and its theocratic dictatorship. And that&#39;s still going on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was in the Navy and had been at my first command at a nuke base in the PNW. I walked to the galley for breakfast and they had some TVs you could watch while eating. I watched the second plane hit.
 I walked to work which was a telecommunications station. We processed messages for different regional commands and would call them directly whenever they had an emergency action message (EAM). I walked in to a completely chaotic watch floor. Every message was an EAM that day. Every phone was ringing or in use, every computer that could alarm was alarming, our dial up modems were constantly busy. All my coworkers were shouting and running here and there. I had never seen it like that and as a young Sailor it was very worrying. Everyone we called to inform them of their EAMs would ask if we knew what was going on or knew if someone was mobilizing but we were just as much in the dark as everyone else.I remember at one point our Leading Chief Petty Officer (LPCO) yelled for everyone to stop what they were doing and told us to call our parents and loved ones to let them know we were safe. That was the longest day I’d ever worked at that command and no one left that day, even those from the previous night shift. The fact that no one, even our CO, had any idea what was going on…that the military was in the dark, was such an unnerving feeling."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I write on medium [1] and I don’t think switching to a stand alone website would be good for me at all.Medium has “publications” where my work gets sent out to hundreds of readers that are reading about a topic, not necessarily from me - I’m not notable at all in the field so I’d have a rather hard time getting people to subscribe to __me__.If I were to make my own website, I’d lose a ton of discoverability.Plus, the monetization on medium is fantastic. Nowhere else would I get that return per view - I’m currently averaging around 25k views a month with a $500 return.I do have my gripes with the platform, but in my case, Medium is the worst platform for writing besides all the rest.
 [1] https://anth-oleinik.medium.com/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are two sides to this, though we often only hear one.For readers who aren&#39;t subscribed to Medium, it can be annoying. You go to read an article, and if that article is monetized, you see a banner to sign up. Plenty of people leave immediately.Now let me tell why, as a writer, I still use Medium and will continue for the time being.I only post 2-4 articles on there per month. But even then, I&#39;m seeing ~50K views per month and this month I&#39;m on track to earn $1000.To see those same results on my own blog, I would need to learn a lot about SEO, affiliate marketing, and have a large Twitter following to direct traffic to my blog. I would also need to maintain it myself.Sure, I might have a higher chance of going viral on HN, but how likely is that even anyway?As a full-time developer with a newborn who&#39;s just looking to earn some fun money, Medium is perfect. I write, submit to a publication, and they take care of the rest.People may say, &#34;I&#39;m not going to read your posts on Medium.&#34; My answer is: okay? Can&#39;t make everyone happy. But I&#39;m still getting 50K views from people who do want to read them, and I&#39;m okay with that.The other point to make is that Medium only pays for views/reads from other Medium members, so I don&#39;t necessarily care if I go viral on HN or not. If I really cared about going viral, I would just post my article to something like dev.to and then submit it to HN.If you&#39;re just looking to write and get views/go viral and don&#39;t care about money, then it might not make sense to post to Medium. But if you want to earn some money with relatively little effort, Medium is hard to beat.Edit: Here&#39;s proof of my claims for people questioning them (https://medium.com/@SunnyB/proof-of-medium-stats-700c2b0b638...). Note: it is a Medium link to an unlisted post. Didn&#39;t know where else to put it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Every nights I read through the hackernews posts of the day which didn&#39;t reach the front page for my newsletter. Every time I click on a medium posts and that I click &#34;previous&#34; the page freeze during 1-2 seconds.Therefore I have a ban on Medium posts. When medium.com is in the URL it is automatically discarded, unfortunately they offer white label domain so I happen to click on some of those links.Also I didn&#39;t do stats about it, but if you want to blog about something and do it on Medium you have a much lower chance to be featured on HN (not talking about others forum ). Choose wisely. HN is not the center of the world but there are only a few places that can offer 50k visits"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The day this number reaches 100% will be on of those before/after moments. Considering the only problem with remaining 8 titles not running is DRM/anti-cheat, it is possible that we&#39;ll see this day arrive.I usually make fun of &#34;linux on the desktop&#34; prophets by saying &#34;Yes, 90% is great but problem is that everybody uses a different 90%&#34;. But 100% of the 50 most popular games is a different thing. It is a level of compatibility that you may not even achieve on windows depending on your hardware. Of course, performance and a few bugs will exist, but compatibility will be good enough for almost everybody.I wonder if this coupled with steam deck will finally make supporting linux sustainable. I mean, a point where supporting is so cheap and the number of users is big enough that it becomes profitable to do so. If that happens, most excuses to not support linux will finally vanish away."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m very curious if we’ll start seeing a move off of windows for gaming rigs with this.  The 100 dollar premium for windows takes a big bite out of a 1000 dollar gaming rig."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A few thoughts:1) Proton labels like platinum, means how much effort you need to put for the game to run on linux. It says nothing about how well it will run. So “work on Linux” means basically that it works on Linux. It says nothing about performance. For instance I had a game labeled platinum run without effort on Arch with 50fps with constant drops to 30 ~ 25fps whereas on windows it runs at a constant 60fps with rare drops to 55/50. (Yeah, I’ve tried all variations of proton, kernel, disabled composition etc)2) In my experience people that says that they see no difference in performance between linux and windows they usually have a powerful gpu, not a medium or low end one. So if you hear on the internet people claiming that the performance is about the same, it’s highly dependent on the game and/or your system specs."</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28490278">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is more just &#34;missed optimization opportunities in EC2&#34; than a statement about mistakes in AWS as a whole.If you want to talk systemic AWS mistakes you can make, we accidentally created an infinite event loop between two Lambdas. Racked up a several-hundred-thousand dollar bill in a couple of hours. You can accidentally create this issue across lots of different AWS services if you don&#39;t verify you haven&#39;t created any loops between resources and don&#39;t configure scaling limitations where available. &#34;Infinite&#34; scaling is great until you do it when you didn&#39;t mean to.That being said, I think AWS (can&#39;t speak for other big providers) does offer a lot of value compared to bare-metal and self-hosting. Their paradigms for things like VPCs, load balancing, and permissions management are something you end up recreating in most every project anyways, so might as well railroad that configuration process. I&#39;ve experienced how painful companies that tried to run their own infrastructure made things like DB backups and upgrades that it would be hard to go back to a non-managed DB service like RDS for anything other than a personal project.After so many years using AWS at work, I&#39;d never consider anything besides Fargate or Lambda for compute solutions, except maybe Batch if you can&#39;t fit scheduled processes into Lambda&#39;s time/resource limitations. If you&#39;re just going to run VMs on EC2, you&#39;re better off with other providers that focus on simple VM hosting."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"AWS is complexity-as-a-service. This is why, as a one-man company, I went baremetal[1]. One flat price, screaming fast performance, and massive scalability if you get a beefy enough machine[2]. I don&#39;t have time to fiddle with k8s, try to figure out AWS billing/performance tradeoffs, or deal with untraceable performance issues due to noisy neighbours and VM overhead. My disaster recovery plan is a simple DB dump script to S3, and I know I can get another baremetal server up and running in less than 20 minutes.[1] with IBM Cloud 1 year free startup credits[2] Let&#39;s Encrypt and StackOverflow run their entire databases on a single beefy baremetal machine. https://letsencrypt.org/2021/01/21/next-gen-database-servers..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Biggest mistake I’ve made:Shifting any non trivial infrastructure into AWS verbatim is always more expensive than running it yourself. You need to rearchitect it carefully around the PaaS services to make a cost saving or even break even.An extreme example of this is it cousin who works for a small dev company doing LOB stuff. They moved their SQL box into EC2 and it’s costing more to run that single RDS instance than their entire legacy infra cost was per year.I’d still rather use AWS though. The biggest gain is not technology but not having to argue with several vendor sales teams or file a PO and wait for finance to approve it. All I do is click a button and the thing’s there."</p>

The lighting, the composition, the textures, the even level of detail…I would recommend everyone try it out for themselves to see what I’m talking about.

French Rust is fully compatible with English-Rust, so you can mix both at your convenience.Interesting factoid: in France, most of the stop signs say &#34;stop&#34; due to the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals linked below.In Québec, on the other hand, most of the stop signs say &#34;Arrêt&#34; due to nationalism reasons. Bilingual Arrêt/Stop signs exist, but are rare."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know this is a joke. But.. when I learnt C programming, and in order to smooth transition from algo classes to practical programming, we were told to #include a header file that would more or less do what this does for rust. The header file would also enforce curly braces and parentheses when writing loops or condition statements, as far as I remember. Fact is: it actually helped. Problem: my first foray in the industry would involve C and guess what? They used english-C (sorry no better word for it) rather then french-C. I fought for a few weeks re-learning the language."</p>

How about &#34;altérable&#34; or &#34;modifiable&#34;?). Interestingly the Result::Err variant was kept short with Résultat::Arf which is an onomatopoeia.10/10 looks very painful to use.

If ever there was a Fraud Magnet, that&#39;s it.

Could it be that the legal and regulatory and insurance systems have made it a manageable problem? Someone steals your credit card, your losses are capped.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"People are worried about the wrong stuff. SolarWinds was bad but it was likely intel operation. They wanted access to networks for intelligence purposes. They jacked it so they could access assets behind corp firewalls. Spys will always try to spy.IMHO the Kaseya hack was far worse, maybe worse than WannaCry but with better outcomes. This was a criminal operation, provided by criminal software suppliers that really was only resolved when the keys were leaked on a forum.The rumor is that local intelligence forced the disclosure of the keys (eg: guns to heads), because this is pretty much the destroy the world scenario that is unstoppable.
It is easy easy for attackers to cause billions of dollars of damage in a day.Its not getting better. It can&#39;t. Our systems are designed for large scope of trust with massive surface areas. Security is a game where the defenders cannot mess up once. Its hopelessly asymmetric and can never be better."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have a semi-related anecdote about surprises from devices.I use a CPAP. After a year, I went back to the doctor for a followup, and was asked to bring the SD card so they could review the data it collects. The device records the times and duration of use, various settings, and some metrics on breathing (apnea events, etc). I knew it recorded this stuff on an SD card.I brought the card to the appointment, but the doctor said &#34;I don&#39;t need that, I have your data here.&#34; It turns out that the CPAP contains a cellular modem, and it phones home and reports in real-time. I had no idea this thing was recording any data at all. It wasn&#39;t verbally disclosed to me by either the doctor or the equipment technicians. I imagine there&#39;s something buried in the fine print of the (long lost) documentation, possibly even in the fine print of some form I signed, but I was caught off guard and none too pleased.I&#39;ve since done some research on this and discussed it with my new doctor when it came time to get a new CPAP. The doctor acted surprised by me having a problem with it. She immediately jumped to the defense of the manufacturer and insurance company, claiming that they &#34;needed&#34; that data. She said that if I disabled it, insurance would refuse coverage.This is insanely invasive, even with disclosure, and ought to be illegal without explicit, obvious verbal and written disclosure. The insurance defense is complete bullshit. For one, I paid cash for the CPAP because I had a high-deductible insurance plan and would have had to pay out-of-pocket anyway (and never claimed it even for the deductible offset).I realize a CPAP isn&#39;t a fridge, and there&#39;s at least a case to be made for insurance enforcing compliance (at least when insurance claims are involved). I don&#39;t agree with the undisclosed enforcement mechanism, nor do I agree that treatment should be contingent on monitoring (it is for some other treatments, but not for most; no one is monitoring diet, exercise, drug use, cigarette consumption, or other risky behaviors, and threatening to withhold treatment for non-compliance).Anyway, I&#39;ve ranted enough, but there&#39;s a serious problem with the normalization of surveillance technology."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It should also have an arm on the door to slap your hand when you open it for the 41st time in a day. I mean, that&#39;s insane, you deserve a slap.Btw, this reminds me a bit of my parent&#39;s Renault that would tell me every damn time I started it to follow traffic regulations. I wish I could slap that car and it would feel it.And then there&#39;s my father-in-law&#39;s Mazda, which has a GPS system that sometimes finds him 200 km off the mark, and it keeps talking nonsense. You can&#39;t silence it because the touch screen doesn&#39;t work while driving. Yeah you can guess how that makes one feel.. like slapping it.Oh boy, I also have an Amazfit smart watch, imagine mountainbiking at high speed, you quickly want to see how many KMs you still have to go. You look at the screen and it says: &#34;PAI 50 Good Job!&#34; (full screen! Despite talking the time to make the display show you only relevant things in settings) and you need your f-king other hand (while biking) to dismiss the notification. Yup, slapping and cursing it is.Do people even use the stuff they make themselves?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Be glad it doesn&#39;t (yet) shame your eco-ignorance on Facebook, doesn&#39;t tell your insurance company you occasionally buy bacon and doesn&#39;t call the police for you infringing their intellectual property by refusing to buy new genuine filters often enough.&#34;Smart&#34; home devices which are not open-source and not under your full control are a horror. I would break it open and remove the WiFi antenna if I had no choice of buying a non-connected one.I&#39;ve bought a robo vacuum cleaner recently. Luckily there still are 100% offline models available. Unluckily they all are overly stupid, can&#39;t have lidars and map your home (while I can see no reason why this has to require Internet access and can&#39;t be implemented an autonomous way)."</p>

Was really surprised (better word-traumatized) that one flippant casual mention of not valuing my life in a private text message was enough to to get me detained by police in a facility for a night.  &#34;Doctor&#34; threatened me with drugging just because I refused to answer some of their questions and instead insisted on a lawyer.  Funny how  freedoms can be taken away so dubiously even when not charged of a crime nor arrested in a system that exists outside the criminal system.

I got sidetracked by the claim that Haldol is &#34;a powerful sedative.&#34; I understand that journalists are neither doctors nor pharmacists, but if you&#39;re reporting on a story about medical ethics, maybe know a little bit about drugs, how they work, and what the words you&#39;re using mean in a medical context.Haldol is a typical antipsychotic.  If the patient has no symptoms that indicate its use, they should absolutely not be taking it.  There&#39;s a lot of side effects.  Some may even persist after the medication is discontinued.One of these side effects is that it can be sedating.  I&#39;ve been on the patient side of a misapplied antipsychotic myself.  They can make you very tired and cause you to feel &#34;drugged&#34;.  This is not the same as a drug being a &#34;powerful sedative&#34;.  Words mean things.  Words in a medical context have specific definitions and nuance.  If you&#39;re reporting on medical malpractice, it&#39;s important to get the vocabulary correct so that the way you word something represents the truth rather than a sensationalized version of it.I can definitely believe that these people were medicated in ways that were dangerous to their health for the convenience of the staff.  However, when you call Haldol a powerful sedative, I have to assume you&#39;re either trying to make the situation sound as horrible as possible or you have no idea what you&#39;re talking about."</p>
