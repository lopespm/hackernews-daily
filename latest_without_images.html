								<p class="story__comment_others">"As an Argentinian, I can add that sadly this has been happening for years, and it appears on the news for time to time. The vessels are mainly from China, in addition to South Korea, Japan, and Spain.The economic situation of Argentina means that there are not enough funds to control de coast. So these ships go in and out at the 200 miles that limit the international waters. It’s easy to see by satellite, but hard to control with a small and under equipped coast patrol."</p>

It would have been a wonderful end to the story if you got something back for all the years of hardwork you put into running it.

I had to track it down myself for a bootstrap.sh, but I don&#39;t like using undocumented sources for critical infrastructure.My use case was needing to set the result of `hostname -f` in /etc/hosts in an automated fashion if a VPS provider didn&#39;t already add a line for the public Internet address in that file. You need to do this so that sendmail doesn&#39;t fail on `apt install` when it attempts to read your FQDN. So I couldn&#39;t use the NGINX example posted elsewhere here.It seems like https://checkip.amazonaws.com/ is much more &#34;reliable&#34; in that it is publicly documented at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-net/v3/developer-guide/s....To anyone who needs to read this: please don&#39;t use &#34;services&#34; like icanhazip for your provisioning. Even my examples above are bad.It does strike me as weird that there is seemingly no POSIX-compliant way to get your public Internet address, from my readings.Edit: Oh goodness... even Amazon&#39;s documentation recommends using Google&#39;s undocumented DNS query.[1][1]: https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/route..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"A fantastic list. I find #11 to be especially critical to one&#39;s career growth:&gt; How to give up your baby, that project that you built into something great, so you can do something elseThis is the only way to really scale oneself, while growing others in the process. Hanging on to a project indefinitely can rob you of an opportunity to tackle bigger, more challenging problems. It&#39;s so easy to get stuck on a comfortable track, feeling like (and probably being) an indispensable subject matter expert, while the bigger fish get away, often without being aware of them or having the necessary bandwidth to even consider their existence. This, in my mind, is one of the big differences between a senior and a staff engineer (where such distinctions exist).I highly recommend this article on &#34;giving away your Legos&#34;: https://review.firstround.com/give-away-your-legos-and-other.... Have shared it with many senior engineers that were looking to grow to the next level.Oh, and +1 to the author&#39;s book &#34;The Manager&#39;s Path&#34;.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From the perspective of a diesel engine tech, this is a controversial opinion, but I&#39;m absolutely glad to see this breakthrough.Lithium is a conflict resource.  its scarce, its hard to mine, and as a result so far electric cars are a fanciful plaything for what i would consider &#34;the rich.&#34;  This paves the way for electric cars that a working class mom and dad can afford to get to and from work and the store.  and of course electric trucks that have obscene amounts of torque means never &#34;getting stuck&#34; behind a slow truck ever again. it also means cleaner cities and hopefully cheaper trucking for over the road drivers and owner/operators.Ive told my coworkers and apprentices this for as long as i can remember:  expect to service elecric long-haul trucks in your lifetime.  Learn the powertrain, the dynamics, the performance characteristics and keep pace with the technology as it evolves.  Make it part of your expectation in the future, because the economic model of diesel is a last-ditch effort at best in the 21st century."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Adding another solution to the issue of mining lithium for batteries at scale is awesome, I hope they find a way to deal with the brine that this produces (Edit: it does not really produce brine in the classical sense according to the paper [0]).Maybe this process could be a way to deal with brine from seawater desalination [1] by at least removing lithium ions from the waste water. Since the ion concentration in the waste water is higher than in seawater, it should theoretically make the lithium separation process easier, shouldn&#39;t it?Another thing: combining this with cheap solar power and seawater lithium mining might be a part of a possible solution for a post-oil industry in the Gulf States? They did the tests on Red Sea seawater which has a higher salinity than most other seawater but apparantly the eastern Mediterranean matches or even surpasses that [2].[0] &#34;It is also noted that the total concentration of other salts after the first stage is less than 500 ppm, which implies that after lithium harvest, the remaining water can be treated as freshwater. Hence, the process also has a potential to integrate with seawater desalination to further enhance its economic viability&#34;, from page 5, (PDF) https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2021/ee/d1ee00354...[1] I am not linking to a particular article but this is what I am talking about: https://www.google.de/search?q=toxic+brine+seawater+drinking...[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salinity#/media/File:WOA09_sea..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They&#39;re still at the bench-top stage with this, from the pictures. This is something that ought to work, since lithium is commercially extracted from denser brines.[1] Extraction from seawater is quite possible but not yet cost-effective. So cost is the big question. This is the usual problem when articles announcing &#34;cheap and easy&#34; come from the surface-chemistry crowd.The authors write &#34;a preliminary economic analysis shows that the process can be made profitable when coupled with the chlor-alkali industry.&#34; So they apparently want to run this off of the reject stream from a plant that extracts chlorine and sodium hydroxide from brine. Running this downstream of a chlor-alkali plant means somebody else already has a brine source and a way to get rid of all the rejected brine. This sort of thing is common. A lot of rare mineral extraction is done as part of a process that extracts a less-rare mineral.Profitability is going to turn on all the usual problems with membrane systems - how long does the membrane last, how often does it have to be backwashed, what parts in the system corrode, and similar routine engineering problems. That&#39;s usually the hard part.[1] https://www.samcotech.com/is-it-possible-to-extract-lithium-..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a little disappointed in the conclusion because there are more secure password managers out there that still offer the same level of convenience as the browser built-in password manager. Yes, if you use a password manager that&#39;s implemented entirely as a browser extension, you may as well use the browser&#39;s built-in password management features. However, if you&#39;re an advanced user and are comfortable using a separate password management application, there are options out there that don&#39;t force you to choose between a difficult-to-use app and the convenience of something in-browser.For example, exploiting a browser-based password manager likely means escaping the sandbox that contains web pages and accessing the shadow DOM. But this is still a larger surface area than 1Password, where the password selection menu (on Windows at least...) is actually rendered by an entirely separate process on the system. (I.e., clicking the icons that the extension displays triggers the 1Password desktop application to display UI at the cursor&#39;s current position. Picking a password from this UI will transmit it to the browser extension for filling. The password is only present in the browser&#39;s memory once you&#39;ve interacted with the desktop application&#39;s UI.)As always, do your research. Don&#39;t get suckered into paying a subscription fee for a browser extension that offers the same functionality your browser has built-in. But realize that there are other options out there that may actually be worth investing in.Disclaimer: I&#39;ve been a happy 1Password customer for a few years now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This somewhat overlooks the main threat model that password managers solve - leaked credentials.People can’t remember 80 passwords so they reuse the same one, that password eventually gets leaked and 9/10 times it doesn’t get leaked due to a targeted attack or a compromised machine but rather due to a breach of a service you signed up too.Sure password managers have issues, they don’t solve user related errors and can even add to the attack surface of a machine they are running on but that’s really not important...Using password managers and generating different passwords for each service reduces the blast radius from any breach.This is why I don’t care if the password manager has the best encryption, or does it even encrypts at all or does it uses the clipboard vs some more secure side channel. Yeah that’s nice but that’s not in my threat model.Which is why I don’t care if your password manager is a spreadsheet, it’s a terrible choice for a business because their threat landscape and the fact that a spreadsheet won’t allow you to audit who has access to what but for you or your mom even that is better than using the same password everywhere else.Heck at home print your passwords and store them somewhere safe... put them on a post note for all I care as long as you live alone or at least not with anyone you wouldn’t want stumbling on that list..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As it looks like Tavis isn&#39;t hanging out and responding to comments here, I thought it&#39;d be worth linking to a question and response he gave on Twitter as most comments revolve around this point.&gt; @diractelda: Based on your thoughts, it seems a more accurate statement is &#34;Don&#39;t use a password manager that interacts with your browser automatically unless it&#39;s the built in password system. Non-integrated password stores are fine.&#34;&gt; @tavis: Yep, that&#39;s a fair summary, I was just trying to be punchyhttps://twitter.com/taviso/status/1401253440622235649?s=20"</p>

Luckily, I had written the course notes (basically a textbook) in latex.I consulted with the student and saw how the reader worked. All was fine, but it was slow because it said e.g. &#34;backslash begin open brace equation close brace&#34;, so I made a perlscript to remove backslash and braces (and a few other things) and then it all worked really well.People, especially those who don&#39;t use mathematics much, think latex is hard for humans.

The article seems to suggest so, but provides no citations indicating that. Were the scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virology publishing their research to general acclaim up until now? Given how little we know about it, doesn&#39;t seem so. Are these scientists driven by the same invectives as western university research academics? They&#39;re probably state employees on stable contracts for a start, not the PhD students and itinerant PostDocs of the university system, who are the main players of the Science Game.I don&#39;t know the answers to these questions, but the article would be more persuasive if it did."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used to work in one of the top fMRI labs. The comments about The Science Game are spot on. The vast majority of scientists, by the time they&#39;re midway through their postdocs, just want to do whatever research will get them a professorship and some grants. Actual knowledge generation is a distant second to keeping the ball bouncing by getting out papers and getting in grants."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; .. may one day pose similar risks due to the run-away prestige games scientists play.It is happening in front of our eyes. From where should we start.(1) Responsible AI, but the outcomes didn&#39;t challenge AI research enough to stop some of the practices. I would avoid commenting on what happened at Google AI recently, but I would say that most of the AI-based solutions that are deployed at large scale can be challenged.(2) paperswithcode.com solved this issue. Back in the day, we would re-implement models that we see in the paper. When we email authors, we will always figure that an RA implemented the solution and s/he left.(4) Rich is becoming richer. There is a phenomena in academia to blindly trust those who are in good labs. I have seen many papers that are great coming from these labs, but there are bad papers as well. we shouldn&#39;t just blindly trust ppl.(5) Review process is broken. Review is a voluntarily work for professors, and imho it shouldn&#39;t. In industrial R&amp;D, reviews are one of the most important things as part of the work. Some of our PRs takes days.(6) All recommendation engines are black-boxes. I don&#39;t know what YT or FB recommend to a kid and whether this is aligned with some of our values. If s/he accidentally watch something bad, we noticed that their timeline is full by the same ideas. In our spare time, we tried to check if we can influence this behavior as a user. I figured that all of our recommendations engines are black-boxes. I don&#39;t know why we don&#39;t challenges. I hacked an App to fetch data, new, feed and run it through recommendation engine and started customizing what I can read.(7) It&#39;s 2021, most of good papers are coming from industrial labs."</p>
