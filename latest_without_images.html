								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Seems their website couldn&#39;t t handle being on the front page.
I found them on github https://github.com/widelands/widelands where it&#39;s described as:
&#34;Widelands is a free, open source real-time strategy game with singleplayer campaigns and a multiplayer mode. The game was inspired by Settlers II™ (© Bluebyte) but has significantly more variety and depth to it.&#34;It makes me quite excited. I really loved settlers II and I am waiting curiously for the next release of the settlers saga, as I haven&#39;t liked the follow-ups. The next instalment is said to be more like settlers II again. Maybe this open and free game is all I really wanted? 
I will try it out!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think most game styles do not fit the &#34;open source&#34; development model. Mainly because games often need a &#34;surprise effect&#34; when released and that is a poorly fit for open development and also because it is easier to contribute code than convince an artist to contribute art tailored to a very specific style.RTS and games like Wesnoth are an exception: they are born a certain way and slowly evolve through contributions to a point where they sometimes finally became very interesting. I have high hopes for the future of 0ad."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To those here riffing on the theme of “this misrepresents the volume and beneficiaries of the transactions involved” - you’re not wrong. Accurate representation of public info like this is a top organisational problem for our species at the moment.But I do think you miss the point, so aptly put by Mr Eisenhower:“Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed. This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children. The cost of one modern heavy bomber is this: a modern brick school in more than 30 cities. It is two electric power plants, each serving a town of 60,000 population. It is two fine, fully equipped hospitals. It is some fifty miles of concrete pavement. We pay for a single fighter with a half-million bushels of wheat. We pay for a single destroyer with new homes that could have housed more than 8,000 people. . . . This is not a way of life at all, in any true sense. Under the cloud of threatening war, it is humanity hanging from a cross of iron.”In a strictly limited sense, I’d rather get my cross of iron at 66% off than for the full $6.4T. Better yet would be universal healthcare, enough homes to go round, clean, sustainable energy production systems, and bridges that keep on bridging."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"“Medicare for all”, the single payer universal healthcare system in the US, was projected to cost between $16-34T [1] over a decade. I know there are some big questions around the actual cost of US aggression / state terrorism since 9/11 (ie 6.4T vs 2T as per other entries in this thread). A rough 80/20 analysis suggests:* We could have funded free healthcare to roughly one quarter of the US population for 10 years (see [1])
* We could have funded free medication for all US citizens for 20 years (assuming US spends an average $1100/yr per patient, approx double of other countries [2], viz a biz the estimated spend of $1K USD / yr per US citizen spent over 20 years on aggression since 9-11 mentioned above)
* …I quite like the following quote by Noam Chomsky on US international terror in Afghanistan (and Nicaragua, Iraq, Sudan and many other places):“ The U.S. is officially committed to what is called “low–intensity warfare.” That’s the official doctrine. If you read the definition of low–intensity conflict in army manuals and compare it with official definitions of “terrorism” in army manuals, or the U.S. Code, you find they’re almost the same. Terrorism is the use of coercive means aimed at civilian populations in an effort to achieve political, religious, or other aims. That’s what the World Trade Center bombing was, a particularly horrifying terrorist crime. And that’s official doctrine. I mentioned a couple of examples. We could go on and on. It’s simply part of state action, not just the U.S. of course.” [3]It sums up the meaninglessness quite well.[1] https://www.crfb.org/blogs/how-much-will-medicare-all-cost
[2] https://data.oecd.org/healthres/pharmaceutical-spending.htm#...
[3] https://monthlyreview.org/2001/11/01/the-united-states-is-a-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Perhaps they should&#39;ve spent this much on medical research instead.  For the same money perhaps we could save a few million people dying of various diseases or cancer.  It would take a whole lot of terrorist events to counter the benefits of significant R&amp;D funding for medicine (or maybe a lot of other things)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love these text-based languages for music composition. Its something that is approaching a gap in music composition in real-life vs via computer. In real-life you can tell your bandmates to &#34;just play a I V IV in C&#34; and they get it. But we are still not quite at a place where we can tell a computer that exact phrase and get something useful. I love how close these text-based languages are getting though!I&#39;ve actually made my own musical language too - called miti [1], which is just one of many others including textbeat [2], foxdot [3], sonic-pi [4], chuck [5], and melrose [6]. Each has their own goals and capabilities.- [1] https://github.com/schollz/miti- [2] https://github.com/flipcoder/textbeat- [3] https://foxdot.org/- [4] https://sonic-pi.net/- [5] https://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/- [6] https://github.com/emicklei/melrose"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sorry to be a downer here, but can someone explain to me what the appeal of these projects are? In the past year or so I&#39;ve seen a number of text-based music notation projects hit the front page of Hacker News and don&#39;t really understand the purpose they are trying to achieve.If I want to transport music notation between software programs, I have MIDI for that, which does a good job of capturing all elements of a performance (keys, timing, velocity, pedals, aftertouch, etc.) These types of notation formats almost always fail to achieve MIDIs precision across all the aspects of a performance.If I want to compose music, I need a format that makes it easy to visualize and manipulate notes in context of the other notes playing across all instruments. DAW piano rolls do a fantastic job of overlaying note information, and traditional combined scores do the same too. Again, text notation usually falls flat here - for example, if you had a large ensemble, and wanted to know which chord was being played on the 2nd beat of the 5th measure, how easily can do you do that? How do you determine if it&#39;s an open spacing or closed spacing? How do you determine the root without walking back through all the octave shifts?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"MacOS won&#39;t let me run alda by default, and I&#39;m not sure they&#39;re wrong. There is an open source alda project, but these are binaries downloaded from alda.io. Who vouches for them?"</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28203654">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What&#39;s funny about having to rely on unauthorized clones to provide a fast native UX was that Spotify&#39;s original client back in 2008 started out as beautifully light, custom rendered native client.Few Apps ever had that wow factor the first time I used it, it was so much lighter and more responsive than anything else of the day. I remember being perplexed at how I could search and skip to any part of a song quicker than iTunes could looking at a local library. Everything was latency-free and instantaneous.We were building a Music Startup at the time, so we investigated how it worked. We we’re very surprised we couldn’t find any evidence of an established UI toolkit. It looked as though they had built their own custom UI renderer and optimized TCP protocol which sent back its metadata in XML. Their traffic looked like it was initially seeded from their own (or CDN) servers (for best latency) and then overtime we would see some P2P traffic on the wire.Our QT/C++ client had decent performance but was noticeably heavier than Spotify&#39;s. I was disappointed to see their native client eventually be abandoned and succumb to become yet another Chromium wrapper. I expect it fell to the pressures of a growing startup adding 100s of developers (without the skill of their original CTO/devs) where a native UI couldn&#39;t be updated and re-iterated as fast as a Web App. I wish they maintained 2 desktop clients, and left their native client alone to just be an audio player and push all their new social features to their new flagship CEF app.It&#39;s unfortunate the skill and desire of building fast native UIs are being lost to Electron and CEF wrappers. Seems the larger the organization the more likely they are to build new Web rendered Desktop Apps and we have to rely on unauthorized Indie efforts like this for fast, responsive native UIs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At this point, I&#39;d be willing to pay for a Spotify client that works exactly the same, but just ignores the existence of podcasts entirely. I use a dedicated podcast client when I want to listen to podcasts, and they keep shoving them in my face and taking up precious UI real estate everywhere.But any client without support for Spotify Connect might as well be dead to me. Controlling my wifi speakers from my phone, or playing music on my desktop Mac from my laptop or gaming PC is critical functionality at this point."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am definitely going to check this out. I use the Spotify snap under Ubuntu as I never got Spotify client working when I upgraded to the lastest Ubuntu and they keep working on the main stable. I do not hate the UI of Spotify but having alternatives is really nice. I also have Spot installed. It is also a simple and native application to listen to your music. I am a very heavy Spotify user. We have a family subscription so my kids have their own premium. Last year I listened to 60K songs; I really like the yearly review BTW. Yesterday I was talking to my wife and we just swallowed the pill completely and we will be throwing out our CD collection to make room for a new cabinet (I currently own around 1000 CD&#39;s)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I disagree with the idea that SPF, DKIM and DMARC are somehow hard. They&#39;re all one-liners in DNS config that can easily be generated with some online tools if you don&#39;t want to read the standard. In my experience, correctly configuring mail server software is a lot harder than configuring the DNS to make your email arrive as reliably as possible. Obscure configuration formats are par for the course for almost every mail server setup.I&#39;ve personally had a much harder time getting DNSSEC to work than I ever had issues with the various email DNS records. Even that is manageable if you&#39;re willing to Google around for a while.My solution to getting self-hosted email right is using Mailcow. A cheap VPS (Contabo FTW) plus Docker is all you need to get it to work, and it spits out all the DNS records you might need to add. That also includes autoconfig records for tons of software, which is nice."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Normally, this means that spf.messagingengine.com has its own SPF DNS record, which will probably list some valid IP addresses that emails can be sent from. There&#39;s also one for Mandrill, for transactional emails. You can have as many of these as you want.This isn&#39;t strictly true (that you can have as many as you want), because SPF has a (IMO) very silly hard limit of 10 DNS lookups per record. From RFC 7208:&gt; Some mechanisms and modifiers (collectively, &#34;terms&#34;) cause DNS queries at the time of evaluation, and some do not.  The following terms cause DNS queries: the &#34;include&#34;, &#34;a&#34;, &#34;mx&#34;, &#34;ptr&#34;, and &#34;exists&#34; mechanisms, and the &#34;redirect&#34; modifier.  SPF implementations MUST limit the total number of those terms to 10 during SPF evaluation, to avoid unreasonable load on the DNS.  If this limit is exceeded, the implementation MUST return &#34;permerror&#34;.We see this not infrequently at Fastmail, when customers report DMARC validation problems, and the answer turns out to be that they&#39;ve got too many includes in their SPF records, so SPF always fails."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s another angle to the App Store scam: Family Sharing.Most people don&#39;t know this but the &#34;Parent&#34; (read:credit card holder) of a family sharing account can&#39;t see, let alone cancel, any subscriptions a minor on the account has purchased.Let that sink in for a second. Apple will happily charge the parents&#39; credit card a weekly recurring fee but there is nowhere in their interface (on device nor on the web) where the parent can even see that subscription.[0]Apple expects the child to go into their interface and cancel the recurring subscription. Something many (most?) adults find confusing. In my case, the child just deleted the App when the trial was over. Which is of course perfectly logical thinking. No bueno.So if the child is away at school (as in my case), or the phone gets left at a friend&#39;s house, or worse... stolen. The only way to get it cancelled is to call them.There&#39;s more to this story, including details on how the built in parental controls are intentionally crippled (IMHO) but I&#39;ve got to run. In summary: The entire &#34;Family Sharing&#34; system is built to rip off people while still maintaining plausible deniability.[0] A senior Apple rep told me this is for privacy reasons. But two things: the minor should have no expectation of privacy when spending their parents money (how is that a good thing?). And secondly, Apple does email a receipt for the subscription to the card holder... so the privacy excuse was pure bullshit. In my case I missed the email because I have more than 6 or 7 recurring Apple subscriptions. I do take partial blame because of that. But I&#39;ve still not been given a good reason why a parent can&#39;t easily cancel a childs subscription."</p>

But it&#39;s nice to be able to install the software I choose to on my phone without having to have Apple or Google&#39;s approval.Unlike iOS there&#39;s no complicated jailbreak required, I can&#39;t remember if you even have to enable developer mode (an easy supported thing). And there&#39;s a reasonable ecosystem of safe alternative app stores. F-Droid mostly, APKMirror also comes in handy for things that have disappeared.I understand the value of a curated app store.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Right. As I&#39;ve pointed out previously, Tesla seems to be unable to detect sizable stationary obstacles that are partly blocking a lane, especially if they don&#39;t look like the rear end of a car. In addition to emergency vehicles, Teslas on autopilot have plowed into freeway barriers and a street sweeper. That&#39;s the usual situation for first responders, who usually try to block as little of the road as possible but often don&#39;t have enough shoulder space.It&#39;s clear what Tesla really has - a good lane follower and cruise control that slows down for cars ahead. That&#39;s a level 2 system. That&#39;s useful, but, despite all the hype about &#34;full self driving&#34;, it seems that&#39;s all they&#39;ve got.&#34;Full self driving&#34; just adds some lane-changing assistance and hints from the nav system."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is why I believe the approach of incremental improvement towards full self driving is fundamentally flawed. These advanced driver assist tools are good enough to lull users into a false sense of security. No amount of &#34;but our terms and conditions say you need to always pay attention!&#34; will overcome human nature building that trust and dependence."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of people in here saying it is not possible to drive safely with partial self driving.  I wonder, how many of those people have actually driven a car with autopilot?I have autopilot on my car, and it definitely makes me a better and safer driver.  It maintains my distance from the car in front and my speed while keeping me in my lane, so my brain no longer has to worry about those mundane things.  Instead I can spend all my brainpower focused on looking for potential emergencies, instead of splitting time between lane keeping/following and looking for emergencies.I no longer have to look at my speedometer or the lane markers, I can take a much broader view of the traffic and conditions around me.Before you say it&#39;s impossible to be safe driving with an assistive product, I suggest trying one out."</p>

They are now crunching that data to improve retail layouts, marketing pitches, etc and there is growing market of selling aggregates of that data across merchants."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This to me is part of a general trend wherein only those with the awareness and resources required will have privacy.For example, if you do have the funds, send a private shopper. But an even more direct example is skipping the discounts associated with club cards for privacy reasons.This will further entrench the class divide between the wealthy and the rest of us."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The October before covid me and Mrs. Asciimov went on a cruse with Royal Caribbean.  We got dropped off at the port, put our luggage in the loading area, and proceeded to walk inside, all without talking to anyone.Not 30 seconds after walking into the Port Building, a RCL rep walked up and greeted me and the mrs by first name. Said please walk this way, I have you all checked in, you just need to go through the returning voyagers boarding line. (metal detector/contraband check)To be honest it was both creepy to have them just know who I was, and kinda awesome to get to skip the regular check in step. I asked the lady how she knew who we were, she told us that between the cameras in the port and the photos we submitted during the cruise purchase they knew who we where, and the information pops up on their tablet when they are assigned the next customer."</p>
