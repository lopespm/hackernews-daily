								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I own the house I currently live in because of a script I wrote.We had been looking for a new build for some time and had settled on a development and specific house we wanted to buy, but it was still months away from being released. We were told they released houses in person first, then listed them online later that day, but I was bored and wanted to see when new houses were listed, so I wrote a scraper to alert me whenever a new house became available.One day, we got a call from the property developer telling us the house we were interested in would be available in person from 10am the next day. Because we wanted to be certain to get it, we appeared at 8am, only to find that 3 other people were already waiting. Houses are released in batches of 2 or 3, so whilst we weren&#39;t hopeful, we joined the queue and waited.At 9am, while waiting in line, I got an alert telling me that the house had been released online, so I open their website on my phone and paid the deposit.At 10am, when the sales office opened, all hell broke loose as the person first in line (waiting since 5am...) discovered the house they wanted had already been reserved online. I&#39;d effectively stolen his house. It was awkward to say the least as all of us were crammed into a tiny portacabin while this unfolded.In truth, I felt awful for depriving him of the house he and his family wanted, but relieved that we had reserved the house we wanted after a 5 month wait. A few weeks later the developer got in touch to say that they had changed their policy nationwide and would only be releasing houses online in the future because of &#34;the incident&#34;...Whilst I wasn&#39;t willing to give up our reservation, I worked with the person who had wanted our house so that they were alerted whenever a similar house in the same development became available. He got one, there&#39;s no hard feelings, and him and his family are now my next door neighbours."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One I did when I was much younger was after a trip to a Cracker Barrel restaurant.  They have these golf tee peg games (triangle shaped board with holes and golf tees inserted).  There are rules for doing jumps and removing pegs, with the goal of getting down to 1 peg remaining.So I went home, fired up basica on my PCjr, and wrote a brute-force solver for it.  Turns out there something like tens of thousands of possible solutions.Then it became a challenge, to filter out duplicates (each solution appears 3 times if you apply it to the board with each 120 degree rotation, plus you have mirrors of these, etc).  Was an amazing feeling for a youngster getting into computers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wrote a program to distribute my lecture slides to my students in real time.When I was a University Professor, I taught Theory of Computing (among other classes).  I did not want to maintain two sets of slides (fill-in-the-blank style), and I didn&#39;t want the students to have to write non-stop during the lecture, so I wrote a couple of programs to distribute the slides in real time during the lecture.Part 1: C++.  A program ran on my computer.  When I pressed a button, it took a screen shot of my chosen monitor and sent it to my server.  Communication via websockets.Part 2: Browser. Students connected to my server at the start of class.  As I lectured, the slides appeared in their browser automatically.  Of course, they could click through all previous slides (for that day as well as previous lectures), but if they were not actively browsing the slides, then the newest slide presented itself to them automatically.  (Technically, it was always one slide behind, because I would not release a slide until I was done talking about it.)  Communication via websockets. It worked in lectures attended by 100+ students.Part 3: NodeJS. My server received screenshots from me (as well as some metadata), kept a small database of all past lectures/screenshots, and served a browsable interface to the students.  It routed all the websocket connections so that everything &#34;just worked&#34;TM.I thought it was cool.  The students complained that the slides were not searchable like a PDF.  I directed them to the index of the textbook."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was also once dissed by Steve Jobs at a keynote!Back when widgets first came out for OS X I was in college and was beginning to learn programming. I was sill very bad, but these widgets interested me because they were essentially just little HTML/CSS/JS webpages. I looked around and saw there was no widget for CNN news.CNN had RSS feeds of their news, I found some other widget that displayed an RSS feed and basically just plugged this new data source in and it worked! Next I just restyled it to look like it the CNN website which at the time was light blue and pretty ugly, but I made this widget to match.I released it, and it got some downloads! Months later at the WWDC keynote, I was watching live and I saw Steve sit down at the demo computer and show off some widgets on the big screen. The CNN widget I made was there on screen at the keynote! I didn&#39;t believe it at first, I was in shock. Next though, when he showed my widget his only comment was that &#34;it&#39;s not as nice looking as [some other news widget] but it gets the job done.&#34;Ouch! Not only was Steve Jobs personally aware of a piece of software I (kind of) wrote but he demoed it at WWDC! But he also said it looked pretty bad... And he was right, it did.Shortly after this I restyled the widget to look nice on its own, regardless of what the CNN website actually looked like. While this stung, it was a good design lesson to learn. Thanks Steve!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked at AT&amp;T in the late 1990s on an early music sales (not streaming) service called a2b Music. It sounds ridiculous now (why would AT&amp;T think they could succeed in consumer-facing music sales!) but at the time they were a co-owner of the AAC patents and wanted to commercialize them. They also had lots of bandwidth and thought this made sense.Being &#34;responsible&#34; folks (and also having no choice in the matter) AT&amp;T bent over backward to accommodate the labels. Half the product was proprietary DRM that made everything constantly unusable. Despite this, the labels still strangled us by limiting what we could sell. Apple quite correctly ignored all of this and solved the problem by first launching the iPod, waiting until it had critical mass (much of which involved tons of unpaid MP3 downloading) and then launching the iTunes Store in 2003 when they had an installed base full of piracy - and the major labels had no choice but to join on their terms. (Obviously I pity the small labels who got screwed in the dynamic.)I think about this a lot when people complain about cryptocurrency or Uber/Lyft evading regulations or destroying legacy businesses. Often this kind of behavior is bad, often the little guy gets crushed. But at the end of the day, legacy businesses really are poison and much of the awfulness could be avoided if they weren&#39;t trying to hold on to things so tightly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I flew home that night, posted my meeting notes on my website, emailed all of my clients to announce the news, and went to sleep.&gt;When I woke, I had furious emails and voicemails from my contact at Apple.&gt;“What the hell are you doing? That meeting was confidential! Take those notes off your site immediately! Our legal department is furious!”Wait, who the hell posts meeting notes on their website (and also emails all their clients without a written confirmation at the said meeting)? I would assume any meeting you&#39;d have with a client/potential would be assumed to be confidential. I felt this particular move was very unprofessional on the OP&#39;s part."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"You all joke that this doesn’t happen in practice, but something like this literally just bit me and it took me a few too many minutes to figure out what was going on.I use a bash script as my BROWSER which calls another bash script to launch or communicate with my browser that I run inside a container. The script that my BROWSER script calls has some debug output that it prints to stderr.I use mutt as my email client and urlscan [0] to open URLs inside emails. Urlscan looks at my BROWSER environment variable and thus calls my script to open whatever URL I target. Some time recently, the urlscan author decided to improve the UX by hiding stderr so that it wouldn’t pollute the view, and so attempted to pipe it to `/dev/null`. I guess their original code to do this wasn’t quite correct and it ended up closing the child processes’ stderr.*I generally use `set -e` (errexit) because I want my scripts to fail if any command fails (I consider that after an unhandled failure the script’s behavior is undefined, some other people disagree and say you should never use `set -e` outside of development, but I digress). My BROWSER scripts are no exception.While my scripts handle non-zero returns for most things that can go wrong, I never considered that writing log messages to stdout or stderr might fail. But it did, which caused the script to die before it was able to launch my browser. For a few weeks I wasn’t able to use urlscan to open links. I was too lazy to figure out what was wrong, and when I did it took me a while because I looked into every possibility except this one.Luckily this wasn’t a production app. But I know now it could just as feasibly happen in production, too.I opened an issue[1] and it was fixed very quickly. I love open source!*No disrespect to urlscan, it’s an awesome tool and bugs happen to all of us![0]: https://github.com/firecat53/urlscan[1]: https://github.com/firecat53/urlscan/issues/122"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m disappointed. I expected some obscure edgecase (like “Main is usually a function…” [1]) but instead that’s about scope handling, contract design and responsibility shift.“Hello world” method simply calls an API to a text interface. It uses simple call, to a simple interface that is expected to be ever present. I don’t find any bug there. It won’t work if such interface isn’t available, is blocked or doesn’t exist. It won’t work on my coffee grinder nor on my screwdriver. It won’t work on my Arduino because there is no text interface neither.Of course, one could argue that user might expect you to handle that error. That’s all about contracts and expectation. How should I deal with that? Is the “Hello world” message such important that the highest escalated scenario should be painted on the sky? I can imagine an awkward social game where we throw each other obscure challenges and call it a bug.It’s nitpicking that even such simple code might fail and I get it. It will also fail on OOM, faulty hardware or if number of the processes on the machine hit the limit. Maybe some joker replaced bindings and it went straight to 3D printer which is out of material? _My expectations_ were higher based on the title.Now allow me to excuse myself, I need to write an e-mail to my keyboard manufacturer because it seems like it has a bug which prevents it from working when slightly covered in liquid coffee.[1]: http://jroweboy.github.io/c/asm/2015/01/26/when-is-main-not-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Enjoyable read for sure, but i think the question whether ot not this constitutes a bug or not is open for interpretation.IMHO, it doesn&#39;t.hello.c is written in a way that makes it very clear that the program doesn&#39;t care about error conditions in any way shape or form; the return value of printf is ignored, the output isn&#39;t flushed, the return of flushing isn&#39;t checked, noone looks at errno; ...so anything happening that could go wrong will go unreported, unless its something the OS can see (segfault, permission, etc.)If I expect a program to do something (eg. handle IO errors) that its code says very clearly that it doesn&#39;t, that&#39;s not the programs fault."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Blender is shaping up to be the best open source project I&#39;ve seen in my 20 years of tech, and I&#39;m comparing this with many other large ones I&#39;ve used, like Linux kernel or various distros, FreeBSD, Kubernetes and so on. They do everything so well, even the releases, I think it beats the paid competition now or will soon do in feature parity and ease of use. As of Blender 2.8 the UI is fantastic.This update comes with many geometry node improvements which continue the trend of making Blender the premium non-destructive modelling solution. I&#39;m in particular interested in seeing how 6900 XT and regular M1 (in Mac mini form) will perform under Metal with 3.1 and macOs 12.3. I was a long time Radeon VII user on Mac but before 3.0 the stability and performance was just not there so I&#39;ve moved my Blender experiments to Windows and Nvidia which works spectacularly but I&#39;m not fussed about booting win just for Blender. Sadly I don&#39;t think AMD is bringing HIP for their older, pre-6000 GPUs https://code.blender.org/2021/11/next-level-support-for-amd-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I genuinely think Blender is my single favorite piece of software I&#39;ve ever used, especially the latest few versions. While it&#39;s always been a powerful piece of software, the past 3 or 4 major releases (really everything since 2.8 actually) have just been nonstop UX improvement on top of ridiculous amounts of thoughtfully implemented new features."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The more awesome Blender gets, the more jealous I am that it&#39;s not designed for CAD.I keep wondering if FreeCAD will eventually make these kinds of strides, or if it&#39;s better to try getting Blender to do CAD-likes stuff.  I know there is a bit of CAM-like stuff floating around for Blender.  But I&#39;m always afraid that this will come up short in the long run, due to Blender&#39;s fundamentally mesh-based nature."</p>

They will likely look to limit their bet (on Russia) for fear of becoming Russia 2.0 to the West. [1]The tweet is from Neil Cybart and WSJ. You may know him as one of the more accurate Apple analysts. And most people still to this day think either China miscalculated it, or China&#39;s official stance is somewhat unclear. ( Paul Graham )And as usual, Benedict Evans has much better take on the situation. Mostly likely because of his major in History.[1] https://twitter.com/neilcybart/status/1500825861242724352"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Had the same issue with my first startup. 50:50 split, no agreement in place for the eventuality of a founder disagreement or one founder leaving the company. We were able to negotiate an acceptable solution but emotionally it was quite draining and it tarnished a good relationship/friendship. Also, in the end the company was not worth much, so in retrospect much quibble and stress about nothing.I think the problem is that in the eyes of a founder their company is always worth a lot, as they tend to see the potential instead of the status quo. That said trying to leave a company that isn&#39;t profitable while keeping a 50 % stake and offloading the job of getting to profitability to your co-founder is pretty toxic. Asking to retain a small stake depending on the duration of your tenure seems reasonable though. For a bootstrapped company I think a 4-6 year vesting schedule is reasonable, though it highly depends on the situation of the company. Some businesses are still nowhere near profitable or stable after 4 years, so they won&#39;t survive one founder leaving with 50 % of the shares as it will make future investment highly unlikely (most VCs would never touch a company with a 50 % shareholder that has already left) and will destroy the morale of the remaining founders (as they will often think that half of their work will go towards someone who no longer contributes in a meaningful way to the company)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s funny. I read the article and do not arrive at the same obvious/apparent conclusion the auther theirself does about Cassidy&#39;s position being reasonable, merely legal.To me the reasonable thing to do is if you want to get out then get out, sell back your stake. If you want to stay in then stay in, work on the project full time or work out some new plan where all stakeholders agree to switch to day jobs and put this into hobby mode.But if you just want to maintain a stake to collect rent, and demand cash that doesn&#39;t even exist, seriously F that guy. The only reason he&#39;s in the legal right to be this douchy is because they failed to write their &#39;pre-nup&#39; properly, not because he&#39;s actually in the right and his position and expectations are reasonable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"ElementaryOS is leaving a lot of money on the table.The reason is that they have an established user base, and there is an app store, which is very curated.People would be more than willing to pay for apps on that app store.Not so many developers are willing, though. The thing is, to publish on the app store, the source code must be publicly available on for instance, github.If they allowed app developers to sell truly commercial software, ElementaryOS could be a self growing machine, and they could give away the OS for &#34;free&#34; and keep the OS open source.Maybe it&#39;s not as &#34;pure&#34; as what they are doing now, but on the other hand they could reach so many more people if they had more monetary resources."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are plenty of Russians on Youtube commenting under pleas posted by Ukrainians asking them to help stop the war. And there are plenty of videos taken by people on the ground in Ukraine that show what&#39;s going on.Lots of Russians actually believe that the strikes are precision and only aimed at the military targets. There&#39;s a video recorded by a woman in Mykolaiv walking among the rubble and cursing at her Russian relatives for not believing her while her city is literally under shelling.But due to the way Youtube works, the Russian users are not very likely to come across those videos. Ukrainian Youtube users are trying to interact with them by replying with links to the videos.If somebody from Youtube is reading this, I understand that you need to curb spammers who post a lot. But if you could somehow help with this effort, it might actually help change the public opinion in Russia. Maybe figure out a way to let the Ukrainians interact with the Russian commenters without getting shadowbanned?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been thinking about how to get through to more Russian people, and its something I&#39;ve had a lot of success doing with many people that live in an alternate reality, where we cannot even agree on perception.Censorship and speech restrictions aside, many Russians really think this is a peacekeeping mission that has no bloodshed. Adding to frustration of Ukrainian residents calling their own family members in Russia about whats going on, and still get denial in response.One thing I&#39;ve been thinking about doing is... agreeing with them? Call it a &#34;special military operation&#34;, and then tell them it&#39;s not working. The world is reacting to the special military operation. The timing of the special military operation is not in Russia&#39;s favor and its causing more harm than benefit, in both Russia and in Ukraine.The semantics are designed to derail the conversation at the beginning. &#34;Ah we&#39;re being bombed indiscriminately in this war of russian aggression&#34;, the Russian&#39;s immediate reaction is &#34;wait, no that&#39;s CGI, that&#39;s the Ukrainians bombing themselves, its exactly why you need help&#34;, instead just play along! &#34;Everything&#39;s A-OK but you still need ...... to dismantle your leadership for failing to get more allies in this operation or putting it off until more support was achieved.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Linked from Tufte’s article, I found this interesting comment from someone’s experience at Microsoft: [1]&gt; Attempting to have slides serve both as projected visuals and as stand-alone handouts makes for bad visuals and bad documentation. Yet, this is a typical, acceptable approach. PowerPoint (or Keynote) is a tool for displaying visual information, information that helps you tell your story, make your case, or prove your point. PowerPoint is a terrible tool for making written documents, that&#39;s what word processors are for.I think that’s on point for many companies. A lot of the terrible slides you see in meetings are actually intended as documentation after the fact, and few people recognize (or care) that this makes for a terrible presentation.Ironically, I think Powerpoint isn’t such a bad tool for creating handouts. If the intended reader reads the document on their screen instead of printing it, a nice PDF with screen-shaped pages might actually be close to optimal.You just have to be 100% clear whether you’re creating a document or a presentation.[1] http://mamamusings.net/archives/2005/11/19/the_culture_of_th..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another NASA screw-up that they&#39;re trying to pin on the vendor engineers, just like Challenger.The title is not reassuring. Conservatism in engineering is essentially about creating safety margins through conservative estimation. The title is saying we need to be careful because a tile was likely penetrated. Hell, if I remember correctly they were reporting that there was known tile damage on the news before reentry, but that they didn&#39;t know the extent.&#34;NASA felt the engineers didn’t know what would happen but that all data pointed to there not being enough damage to put the lives of the crew in danger.&#34;If you thought they didn&#39;t know, then ask them what they do know! It&#39;s right on the slide that flight conditions are outside of test parameters and that the mass of the projectile was much higher. How the F do you work at NASA and not understand the basic principles of mass, velocity, and energy well enough for that to stand out enough to ask questions or run your own calculations...The reason the slide is laid out the way it is, is because it&#39;s describing the thought process and creates a deductive argument for how they got to their concern. This is a presentation for a briefing for other engineers, not a conference or sales pitch. It&#39;s supposed to be formal and contain the synopsis of technical points. Using projectors for technical briefings predates the use of PowerPoint. I see nothing wrong with the layout in that context.Edit: why downvote without a reply? NASA has a history of blaming vendors when they screw up. This looks like another example to me. The presentation format does not have any issues given the setting and target audience."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The title presumed that the crew could have been rescued if NASA had recognized that reentry was impossible. But that&#39;s far from clear. This article goes into fascinating detail about how difficult it would have been to prepare a rescue mission on time: https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/02/the-audacious-rescue...One huge issue, beyond whether a rescue mission would&#39;ve been possible, is whether it would&#39;ve be ethical. If NASA knew that Columbia was stranded in orbit, then it would be knowingly sending a second crew up on a vehicle with the exact same potential problem, with no time to mitigate it. I&#39;m sure a rescue crew would&#39;ve volunteered despite the risks, but anyway the point is that &#34;the slide that killed seven people&#34; is erasing all of these questions."</p>
