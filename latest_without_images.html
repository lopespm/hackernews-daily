								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I switched to Bitwarden when LastPass started using silly tactics to make customers pay.  I didn&#39;t switch because of the price - the service pricing of Bitwarden was a pleasant surprise.I switched because I lost all trust in LastPass.Managing credentials and sensitive information is all about trust.  The second I lose trust in that kind of service, I don&#39;t just stop using it, I will most likely never even consider coming back as a customer and I will warn people against them.  I don&#39;t give second chances to services that are trust based.I&#39;m pretty happy with Bitwarden so far.  But if they betray my trust I&#39;ll be out of there in a day, never to return.  I switched from LastPass to Bitwarden in a day.  LastPass never gets a second chance.What the VCs have to understand is that if their greed makes them push Bitwarden to engage in silly tactics, they risk driving away their customer base."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Bitwarden already does one thing well. It&#39;s everything I&#39;m looking for - open source, costs money but not much ($10/yr), 2FA, clean interface. I&#39;m happy for the new investment, but I hope they don&#39;t start adding new things just for the sake of growing.Also - to the people who analyze funding rounds - $100M sounds like a huge amount to me. Why would a password manager need so much money?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The code for the server is AGPLv3 https://github.com/bitwarden/server , with only things in the /bitwarden_license/ directory being proprietary.The code for the mobile apps is GPLv3 https://github.com/bitwarden/mobile/blob/master/LICENSE.txtThe code for the clients is GPLv3 https://github.com/bitwarden/clientsThese are all copyleft... with a CLA (contributor license agreement). It&#39;s the CLA that allows them the ability to dual-license for the server.The VCs must really believe the company can produce a product based on Enterprise sales which would deliver a value North of $1B. And perhaps they can, as Bitwarden as we know it could be considered a strong beachhead to allow them to expand into other auth markets that have high value (hello Okta, Auth0, etc).But this doesn&#39;t seem that scary for Bitwarden users at this point."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m author of Hacking Healthcare for O&#39;Reilly, 20 year health system executive, blah, blah.It&#39;s very easy for people to forget the scale of the US &#34;health system&#34;, we are talking 1/5, maybe more, of the entire US economy. If US healthcare spending were a country, it would have the third largest GDP in the world. Accidents of history and the massive federal beauracracy created the crazy monster of ICD/CPT codes that results in the very clumsy way of pricing healthcare services that results in this massive matrix of data.As pointed out elsewhere there is a tremendous amount of cost distribution that goes into the code matrix and this plays a large role in negotiations with health insurers as well. Ground is given in one set of procedures and lost in others.This is a big step in shining light into areas that need it to improve the system overall."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I work in data at https://www.carrumhealth.com/, and I&#39;ve been parsing this data for weeks. The transparency prices allow us to meaningfully negotiate with providers, and make tangible, incremental progress toward cheaper health care. Providers and existing insurance carriers leverage information asymmetry to control the market otherwise.For context, we bundle the 100&#39;s of itemized costs into a single, static bill per surgery type. In doing so, we&#39;ve built a custom virtual-network with the most efficient surgeons. These surgeons are able to meet the volume and quality requirements to allow for lower margins. We&#39;re able to get negotiated rates that are 10-40% cheaper than traditional insurance contracts when we have data that we trust.Unfortunately, this data alone isn&#39;t enough to properly determine prices because organizations will spread costs across procedure and billing codes that often occur in aggregate groups. For example, in a joint replacement surgery, some organizations may dump the cost into the billing for the implant itself, while others may put it under the procedure code. You have to gather billing data en masse to see which charges occur together, then combine this pricing data to determine what costs will actually look like for someone experiencing a procedure.It&#39;s a nightmare!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Someone with the right connections should call up Google Cloud and ask them to ingest the data into BigQuery as an example dataset like the NY taxi trips.
It would be a great way for them to show off the capabilities of the engine and helpful for everyone wanting to do analysis on it.https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For context: &#34;This contract is part of NASA’s High-Performance Space Computing project&#34;. I used to work with the HPSC leads and paid attention to it. This is one of many parallel threads for next-gen computing, including snapdragon and others. Yes, it will be rad-hard. That was a program requirement and is mentioned in the press release. As such, it fits a particular mission profile.There is no existing compulsion for missions to use HPSC. This is a technology development program seeking to meet the requirements of missions. It&#39;s great news they converged on an architecture!As part of their development, HPSC folks will seek mission partners for tech demos. Then, missions will voluntarily (or with some light compulsion) adopt the technology based on the growing heritage and mission need."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting!  ESA has been using a custom SPARC V8 rad hard architecture: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LEONI&#39;m currently using a dual-core 90 MHz processor that is relatively advanced and has good performance for many applications.  It has error-correcting memories (SDRAM, cache, registers) and a lot of integrated peripherals (spacewire, serial, ethernet, 1553, CCSDS) that help reduce board complexity.Next up in the pipeline is an 8-core 1 GHz monster:

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am a little surprised to see this. I&#39;d imagine NASA would chose a CPU with an already proven track record (especially for something so wide ranging, the press release says it expected to be used for &#39;virtually every future space mission, from planetary exploration to lunar and Mars surface missions&#39;. This is a new design from SiFive and there&#39;s not a huge amount of SiFive IP around yet to demonstrate how good (or otherwise) their verification is. Running into a hardware bug whilst your CPU is in space is not good.Still good SiFive have convinced NASA otherwise, they must have a pretty strong verification story behind the scenes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"HTML media capture is superb. I have successfully used it in production, and I was surprised by how simple it was and how well it worked. I learned about it from here[0].It&#39;s cool because if you have an app that requires users uploading pictures, you just need an HTML &lt;form&gt;, an &lt;input&gt; with `capture`, and a few lines of code in the backend. I thought I would need to do some JavaScript gymnastics, and it ended up taking just an afternoon to design, develop, and deploy.[0]: https://anssiko.github.io/html-media-capture/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This github page is the most interesting (fairly apolitical) read on the lab leak hypothesis that I&#39;ve seen to date:https://project-evidence.github.io/After reading it, it seems most likely to me that patient 0 was a person who collected bats for the lab with insufficient safety equipment, but the article itself doesn&#39;t really present a strong conclusion."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well I hope that at least the next lab-made pandemic will insert some beneficial mutations to humanity.In a way, the lab-leak hypothesis is comforting, because it means that nature with its own means did not manage to manufacture such a highly-transmissive disease, despite the facts of modern life, record human population and rates of travel. If it is not lab-made, then nature may do this again soon with another virus."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don’t go looking for covid discussions but they arrive in my feeds so i’m conscious i’m seeing a feed that someone(s) else curated for me and wanted me to view. That said…Is there any popular discussion or action regarding mitigation of both lab and natural origins for future?It seems that both avenues are possible. If we know both are possible, that seems like enough knowledge to move forward with exploring possible mitigations for future.I realise there may be hard reasons why no mitigation is possible, but i just never encounter popular discussion of what to do next."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"At a previous company I worked at, we had an issue with our software (Windows-based, written in a proprietary language) randomly crashing. After some debugging, we found that this happened whenever the user made some specific actions, but only if, in that session, the user had previously printed something or opened a file picker. The culprit was either a printer driver or a shell extension which, when loaded, changed the floating point control word to trap. That happened whenever the culprit DLL had been compiled by a specific compiler, which had the offending code in the startup routine it linked into every DLL it produced.Our solution was the inverse of the one presented in this article: instead of wrapping our routines to temporarily set the floating point control word to sane values, we wrapped the calls to either printing or the file picker, and reset the floating point control word to its previous (and sane) value after these calls."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Julia package ecosystem has a lot of safeguards against silent incorrect behavior like this. For example, if you try to add a package binary build which would use fast math flags, it will throw an error and tell you to repent:https://github.com/JuliaPackaging/BinaryBuilderBase.jl/blob/...In user codes you can do `@fastmath`, but it&#39;s at the semantic level so it will change `sin` to `sin_fast` but not recurse down into other people&#39;s functions, because at that point you&#39;re just asking for trouble. There&#39;s also calls to rename it `@unsafemath` in Julia, just to make it explicit. In summary, &#34;Fastmath&#34; is overused and many times people actually want other optimizations (automatic FMA), and people really need to stop throwing global changes around willy-nilly, and programming languages need to force people to avoid such global issues both semantically and within its package ecosystems norms."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Finally, I am legally obligated to inform you that I used GNU Parallel to scan all the wheelsFWIW, this is tangential to this awesome article, but if the author is here or anyone else who cares: that statement isn’t true, you are not legally obligated to mention GNU Parallel. It is nice to do though! The link even says this explicitly, and also separately mentions the citation notice is only asking for scientific paper citations, not blog citations. I love parallel, but boy has that citation notice thing caused a lot of confusion over the years."</p>

The company I work for has spent a lot of money trying to use Snyk for this purpose, but it really sucks, and chokes on most of our Go repos go.mod files meaning some of our most important repositories are blind for vulnerability scanning.We don&#39;t get the static code analysis feature from Snyk (where vulnerabilities are raised only when they affect us), because this is an optional paid extra.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This seems harder in our modern world where everything is contracted out to the lowest bidder.  I&#39;ve had great conversations with custodial staff at schools, parks, and other areas that actually hire the workers.  At my day job, a giant corporation which hires its engineers but outsources its janitors, chefs, and so on, there&#39;s a totally different vibe.Even the few janitors that speak English are both rushed to complete their tasks in the insufficient allotted time and almost terrified to talk to the normal employees, presumably due to the perceived power balance - were an employee to complain about them, the vendor would almost certainly fire them rather than risk offending the client.  It&#39;s not fair, but it is reality, and it means that even when I do say hello or hold a door or whatever I don&#39;t get a response."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Do people here from outside the US think this is the case everywhere? Because I&#39;m from Latin America (more specifically Brazil) and I don&#39;t think ignoring the lower paid staff is the status quo. Actually it is considered pretty rude not to at least acknowledge them and say the usual pleasantries (Good Morning, Hey Jon!, etc...).Having been to the US I&#39;d say I don&#39;t think that is a fact everywhere also. In NYC for sure, as people are more transactional with each other, or SV where people are awfully superficial/shallow. But I&#39;ve been to cities where people are much warmer (from the top of my head, San Diego).One step further I&#39;d recommend you to do is to sometimes move past from the &#34;automatic pleasantries&#34;. For example, when the cashier at the fast food asks you &#34;hello, how are you sir&#34;, instead of answering &#34;fine, thanks, I want....&#34; go for &#34;I&#39;m good Jennifer, and you? How are you doing today?&#34;. My experience is that this always get people off guard and has a very positive impact of them, as bring them back to a more human (and less transactional) aspect of the interaction."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What a coincidence! For a project that I maintain (Buildbarn, a distributed build cluster for Bazel) I recently generalized all of the FUSE code I had into a generic VFS that can both be exposed over FUSE and NFSv4. The intent was the same: to provide a better out of the box experience on macOS. Here&#39;s a design doc I wrote on that change. Slight warning that it&#39;s written with some Buildbarn knowledge in mind.https://github.com/buildbarn/bb-adrs/blob/master/0009-nfsv4....Fortunately, fuse-t doesn&#39;t make any of my work unnecessary. Buildbarn uses go-fuse, which talks to the FUSE character directly instead of using libfuse. fuse-t would thus not be a drop-in replacement.

I hope that this project enables those many FUSE-related applications to return to Homebrew since an open-source FUSE provider is now available again.I am curious though why a NFSv4 server was chosen over wrapping Apple&#39;s File Provider API [1], which seems to be the native method for providing virtual file systems from user space on macOS since macOS 11.5. After glancing over the API I guess it&#39;s because FPEs are too high-level to implement FUSE properly, but I&#39;d be glad if you can share any details to satisfy my curiosity.[1] https://developer.apple.com/documentation/fileproviderEDIT: Errata, I assumed it was open-source, but it is not. Too bad :( -- but at least this will eventually provide a more stable FUSE experience on macOS."</p>
