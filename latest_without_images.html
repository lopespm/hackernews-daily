								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I agree with most of the points raised by the author but as a Venezuelan Bitcoin is a godsend. If you live abroad and want to send remittances to your friends and family it can be pretty easy in a normal country , with wire transfers,western union and so on. If your family lives in Venezuela your options are extremely more limited.These are some of the options Venezuelans have had to use:1. Ask the money to be sent to Colombia with WU and then travel hundreds of kms to get  what usually amounts to a few hundred dollars at most.2. Use Zelle, send dollars in the US, and receive Bolivares in Venezuela. But for that you need to have an US bank account, and find a person you can trust also with an US bank account and plenty of highly volatile Bolivares in Venezuela willing to make the exchange.3. Use paypal, same as above with way higher commissions and the risk that paypal (and the other person) will fuck you.4. Buy Amazon gift cards and use the same schema above, be exposed to scams and high commisions fees.Trading bitcoins in say localbitcoins.com, you have a very liquid market and somewhat secure transactions (Bitcoins are not liberated until you check the money is in the Venezuela account). There are risks of course, especially because of BTC volatility but at least is a fast,convenient,widespread option. I wish something like that, only more stable and with less of that Tulip-craze whiff BTC has."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I bought my smartphone from Hong Kong, in part because I wanted a specific variant that would be more likely to work with open-source ROM&#39;s.The seller initially requested payment via Transferwise, who sought crazy amounts of personal information and bullied me into a privacy-hostile customer agreement.  Days went by and they still hadn&#39;t activated my account.Growing frustrated, I convinced the seller to accept Bitcoin, which was comparatively instant.  The phone arrived a few days later, meanwhile the Transferwise morons still had their heads up their arses with no movement and no good explanation.  I&#39;m not a financial risk; I&#39;m a good little citizen with no red flags.  Reading between the lines my sense was their staff were overloaded or their onboarding system was simply broken.Bitcoin was incredibly helpful for me that day, and my favorite feature about the phone is the way I paid.  In addition to a great story, I&#39;ve got to admit there was something liberating and empowering about giving what felt like a big middle finger to the slow, decrepit, old-fashioned institution who couldn&#39;t even deliver on their core business proposition.  Like saying &#34;screw you, I don&#39;t need you and your crappy service anymore, come back when you can compete on merits&#34;.Whatever else you criticize about Bitcoin, it&#39;s still &#34;cash you can email&#34;, and even if that&#39;s all it ever amounts to I still find it a bloody useful innovation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There does seem to be a fundamental design issue in bitcoin and proof of work in general: Mining has economies of scale and therefore winner takes all mechanics leading to centralization.At that point the mechanism that ensures ledger integrity is the calculation that if the miner tampers with the ledger, that would destroy trust in the coin and hurt the miner in that way.But 1) that&#39;s exactly how conventional currencies work too and 2) it&#39;s actually an untested hypothesis. Who knows what would happen in a world where the economy runs on bitcoin and there&#39;s some &#34;good reason&#34; to deviate from the protocol."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I predict a rash of eventual FireEye, Cisco, and other vendor zero days in the near to mid future. If you are a nation state actor what better way to find zero days then to get the source code and find the bugs to exploit. This is the only thing that makes sense that would be worth the risk of attacking companies such as FireEye and Microsoft."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; This means we do not rely on the secrecy of source code for the security of products, and our threat models assume that attackers have knowledge of source code. So viewing source code isn’t tied to elevation of riskI don&#39;t know how much of this is true. Wouldn&#39;t it be helpful for bad actors to understand how Windows defenses work looking at the code thereby increasing the risk?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Practically speaking, being a bad guy with access to Microsoft source code for a short time has very little impact or real-world relevance. They do thousands of updates a day, the build processes are lengthy and poorly documented, the overall direction of the code is subject to myriad political groups inside the company, and they&#39;re making massive improvements in multiple branches that will render that snapshot irrelevant within minutes.The &#34;best&#34; market for any such code would be... what... China? Other than the possibility of figuring out potential hacks who could make use of the code in in its sheer mass? By the time you figure out something clever your version of the code is hopelessly out of date."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a *nix sysadmin since before Google was a thing, I find articles like this frustrating and arguably dangerous.They lay out a set of &#34;rules&#34; the author has collated as a dogmatic doctrine that only a fool would not follow. But they provide no &#34;why&#34;, take absolutely no context in to account, and talk only about their perceived upsides.Anyone reading this should take each point as &#34;here&#39;s a possible thing you should go and research yourself&#34;, because there are consequences to most of these rules.I&#39;m not saying anything they&#39;ve written is wrong (though there is a lot of unsubstantiated opinion there), just that you should learn what any of these changes truly do before implementing them AND that your particular context is really important.Edit:There is a disclaimer at the top which mustn&#39;t be forgotten while reading.&gt; DISCLAIMER: Do not attempt to apply anything in this article if you do not know exactly what you are doing. This guide is focused purely on security and privacy, not performance, usability, or anything else.I do appreciate people putting work into producing this sort of content, but I think the article could be improved by phrasing the various steps as suggestions and perhaps linking out to more detailed documentation on the &#34;why&#34; elsewhere."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some omissions IMO: never let people SSH in with a password, and for the love of god, stop leaving private SSH keys on servers. Privat SSH keys should never leave your physical proximity. They should be on your laptop, or desktop, or your yubikey, but never on servers. Also SSH agent forwarding is the devil. Don&#39;t do it.Lots of really braindead advice in there too, like disabling RDRAND because there might be a backdoor.. come on.. even Linus knows that&#39;s obvious bullshit.[1][1] https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2013/09/11/rudest-man-in-li..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This list is cool, but I think it would be more useful with some quick notes on side effects. I think all but the most hardcore Linux lovers won&#39;t have enough breadth and depth to understand the full ramifications of many of these config changes.I&#39;m no Linux expert but even having used it for a fair number of years, I only have a shallow understanding of most of the things that are tweaked here, if I&#39;ve even heard of them at all. For example, it says &#34;kernel.kexec_load_disabled=1&#34;, and points out the threat which I can understand, but I don&#39;t know what that&#39;s used for in the first place. Perhaps it isn&#39;t really ever used for anything, but it&#39;d be nice to be told that, because my initial line of thinking is that these defaults must be defaults for a reason and that makes me hesitant to actually make any of the changes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In 2004 my brother and I developed a buttplug shaped like George W. Bush - we called it the Bushplug. Manufacturing was more expensive than we had expected but we sold about 100 of them - presumably as novelty gifts. Our price point was too high for a novelty gift and the nose was a little too pointy to be an enjoyable sex toy. We made our money back and had some fun with being featured on BoingBoing and Fleshbot. Someone tried to sue us. We sent the last of the Bushplugs to the Smithsonian&#39;s presidential museum. We made our investment back but didn&#39;t become buttplug millionaires."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In 2006/2007 I built HTMLButcher, a C++ desktop application to slice PSD/image website designs made by designers to HTML.
 In these years sites where made with tables, so for slicing a design I had to cut the images and fit then into borderless HTML tables.
I took 2 years to build it, and in this timeframe people started building sematic websites with CSS, and abandoning table-based designs.
I managed to sell 100 copies, for some reason 90% to India.
After some years without selling nothing, I open sourced it: https://github.com/RangelReale/htmlbutcher.
The good thing is that I REALLY learned C++ with this project, and this knowledge was the basis for my current company where I made a digitalsignage application in C++ that runs in some of the largest DOOH places in Brazil, in Windows, Linux and MAC (targets of HTMLButcher). So in the end it was a good investment!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I built a Tinder-like matchmaking app where users log in with their Facebook account and the app then auto-matches users by their FB likes. I thought taking the hassle out of swiping could give my app an edge over Tinder.It was working fine for a week or so before Facebook caught up and revoked my API keys (effectively killing the app). They didn&#39;t give any reason besides some vague recommendation to review their Terms of Service. A few months later at their F8 developer conference they announced they&#39;ll be launching their own matchmaking service which will work pretty the same way I built my app.Moral of the story: never trust big tech.P.S. I open sourced the app a few years ago: https://bitbucket.org/stonepillarstudios/workspace/projects/...
Feel free to fork &amp; revive."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The tweet mentions that you could &#39;just&#39; send an SWF file to someone and it played. Well, if anybody had to fix a computer, or hosted anything Flash-based during that era, then they would know that&#39;s bullshit. Sure maybe with the standalone Flash player it worked allright, but that&#39;s not how people really used Flash. Even in my experience, a single SWF running locally didn&#39;t always work across all versions of Flash player.Flash on the web only worked if you had Flash player plugin installed. Both browser and Flash updates themselves would break the Flash plugin constantly. That was across all browsers and platforms. Keeping plugins updated and reliable was a mess, for a long time there weren&#39;t even auto updates.Flash was a mess the whole time. Let&#39;s not pretend that it ever really &#34;just worked&#34; because it didn&#39;t."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is true but it is a common misunderstanding imo. Nobody is arguing a tool like Flash shouldn’t exist; it should. People are arguing a runtime like Flash shouldn’t exist, and that HTML5 has all of the components that are needed to be that runtime and then some. A tool should give us what Flash did but with the HTML runtime.So why doesn’t that tool exist?Well... as far as I know it does. I’m pretty sure this is exactly what Adobe Animate is meant to be:https://www.adobe.com/products/animate.htmlSo why isn’t it causing a Flash-style revolution?In my opinion... Because of YouTube. Twitter. Etc.Before everyone had heaps of bandwidth, you needed to consume smaller files. A full 1080p video was unfathomable with the codecs, compute and network bandwidth available in the early 2000s. Swf files however were small and easy to distribute. The perfect storm occurred due to the structure of early internet, and communities like Newgrounds flourished.I honestly think Flash just got a bit stale. It stopped being new and exciting, and for animations video sites were probably going to win out anyways. For games, a lot of indie devs now target PCs and game consoles. Unity and Construct export to HTML5. People wanted to do more advanced things to the point where Flash itself started doing things like 3D rendering, at which point the appealing aspects of Flash started to make less sense anyways.Many seem to argue passionately, probably from an emotional place, that Flash was killed. Honestly, I just don’t agree. Flash was dying either way. Everyone just gradually decided to cut off the life support.The era it ushered in will be missed, though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve come across a lot of similar sentiment from ex-Flash devs, who romanticise its heyday as a period of fertile creativity (true) and say that HTML5/JS/CSS/SVG is an inadequate replacement (false).In truth, the fundamental capabilities of the modern web platform matches and typically exceeds anything that was offered by Flash. What these people are really lamenting is the ease of authorship that Flash provided to non-technical users.Macromedia/Adobe provided a suite of powerful tools for authoring Flash animations and applications. There is no free equivalent available targeting HTML/JS. This is not a problem of capability in the platform technologies. It is because there is no economic incentive to make and give away such tools. What equivalents do exist in this sector cost money.When it comes to Flash, the old adage, &#34;if you&#39;re not paying for the product, you are the product&#34; holds true. The Flash authorship tools were free because 3rd party authors creating Flash content were assisting in the promulgation of a proprietary platform that was gradually replacing open web standards. Had they succeeded, Macromedia/Adobe would inevitably have looked to squeeze and monetise their domination of the web.Programmers are often accused of not understanding what Flash offered to artists. Maybe that&#39;s true, but I&#39;ve not encountered many artists who conversely understand the above."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To me, what sucks about JIRA (and would suck about any well-designed tool that replaces it) is not &#34;feature x&#34; but the entire JIRA mentality. All of it.It encourages micro-management. It encourages more and more process. It is the enemy of getting better at the DORA metrics, which requires streamlining process.tickets in JIRA are not the work itself, never was and never will be, it is a LARP of the work, but it gets taken for the central thing. This is an illusion.  Fixing a bug without filing a JIRA ticket is in itself progress. Moving a JIRA card without any other change is not. Yet the second is what&#39;s visible and therefor what&#39;s rewarded.Any problem gets solved with &#34;more JIRA &#34; which stops working when the remaining problems are caused by too much JIRA. And yet they keep trying, because it gives &#34;control&#34;. JIRA is a like metastatic tumour that will grow until it kills the host.In case the cancer metaphor didn&#39;t make it very clear, I don&#39;t like JIRA much. Yet if JIRA were to die today, the middle management who live by JIRA would replace it with something else equally bad, if not worse.Filling in missing features won&#39;t and can&#39;t fix that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a hundred small issues with Jira, but there&#39;s one huge one:  It&#39;s slow. Really, really slow.Atlassian seems to make a lot of money, so I guess they&#39;re optimising for something that matters to someone, but from my point of view I have a simple process for evaluating tools:1) Can I use it at all? 2) How many of the features I want does it have?I&#39;m pretty sure Jira would score great on the second question, but since it hard fails the first, I&#39;ll never know. And it&#39;s been slow for so many years now, I assume they have no interest or ability to fix it. And their slow drift towards cloud installs over letting people self host isn&#39;t helping them either since, embarrassingly, their cloud instances seem to be even slower.(Incidentally, there&#39;s a lot of competition in that space, but I&#39;ve been pretty happy with Clubhouse. I wouldn&#39;t mind a few more features, but it&#39;s good enough. More importantly, the UI is clean and snappy, and that hides a multitude of sins.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Every bullet point says &#34;Missing...&#34;, but I feel like the main issue about Jira is that it has waaay to many features, and that it&#39;s super slow!The only bullet point I do agree with, is that Jira is missing an easy (or IMHO a minimalist / simple) interface. The tool is a mess, and the people using it are probably also using it in the wrong way, making the whole situation way worse.Don&#39;t get me wrong, I like Jira to some extent, but its performance and messy UI are really making my life harder rather than simpler."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The &#34;Create New Project&#34; dialog has serious accessibility problems when used with a screen reader. The buttons are clickable divs, not actual HTML buttons or even marked up with proper ARIA. I haven&#39;t yet ventured any further into the app.Given that the app is a WebAssembly development environment, my first guess was that it was built in WebAssembly itself, with a custom UI framework. But in fact, it&#39;s plain React, using its own home-grown components for basic things like buttons.It breaks my heart that when this project was started in 2017, some 20 years after web accessibility advocacy had started in earnest, the developer was still uninformed enough about accessibility that they would create a custom button component with no ARIA support. I suppose we could also blame the web platform for making it hard enough to customize the look of a standard button that the developer would reach for the div tag. What do we do about this?"</p>
