								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Great write up!One thing to add is that you can even open tunnels during an interactive session without disconnection.To do this, type the escape command sequence ~C (will not show) and it will drop you to the control prompt. You can then add tunnels.     ssh&gt;
     ssh&gt; -L 8000:localhost:9000 
     Forwarding port."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a really fancy new -R feature that I love (added in 2017 I think).ssh &lt;target&gt; -R &lt;just a port number&gt;This opens up a localhost port on the target that acts as a socks server which tunnels all your traffic through the source machine.This is great for machines that you can SSH into, but are otherwise completely isolated from the network, or are monitored heavily. You can jump on, and pull down everything you need from the existing SSH connection, rather than using the machine to make requests out to the internet directly.This is also good if the source machine is a web server or something on a secured network which can SSH out, but not much else, and the destination is your command and control server on the internet. Then it opens up a socks port on the C&amp;C machine that gives full access to the internal network, impersonating the source machine.Every other -R is a point to point TCP connection, but setting up a SOCKS proxy with -R is magic. More analogous to a reverse -D than a reverse -L. Super useful."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The leaked internal slides from Intuit are really disgusting [0][1].From the article:&gt; Internal presentations lay out company tactics for fighting “encroachment,” Intuit’s catchall term for any government initiative to make filing taxes easier — such as creating a free government filing system or pre-filling people’s returns with payroll or other data the IRS already has. “For a decade proposals have sought to create IRS tax software or a ReturnFree Tax System; All were stopped,” reads a confidential 2007 PowerPoint presentation from an Intuit board of directors meeting. The company’s 2014-15 plan included manufacturing “3rd-party grass roots” support. “Buy ads for op-eds/editorials/stories in African American and Latino media,” one internal PowerPoint slide states.I&#39;m always stunned and disappointed at how easy it is to game the American political system. I say that with great respect for this country and the freedoms it affords me, but those freedoms mean little if skullduggery like this goes on.[0]: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6483065-Intuit-board...[1]: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6483061-Intuit-Turbo..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s little wonder that democracy is in a state of decline and that faith in our public institutions is at an all time low when government can be so easily corrupted by disingenuous carpetbaggers such as Intuit. It&#39;s not as if this corruption of process by Intuit is an isolated instance, the trouble is that it&#39;s commonplace.It seems to me that the first step in citizens reclaiming their democracy back and having our faith and integrity restored in our institutions is to take charge of the lobbying process and rescue it from corporate interests and other bad influences. I would go so far as to suggest all lobbying of politicians be done in public and that to bypass the system of public scrutiny be made a felony.This may sound like highfalutin idealism and overkill but after what we&#39;ve witnessed in Washington in recent weeks we 
can no longer ignore the fact that trust in our governance is at an alltime low - and that as citizens we have a collective responsibility to ensure we fix the problem.We have to break the nexus of mistrust between the Citizenry and Government and desperate times call for desperate measures."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not sure why it doesn&#39;t seem to be more well known, but CreditKarma has allowed free filing of taxes (incl. capital gains), and was recently acquired by Intuit. Last I read they were under investigation by the Department of Justice because of the implications they were eliminating a competitor.Comments: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24038559I&#39;ve used it for the past 2 years, and it has worked great for me, albeit I don&#39;t have very complicated taxes. I&#39;m actually afraid of what happens if the acquisition goes through, definitely expecting the free tax filing to disappear soon after that occurs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Teletypes in Switzerland were ITU V.21 with three modifications:- 110 baud instead of 300 baud- not full duplex- carrier toneI experimented with a Java application and FFT to try to write a soft modem, so I still know the exact specification by heart. Bit 1 was 960 Hz, Bit 0 was 1160 Hz, the carrier tone 1060 Hz, and there were 2 stop bits. This means, the teletype could transmit 11 letters a second.The carrier tone is special: if someone stopped typing, the teletype switched to the carrier tone and kept it on for about 3 seconds then stopped.Being not full-duplex Deaf users used a convention so they know when they can type. The called party begins typing and ends with two stars, like this **. Then the caller knows he can type and also indicates the end with two stars. When a party is ready to hang up the phone he writes four stars.This is what my model (Telescrit) looked like: https://db1.rehadat.de/rehadat/bilder/TC058000/tc058773.jpg"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Working in IT, the vast majority of engineers and IT adjacent people have little care or desire to learn about phone or communications systems. Especially nowadays when Teams and Zoom take care of your VoIP woes on the backend, and AWS or Azure are always doing something way cooler than a PBX can.I was lucky to work alongside an enterprise PBX architect and not only learn about phone systems, but come to appreciate the history of them as well. One of the more interesting things to me has always been the amount of accessibility that gets designed into phone systems. TTY, translation services, different languages, etc. It&#39;s something that always reminds me we&#39;re designing and dealing with a wide variety of humans that I don&#39;t get when designing a network."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; “He saw there were old World War II teletype machines not being used,” said his daughter. “Another deaf engineer in California had come up with the way to send signals over phone lines. My dad came up with the coupler component the teletype needed. He then pressed Western Union to provide the old machines to deaf people and Bell telephone to use them on their lines.”Another TDD pioneer, James Marsters, is described here:https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/23/us/23marsters.html"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I find it hilarious that so much disinformation went into this article itself. The mischaracterizations of Fauci and the reckless, the poor sources that themselves are spin machines, all highlight a lot of the issues: a spectrum of people hell bent on manufacturing distrust in various institutions for their own gains, now co-adopted as an identity by the GOP.We need to find a way to fundamentally change the incentives in media, change the public’s expectation of separating opinion versus news, and remove the cancer(s) of “think tanks” that only serve to undermine and destroy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As an (European) outsider: Manufacturing consent is a key feature of societies. If societies are not just an accidental aggregation, but do have some actual cohesion, a core body (canon) of shared believes and opinions is absolutely necessary. If a society fails to manufacture consent as a common point of reference in this core domain, we may even speak of a failed society.A certain amount of mis- and disinformation, manipulation, falsely raised expectations (e.g., if masks do not stop CV19 dead in the track, it&#39;s also not a viable tool of mitigation), etc, is to be expected. A certain amount of dissent is vital to a thriving society, as opposed to a slow descent into dogmatism. A certain amount of dysfunctionality is actually functional to societies. However, if we are losing a common point of reference and the discussion turns from an ever varying problem space towards questioning and problematizing consent per se, society itself is at stake, as partitioning and claims to rightful dominance by one side or the other are inevitable. Dealing with this is not a matter of free speech, even, if suppression of free speech may be empirically observed as an – mostly failed – attempt to address this. It&#39;s actually more connected to the question, what speaking freely actually means: Is it to enter into or to contribute to a discussion, or is it a means of claiming dominance? In other words, does the address include those who do not share the specific set of believes and points of reference of the speaker, or does it exclude and/or ignore them, by this turning into an hermetic or even radical argument, meant only to augment the position of the speaker? Is it still pervasive, or has this turned into a hegemonial discourse? If it&#39;s the latter, it&#39;s not about manufacturing consent anymore, but about establishing a new, biased one, probably by force."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While it is true that we should be having a discussion about what really constitutes disinformation in a way that treats the concept as more than just a political tactic, this article reads as though it is doing almost the same thing. The bit about disinformation functions like a subterfuge to really assert what seem like the author&#39;s political views: covid skepticism, russiagate, ... If there is anything worse than throwing around the term disinformation to summarily dismiss ideas one disagrees with, it is having a discussion about this practice to underhandedly characterize ones own ideas as being &#34;actually&#34; true; as though these ideas are merely examples of real &#34;fact-based&#34; discourse. It is frustrating to see someone broach an important topic, then author between the lines of the discussion more of the very same problem."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Transparent Wood Composites [1] &#34;are novel wood materials which have up to 90% transparency and higher mechanical properties than wood itself&#34;. This latest paper Solar-assisted fabrication of large-scale, patternable transparent wood [2] describes a technique that brings this material one step closer to production scale:&gt; Here, we report a method to produce optically transparent wood by modifying the wood’s lignin structure using a solar-assisted chemical brushing approach. This method preserves most of the lignin to act as a binder, providing a robust wood scaffold for polymer infiltration while greatly reducing the chemical and energy consumption as well as processing time. The obtained transparent wood (~1 mm in thickness) demonstrates a high transmittance (&gt;90%), high haze (&gt;60%), and excellent light-guiding effect over visible wavelength. Furthermore, we can achieve diverse patterns directly on wood surfaces using this approach, which endows transparent wood with excellent patternability. Combining its efficient, patternable, and scalable production, this transparent wood is a promising candidate for applications in energy-efficient buildings.This same group has previously described A Clear, Strong, and Thermally Insulated Transparent Wood for Energy Efficient Windows [3].[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparent_wood_composites[2] https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/5/eabd7342[3] https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adfm.2019075..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m really disappointed with this narrative that natural fibres infused with chemicals are somehow still natural.“Bamboo fibre” bowls made with plastic for a recent trend: Not just not biodegradable as the name suggests, but also not recyclable.Like “vegan leather” (made from processed crude oil), these terms only seem to take us away from the products that we are actually looking for when something says “natural”."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Because it&#39;s hidden in one of the captions:The volume fraction of wood in the resulting product appears to be around 33%. So by volume it&#39;s two-thirds resin and one-third wood.I was hoping the wood fraction would be slightly higher to justify calling it &#34;transparent wood&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have plenty of criticism of the blockchain hype, but IBM does this for all buzzwords regardless of how useful the underlying technology is. It is all marketing to get executives at large companies to cut large checks. Once those checks are cashed they drop everyone and move on to the next buzzword.The current buzzword is hybrid cloud. Which is awesome for IBM because most large companies already have some on-prem and cloud resources. So IBM inserts a bunch of people into existing processes and resources and claims credit for creating a hybrid cloud for their customers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The point about theory-building requiring (or at least being accelerated by) interpersonal communication / teaching rings very true.In the middle of last year, my team went through a major re-org, and I&#39;m now working with a whole bunch of new teammates. My project didn&#39;t get cancelled in the reorg; in fact, it&#39;s actually come to more prominence due to synergy in the projects we work on. Essentially my new teammates are working on applications which have 2-4 years of catching up to reach the same level of maturity as my existing work.It&#39;s taken me the better part of a year to communicate the whys, whats, and hows of the systems we&#39;ve built. I&#39;ve given multiple talks, explained in 1:1s, written docs, and it&#39;s just taken a really long time to get across these ideas.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Worthless&#34; is an exaggeration: any significant body of code running a critical business process would be missed---and expensive to recreate---if it were lost. But I think the article does make a good point about the value to others. Unless you have a dev team whose head is in that code, and a business team built around that software workflow, just having the code won&#39;t be of much value to you. The value of software is inextricably linked to the team that has shaped it. So while it isn&#39;t worthless, it is certainly of much lower value without that team."</p>
