								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"By the way, Kevin Rothrock is the host of the podcast ‘The Naked Pravda’ from Meduza, which is one of the main independent news outlets in Russian now—created by former staff of Lenta.ru after that came under ownership of an oligarch and became pro-government. ‘The Naked Pravda’ is in English and serves the audience who would like to know about Russian affairs from people closer to the ground. In fact, it&#39;s quite worthy even for those who speak Russian and have other news sources.https://meduza.io/en/podcasts/the-naked-pravda or https://meduza.global.ssl.fastly.net/en/podcasts/the-naked-p...Also perhaps https://meduza.io/en and https://meduza.global.ssl.fastly.net/en for text—though that has much less material than in Russian, and I can&#39;t personally vouch for it.As a gentle reminder: after being declared a ‘foreign agent’ and losing risk-averse advertisers, Meduza lives on direct contributions from readers. Given both the devaluation of the ruble and the financial sanctions (as Meduza is not incorporated in Russia), these contributions will likely shrink, and we might lose one of the last outlets with actual good journalism."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Seems like a really slow, cumbersome technique to monitor people. The one officer was rapidly scrolling looking for who knows what. No one can read or even scan text that fast, so I guess looking for photos?At the human level there are probably plenty of low-tech techniques to keep yourself safe like deleting messages or using coded language.It’s sad to watch Russia descend into totalitarianism."</p>

It seems like a fairly specialized use case.If you just want or need to look at stuff under a microscope, it&#39;s probably better just to buy an inexpensive one.  You can get a pretty decent one in the $300-$400 range.  I have one of AM Scope&#39;s stereo boom microscopes and works great for what I need it for.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m still young so maybe my mind hasn&#39;t matured enough to where I can combat this well. So I went heavy-handed - I have a button on my desk that when I press it, my server&#39;s DNS server (through which all my devices and router resolve) begins rejecting requests to reddit, instagram, twitter, hackernews, news.google.com, etc.For the next two hours, there is nothing I can do outside of SSH&#39;ing through my mobile device (purposefully don&#39;t have an app for it) and resetting the countdown on the DNS server and restarting the server, to allow these DNS requests. It denies all SSH connections from my home network, and doesn&#39;t even resolve its own subdomain (dns.my-domain.com for the DNS dashboard) for me to reset it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m curious what the generational divide is for this. I’m 57, love tech and enjoy the positive side of the internet in limited doses. But I find most social media boring.There is incredible and AMAZING art, accidental moments, serious discussion and fascinating analysis of the world to be found online. But without grounding myself in genuine experience in the stinky, cruel real world of human interaction, nature, and emotions it’s hollow. It only has meaning with this grounding reality.Infinite scroll has never captured my attention beyond a few seconds. I can’t determine if I’m an anomaly? Normal for my age group?I’m distressed about how much time my 24 year-old daughter spends on instagram. She lives at home, works as a dance instructor, and spends most of her time staring at her phone screen.As a child I loved television. The six million dollar man was a highlight of the week (unless  a spaghetti western was on). But it quickly became stultifying garbage when I spent more than a couple hours on the screen.Am I just not normal? I love the grittiness and dangerous unpredictability of the real world. Yet love movies. I’m not sure what to think"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I still mostly use the web browser on my mobile phone.Many apps are just too damn invasive now as well, they cross the line way too far for metrics they don&#39;t even really pay attention to; this is why I only install apps that don&#39;t use dark patterns and I&#39;ve deleted many that go that route. I also schedule my important daily tasks on my calendar with silent (vibration alerts) so that I know when things need to get done. Ringers and notifications are always off on my phone...I do get pulled in to TikTok at times, but I frequently recognize when the content gets &#34;preachy&#34; and/or boring, and I quickly quit the app and take a break when that happens. Sometimes, it&#39;s just simple fun to take a mental break from being serious too, so we shouldn&#39;t always ruin all the good aspects of social platforms.Product owners and companies now often think their role is to manipulate people into staying on apps, and that&#39;s a very toxic attitude that discourages trust in corporations behind the apps.In truth, these platforms are accountable for the suicides, societal depression, crimes, and negative effects their platforms encourage in real life, and eventually they will be held accountable for it.For us, there are careful choices to make; we need to identify dark patterns and encourage public awareness about them. We need to refuse to do development work that supports negative outcomes and dark profit.If any of us collect a check for creating bad algos and just think it&#39;s just &#34;doing our job&#34; we&#39;re just as accountable as the greedy and morally corrupt execs that push for profit goals without any sense of societal responsibility and moral accountability."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hey, sorry for all the name changes of Microsoft Defender. I work at MSec (Microsoft&#39;s security org).We ended up absorbing and acquiring a few companies to provide a better offering and a lot of re-branding happened. For example Security Center&#39;s old portal for active threat protection, automatic remediation, incident investigation etc is all now absorbed into (the better) security.microsoft.com which is (to my understanding, just an engineer) the current and last (for the foreseeable future) rebrand. The team I work at started as one person working on the frontend for MDE (Microsoft Defender for Endpoint) and now has hundreds of people working on the security portal across India, Israel and the US (as well as a few other smaller sites contributing).Also, as an engineer I have to say the offering is good. The anti-virus and the telemetry is worked on by some really smart people. Client information is sacred, logging into production takes multiple audits and PII is scrubbed (heavily) any time logs are needed. We still have a lot of room to improve but I am confident in Microsoft both delivering a good product and acting in good faith (and there is a clear business incentive in the enterprise security space to do so rather than benevolence)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I responded to multiple major compromises during the Hafnium Exchange hacks.https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319934/microsoft-hafnium...In quite a few cases, we identified that ultimately a server has been popped using this unknown zero day, but never before seen webshells and Cobalt strike droppers all ended up dropped on servers and then deleted by Windows Defender. We recommended rebuilds regardless but the product clearly provided more security than people give it credit for.Then we identified a number of places it didn&#39;t appear to work. Why? The answer was people following &#34;best practices&#34; of adding AV exclusions for the whole web root folder, and for some reason the whole user profile folder.That big Kaseya hack? Every Kaseya user was told by Kaseya to add exclusions for every folder used by the product.One of the understated issues with modern EDR products is people simply following vendor advise and making it useless. I&#39;ve got a software product that handles payment details that randomly drops EICAR test files in random folders all of the user PC while it&#39;s running just so it can shut itself down if it detects Defender in use &#34;for support reasons&#34;.All the top EDR products in the world and all the hardening advice you can find can go down the toilet pretty quickly if you let vendors tell you how to run these products - ignoring them is a highly rated hardening tip."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My firm belief is the that hardware vendors do end users a disservice by preloading 3rd party anti-virus software that expires ans requires payment after a period of time for virus signature updates.   Typically this 3rd party software disables Defender, so once the pre-installed AV trial runs out, the user is exposed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;But we should keep in mind that the virologists publishing papers downplaying the possibility of a lab leak are not disinterested parties in this. The political context is a debate about regulating virus labs, and it’s hardly shocking that a large segment of the virus lab community doesn’t like that idea.&#34;This, I think, is the crux of our problem.  Almost anyone who knows enough about the field to have an informed opinion, is involved enough to have an incentive to convince the world that it was not their profession, that unleashed this.  Scientists are human, not demons but also not angels.  It would be hard to convince yourself, that your profession was responsible for this.  We should listen to what they have to say, but not expect them to be dispassionate and unbiased investigators of the question."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why is this being discussed now? Matt Yglesias has publicly admitted that this piece is flawed. This is critically important context that is being missed by everyone in this discussion:‘…SIGNIFICANT factual error in my newsletter.’‘…we knew specifically that RaTG13 samples had been brought to the Wuhan Institute of Virology and studied there.That is not the case for this Laos virus.To me that discovery really does meaningfully detract from the plausibility of the lab leak story and I apologize — I simply missed this when it came out and failed to update my views.‘https://mobile.twitter.com/mattyglesias/status/1499467534202..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just couldn&#39;t take the &#34;research&#34; seriously when I read this:&gt; They said they found no support for an alternate theory that the coronavirus escaped from a laboratory in Wuhan.No support? Really? Not just &#34;weak&#34; support, but not a single shred of support whatsoever? So it&#39;s just a hoax?There&#39;s a long article going into what would be otherwise some very strange and implausible coincidences [1] surrounding the issue for those curious. Surely unbiased research into the topic would deem these to be worthy of at least some cursory mentions (and ideally, some debunking)?Moreover, this might be an interesting read:In January 2018, the U.S. Embassy in Beijing took the unusual step of repeatedly sending U.S. science diplomats to the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV), which had in 2015 become China’s first laboratory to achieve the highest level of international bioresearch safety (known as BSL-4). WIV issued a news release in English about the last of these visits, which occurred on March 27, 2018. The U.S. delegation was led by Jamison Fouss, the consul general in Wuhan, and Rick Switzer, the embassy’s counselor of environment, science, technology and health. Last week, WIV erased that statement from its website, though it remains archived on the Internet. [...] During interactions with scientists at the WIV laboratory, they noted the new lab has a serious shortage of appropriately trained technicians and investigators needed to safely operate this high-containment laboratory.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have a similar freakish ability, but mine has to do with writing. I can basically ~see~ approximately three pages of prose in my mind&#39;s eye while writing. It only works under certain conditions, but it feels just like I&#39;m transcribing something rather then doing any kind of deliberate thinking. People are shocked what comes out of me, and even more so when they see how quickly it happens. You would need to see me in person to experience the full effect, but my body does not match my words. Imagine the biggest lumberjack you&#39;ve ever seen describing the petals of a flower with such high precision that it takes your breath away. That&#39;s me. I&#39;ve started to slowly nurture this talent, because it finally occurred to me that it might be special."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I caution against looking at numbers in any single way. The more different ways you can visualize math concepts, the better. Practice seeing them in different ways.Sometimes numbers are for quantifying a pile of things, and 255 and 256 are basically the same.Sometimes numbers are for cryptographically signing things, and 255 is extremely secure while 256 is completely vulnerable.Sometimes numbers are for arranging tournaments, and 256 is a tremendously useful number while 255 is super annoying and you should look for another.Sometimes numbers are stored in a single byte, and 256 (=0) is the friendliest number you will ever know, while 255&#39;s words are BACKED BY NUCLEAR WEAPONS.Sometimes infinity is a useful number, sometimes it&#39;s not. Sometimes 1/2 is a useful number (pies), sometimes it&#39;s not (babies).  Sometimes sqrt(-1) is a useful number, sometimes it&#39;s not. Sometimes the sum of all positive integers equals -1/12; sometimes that&#39;s stupid.All of these situations may call for visualizing numbers differently."</p>

I work with complex numbers by just breaking them down into multiple steps.Now I’m wondering if I should challenge my brain to do this differently."</p>
