								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m pretty skeptical of most of the Pro-Assange reporting that happens because so often it seems very unreliable - cherry picking things, misrepresenting things etc. For example, I don&#39;t know enough about the Assange charges to say what is relevant or not relevant to the extradition, but just from a basic premise - what most people know Assange for is nothing to do with hacking Iceland MPs so it seems pretty unlikely that this would be a material part of the extradition. It would be kind of weird if that were a core part of the extradition, yet this article seems to be making out this is the star witness. I just doubt it frankly.It doesn&#39;t help the author that they repeat tired old accusations about the judge being biased."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t think the problem is with the &#34;lie&#34; that the innocent need not fear surveillance. Most people will agree that mass-surveillance will negatively affect some people that are indispensable to healthily functioning liberal society: journalists, activists, academics, public figures...The problem is that even if most people don&#39;t subscribe to the &#34;nothing to hide&#34; argument in general, they do not care about themselves being the target of surveillance.Having unsuccessfully tried to make family and acquaintances more aware of privacy issue, I can confidently say that the &#34;nothing to hide&#34; argument is nothing next to the &#34;I don&#39;t care&#34; attitude. It&#39;s not just being the target of a wrongful accusation, arguments about unintended public shaming, identity theft, negative economic consequences (higher insurance premium or mortgage rates if your bank has more information about you), none of it will work.I think there is some sort of a Tverskyan study to be done here about expected value and perceived risk. Overall for most people the equation is always: (probability of data being mishandled) * damage &lt; time and effort required to maintain my privacy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a fight we are only ever gonna lose.I.e. in Germany, I have seen wave after wave of surveillance passed. People try to fight back each time. Often the supreme court cancels the unconstitutional laws.But they always try again. And it only takes a football euro cup or Worldcup, or Olympic games or a natural catastrophy to provide the distraction for the public to pass another law.Our governments want to surveil us, and they will do it whether we like it or not.People only stand up and fight if the damage if the fight is smaller than the damage of what they are fighting against. We live comfortable, so we will take a lot of this type of immoral behaviour of our leaders. The figth will only start after enough innocent surveillance victims are harmed in the real world (i.e. their data is leaked or worse) and enough people have felt negative consequences of this surveillance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hopefully some will ask themselves why the &#34;beacon of democracy&#34; in the region is so ready and open to sell tools used almost solely to prevent the spread of true democracy to their neighbours? And then maybe we should all have a long hard think about how this translates to our own disgusting arms industries as a whole."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If I understand the story correctly, they had the suspect in custody and yet failed to positively ID him, relying on an ID he had stolen from an innocent man named Ousmane Bah.  The ID had no photo and was labeled &#34;not to be used for identification&#34;.  SIS filed a police report which said they had video evidence showing the perpetrator.They then put out a &#34;BOLO&#34; with the innocent man&#39;s name, had him arrested, figured out they have the wrong guy, do nothing about it and had him arrested again.When Bah appeared in court to answer charges and Apple was asked to present the video that would have cleared Bah, Apple claimed that the video had been deleted.  The video was later found by Bah&#39;s attorney during discovery.  This happened more than once.  A warrant was issued for Bah’s arrest and contained the photo of the imposter.  Bah was arrested even though the he doesn&#39;t resemble the imposter, other than being Black.  Prosecution against Bah continued in multiple states through June 2019.Hmmm, seems like a lot of people involved in this case should be fired, including the Apple Employees, SIS Employees and Police officers, reguardless of whatever other outcomes there are."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Apple then told the Suffolk County prosecutor &#34;that the video evidence of the impostor, which would have completely exculpated Ousmane Bah, had been routinely deleted.&#34;Why would anyone routinely delete evidence of crime instead of making a copy of it before it was deleted? What&#39;s the point of having surveillance equipment and footage if it&#39;s just routinely deleted even if there was a theft?&gt;The video from an October 2018 theft misattributed to Bah in Rockaway, New Jersey, was also deleted.Oh wow, again?&gt;And as it turned out, the video of the Boston incident turned up eventually – Bah&#39;s attorneys found it during the discovery process. It showed the impostor, not Bah.They should open a criminal investigation into what happened with the video. Intentionally accusing someone they know to be innocent, taking their time and freedom is completely inexcusable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;identified the individual as Ousmane Bah based on the examination of the temporary learner&#39;s permit he is said to have had on himSo essentially a kid stole another kids ID. Because the (thieving) kid had gotten in trouble with the same ID before it was also a match in the database.It does seem like a true failure but the headline makes it sound like this was an AI falsely accusing someone based on pure randomness. Even without the tech, the police would have had the name of the wrongly accused person because the security guard only had the fake/wrong ID and the person&#39;s ability to match faces was not great."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I recently had the privilege of trying to do the right thing when I identified fraudulent research carried out by an institution in Austria. The initial response of the institution was positive but when I pressed for further details on how such things could happen suddenly nobody anymore would take my call. The research was paid for by a private company to pimp a nonsense product. The research was never published in a research journal but it didn&#39;t stop the company using the name of the university alonside exerpts from the paper in marketing material alongside gushing claims of &#34;proved by science&#34;.The company threatened to sue me and the university threatened me as well. Neither has followed through on threats. The company wants to keep selling their rubbish magnetic health ding ding and I assume the university wants nobody to look into how positive results for the product came out of their institution. Allround an education on how the real world works."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When you want to do a proper work, your grants and papers get rejected because they are not innovatove enough or don&#39;t go far enough. So it is not a surprise that people that lied in their applications about what they can realistically do also lie when it comes to reporting results. Unfortunately there is no way out. I stopped counting how many reviewers of my grants disagreed on what was proposed, one saying that it was not innovative, the other saying that is was too risky to use this approach. We have a big problem in science, peer-review is broken and everything relies on it. And many reviewers are way out of touch about what happens in their field, I see reviews that clearly show the reviewer was sleeping for the last 10 years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had the &#34;privilege&#34; of reviewing a certain piece of software written to model a certain pandemic outbreak...Numerical modelling in biology/virology feels rife with serious problems that are simply sidestepped because of ego and status. I raised alarms and as merely a senior expert in distributed computation and numerical modelling I was shutdown quite strongly. After the group in question were forced to accept our published work refuting their results to be FUBAR due to severe numerical instabilities which hadn&#39;t even been checked for we were shut out for a group who patted them on the back for being &#34;oh so clever&#34;...(our published work numerically demonstrated results they were presenting as fact were compatible with statistical noise and that it is known they didn&#39;t have the required extra 100xcompute or 100xtime to produce results as precise as what they were after)Had a similar experience a few years ago with a geological modelling group and a group hoping to do biochemistry on a huge cluster of 20k cpu cores.
For all of the &#34;numerical sciences&#34; achievements only really physics and chemistry (and maths) seem to have championed the ideas of reproducibility and falsifiability in numerical analysis and simulation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"In a sea of cynicism, I gotta say.. bravo. This genuinely put a smile on my face. It has a lot of problems, sure, but it&#39;s a creative use of the Web and would surely work for some use cases. It&#39;s certainly no worse than using Flash ever was.It reminds me a bit of a &#34;newsletter&#34; I&#39;m subscribed to called, ironically, &#34;Not a Newsletter&#34; (http://notanewsletter.com/). You get an email from the author each month and it just points to a Google Doc where he puts the actual content. Why&#39;s this good?

I cannot do that.Realistically, how many years will I have to wait until Firefox catches up?Over twenty years ago, I learnt Web authoring by examining the source which had a profound effect on my career.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Curious to see comments quipping that some of the math problems geared towards young kids are too hard. I&#39;d recommend taking a look at Singapore Math[0] to get an idea of what kids in those age ranges are actually capable of doing, provided that adults shed preconceptions that children ought to be &#34;sheltered from hard scary stuff&#34;, and instead encourage them.There are also great math-oriented games these days (I had some good success w/ prodigygame.com[1]).My youngest daughter is 6 and can solve simple multiplication and division problems. Sometimes she even surprises me. Some time ago, we were introducing ourselves to a new neighbor and the convo went somewhat along these lines:- my son: how old is your dog?- neighbor: she&#39;s 8- son: she&#39;s so small, is she a puppy?- neighbor: oh no, she&#39;s grown up. 1 dog year is about 7 human years, so-- daughter [interrupting]: oh wow, so then she is 56!The other day, she came to me beaming to explain how she had just solved 38/2 (by doing 40/2, 2/2 and subtracting the results). Gotta say it&#39;s a joy to see a kid that enjoys math.[0] https://www.singaporemath.com/[1] https://www.prodigygame.com/main-en/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On a related subject, here is a recent experience and I dont know how to deal with it.I have been helping my kids with their homework during the pandemic, I thought it would be easy since I got very good grade 25+ years ago. And then when I sat down doing it. I couldn&#39;t remember a thing. Not a single thing. All of a sudden, apart from basic algebra, all of the maths were gone. Zip, Zero. I couldn&#39;t remember how sin cos tan works any more. It was like a few years of memory in my brain went missing. For some people it may be funny and have a laugh about it. For me it was shocking, quite horrifying and depressing.I am thinking if I should relearn all those maths again. If so how do you go about it? Most of my friends aren&#39;t any good at maths so they thought not remembering any thing was not a problem.But for some strange reason all the basic for Physics, Chemistry and Biology were still there. At least half of it. It was just maths. I dont know if anyone else have similar experience."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These problems are very simple and surprisingly fun to work with. Their purpose is to develop &#34;thinking culture&#34; (Arnold says this in the intro). He also writes that &#34;the worst at solving these simple problems are Nobel and Fields prize winners&#34; :) Now, I think that&#39;s Russian hyperbole or poetic licence, if you will, but it does illustrate an issue I run into nearly daily teaching maths to 13 - 15 year olds: Some of the kids think in ways I have a hard time understanding and often solve problems in ways which are difficult for me to grok because they are not using mathematical language to explain what they&#39;re doing. This happens especially with kids who generally perform poorly in maths. They solve problems similar to these in ways I have a lot of trouble understanding because it&#39;s like we are speaking two different languages. These problems are trivially easy if you translate them into simple equations (the ones I&#39;ve done, anyway). The problem is I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what Arnold means when he says &#34;Thinking culture&#34;, so I suspect I might be cheating ;)Edit: Nr. 13 is wonderful :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My shield updated to this the other day. I&#39;m pretty furious about it, it&#39;s not a cheap device, and it&#39;s certainly not Google&#39;s. To be adding these &#34;features&#34; without asking, irrespective of whatever agreement between me, Nvidia or Google exists, is ridiculous.I know it&#39;s in whatever terms I, uh, &#34;accepted&#34;, but there&#39;s just no escaping it in this day and age.Fortunately, I know how to use ADB and just installed another launcher, but most other people just have to bend over and take it. No doubt ADB tricks won&#39;t be sufficient in future updates and I&#39;ll be playing more silly games with a device I own.Apple is seems almost as bad too. There&#39;s recommendations that I don&#39;t want. It&#39;s certainly worse in that I would have even less control and be unable to remove them.It&#39;s certainly a good thing that I don&#39;t live anywhere near a Google office, otherwise I&#39;d be launching this POS through one of their windows if I did."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve had the Shield for years and set them up for a few family members. I still believe it&#39;s the best device of its kind on the market and I&#39;ve recommended it every chance so I have a lot of friends with them as well.In the most recent update, the until-now ad-free homepage was defaced with an ad banner that takes up half the screen and can&#39;t be removed. This wasn&#39;t a change made by Nvidia but by Google to the Android TV Launcher. To add to this, some of the ads have been deemed inappropriate or offensive to certain users adding to the frustration of ads being introduced to this long-standing ad-free experience.I, like many Shield owners, am considering installing a third party launcher. This can be done pretty easily by watching an instruction video on Youtube and most users will go this route without consideration of security - potentially opening large numbers of the devices up to vulnerabilities."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;Test your backups&#34; is so easy to say, but quite difficult for many to do. There are a lot of shops that probably don&#39;t know how to recreate a machine from scratch. How many systems are developed as balls of clay. Little bits added and smeared in over time until the ball just gets bigger, but each piece lost in the process. How many folks can go through their local config files and explain all of entries, how many can even tell which ones they have changed, or why? Especially when they were changed by Frank, but he left 2 years ago.You&#39;d like to think you can just restore the system from backup and it&#39;ll just light back up. But how do you test this without cratering your existing system? Like a boat in a basement, many system are built in-situ and can be very rigid.Modern environments like cloud computing and creation scripts can mitigate this a bit organically, but how many of these systems are just a tower running Windows w/SQL Server and who knows what else? Plus whatever client software is on the client machines.How do you test that in isolation?At least read the media to see if it can be read (who doesn&#39;t love watching a backup tape fail halfway through the restore).Simply, it takes a lot of engineering to make a system that can be reliably restored, much less on a frequent basis. And this is all engineering that doesn&#39;t impact the actual project -- getting features to users and empowering the business. Which can make the task even more difficult."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing I&#39;ve always wondered: How do you prevent ransomware from ruining your backups, too?Lots of ransomware tends to be &#34;delayed&#34; – it can&#39;t encrypt everything instantly, so it encrypts a little bit each minute. During those minutes, isn&#39;t it conceivable that the now-encrypted files replace your old backups?I suppose this isn&#39;t really a &#34;backup&#34; but rather a &#34;mirroring strategy.&#34; But for certain kinds of data -- photos, video, large media -- can you really afford to do any other kind of strategy?The other question I have is related to that first point: since ransomware can&#39;t encrypt everything all at once, how is it possible for your system to continue to function? As you can tell, I&#39;m a ransomware noob, but it&#39;s quite interesting to me from an engineering standpoint. Does the system get into a &#34;half encrypted&#34; state where, if you rebooted it, it would fail to boot at all? Or does ransomware targeted at businesses tend to be more of a surgical strike, where it targets and wipes out specific datastores before anyone notices?(It&#39;s the &#34;before anyone notices&#34; part that I&#39;m especially curious about. Isn&#39;t there some kind of alarm that could be raised more or less instantly, because something detects unexpected binary blobs being created on your disk?)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This really hits home, decades ago - I was working at this place that did daily tape backups.  I remember thinking, this is unreal - there&#39;s literally a room filled with tapes.One day, I asked if they ever had performed a recovery off of the tapes, as I questioned if the tapes were even being written to.  (NOTE:  Backups was not my job at all. )Why had I brought this up?  I would be in the server room and never saw the blinky lights on the tape...well.. blink. Everyone literally laughed at me, thought was a grade A moron.A year later, servers died... Pop&#39;ed in the tape... Blank.  No worries, they had thousands more of these tapes.  Sadly, they were all MT.  They had to ship hard drives to a recovery shop, and it was rather expensive.I left shortly after this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Congrats!I tried Julia for the first time last week and it was great.I&#39;ve been playing with the idea of defining a hash function for lists that can be composed with other hashes to find the hash of the concatenation of the lists. I tried to do this with matrix multiplication of the hash of each list item, but with integer mod 256 elements random matrices are very likely to be singular and after enough multiplications degenerates to the zero matrix. However, with finite field (aka Galois fields) elements, such a matrix is much more likely to be invertible and therefore not degenerate. But I don&#39;t really know anything about finite fields, so how should I approach it? Here&#39;s where Julia comes in: with some help I was able to combine two libraries, LinearAlgebraX.jl which has functions for matrices with exact elements, with GaloisFields.jl which implements many types of GF, and wrote up a working demo implementation of this &#34;list hash&#34; idea in a Pluto.jl  [2] notebook and published it [0] (and a question on SO [1]) after a few days without having any Julia experience at all. Julia seems pretty approachable, has great libraries, and is very powerful (I was even able to do a simple multithreaded implementation in 5 lines).[0]: https://blog.infogulch.com/2021/07/15/Merklist-GF.html[1]: https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/92139/using-rando...[2]: https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I played with Julia a bit in grad school. Although I didn&#39;t end up using it much after that I thought it was a lovely language. Forget python, I hope Julia manages to kill off Matlab and its weird stranglehold on various pockets of academia. Congrats to the team here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Congrats to the Julia team.I am a python developer who has dabbled with Julia but it never stuck for me.I think Julia was built by academics for other academics running innovative high performance computing tasks. It excels at the intersection of 1) big data, so speed is important, and 2) innovative code, so you can&#39;t just use someone else&#39;s C package. Indeed, Julia&#39;s biggest successful applications outside academica closely resemble an academic HPC project (eg Pumas). I think it will continue to have success in that niche. And that&#39;s not a small niche! Maybe it&#39;s enough to support a billion dollar company.But most of us in industry are not in that niche. Most companies are not dealing with truly big data, on our scale, it is cheaper to expand the cluster than it is to rewrite everything in Julia. Most who ARE dealing with truly big data, do not need innovative code; basic summary statistics and logistic regression will be good enough, or maybe some cloud provider&#39;s prepackaged turn key neural nets scale out training system if they want to do something fancy.I think for Julia to have an impact outside of academia (and academia-like things in industry) it will need to develop killer app packages. The next PyTorch needs to be written in Julia. Will that happen? Maybe! I hope so! The world would be better off with more cool data science packages.But I think the sales pitch of &#34;it&#39;s like Pandas and scikit but faster!&#34; is not going to win many converts. So is Jax, Numba, Dask, Ray, Pachyderm, and the many other attempts within the Python community of scaling and speeding Python, that require much less work and expense on my part for the same outcome.Again, congrats to the team, I will continue to follow Julia closely, and I&#39;m excited to see what innovative capabilities come out of the Julia ecosystem for data scientists like me."</p>
