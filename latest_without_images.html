								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It was a mistake to attack the business side of the oil company, because it created what could be sold as reasonable doubt to shut down the pipeline.As a result, the ransom had the optics of an attack on infrastructure. As evidenced by the coverage of Americans desperately filling up containers.This created the impetus for the US to treat this as an incident far and above the ambient ransomware activities leading up to this.It also gave the US an opportunity to show how effective it could be when it had the political cover to do so."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The REvil representative said its program was introducing new restrictions on the kinds of organizations that affiliates could hold for ransom, and that henceforth it would be forbidden to attack those in the “social sector” (defined as healthcare and educational institutions) and organizations in the “gov-sector” (state) of any country. Affiliates also will be required to get approval before infecting victims.Statements like this seem to point to ransomware activities being far more coordinated and &#34;business-like&#34; than they often get credit for.I do wonder if ransomware is (in a strange way) a(n illegal) free-market response to what is perceived to be an under-valuation of tech skills - aggrieved people who can carry out attacks and gain access to deploy ransomware are likely to be able to earn more through this route, even factoring in their &#34;risk of being caught&#34;.If a market correction occurs (ransomware becomes a real fear, organisations rapidly start to value security skills more and pay &#34;megabucks&#34; for the skills and hire them at-scale), the risk/reward of being caught starts to mean access brokers reduce in number, and the compensation reaches a free market equilibrium (accounting for the &#34;getting caught&#34; risk of criminal activity).A lot of the time I still see people trying to hire entry-level people into live/ operational security roles, without the experience they&#39;d need. I wonder if this is partly due to a desire to cut costs, rather than accept the need to pay rock-star compensation?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; “There’s too much publicity,” the XSS administrator explained. “Ransomware has gathered a critical mass of nonsense, bullshit, hype, and fuss around it. The word ‘ransomware’ has been put on a par with a number of unpleasant phenomena, such as geopolitical tensions, extortion, and government-backed hacks. This word has become dangerous and toxic.”I am... flabbergasted.  What?  Ransomware has always been a brand of extortion; it&#39;s right there in the name.  Extortion has become dangerous and toxic?  You have got to be kidding me.  I wonder what&#39;s next for these folks.  A life of simple, honest, pleasant and non-toxic crime?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Congratulations!I always have great respect for Scala because itself and the community tried to adopt and push the novel idea in the industry. Take a look at the changes, they&#39;re no joke to design and implement. At the same time, they&#39;re also trying to make the language consistent and simple. (Yes, I mean simple, not easy or single-paradigmed)They are taking the hard way, and not only there are not enough people to appreciate the effort, but also attract some hatred from time to time. I hope Scala 3 would bring us and itself a bright future, and inspire more languages to move forward.(For example, there are a lot of type features added to TypeScript in most releases because it needs to do the typing on existing dynamically typed languages, it may also be a hint that dependent type actually makes sense in mainstream languages)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m so psyched about this. I&#39;ve followed the development of Scala 3 for pretty much the whole voyage, and I think they&#39;ve done an incredible job bringing the community along through some pretty radical changes to the language. It has definitely not been an easy process herding a community with very big, informed, divergent opinions on the language.In the end, I think they did an awesome job. Many, many sacred cows of old Scala were confronted. I think the result is a much more approachable language, where simple things are easier."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Amazing!!! Great to see Scala improving at such a fast pace!I&#39;m especially excited about union/intersection types. I think we could all witness how well they work out in typescript and I believe that every language with the concept of subtyping should have this feature. It is one of the things that make working in a statically typed language feel much more dynamic/lightweight without giving up on safety guarantees."</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27149123">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Apart from the threading model, I love Zulip for its openness.
It&#39;s quite sad Slack and Discord are often the first choice for open communities. They are siloed and unless you are deliberately searching in a specific workspace, you&#39;ll never run into the information in a search engine.In comparison, Zulip:- provides HTML export functionality https://github.com/zulip/zulip-archive#zulip-html-archive (example https://leanprover-community.github.io/archive )- URLs are nice and encode meaning (e.g. https://memex.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/279601-hpi/topic/...)
  ... compare with Slack/Discord meaningless character sequences- I&#39;m excited about https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/4817 , which would allow viewing workspaces in &#39;guest&#39; mode, without registering at all"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was skeptical about Zulip when I first tried it. What is it supposed to be? A chat? A forum? Why is the UI so ugly?But after using it a while I now really dislike Slack et al, both in professional teams and for open source communities.Zulip can give you the best of both worlds. It&#39;s a regular chat. But the threading model also encourages long-form, more forum or email like discussions.Threads are easily discoverable and it&#39;s trivial to catch up on all the relevant discussions that you missed, while skipping everything that doesn&#39;t concern you.You can still have some regular chat channels for typical ephemeral discussion that no-one is expected to read. It&#39;s really a great tool.The only downside is the very subpar UX when compared to Discord or even Slack."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The &#34;threaded&#34; part is key here. Slack threads are useless compared to Zulip. In Zulip you can create threads on the fly from existing messages, so if discussion starts diverging you can turn it into a new thread. It&#39;s just a fundamentally superior model."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I fell prey to this. Might have been the exact same website, too. Had had a drink with dinner, thought heck why not file for my EIN for an independent consulting LLC I was creating? Was using a fresh OS install where I hadn&#39;t yet installed Firefox with an adblocker. Usual defenses were weakened. Boom, $250 down the drain before I really thought it all through. Fortunately I was able to get it refunded by initiating a chargeback and telling their website support that I believed they were misrepresenting themselves as the IRS. It really was a &#34;welcome to the real world&#34; moment, though - my very first act as a new business in the US was to get scammed. This theme has continued. 90% of the business mail I get are scams masquerading as official government mail to get business licenses or whatever. These websites are run by scumbags who should all be arrested. And Google, of course, should pay actual penalties because it&#39;s been all upside for them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a hard time trying to understand why governments don’t address these scams more proactively.There is a related issue when you register a new company here in Germany: As soon as the new entity is added to the company house (called “Handelsregister”), you will start to receive fake invoices from scam companies.These invoice look very similar to official ones and some even use the official seal of the state (see https://www.firma.de/en/company-formation/beware-of-fake-han... for examples).If you don’t pay close attention you can easily mistake these invoice for official ones.This scam is quite well-known and has been going on for years. To further add to the insult - the companies that send these fake invoices are usually German entities as well, not some obscure shell companies in remote islands and yet besides warnings from the government it seems that little is happening.I find it infuriating and don’t understand why it is even allowed to send another party that you never had any relation with an invoice for a service that you actually haven’t performed yet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I teach everyone in my family to never trust the first few sponsored results now matter how convincing they may be. As far as I’m concerned Google know exactly what they’re doing and are actively complicit in perpetuating online scams against one family and friends. Are we seriously supposed to believe a company of their size, with their talent pool, and their money, can’t filter out such blatantly obvious crap? Sure."</p>

I&#39;ll probably be more inconvenienced by the mitigations that will surely result that make it that much more painful to actually launch a URL scheme, sadly.I&#39;ve actually never checked the &#34;Always open Slack for slack:// links&#34; or similar checkboxes, precisely out of predicting shenanigans like this would happen eventually :)I wouldn&#39;t be too offended if browsers changed the way they handle schemes: always open a &#34;how would you like to handle  this link&#34; dialog for any protocol (even if unhandled - like how Windows shows the &#34;how would you like to open this file&#34; dialog), to disguise whether the protocol is handled or not.  Not sure I have the answer for user convenience though if someone is used to things automatically opening. That&#39;s the &#34;inconvenience&#34; aspect of any potential mitigation, we probably have to get rid of that &#34;remember this choice&#34; checkbox (well, my point is that &#34;have to&#34; is debatable here)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love Syncthing. I have abysmally slow home internet, so any cloud storage service simply takes too long to sync, and trying to do the first sync of 150 GB takes many weeks. Besides, none of these services (dropbox, onedrive) support ignore files, so they&#39;re constantly syncing node_modules folders, etc.Instead, I have Syncthing set to sync a half-dozen folders (Pictures, desktop, documents, audiobooks, etc.) between my phone, laptop, and desktop over the local network. In total, I sync more than 150 GB of files and it works almost instantly and seamlessly. I use the SyncTrayzor GUI for Windows and the Syncthing app for Android. The Android app occasionally needs to be restarted manually, but that&#39;s the only problem I&#39;ve had with it.Importantly, I keep local copies of everything on all of my devices, including my phone (256 GB storage plus a microSD card slot which I have yet to need). Lack of support for Syncthing on iPhones is one major reason I stick with Android, even though there&#39;s a lot to like about the platform. Once it gets too big I&#39;ll move a bunch of old stuff to backup/archive drives, but I don&#39;t expect that to happen for a while.Now, I use Google Photos to selectively share photos with others, and that&#39;s it."</p>
