I 100% support youtube-dl and I want YouTube to stop interfering with it, but I also think we&#39;re being a little too cute when we pretend like ytdl isn&#39;t circumventing anything... it seems obvious to me that YouTube is trying to put up roadblocks and we&#39;re trying to get around them. I would feel better if we could find a way to defend ytdl without the pretense of acting like this cat-and-mouse game isn&#39;t going on.[0] https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2020/11/2020-11-1..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"An example that needs to be in the textbooks. A detailed explanation and a timeline along with the code snippets. It succinctly shows you the complexities involved. Kudos to Max for putting it all into the post.&gt; Blaming the Linux kernel (i.e. somebody else’s code) for data corruption must be the last resort.^^^ I can only image the stress levels at this point."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"10 years ago I found even more outrageous bug in Windows 8.I was working in MSFT back than and I was writing a tool that produced 10 GB of data in TSV format , that I wanted to stream into gzip so that later this file would be sent over the network. When the other side received the file they would gunzip it successfully, but inside there would be mostly correct TSV data with some chunks of random binary garbage. Turned out that pipe operator was somehow causing this.As a responsible citizen I tried to report it to the right team and there I ran into problems. Apparently no one in Windows wants to deal with bugs. IIt was ridiculously hard to report this while being an employee, I can&#39;t imagine anyone being able to report similar bugs from outside. And even though I reported that bug I saw no activity in it when I was leaving the company.However I just tried to quickly reproduce it on Windows 10 and it wouldn&#39;t reproduce. Maybe I forgot some details of that bug or maybe indeed they fixed this by now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another example of a vulnerability that is purposefully obfuscated in the commit log. It is an insane practice that needs to die. The Linux kernel maintainers have been doing this for decades and it&#39;s now a standard practice for upstream.This gives attackers an advantage (they are incentivized to read commits and can easily see the vuln) and defenders a huge disadvantage. Now I have to rush to patch whereas attackers have had this entire time to build their POCs and exploit systems.End this ridiculous practice."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m not opposed to this. I&#39;m opposed to the West imposing its IP regime on the world. I&#39;m supportive of Western copyrights, patents, trademarks, and trade secrets in the US and Western Europe. However, the concept of IP ownership -- let alone specifics of how its structured -- are a cultural and human construct.Other countries should be free to figure out other ways of doing this.Very little of this existed prior to around 1700. It&#39;s a relatively recent construct too (although there are some historical parallels).I&#39;m not at all convinced we&#39;ll make much progress as society if we impose our values on everyone, and expect everyone to behave the same way. There are fundamentals and externalities -- the war on Ukraine is wrong, and we should intervene. However, on something like having IP law, let alone breaking it up into copyrights/patents/trademarks, let alone stating durations and contexts of all of those, this just seems like overreach.I feel like this is one of those places where corporate lobbyists managed to change people&#39;s values in a way which is quite unfortunate. People learn about IP theft in elementary school, it gets integrated into UN human rights documents, and something which is really culturally-dependent is viewed as universal. It wasn&#39;t viewed this way when I was a child.Even little things make a big difference. We&#39;ve gone from &#34;copyright infringement&#34; to words like stealing and theft. They&#39;re fundamentally different concepts which were intentionally mixed up. If I steal from you, you no longer have what I&#39;ve stolen. If I copy your software, you still have it; I might just have deprived you of profits (if I had otherwise bought the software).I&#39;m not arguing against the IP regime in the US/EU, or for breaking IP laws. I&#39;m just arguing we shouldn&#39;t force our IP regime on everyone else."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m tired of the TnT Russian team cracking my macOS apps. Both Lunar (https://lunar.fyi) and rcmd (https://lowtechguys.com/rcmd) are now available for free on macOS piracy websites.I made many attempts at discouraging this through anti-piracy measures I learned while working as a malware researcher a few years ago. But if I want my apps to also be available on offline devices, there&#39;s really no way to combat this.The apps are also targetted more toward power users which are more likely to know about cracked apps. This is really hurting indie devs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Devils advocate: if the majority of business software is sold from the US and the US is refusing to sell software to Russia, what choice is there?I’m sure the Russian government are using Microsoft Office, if they can’t legally buy it anymore then they must make the piracy of it legal: or they’re breaking their own laws.Or they retrain on open/libreoffice. But that unfortunately has a poor track record of working.As staunch of a FOSS advocate as I am, this is probably the sensible move for now. :/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Are there any &#34;math for people who just want to use it&#34; tracks in math pedagogy? I don&#39;t care a bit about proving any of it&#39;s true, or even reading others proofs of same. &#34;Recognize which tool to apply, then apply tool&#34;, all focused on real-world use (so, yes, it wouldn&#39;t be &#34;real&#34; mathematics). That&#39;s the math education I&#39;d like—try as I might, I just can&#39;t make myself care even a little about math for math&#39;s sake.I&#39;ve got Mathematics for the Nonmathematician by Kline and that&#39;s kinda heading the right way, but what about whole courses of study? More books? It&#39;s more of an introduction than a thorough resource or course, and feels like it needs another four or five volumes and a lot more exercises to be really useful.I want a mathematics education designed for all those kids (likely a large majority?) who spent math from about junior high on wondering, aloud or to themselves, why the hell they were spending so much time learning all this. One that puts that question front and center and doesn&#39;t teach a single thing without answering it really well, first."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I went from only having done high school math 10 years ago to completing an MS in math and statistics at my local state university while working in an unrelated field. I would recommend NOT starting with calculus if you haven’t done it, instead, just learn how to do proofs - I used Chartrand “Mathematical proofs” - You don’t need to know any math beyond algebra in order to do that most of this book. If you need to revise or learn Algebra, then I would do Stroud “engineering math” first which is designed for self-learners with lots of solutions and feedback.At some point, it would be good to get a a copy of Lyx and start to learn to write math in LaTeX - Then you can get feedback on your proofs online at math.stackexchange.com if you don’t know any math people locally.Feel free to get in touch with me if you want to discuss further, happy to help!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I loved last year being able to take university courses online. I knocked out analysis, topology, and quantum mechanics as a non matriculated student. I&#39;d had those books for years but never could get through them alone. (The main thing being, you really don&#39;t have anything to gague whether you know it well enough or not).I really wish there was more opportunity for that. I&#39;d love to take a few more classes, mostly in pure math, but there&#39;s simply nothing on offer for remote study past the 200ish level. (There are some remote masters programs in applied math, but nothing for pure).I don&#39;t think I&#39;d enjoy doing a PhD full-time. One or two classes per semester while working seems just about right. But the closest university is an hour away, so in-person isn&#39;t a realistic option."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;Britain last year backed a $546 million funding round at the company to develop the country&#39;s first small modular nuclear reactor (SMR), part of its drive to reach net zero carbon emissions and promote new technology with export potential.&#34;Cool. Although I foresee exporting this technology will be difficult as far as fuel and waste supply chain goes. Having the possibility of multiple new, smaller countries receive nuclear power makes moving fuel and waste across multiple borders more difficult. Also, protecting the technology so it doesn&#39;t fall into the wrong hands becomes more difficult as well (assuming these things can enrich uranium).&#34;Each mini plant can power around one million homes...&#34;.This is where I did a spit take. I was really underestimating the capacity for these &#34;mini&#34; reactors. Being able to power so many homes (and being more centralized than I thought) means these reactors would still require huge infrastructure investment in order to spread the power."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like it, because the world is not going to reduce its suicidal dependency on fossil fuels with just renewable energy (solar, wind, tidal...).  Safe(r) and cheaper nuclear reactors could bridge the gap.But, I do wish the development of thorium based nuclear reactors would be accelerated, so we can stop with the primarily uranium nuclear reactors that have the capacity of dual use for helping to make nuclear weapons (which the world has enough of).  Additionally, thorium is safer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These moves should probably be considered in context of the UK&#39;s collapsed/collapsing ability to produce energy [0]. These stats are a bit laggy, but it looks like they&#39;re being choked out of any sort of industrial relevance to anything.It is hard for me to imagine how that doesn&#39;t translate into a crisis of living standards. Either they&#39;re directly losing the ability to secure people comfortable lives, or they are losing the ability to export valuable products and becoming more vulnerable to foreign pressure. They literally can&#39;t have goods and services without energy.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_in_the_United_Kingdom#O... - the table here is a jaw dropper, looks like they are deindustrialising."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve investigated network equipment before, my findings were that you shouldn&#39;t trust any of it and use a standard Linux box whenever possible. The worst was consumer-grade modems/routers with low-hanging fruits such as backdoors, &#34;forgotten&#34; telnet servers left enabled, shell command injection in the web UI, etc but even enterprise stuff had its problems (thankfully, at least on enterprise stuff you can disable the web UI and any services you don&#39;t use, considerably shrinking the attack surface to pretty much just the kernel). And don&#39;t get me started on mobile network equipment where untrusted data is parsed at the kernel level and the motto is still security by obscurity (and the impossibility to obtain said equipment for the average Joe).What I think happened is that they breached the control infrastructure which gives them access to an &#34;internal&#34; VLAN that the satellite terminals use to communicate with the mothership for firmware updates, configuration changes, etc, and from there were able to attack these as if they were locally connected (or worse - since that network segment is presumed &#34;internal&#34; and may expose services not normally available - think whatever is the TR-069 equivalent for BGAN terminals), either just pushing an incorrect configuration that prevents the terminal from connecting (essentially bricking it until you can get out-of-band access and reconfigure it properly) or obtaining root (via exploit or pushing a specially-crafted firmware update) and overwriting /dev/mtd* to completely kill the terminal.&#34;Cyberattack on satellite network&#34; sounds so serious but I very much doubt it&#39;s got anything to do with the satellite part of it. They&#39;ve done the equivalent of breaching into the management network at a terrestrial, wired ISP and sent garbage configuration over TR-069 to brick the modems. Attacking the satellite layer would require much more effort for essentially the same gain (and if your objective was to get into the satellite layer, why waste that access on breaking everything in a highly-visible way when you&#39;re better off silently sitting there and using the access to eavesdrop on everything, especially when it&#39;s used for SCADA traffic of critical systems that&#39;s itself unencrypted and vulnerable to tampering?)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Simultaneously, Russian ground forces have had a hell of a time using their encrypted radios, resulting in the logistical and tactical omnishambles observed by many, and fallback transmitting in the clear using civilian ham radios or cell phones.Some have attributed this to difficulty in distributing encryption keys to forward units or just general incompetence, but one fun theory I saw on twitter is that Russia uses SDRs somewhere in their radio net and a similar poison packet bricked them all."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s not clear how any of the suggested attacks constitute &#39;permanent&#39; damage:
disabling the transmitter, corrupting the antenna pointing logic, demod, power params can all be solved by reflashing the firmware and FPGAs. Not always simple but possible at least by the manufacturer.One way to really destroy a transmitter is to transmit at full power without an antenna attached. Another is to burn the receiver front end by directing the full transmitter output to the receiver input. If the RF path is configured with software controlled RF switches a hack could burn out the front end circuitry for good. All depends on how permanent we&#39;re talking."</p>
