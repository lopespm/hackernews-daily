								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Recently a Chinese media interviewed me and I talked about a few side projects I have done in the past. I talked about the Neuralrad Mammo Screening project and Neuralrad multiple brain mets SRS platform. More awareness on radiation therapy to the general public will greatly help the community and we believe Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) will eventually replace majority of the whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) in the next five years.Here is the link to the original article:

								<p class="story__comment_others">"In the UK the NHS don&#39;t do screening for breast cancer for under 50s because it&#39;s believed that it would do more harm than good by leading to unnecessary treatment for cancers that would never have actually caused any harm, and even where no treatment is carried out it causes great distress. Though there are arguments that the age cut off is too high, and should be set at 40.The above is with regard to a well-funded and regulated screening program that presumably has much better precision/recall than this website. I wonder what the cut off age is for this website before the diagnoses cause more harm than good? 60? 70?This is getting lots of upvotes because it&#39;s confirmation bias for the large segment of HN readers who believe that problems would easily be solved by a small number of brilliant technologists, if only it weren&#39;t for governments and big organisations with all their rules and regulations."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very important caveat for all of you who are thinking, “woo hoo, no need to buy that EuRail pass! Or to buy an expensive ICE ticket!”These tickets are good for all “Nah- und Regionalverkehr,” explicitly excluding ICE, IC, EC (international) and long-distance busses (like the one between Munich and Zürich)If the train number begins with RE or RB, you’re good, but of course, those are the slow ones that stop in every village along the way.This is for the benefit of people who live here and are struggling with 2 EUR/liter fuel, not the kind of people who blithely paid 60 EUR to take the ICE. There does not appear to be any residency requirement, but remember, you’re not the target market for this (unless you live here and are struggling with fuel prices…)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I would argue making it free and keeping it free would have been a cool move.
- Less/no expensive accounting
- Less/no personnel for checking tickets
- Less/no personnel for prosecuting people who don&#39;t have tickets
- Less/no ticket vending machines (and all the maintenance that comes with it)
- Less traffic on the roads since you can&#39;t beat &#34;free&#34; and hence less emissions (at least in hamburg trains operate on green energy) and less wear on the roads (might be offset by the wear on trains and busses)
- Fully non-discriminant with respect to incomeI have no idea if that would work for inter-city transport but for inner-city transport the HVV for example (the public transportation network responsible for hamburg and surrounding areas) sells 30 million tickets a year and I wonder how much it truly costs them to do that with all the relevant factors mentioned above."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some context is given here: https://www.dw.com/en/germany-introduces-9-ticket-to-offset-...The ticket is part of a support package signed off by the German parliament. The will pay approximately €2.5 billion for the ticket offer, as a response to rising energy prices and the resulting high costs of individual mobility."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Nice! A welcome addition!Too bad they&#39;re not using KaTeX [0] instead.It renders the maths server-side, so there&#39;s no runtime needed.An additional bonus is that the resulting math is copy-pasteable, which in the case of disply math might not be that useful (since most equations are to complex to be meaningfully copy-pasted with unicode), but it helps from inline math dissappearing when copy pasting texts.But, that being said, I&#39;m sure they had their reasons to do so. For one, MathJax seems more well-known by quite a bit so maybe it&#39;s the safer option.1: https://katex.org/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s really sad that PBS ended their sister series on math, Infinite Series[1]. Those videos were just as deep, informative, and accessible as PBS Spacetime. Some of my favorites are the one on the mathematical &#34;hydra&#34;[2] and the ones on voting systems [3][4][1]: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs4aHmggTfFrpkPcWSaBN9g[2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWwUpEY4c8o[3]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoAnYQZrNrQ[4]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhVR7gFMKNg"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A channel worth subscribing. Matt (and team?) manages successfully to walk the fine line between managing the complexity of the topics they discuss (which are sometimes extremely dense), making it consumable for the population that&#39;s interested in science and physics, but doesn&#39;t pursue it on a daily basis. At the same time, they don&#39;t fall for the trap of dumbing it down to the point where the audience develops misconceptions and starts believing in pseudo scientific claims.There are some series they sometimes do, which are entertaining to follow. I also enjoy things like Journal club, where they pick a paper and deep dive into it. The audience also participates, in a way, where they pick the questions/comments from the previous video and answer them.However, it&#39;s not all academic either. There are some running jokes etc, which keep the content entertaining, while being informative, a format that I see common in some of the best Youtube channels."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot hinges on the dating of this site. How was it done?According to this article[1] (which has a nice wide-angle view of t-pillars in context), it was radiocarbon dating[1]. You find bits of stuff at the site and the isotopic composition of the carbon-containing material tells you the age based on known rates of carbon-14 decay.The actual isotopic analysis seems pretty solid.The problem is that this isn&#39;t any ordinary site. The article notes that the site appears to have been deliberately buried. This raises the question of where the samples that were dated actually came from.This critical review suggests major problems with the older-than-everything-else hypothesis for the site.[2] It notes that at least some of the samples were dated from &#34;fill,&#34; or the stuff that was used by someone at some point to bury the site. And that stuff could have itself come from sites much older than Gobeklitepe:&gt; We already discussed the problem with dating “fills” as opposed to dating “structures”. A fill’s date (no matter how confident we may fill about its actual date) in no way dates structures, as it simply can be coming from soil deposits that are either older or younger than the structure itself. You can fill your home with dirt from your yard, which could be from various geologic strata, some containing fossils from the Pleistocene. This will not make your home a Pleistocene Epoch home. Or you can currently fill a 4th century BC Temple with soil from riverbanks containing live exoskeletons; this will not render the Temple a 2000 AD structure.Even if the site wasn&#39;t deliberately buried, everything hinges on where the fill came from. The base assumption of radiocarbon dating is that no foreign material was brought in. The shakier that assumption, the shakier the claim to the ages being quoted.[1] https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/14487942[2] https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317433791_Dating_Go..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"City noise pollution is a factor in all-cause mortality due to
long-term, barely perceptible stress effects on the cardiovascular
system. Unfortunately, one of the most disturbing and frequency sources
of city noise pollution is from emergency vehicle sirens.I gave a presentation at the Audio Engineering Society titled
&#34;Iatrogenic Sound&#34;, on the tragic irony of how sirens may causally
contribute to the heart attacks and strokes that ambulances are
rushing to treat.We were exploring the acoustics of urban design and the sound-design
of sirens. The sweeping &#34;wailer&#34; siren is in fact one of the worst
possible designs imaginable - all the wrong characteristics for
locatability of source, annoyance versus attention ratio, penetration
of dwellings etc. Add to that the design of modern &#34;luxury&#34; cars which
are soundproofed, fitted with anti-noise and blaring ICE systems to
block the world out.There isn&#39;t an easy solution. Most laws give police, fire and
ambulance crews &#34;discretion&#34; in the use of sirens. In the UK that&#39;s
Article 99. But here, the removal of crown immunity and insurance
pressures mean the crew now always deploy, even at times of night
when it would have previously been illegal under other laws. I expect
the same complex spheres of interest clash in NYC too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have lived in nyc for a long time both in manhattan and Brooklyn. I have never understood how these cars and bikes are allowed to roam the streets like they do openly all day and all night while police used to be so quick to arrest youngsters who jumped turnstiles or smoked weed. The asshole in the article that is quoted even has the courage to say things like they need that sound for safety of themselves and cars and pedestrians. It&#39;s 2022, ban these cars and loud bikes from city streets. Heck ban all the unnecessary cars in city centers and just use electric vehicles. The city belongs to pedestrians, not some &#34;tuff&#34; redneck gang who think they can do whatever they want."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m really excited about this. I live in the NYC area and I think noise pollution from vehicles is an under-appreciated problem. I think the worst impact from street noise is on sleep; even a bit of noise noticeably hurts my sleep quality."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I guess I&#39;ll take the contrarian view here: the developer violated a reasonable Play Store policy, refused to fix the problem, and received an expected outcome.If you read the details of the Play Store complaint, you will see that they say the app was uploading information from the user&#39;s contact list without properly disclosing to the user that this was happening [1]. This is a violation of Play Store policy (a disclosure is required). It&#39;s not an unreasonable policy.You can see in the app&#39;s source code where some of this happens [2]. In short, the contact list is read off the device, email addresses associated with each contact are parsed out, and the app does HTTP requests to remote servers to get the favicon associated with each email contact domain. Note that this is the sending of information off each user&#39;s contact list (the email address domains) to those remote servers. As such, it requires a disclosure to the user.The developer&#39;s response is that he refuses to add a disclosure to the app because he is not uploading &#34;contact info&#34;. [3]. Ok... not a great response. Certainly I would expect apps to disclose whether or not they are using any information on my contact list to reach out to third-party servers, even if only domain names. In any case, it&#39;s Play Store policy.In the end, he finally removed the favicon feature. And Play agreed to allow the app back into the store.

Good faith security research means accessing a computer solely for purposes of good-faith testing, investigation, and/or correction of a security flaw or vulnerability, where such activity is carried out in a manner designed to avoid any harm to individuals or the public, and where the information derived from the activity is used primarily to promote the security or safety of the class of devices, machines, or online services to which the accessed computer belongs, or those who use such devices, machines, or online services.Seems pretty reasonable.  There will be arguments over what exactly qualifies but it provides a clear guideline / reasons where someone at the DOJ can not charge someone with good reason.It hopefully side steps some of the &#34;what even is hacking / a security breach / dude just opened browser dev tools ...&#34; type questions where they can look and say &#34;He notified them of the issue, I don&#39;t think this was in bad faith.&#34;  Now you&#39;re all out of those other weeds.If anything hopefully this provides a good example to trickle down to other law enforcement agencies."</p>
