								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Fact checking has been laughable from the beginning.  It is inherently biased.  The heavy political leanings of those in direct control of the organizations&#39; verdicts are brought up time and time again, and even memes are being made about sites like Snopes.  My favorite meme goes something like:Did x member of y political organization get arrested for hitting some in the head with a baseball bat?FALSE.[big block of text]X member of y political organization was arrested for hitting someone in the head with a cricket bat.[big block of text]"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think what many here and the writers of the article are missing is that you can both be truthful and misleading. These are not mutually exclusive. Let&#39;s start with the title: &#34;The Study That Convinced the CDC To Support Mask Mandates in Schools Is Junk Science&#34;. If you just read this (titles are very important and most people only read these) what will you take away? What the authors are trying to say is that this one study has problems.But reading further in the article they rise doubt about masks in general, which is something we know is highly effective (purely from a physics point of view). They don&#39;t say masking is effective, they continually question if it is. This is really problematic. The study being wrong doesn&#39;t question _if_ masking is effective, but _how_ effective. There&#39;s a major difference in these statements and they can have readers, who are not experts and don&#39;t know scientific vernacular, to doubt and distrust more science than the article _technically_ draws into question. The article is suggesting that this is the norm and because this study is bad we get to question all the others.So the problem here really is that while yes, the article only questions the one study they do so in a way that questions more fundamental knowledge that we have. Masking works. How much? Harder to say. There&#39;s a few old sayings such as &#34;the devil never tells a full lie&#34; or &#34;the devil sows doubt&#34; (often with truth). These are the errors that the authors are making here.I would conclude that they aren&#39;t inaccurate, but are misleading."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am 44 and if I had to sum up what I&#39;ve learned in my life into one concept it would be this:The truth, real truth, is EXTREMELY hard to ascertain. Therefore, be open to new ideas, but slow to accept anything as absolute truth. Those in power push narratives. Conflicts of interest make data questionable. &#34;Experts&#34; are just people with their own inherent biases. And often we simply learn new things.Therefore, I can think of very few things more damaging to society and free speech than &#34;fact checkers&#34;. Almost always I find that their &#34;facts&#34; are nothing more than the &#34;opinions&#34; of the most powerful and influential group at the time, and are usually entangled with politics. In short, &#34;fact checkers&#34; don&#39;t actually understand the definition of what a fact is, but are quick to declare them, and this is contrary to my experience of real, actual truth."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Everybody&#39;s got questions and suspicions, but here&#39;s my rather subtle one: If you&#39;re editing dramatic video footage for YouTube, why exclude the exciting moment when the engine suddenly quits? Why edit out the suspense of your repeated attempts to restart the engine? Why omit the drama of your repeated radio calls?I think if you&#39;re a YouTube narcissist, you leave everything in that attracts attention and views. Now of course maybe if your ego is especially fragile, you edit out anything that makes you look bad. (Bad in your own opinion, mind you. There were numerous things left in that make him look bad in my opinion, but I digress.) So maybe he thought he sounded panicky on the radio, and maybe he thought he looked inept trying to restart the engine (or maybe he was too dumb to try either of those), but that still leaves the moment the engine quits - why leave that out?Now you know what they say about assume: it puts U between me and some ass. Which I don&#39;t appreciate. But nonetheless I assume that moment is not shown from the cockpit camera because he killed the engine. And if he killed the engine, he probably never tried to restart it, and never made any radio calls.It&#39;s kind of like when your cell phone is turned off all day, on the same day your spouse happens to get murdered. Nobody can triangulate &amp; prove you were at the crime scene... but........."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a private pilot and I regularly fly aircraft similar to the one in the video. Engines can fail for any number of reasons, but catastrophic engine failure is exceedingly rare, and most of the time an engine stoppage is going to be something that can be corrected easily, such as fuel starvation (maybe failure to switch fuel tanks?), or a misconfigured fuel mixture, or a fried magneto.As student pilots, we train extensively for engine-out scenarios by running through checklists to increase glide distance, diagnose the problem, and hopefully restart the engine. At the very least, we evaluate all options.The first thing you are trained to do in an engine-out is to pitch the aircraft for best glide speed, and you don&#39;t even see him do that in the video. The prop stops spinning and he immediately opens the door.Bailing from the aircraft was the first thing he thought of doing, and that is the complete opposite of what every pilot is trained to do. I can&#39;t emphasize enough how much the engine-out checklist is drilled into you during training. Any qualified pilot is going to exercise some of those options unless their intention is in fact to bail from the aircraft."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is well written, and I learned stuff (the trailing spaces and end-of-buffer indicators).Modern Emacs configurations tend to revolve around use-package, which wraps up the package installer logic at the end of this configuration and makes it somewhat declarative. Just going by the standards of r/emacs or places like that, it&#39;d be unusual to see a .emacs that didn&#39;t ultimately boil down to a bunch of use-package clauses configuring stuff like LSP, Magit, company, ivy, and yasnippet.If I was going to add just one thing to this starter configuration, it&#39;d be a single example of use-package, to make it clear how to add and configure a package the user just read about online --- it&#39;s just such a big part of how Emacs is used now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I published this project a few minutes ago and I was about to do a &#34;Show HN&#34; for this project here.

In any case, thank you, todsacerdoti, for posting this here!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ahh, I finally get to flex. With our powers combined, me and a random unknown dev successfully set up a Python REPL that has access to emacs. I.e. you can program emacs via python:https://twitter.com/theshawwn/status/1472371143000707075https://github.com/zielmicha/emacspy/issues/1Setup guide: https://gist.github.com/shawwn/64e17ac3f7b272ce0ce16eb6a593b...Maybe this&#39;ll be the boost you lurkers need to get your butts into one of the coolest editors. &#34;Not your dad&#39;s editor&#34; -- new emacs slogan, probably. /sBonus screenshot of compiling emacs on a 96 core TPU: https://i.imgur.com/YtJ8jF7.pngIt launches emacs, then uses the (relatively) new dynamic modules feature to start a Python runtime, which can then import a library that accesses emacs.But to my surprise, Python can also import whatever you already have `pip3 install`&#39;ed. I imported jax and did some high speed calculations in lisp. Just kidding, I really did import jax, but it&#39;ll take a bit more work to be able to pass numpy arrays to emacs. :) But it&#39;s &#34;just&#34; a matter of making some kind of RPC system so that (+ a b) ends up calling back into python to do the addition. Then the circle will be complete -- elisp from python (already done), and python from elisp (&#34;exercise for the reader&#34;).For real though, go throw that fella a star on his github repo. The most surprising thing was that this project has been quietly on github for like two years already. It was sitting at zero stars when it popped up in one of my random google searches."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My big eye-openers (some from postdoc) were more about the sociology of science than the day-to-day productivity:- Even the most blatantly wrong and illogical published work can only be displaced by another publication that explains/does the same phenomenon better; i.e., people are going to keep believing in phlogiston until someone shows them oxygen. If you simply point out inconsistencies in phlogiston theory, in person or in writing, they may well make a variety of unwanted psychological deductions about you.- Similarly, nobody actually enjoys being around critics or enduring criticism, and therefore you will observe many senior scientists partially avoiding the major downsides of being a critic by artfully concealing criticisms inside what sounds to the uninitiated like mutual affirmation sessions. You have to listen very closely and learn the lingo to pick this up.- Never question a scientific superior (other than maybe a direct mentor or very close colleague) with any other approach besides &#34;I have a helpful suggestion about how you can maybe reach your intended destination better/faster/more precisely&#34;. Regardless of where that destination might be, such as off a cliff or into a wall.- The opinion/fact ratio you are allowed to have as a scientist is directly and very strongly correlated with seniority, H-index, and so on.- The incentive structure of scientific publication is such that there are big rewards for being right on an important question, bigger the earlier you are to the party, and little to no penalties for being wrong, so long as the error cannot be provably and directly linked to fraud. There are a variety of interesting consequences to this incentive structure."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Missing from this actionable survey is the skill of answering questions that haven&#39;t yet been answered in the secondary literature (books, reviews) or even primary literature (journals). This is, of course, what research and a PhD is all about in the end.In my experience, this fact was the #1 reason why some peers dropped out of PhD programs. They joined expecting a continuation of undergraduate education, which consists largely of recapitulating what appears in the secondary literature. Instead, what they got in graduate school was the expectation that they would be producing the primary literature. That&#39;s a very different game.It was a game these peers discovered they hated playing. Nothing in college can prepare you for the isolation of spending your time becoming the world&#39;s expert on a narrow technical topic. Your usual reinforcement mechanisms of approval from family and friends gives way to slight comprehension at best. Then there is all of the alone time doing research requires. But I suspect the hardest part of all is the seemingly endless lineup of dead ends and false hope. Not only is success not assured, you often have no idea whether the result will have any utility even if you succeed.Then, just when you&#39;ve gotten the hang of this finding answers game you discover that the real expectation is to be the one who formulates good questions. The kinds of questions that, although they will certainly involve dead ends, will ultimately pay off in some meaningful way. Very little in a bachelor&#39;s prepares you for doing this. It&#39;s a hard-won skill that comes from a round or two (or three or four) of months (or years) spent answering questions that nobody cares about. A lot hinges on your relationship with your advisor on this one.The PhD isn&#39;t just a bachelors degree but harder. It&#39;s a completely different animal. The skills in this article are very useful toward that end. But there&#39;s a lot more to the story when it comes to skills for finding answers to those unanswered questions, and formulating worthwhile questions without answers.The benefit of all of this work and discomfort is that you come away with the ability to answer worthwhile questions that haven&#39;t yet been answered. And that&#39;s a highly transferrable and applicable skill."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Two things I would add to this that I learned early on in my PhD:1. Presentations aren’t really about conveying information.I sat though so many dull presentations, they were very informative but I can read a paper quicker than they can badly present the same information.The best presentations were the ones that covered the whys of the work, the applications, the next steps, the specific problem areas - often these aren’t covered in the paper but, armed with that extra insight I am far more likely to read the paper and remember it.Presentations are (as the author says) about telling stories.2. Show up. So many PhDs waft around not doing a whole lot, and so land up being on the program forever. This only benefits the uni and is detrimental to the student. I noticed in the first month of my PhD that most people did a lot more work at the end than the beginning - so I flipped it, worked consistently from day one and got done in just under 3 years.Carry this over to your daily life and it’s almost a super power for getting stuff done. Consistently showing up and plugging away in something reaps rewards."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Ridiculous Option: Apple Pro Display XDRI&#39;ll admit, a monitor that costs more than my first car is beyond affordable for 99% of the population.But saying that, many of the people reading this are pulling truly exotic salaries right now.  After devoting untold hours to reaching the top of their profession.Let&#39;s say you&#39;re a professional earning $300k plus in software.You&#39;re often working 100% remote, using your monitor 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, just for work.  Plus untold hours of HackerNews (strictly after 5pm of course).I just find that&#39;s truly not an unlikely situation to be in.Without reference to the technical merits of the Apple Display, I don&#39;t think dropping $5000 on a monitor is outlandish for any professional in the situation I&#39;ve described.My hairdresser for example has a $4000 pair of scissors.  He uses the damn things every day, and he sharpens them twice a day.Whilst it&#39;s not essential, taking pride and investing in the tools of your trade is not a thing to frown upon."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have been waiting for good external Retina displays for years. That the situation has not improved after all this time is incredibly frustrating. Why is no display manufacturer [0] interested in setting itself apart by producing and marketing a lineup of reasonably priced external pixel-doubled (~200 ppi) displays? For some reason everything must be 16:9 and 4K with no regards to display size, resulting in some very awkward pixel densities. The fact that Apple is able to mass-manufacture a 5k display with a whole computer in it for just a little bit more than an UltraFine 5k is to me an indication that at least it’s technically feasible.[0] There is LG, but these displays have their issues as the article explains."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why is &lt;220 ppi a dealbreaker? 27 inch 4k displays seem fine to me for retina and they are quite abundant. Though I&#39;ve tried 32 inches 4k, and there the resolution is not enough for text work.Dell has a 32 inch 8k display which is ~280 ppi in stock.https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-ultrasharp-32-8k-m..."</p>

It turned out that he still had a number of friends in that area, and had forwarded it on to a friend to investigate.“Never heard of this lawyer chap,” the response came, “DO NOT respond!”So, of course the Archbishop responded.For a moment, I put myself in the shoes of this “Nigerian Prince”, getting an email from “Archbishop Desmond Tutu”, shaming the alleged prince for attempting to scam innocents on the internet. I started giggling.“So what happened next?” I asked.“Oh, he emailed me back, and tried to sell me something else.”"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I do not understand why articles like these consistently score poorly on HN? Of course it’s all based on luck, but that doesn’t make it an uninteresting read. I admire the diligence of the author, and how well they played the lucky cards they were given.I am frequently in awe when reading technical articles on HN, with people advancing the state of the art in some technology. Those people also are incredibly lucky, because they were born with massive talents that, through sacrifices and education, they transformed into life achievements.As an average software engineer I was not lucky enough to be born with cognitive skills that will ever allow me to reach those technical highs, but that is not a reason to crap on it saying “Just luck! Just genetic/environmental luck!”.Similarly, I don’t typically read from others: “It’s easy for you to rewrite the Linux kernel in JavaScript over a weekend, your work is just luck because you were born a genius in a developed country so all your achievements need to be discounted and you have no merits!”.I suspect when it comes to compensation talk people tend on average to get more bitter than they should otherwise be.Maybe I take this to heart because I made significant sacrifices to immigrate to the US and, while I was immensely lucky to succeed in the endeavor, most people I know would have never taken those uncomfortable steps (leaving family behind in a different country, sacrifice personal space by frugal living in a HCOL area as opposed to a LCOL area with a house and backyard for the kids, …), yet they will happily “complain” that my compensation is much higher than theirs, and that there is no merit to it, rather than simply admitting that they willingly chose a different path in life, but they could have chased my same opportunities with largely the same financial outcome.If I was reading this article and I was not a tech worker in the US but interested in getting those compensations, my first reaction would be “damn, let me research what are the options for legal immigration to the US and let me start down a path that has good odds of me landing a tech job over there within 5-10 years”. It would not be “let me complain on HN how the country I am a forever-prisoner in has a 90% effective tax rate so that I feel good about my situation”."</p>

It could potentially add quite a mark-up to a cheaper item such as the sampler packs someone else mentioned. But those packs look GREAT.You should check out the rest of their posts/articles. I’ve ended up on them before when trying to find out the difference in the types of inks and types of pens. I have always been really impressed by the quality of their articles. Really want to give them some cash so will wander over there in a bit.Sadly, my writing has got worse and worse since my life has become more and more digital. I should really have a goal for 2022 to be able to write legibly once again.

It works fine with ballpoint or fountain pens (some notebook papers don’t work well with fountain pens and people think they need special expensive paper). Obviously it doesn’t come in a neat book. I just used plastic document sleeves for the first level of organisation (one could then view more than two pages at once too) and box files for the second, though it wasn’t very necessary. I don’t have much to write and record these days.I currently use paper for free-form drawings or diagrams for work as photographing a paper drawing is the most efficient process I currently have for getting such diagrams into emails/our wiki."</p>

Wilson, it&#39;s just a conversation on stage (so it&#39;s not overproduced and chopped up with weird sounds like RL stuff can be): https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/articles/91867...Just sharing because I really liked this, he comes across as a really lovely man."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Cray/HPE, presumably, has a contract to provide support to the customer with nuclear weapons. If this fix is necessary to that contract, Cray/HPE should set the bounty needed to get it done as part of the necessary cost of fulfilling their contract (if they didn&#39;t figure it in, and it&#39;s not a cost-plus contract, and it cuts into the profit margin, well, that&#39;s the risk you take with fixed-cost contracting.) Free Software may often tend to be free-as-in-beer as well as free-as-in-speech but, where it is, that is as is. If you have special, and especially time-sensitive, needs that aren&#39;t as is, you pay someone to do it. It&#39;s not a gratis support contract with response time guarantees. As Cray/HPE ought to be well aware, that kind of support is expensive, and doesn&#39;t happen if no one is paying."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If the customer has nuclear weapons, then the customer has magnitudes more money in their couch cushions than would be required to pay to have this functionality implemented. For that matter, they’re probably paying Bill Long’s employer some significant chunk of change, and it would be easy for them to offer to pay for this functionality. But it’s free/oss software, so let’s just keep bugging the maintainers instead."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The customer has nuclear weapons.  They do not do &#34;bounty&#34;. :)Not only is this not funny, it would likely have the unfortunate effect of turning off any of the &#34;very, very, very, few individuals&#34;[0] who might be able to help. The fact that the issue apparently remains open after a year and a half seems to attest to that.[0] https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=95644#c8"</p>
