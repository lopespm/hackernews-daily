I started making this for myself just because I wanted more of a &#34;reader mode&#34; like experience (narrower column, nicer fonts, dark mode etc).  Then I got a bit carried away and implemented everything I could think of for a modern redesign of Wikipedia.  Hope you like it!"</p>

Less chrome, less bytes over the wire, less predictive search, less &#34;flatness?&#34;, less timely, more timeless."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is still the strongest apple advantage: design, engineering and build quality.Recently I wanted to buy a second notebook so I could leave my MBPro at home in trips where I didn&#39;t want to work, but still had a machine that run linux and windows for some quick idea or even some light gaming.Decided for a Samsung Galaxy Book Pro. Expensive machine, but slightly cheaper than a MacBook Air. good i7 11gen processor, excellent battery life, very light but with surprisingly good thermals, 1tb SSD, but unfortunately no option to have it with more than 16GB RAM.Anyway, was very satisfied with it, and it was so light that I was even booting it with linux and doing some programming on it.But, one day I just opened the lid by the sides, heard a crack, and the gorgeous OLED screen had cracked.Of course I didnt abuse it, I just opened it, without excessive force or speed. But the screen is very fragile, the lid is paper thin, but not rigid enough, it seems, to avoid this problem.And of course, Samsung says it was my fault, and I will have to pay the fix.And yes, I know people have plenty of complaints about apple, but I never had encountered such an obvious problem with an Apple product. Have they not stress-tested this stuff?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Does anyone have a canonical URL to the previous month&#39;s scan of the LEGO mini-figure? I didn&#39;t see any navigation on the site unless there&#39;s a magic spot I missed or am inadvertently adblocking: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29253441This month&#39;s entry comes off way too much like advertising for my taste, with the flowery language like &#34;magic features&#34; instead of just &#34;features&#34;, or the seemingly-unnecessary sales statistics in lieu of a technical description of the Airpods Pro: &#34;In 2020, Apple sold 110,000,000 AirPod products. Talk about mass manufacturing.&#34;Maybe it&#39;s just an unconscious tic when talking about Apple products. Even I have a hard time not saying &#34;Boom&#34; when showing off something cool :) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx7v815bYUw"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the AirPods Pro were a regression from the OG AirPods for four reasons:- Idle life took a huge dive from the originals. My OGs haven&#39;t been charged in something like six months, and the case is still at something like 20%. Meanwhile, the case holding the APPs would die in less than a week and the buds inside of them a week after that.My wife&#39;s APPs have been lost for a while because of this.- Noise cancellation performs worse than the original firmware. They have actually been outclassed by other offerings, such as the Sony WF1000XM4.- The buds themselves have a design flaw wherein earwax will accumulate in its inner grille severely enough to significantly compromise bass response. There&#39;s a thread in MacRumors that&#39;s something like 36 pages long acknowledging this. Apple quietly fixed this in version 2 of the APPs (with the MagSafe case).- The mic isn&#39;t as good. The original APs performed extremely well in wind and loud surroundings. I think the downward beam-forming mics were a big part of this. The mic on the APPs perform worse in these scenarios IMO.I&#39;m glad that Apple went back to beam-forming mics.Regardless, I&#39;m thankful for Apple for lighting up the true wireless headphone industry. The APs were a dream come true when they came out; nothing before it compared (and I had $600 custom IEMs that were waterproof and had a control scheme controlled by head nods). The APPs accelerated the creation of noise cancelling true wireless. I&#39;m excited for the next iteration of these products."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Update: 3 hours after posting and being on the hacker news front page:Automated email out of the blue: &#34;We’re pleased to let you know that we’ve recently reviewed your YouTube account, and after taking another look, we can confirm that it is not in violation of our Terms of Service. We have lifted the suspension of your account, and it is once again active and operational.&#34;Thanks hacker news for voting this up and clearly triggering something within the GooglePlex. Still a big -1 for Google/YouTube that their normal processes are completely broken."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Presumably, many Googlers who are directly involved in designing and implementing content moderation are active readers of Hacker News, as is evidenced by the fact that having a story hit the front page is an effective way to solve problems like these.But what I never see is any of those Googlers taking the time to explain why they feel these seemingly-broken approaches are the only ways to solve the problem of moderation at scale. To me, it seems insulting to one&#39;s intelligence to receive an automated message that your channel&#39;s been banned, be given the option to appeal, and to receive an equally automated message rnd() minutes later that your appeal has been denied. But what do I know? I&#39;ve never been tasked with solving such an engineering problem.I know FAANGers here may feel put upon by what appears to be a hostile environment against their companies, but that&#39;s at least in part because you&#39;ve never said exactly which technical and practical challenges lead to this state of affairs. If it&#39;s not against your company&#39;s NDAs, I challenge you all to try; whether the community agrees with you or not, I think we would all learn something useful from a productive discussion about the problem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem is not the content of the video, crypto or not. The problem is not that YT moderates aggressively (it doesn&#39;t do enough IMHO) or even how it moderates.The problem is that there is no serious appeals process, and no third party oversight of moderation decisions. This is true for all the big platforms.How do we fix that, IDK, but probably at the government level."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; MySQL is a pretty poor database, and you should strongly consider using Postgres instead.Wow, right on the chin with that one.&gt; More jarring were the people who insisted everything was OK (it seems most MySQL users and developers don&#39;t really use other databases)I only have anecdata of my usages of MySQL and Postgres but I swear people that cut their teeth on MySQL and have never used Postgres just don&#39;t know what they are missing.Yes Postgres can be slower out of the box and yes Postgres has worse connection handling that usually requires a pooler but the actual engine and it&#39;s performance makes it worth it in my opinion."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I got into programming in 2000 and right when I did Tim Perdue wrote a very important article comparing MySQL and Postgres. He concluded that Postgres was the better database.[edit] Thanks to DocTomoe for finding this:https://phpbuilder.com/mysql-and-postgresql-compared/Some of the discussion of the article survives:https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/39635C4A.1A4486D9%40al...The article was a very big deal at the time, because it was so well researched and so devastating for MySQL.I figured that article was the death knell for MySQL, but then MySQL surprised me by just going and going and going. It was helped along back then by having a very close relationship with the PHP language. Nowadays, you can use any database you want with PHP, but in 2000 PHP was very much biased in favor of MySQL, and every article written about PHP was written with the assumption you&#39;d be using MySQL as the database. I suspect that MySQL would have died except for the massive life support it got from PHP during those years.The moral I take from all of this is that sometimes you can have two technologies, and one is clearly better, yet the one that is clearly better can remain under-utilized for 21 straight years.I know a bunch of HN people will now show up and defend MySQL, or defend a lazy style of programming that accepts defaults even when that means using a poor cousin of something good. But we should stop for a moment and really think about the implications of this. Because it really is remarkable that people have known of the superiority of Postgres for 21 years and yet people still use MySQL."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It is incredibly hard to improve something that your user base doesn’t think needs improving. That part really stands out to me.When I first moved to Postgres I was fairly reluctant - my impression was that it was some arbitrary flavour of sql, and since I was used to MySQL (the only sql database I’d ever used) it seemed incredibly unnecessary to bother with. I imagine there are tons of people out there like I was who would rather let things be.Since the first few weeks I don’t think I’ve ever chosen to use MySQL again; Postgres totally changed my career for the better."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not just news sites, either.  A lot of fandom wikis run on the same platform, fandom.com.  That site is a pain in the absolute fucking ass to use on any mobile device, specifically because of the autoplaying video that takes up half the screen on every page load.  Weirdly, desktop is fine; no autoplaying videos or any such nonsense.  It&#39;s only on mobile that Fandom has seemingly made a deliberate effort to make the user experience as frustrating as possible.  And not once has the video had even a tangential relationship to the article being viewed.The worst part is that uBlock Origin&#39;s element picker doesn&#39;t work on Firefox for Android (or if it does, I haven&#39;t figured out how to use it), so on the one platform where it&#39;s maximally annoying I can&#39;t do anything to block it."</p>

Profit?In reality, at least in my case, what happens is: (1) I say “WTF!?!?”, (2) I make a mental note to never ever visit the site again, and (3) (sadly) I see it again and again at different sites."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Author here. I forgot to mention:With a Wemos D1 mini (ESP8266) MCU that costs around USD 2.00, you can pretty easily make the Vindriktning WiFi connected and get the data to a backend [1].You just need to solder three wires, and there is enough space within the enclosure to fit the D1 mini inside.This would then allow you to get the exact measurements and to better understand if the &#34;green&#34; is more on the lower end or the higher side.[1] https://github.com/Hypfer/esp8266-vindriktning-particle-sens..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Informative article with fair, fact based, conclusions.I&#39;d like to add that:- The VINDRIKTNING is extremely consumer accessible ($11.99, good build, simple traffic light system).- It may be put into spaces that previously had no particulate air quality monitoring.- The spouse-acceptance-factor is extremely high (unlike e.g. a couple of circuit boards wired together off of Aliexpress).There are other consumer friendly offerings, but they aren&#39;t affordable (e.g. Amazon Smart Air Quality Monitor 4x cost, Airthings 10x cost). That being said, IKEA could fix their traffic-light system&#39;s cut off points for free and should consider it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I would be very careful with this kind of evaluation. There are lots of sensors that perform well vs reference instruments but not in the field.If you want real evaluations, SCAQMD (the folks in charge of air quality for southern california) do evaluations of commercially available, low cost sensors, both against reference instruments and the lab.See http://www.aqmd.gov/aq-spec/evaluationsYou can see what i said is true from the table - lots of sensors that are very well correlated with reference instruments in the lab, but suck horribly in the field.I would think you would be better off submitting the sensor in question to them, and letting them put it through its paces.(They publish within a month of finishing testing, and testing takes ~8 weeks)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’m your age and of similar profession with a known history of doing software development. Having been a nerd since very early age I come to the conclusion that0) I am growing older and I may get more conservative  
1) I used a lot of products that evolved to a local optimum but I see a lot of them being thrown back into a evolutionary state they already passed a decade ago. Maybe to eveolve better, but I have my doubts. 
2) Everything is bloating now. Instead of a collection of good tools interacting I have now 3+ ways of opening an Excel-File someone shared in Teams. All of them are broken and Teams is broken, too.I feel as if the excellent wrenches I have been using for 20+ years are growing tumors in the form of a can opener. All to please people who never used a wrench or a can opener before. And production of the original wrenches is cancelled. Over night.Next time I need a wrench it may be made of felt, because fedoras are en vogue and the mad hatter has to sink venture capital into expanding his business.(Funfact: In German you could make up the very valid and understandable, but still strange word “dosenöffnerförmige Tumore” )"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think there at least 3 things at play here:#1) Software used to live on a disk you buy. That software doesn&#39;t change, until buy a new disk. Then it lived in apps, where you can update or not. Now often, it lives in the mythical cloud where changes can happen all the time.Now, even on the disk front, things were always changing. Often for the better, sometimes for the worse. In the OS world Dos-&gt;Windows-&gt;Windows 95 were big changes, and the OS9-&gt;OSX change also huge! But now the changes are always.#2) The entire software world is built on VC money. VC money is not looking for slow and sustainable growth. Or a happy userbase of 10k people. The VC world doesn&#39;t mind if 99 companies crash and burn trying to harvest the wind while building their sails if one takes off.#3) Out of the VC/startup world, large companies must justify their existence and every team and every programmer on that team must justify theirs. No one ever stuck around by saying &#34;everything is good, we literally don&#39;t need to do anything or acquire another customer, let&#39;s all cut out hours to 2 days a week, keep patching bugs and making security updates, be happy with our current level of subscriptions, and spend a bit of time in R&amp;D to make sure we have other bait in the water too if for some reason our users stop liking this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"IMHO the answer is the tech version of bullshit jobs.You know the concept - jobs that exist just to exist and pay for someone&#39;s living, though they produce nothing of actual value, and it takes effort to actually remove so no one does.With software it goes something like this:1) A  product is built, something that solves a real issue. It&#39;s new, rough around the edges and has only the basic critical features.2) Funding is found and a large team is hired to implement what&#39;s needed and fix all the rough edges.3) The team comes up with good, new ideas that actually improve the product experience for everyone, so in the eyes of management and the investors they have merit.4) After the first 10 good ideas are implemented, the next ideas are... not as helpful, but some users still like them and nobody wants to fire anyone who&#39;s been doing really good work so far.5) Fast forward a couple of years, the team is huge and there is really no headroom to improve the product. Everyone tries to come up with bullshit ideas and force their ideas through, just to have something to show come performance review time. The users stay with their tried and true product, and they&#39;re so invested at this point that a few regressions make them bitter - but not enough to leave.6) Rinse and repeat.I&#39;ve been on that team. The engineers there are often mentally older, comfortable, and smart - or at least were smart.  Many of them are sure what they do is important. But they&#39;re wrong. They now hold bullshit jobs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know it’s just an anecdote but as a customer I kind of believe this.I just completed a transaction with them that had to be extended beyond the rate lock window. For about 10 days there was a daily back and forth where they asked me to provide some documentation. I would provide the requested documentation and about 12 hours later I would receive a task of uploading the same required documentation.The document was a 50ish page legal document that required someone to look at it. It’s clear nobody was actually spending any effort on it. Even calling my loan officer wasn’t getting me anywhere. It wasn’t until the deadline approached that they called me and wanted to get it all sorted out and they extended my rate lock.The way management handled this looks horrible but if there’s any truth to these employees essentially stealing wages from their employer then they’re lucky they’re just being fired and not being prosecuted."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The funny thing is that krebsonsecurity.com are the ones that published the false information in the first place.Good summary of the whole saga by Crosstalk youtube channel which covers mostly Ubiquiti: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paLm0tP5GbI"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For me a company of their size and, what I would expect, maturity, this new announcement does not satisfy me or provide me much assurance. Consequently I am still happy I have been recommending people against Ubiquiti since the original announcement from Krebs.* Why was it so easy for a lead engineer to get access to a root AWS user without anyone else being notified? I.e. AWS GuardDuty provides FREE alerting for when an AWS root IAM account is logged in or used, this account should be under lock and key and when used, confirmed and audited by relevant persons or teams.Start edit/* Furthermore on the root account being easily accessed, the root account in the companies I&#39;ve worked at had MFA enabled, and the QR code is locked in a safe only accessible by two people agreeing it needs to be accessed in a break glass situation, where warranted./End edit* Why was he also able to delete critical CloudTrail logs and reduce their retention to 1 day? I.e. These logs should be in a S3 bucket or other environment where such changes cannot be made. Alternatively, they should be shipped to a redundant service that manages this risk to prevent data deletion* Why did Ubiquti not announce they were compromised sooner? The hack started in early December, Ubiquiti noticed the compromise on Dec. 28. Ubiquiti told the market on January 11th. Is that a satisfactory turn around? Giving them some credit for the XMas break I&#39;ll say this partially understandable.All the AWS configuration I&#39;m speaking of above, I would describe as Security 101.Most of these settings can be set and managed from AWS Organisations for free, and backed up with alarming and alerts for Guard Duty trivially. That a company of Ubiquiti&#39;s size and maturity had such basic risks not managed is still a concern.I understand AWS Organisations can be difficult to set up for legacy AWS accounts, but even with that said, setting the alarms and monitoring up that would help manage the risk associated to the questions above is not difficult and should have been in place.That Ubiqitui would only find relief ultimately from the developers poor OpSec rather than Ubiquiti&#39;s own security policies and procedures provides a commending perspective of their internal security posture."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Investigators say they were able to tie the downloads to Sharp and his work-issued laptop because his Internet connection briefly failed on several occasions while he was downloading the Ubiquiti data. Those outages were enough to prevent Sharp’s Surfshark VPN connection from functioning properly — thus exposing his Internet address as the source of the downloads.Not the first time I’ve read about a VPN unable to mask someone’s ip when they were on a wonky connection."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"WebAssembly is kind of a hack here (although a clever hack that saves a lot of effort) - the essence of what the Mozilla folks have done isn&#39;t WebAssembly, it&#39;s a trusted compiler - by which I mean a compiler that emits trustable code, regardless of how untrusted the source is. It&#39;s a really neat idea that I hope to see more adoption of, because our current security models for software suck.Security based on process isolation is extremely inefficient and coarse-grained - having a trusted compiler could (eventually) massively increase performance by removing processes entirely (no more virtual memory! no more TLB flushes and misses! less task switch overhead!) and eliminating the kernel/user mode separation, with an increase in security.&#34;Could&#34; because it&#39;s not clear to me if the reduction in expressiveness from our languages now to future languages with a theoretical trusted compiler (all jump targets have to be known at compile-time?) will be accepted by the majority of the populace.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This sandboxing is achieved via RLBox[0], which is a toolkit for sandboxing third-party libraries. It comprises of a WASM sandbox and an API which existing application can leverage. The research paper[1].[0]: https://plsyssec.github.io/rlbox_sandboxing_api/sphinx/[1]: https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.00572"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So if I&#39;m understanding this correctly, Firefox compiles its dependencies as WASM, effectively blocking function calls to things it shouldn&#39;t and illegal memory access, and then translates it back to C so it can compile it normally? Sounds neat!"</p>
