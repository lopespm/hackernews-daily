								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hetzner just turned off our hole domain, without contacting us first at all! All servers unreachable, 10k angry customers hammering us. All because if they receive a trademark complaint they won&#39;t contact the domain owner first and give them reasonable time to &#34;fix&#34; the &#34;issue&#34; (even 2 hours would have been enough). No, they just turn off the production server and simultaneously send an e-mail &#34;you better respond to their complaint if you want your domain back up&#34;.Totally unprofessional and a complete joke. Will never use them on a production system again. Always angry if they are mentioned here like they are a legitimate choice..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It sounds to me like you failed to renew your domain on time, and missed the grace period. Redemption grace period is not a fine, it’s a normal period of the lifecycle of a domain name during which they (the registry, via the registrar) give you a last chance to get your domain back. This is well documented and part of the conditions you accept and need to understand when you rent a domain.You said you had another payment mean, but they’re likely not allowed to use it without your approval. If you missed the email requests for approval, they couldn’t renew and you legitimately lost your domain.The annual contact accuracy check (WDRP) usually doesn’t result in deletion but suspension, so something sounds fishy here. Maybe it came at the same time as the renewal (which makes sense) but I’m pretty sure it’s not the direct reason for deletion of your domain.However the above is true only for gTLDs, not for ccTLDs. What’s the TLD of your domain?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Godaddy is the worst. Apparently if you ever decide to move your domain out of GoDaddy(which has alot of dark patterns to discourage you), they will remove whois privacy protection(which they charge you for) until transfer is completed. It gives bots/scrapers enough time to get that information(ICANN requires you to provide accurate personal information with email, phone number, name, and address) and your private info is ripe for abuse.It&#39;s like a punishment for moving away from them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This info gives us an interesting opportunity to estimate the rate at which Signal is adding new users. They&#39;ve been very tight-lipped (understandably) about their usage stats but anecdotally they seem to be an increasingly common presence on my friends&#39; phones, even the non-techies.As far as I can tell, Signal uses Twilio only to send SMS for phone number verification. Verification happens when a user registers a new number or changes the number on their existing account.The rate at which Signal is adding new users could be calculated by:1900 * (proportion of new registrants among SMS recipients) / (length of Twilio incident)You could probably make some common-sense assumptions about the first variable. But I can&#39;t find any publicly available info on when Twilio was first compromised. Their press release only mentions that they discovered the intrusion on August 4, which is presumably close to the end date of the incident. Does anyone know what the estimated start of the incident might be?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The attack Twilio suffered is almost identical to the recent attack against Cloudflare: https://blog.cloudflare.com/2022-07-sms-phishing-attacks/ (even down the wording of the text messages, which are nearly identical). Cloudflare’s use of security keys prevented the attackers getting access to any accounts in that case.These attacks are sophisticated and are capable of bypassing TOTP or mobile-app-based MFA. If this is widespread, I’d be surprised if we didn’t see a massive influx of breaches soon. The vast majority of companies are not well defended against this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Among the 1,900 phone numbers, the attacker explicitly searched for three numbers, and we’ve received a report from one of those three users that their account was re-registered.I wonder if this was a curious attacker trying to see what they could do with their access, or a targeted attack."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a a beautiful thread. All the concerns that come into play with a commercial business, a very human representative of that business, and someone outside expressing a need. A need that some would see is contradictory to the pure business goals.Doing business out in the open like Tailscale is doing is so refreshing. Having seen Brad Fitz communicate in other places, it is obvious he isn&#39;t doing the right thing for the user only because these conversations will be scrutinized in public. Tailscale has a lot of great technical people who actually are even better communicators.This is the lesson for me in this thread: remember to optimize hiring good communicators and not just good technical people. This conversation would have quickly gone south if it was purely about the technical or business reasons for doing it. After all, the root word of communication is commune: to connect. We often forget that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The developer of Headscale, Juan Font, mentioned that Tailscale also reached out to them when they tried to implement a new version of their control protocol. They also gave Juan some docs on the design to help with implementation on the Headscale side. It was posted to HN[1], but didn&#39;t seem to gain much traction.[0] https://twitter.com/juanfont/status/1507760973037322240[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30829522"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article, and some of the comments here, seem to confuse &#34;second-order&#34; with &#34;long-term&#34;.Long-term just means doing the same analysis far out into the future: &#34;If I spend less on maintaining software product $LEGACY, I will save money. If I continue to do this, I will save more and more money by each passing month.&#34;Second-order means discovering neighbouring causal links. &#34;If I spend less on maintaining software product $LEGACY, I will save money. I will however also have to prioritise which bugs I fix. This will lead to some bugs that would be fixed today not getting fixed. That might mean that some users of $LEGACY move to a competitor. In turn, it costs more to acquire new customers than to retain old ones, so just maintaining the same customer count while dissatisfying customers until they quit will cost more money than by trying to make existing customers happy.&#34;Quitting $LEGACY customers will however lead to fewer bugs being discovered in $LEGACY, meaning the reduced maintenance budget might be sufficient again. However, quitting customers doesn&#39;t only force me to spend more to re-acquire similar number of customers – it might also be negative for marketing, so it becomes harder to acquire new customers, thus having a non-linear effect on the customer replacement costs.&#34;Decreased maintenance of $LEGACY might make some developers happier, but signal to others that we are not serious about the lifecycle of our product. This might result in them not putting in as much effort to make maintenance easier in future products, which will increase the maintenance demand in future products. Thus, insufficient maintenance efforts on $LEGACY may lead to increasing maintenance demand, which leads to insufficient maintenance efforts, which leads to increasing maintenance demand, and so on.&#34;As the last parts of that hint at, what&#39;s really important is not all the neighbouring causal links, but those that lead to nonlinearities and feedback cycles. By mucking about with things in a stable system, in particular when there are nonlinearities and feedback cycles involved, you can accidentally create an unstable system that wants to drive itself into the ground."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Applied Economics: Thinking Beyond Stage One by economist Thomas Sowell[0] explores this in good detail, applying it to political and economic policies, in his book.Housing policies, medicare and today&#39;s problem of defund the police can be better analysed if the framework of second-order thinking is used to view the pros and cons of such policies and their subsequent ramifications.Second-order thinking is a great mental model to have and helps us address some of the cognitive biases that get in our way when making choices.To me this form of thinking is evident in chess, the evaluation necessary to make a single move gets us to look at the consequences after the third and fourth move before a final decision is made.I believe when the time allows for it we should really consider the future ramifications of our actions before making a move.[0] https://www.amazon.com/Applied-Economics-Thinking-Beyond-Sta..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I use the predictive horizon model. It&#39;s not that there&#39;s a clear division between first order and second order thinking, it&#39;s that some people&#39;s ability to model consequences covers a narrow area, a few people can model successfully much further out, and a tiny minority can make astounding predictive leaps that reach far into the future.It&#39;s a continuous variable, not a Boolean.But it means most of the population literally cannot see consequences that seem obvious to someone with a wider reach.Asking &#34;and then what&#34; won&#39;t change this, because if your modelling ability is poor you&#39;ll just get a longer list of wrong predictions.It&#39;s a mix of native ability (IQ helps, but it&#39;s not a sole determinant), domain specific experience, and experience with synthetic thinking - the ability to filter and combine multiple trends, as opposed to purely analytical thinking which usually looks at one or two."</p>

The point is expensive doesn&#39;t always mean good."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Really interesting to hear so many people having had experiences with Apple support.I recently bought a 10 year-old iMac second hand from Cash Converters, which I promptly softbricked the day after purchase (bad Bootcamp install + firmware password).I took it in to the Apple Store, and despite the fact that it was 10 years old and used, they contacted the engineers in Cupertino to get the firmware unlock key, reformatted it and updated it to the latest supported macOS, and didn&#39;t charge a cent for the service.I was blown away and told people I knew about the experience.  Apparently they did something similar for a friend&#39;s iPhone 6 a couple of years ago.  Didn&#39;t charge a cent to service a 5 year-old smartphone."</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32468613">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not sure if Bun has had an influence on this, these features must have been in development for a long time, but the timing surely is impeccable.npm compatibility is huge for Deno. It is basically the one major drawback to Deno, which gets hopefully fixed with this feature. It also looks like this compatibility layer is implemented transparently in the existing module management, which is a big bonus. Nobody wants to deal with node_modules anymore when working with Deno for an extended period, just love to see this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m actually a little disappointed by NPM compatibility. Or at least conflicted. Deno has felt like an opportunity to reboot the server-side JS ecosystem into something far more sensible than it currently is. Not that anyone is to blame for what it is, really, but you learn lessons and move forward. Sometimes making breaking changes.This seems like an acceptance that moving on simply won&#39;t happen. The existing ecosystem is too big and too powerful to be ignored. If I were a particularly cynical person I&#39;d also point to Deno taking on millions in VC funding - once you&#39;ve done that you can&#39;t be content to create a perfect, gleaming sandbox. You have to bring in money."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a non-user of Deno, I’m curious, how do people tend to manage dependency version centralisation in Deno? I suppose this will apply to existing Deno as well as npm imports. I can just see you ending up having to change “import express from &#34;npm:express@5&#34;;” from 5 to 6 in lots of places when the next major version comes out.When contemplating how I might do it, I came up with centralised reexport, a file deps.ts containing:  export express from &#34;npm:express@5&#34;;

This would basically stand in for the dependencies object in package.json.So then I looked up the docs and found https://deno.land/manual/linking_to_external_code#it-seems-u... and was amused to find the same solution, even down to the file name “deps.ts”!Is this how people tend to work with Deno?I see it also supports import maps, https://deno.land/manual/linking_to_external_code/import_map..., which could readily solve the problem too. Do people use that?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Many moons ago, one of the things I did was to port the Windows version of Google Earth to both Mac and Linux. I did the mac first, which was onerous, because of all the work involved in abstracting away system specific API&#39;s, but once that was done, I thought Linux would be a lesser task, and we hired a great linux guy to help with that.Turns out, while getting it running on linux was totally doable, getting it distributed was a completely different story. Due to IP reasons, this can&#39;t ship as code, so we need to ship binaries. How do you do that? Do you maintain a few separate versions for a few popular distributions? Do you target the Linux Standard Base? The first approach is a lot of work, and suffers from breakages from time to time, and you alienate users not on your list of supported distros. The second version, using LSB, was worse, as they specify ancient libraries and things like OpenGL aren&#39;t handled properly.End result; management canned the Linux version because too much ongoing support work was required, and no matter what you did, you got hate mail from Gentoo users."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Agree. Had a few games on Steam crap out with the native version, forced it to use proton with the Windows version, everything  worked flawlessly. Developers natively porting to linux seem to be wasting their time.Funnily enough with wine we kinda recreated the model of modern windows, where Win32 is a personality on top of the NTAPI which then interfaces with the kernel. Wine sits between the application and the zoo of libraries including libc that change all the time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Coincidentally, Win32 is also the only stable API on Windows.WinForms and WPF are still half-broken on .NET 5+, WinRT is out, basically any other desktop development framework since the Win32 era that is older than a couple of years is deprecated. Microsoft is famous for introducing new frameworks and deprecating them a few years later. Win32 is the only exception I can think of."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I feel there is some slight mis-information in this article that might confuse people and give them the wrong impression of &#39;Local SSDs&#39; vs the network based ones and about the nvme protocol and made it seem like &#34;local ssd == nvme&#34;.NVMe - &#39;non-volatile memory express&#39;. This is a _protocol_ that storage devices like SSDs can use to communicate with the external world. It is orthogonal to whether the disk is attached to your motherboard via pcie, or it lives somewhere else in the datacenter and uses a different transport layer. For example, local NVME SSDs will use PCIe transport. But you can also have NVME-over-TCPIP, or NVME-over-fiber-channel. Or NVME-over-Fabrics. Many of these are able to provide significantly lower latencies than a millisecond.As a concrete example, AWS `io2-express` has latencies of ~0.25-0.5ms, though i&#39;m not sure which technology it&#39;s using.nvme over fabrics: https://www.techtarget.com/searchstorage/definition/NVMe-ove...
many interesting presentations on the official nvme website: https://nvmexpress.org/education/documents-and-videos/presen...
aws: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/storage/achieve-higher-database..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"An easy way I usually solve this with most MongoDB deployments is to have a couple data-serving nodes per shard that have local NVME drives and then have a hidden secondary that just uses an EBS volume with point-in-time backups.Your write load is already split up per-shard in this scenario, so you can horizontally scale out or increase IOPS of the EBS volumes to scale. And you can recover from the hidden secondaries if needed.And no fancy code written! :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of mirroring an SSD array to a HDD! I believe this is what some college kids get their hands on, since many motherboards come with 2 NVMEs. NVME RAID0 is too dangerous and RAID 1 is too expensive, but, by pouring few hundred more bucks, one can gain a marginal safety while enjoying the blazing fast RAID0.The magic here is `--write-behind`/`--write-mostly`[1] in `mdadm`. I mean, that&#39;s the only method that I can think of here. This is an old dark magic that prevents (though not entirely) reading from a specific drive.[1]: https://raid.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Write-mostlyTBH, in general, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good option for databases. The slow drive does cause issues, for it is literally slow. The whole setup slows down when the write queue is full, reading from the write-mostly device can get be extremely slow thanks to all the pending writes, and the slow drive will wear out quicker thanks to the sustained high load (though this one should not apply in this specific case).So you mostly don&#39;t want to use a single HDD as your mirror. For proper mirroring, you need another array of HDDs, which will end up being a NAS with its own redundancy. That&#39;s a large critical pain in the butt, but this is necessary for industrial grade reliability, and also allows making your &#34;slow drive&#34; faster in the future.In this specific case, it&#39;s pretty well played. They get 4 billion messages per day, which is roughly 46k per second. Assuming each write requires updating at least one block - 4kb - the setup needs to sustain at least 185 MB/s, which is clearly beyond a single HDD. Google Persistent Disk is a kind of NAS anyway, so that perfectly aligns with the paragraph above."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Is the fear of &#34;people selling your email to spammers&#34; a modern myth, or are spam filters that good?Email databases for sale are not always for spam or malware.  They are often used for tracking and cross marketing calculations.  Placing a companies name in the address will signal a canary and they may likely filter your contact out of their database or at least flag it and treat it differently.I&#39;ve been using email canaries for decades but recently had to adjust my canaries to be less obvious.  A few vendors got upset that I had their name in the address and one even accused me of fraud and canceled my $500 gift card.  That was the Tractor Supply Company.Either way I will continue using canaries and multiple domains as it is a good way to be filtered out of some cross marketing databases and to avoid some behavioral tracking and some machine learning.  It is also useful to find companies that get upset.  This is an indicator to me they lack integrity and should be avoided.  Canaries are also a good indicator to detect if a company has been compromised."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m glad you had a good experience.  I had a different one.I&#39;ve ran my own domain for longer than you have, and many emails have been compromised.Some are 100% from companies selling the emails to sister companies.The majority, though, is from a company itself being compromised by hackers / database access / etc.  LinkedIn, Neopets, ProFlowers, TeeSpring, etc.  I can go on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Let&#39;s consider a few things:1) Just because it hasn&#39;t happened to you, that doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t happen. I have quite a few examples of companies selling or otherwise sharing, whether intentionally or through compromise, my email addresses.2) If someone (some company) is going to sell email addresses, it&#39;s not unreasonable to imagine that they&#39;d want to remove any addresses that would directly link those addresses to their source, so a quick search to remove any address with the word &#34;adobe&#34; in it when selling Adobe mailing lists would not be unexpected in the least.Years ago I set out to learn more about the &#34;missing sock&#34; problem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_sock). I bought a dozen pair of brand new socks and I ironed on labels identifying each and every sock. Guess what? The labeled socks never went missing. The act of labeling the socks dramatically affected the experiment.Perhaps using companies&#39; names in our email addresses is affecting our results."</p>
