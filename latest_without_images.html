								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Engineering mistakes happen.The most inexcusable thing is not communicating with the paying customers who have been affected for over a week.Atlassian&#39;s Global Head of Customer Success probably should have been fired but here she is promoting Atlassian Cloud on LinkedIn three days ago: https://www.linkedin.com/mwlite/in/gertie-rizzo-5b70061Actually reading a bit more, it seems like their customer team was partying in Las Vegas instead of taking care of business: https://www.linkedin.com/mwlite/feed/hashtag/atlassianteam22Priorities."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve repeatedly asked Atlassian if:1. They can confirm that they have backups of our data (about a thousand stories, substantial confluence, opsgenie history, and three service desks).2. Will our integrations, configuration, and customizations also be recovered, or will we need to rebuild those once our data is recovered?I have received no response, and no human is even willing to acknowledge those questions. The service desk staff ignore them as if I never asked. Repeatedly.Also, I&#39;ve been asking around, and haven&#39;t been able to find a single story from somebody that can confirm that they were down, who has had their data recovered."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is extremely poor for a large SaaS company.A standard RFP question for SaaS should be:- Can you restore data for a single customer, and if so, what is the RTO for that operation?A smaller SaaS could be excused for only thinking about full database restores. When you&#39;re a scrappy upstart, thinking about hypotheticals is less important than survival.But for any decent size multi-tenanted SaaS, it&#39;s imperative that you have the ability to selectively restore individual customers.The usual approach is to do a full database restore into a separate instance, then run your pre-prepared &#34;restore customer&#34; scripts to extract a single customer&#39;s data from there and pump it across your prod instance. In Oracle for example you might use database links to give your restore code access to prod and also the restore instance at the same time.Atlassian - MUST DO BETTER."</p>

(C) the thunderbolt ↯ is commonly used for &#34;not&#34; or more specifically for dis-proof in this area and(D) at least by my 30 s internet search on a mobile phone I couldn&#39;t find any other &#34;no-angle&#34; or &#34;no-right-angle&#34; symbol.Someone could argue that usually you use a simple strike through as like as in ≠ (unequal), ∉ (not-element-of) or ∅ (empty set) but I would say it was chosen to avoid confusion in this case. The angle itself (without the &#34;no/not&#34;) consists of only to orthogonal lines so it would be kinda complicated to &#34;strike it though&#34; in any direction without ambiguity that would resemble a triangle, a fork or whatnot.■"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"(Edited to upload the image to imgur and avoid spammy advertisements).Here I&#39;ll date myself: I remember this as &#34;diode with a gate&#34;. Back when we did circuit diagrams with stencils, you had the diode stencil which looks like a triangle with a line on top, and then with the electrical stencils you had &#34;decorations&#34;.The intention was to put down the original symbol on the paper, move the decorations stencil over top of it and then add the required decorations. It&#39;s why diode symbols look like this: https://imgur.com/a/0tSLV7O (notice &#34;step recovery diode&#34;).The &#34;lightning bolt&#34; isn&#39;t a lightning bolt, it&#39;s a hint that this diode is going to have a very sharp &#34;snap off&#34; in the waveform. See: https://www.electronics-notes.com/articles/electronic_compon...OK so why do we have a seperate decorator for a diode? Can&#39;t we just have a pocket full of stencils for diodes? Space was at a premium back then. It goes back to daisy wheels and typeballs: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printer_(computing)#Impact_pri... You would have one position for &#34;diode&#34; and one position for &#34;decorator&#34; and the printer would know when it got one ASCII char it would print the diode, then send whatever the thin space is to advance the print carriage a small step, then print the decorator.Someone should be able to find a daisy wheel or typeball dedicated to circuits and bear this out."</p>

(I still have no idea, nor can supply an example of the symbol in use.) […] it is the case that ISO 9573-13 existed long before either AFII or the STIX project were formed.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Haidt makes an excellent observation about the mid-20th century unity being an aberration due to the technology of the time:&gt; Gurri is no fan of elites or of centralized authority, but he notes a constructive feature of the pre-digital era: a single “mass audience,” all consuming the same content, as if they were all looking into the same gigantic mirror at the reflection of their own society.Something I think we overlook is that America was more fractious prior to the mid-20th century, but the stakes were lower because our institutions were more distributed and more local. The federal government had a vastly smaller scope back then, but so did nationwide and multinational corporations. Differences in world view are less significant when the bureaucrats and executives with power over your life live nearby instead of in another city and state. Our current structure, with a homogenous federal government and nationwide corporations arose against the backdrop of that unity.What I see missing from Haidt&#39;s analysis is increased federalism and localism as a solution. Aside from maybe California, our individual states remain vastly less fractious than the nation as a whole. Here in Maryland, for example, our Republican governor has an approval rating over 70% in both rural and urban areas. That&#39;s not because the state doesn&#39;t have ideological diversity--a third of the state voted for Trump. But the extremes are compressed compared to the nation as a whole--Baltimore isn&#39;t San Francisco but neither is Carroll County rural Alabama. Not only that, it&#39;s hard to get folks in Carroll County worked up about Baltimore they way they get worked up about San Francisco, and vice versa."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While I am a big fan of Jonathan Haidt, and have read several of his books, I can&#39;t help but feel that this is written from a point of view that is entirely too impressed with (if also afraid of) technology.Peter Turchin predicted escalating levels of polarization in the US, reaching a peak around 2020, without any need to look at social media.  The level of political polarization now, while high, is less than the late 1850&#39;s.  I also think he&#39;s more impressed with AI-generated content than is warranted; unpaid zealots can crank the stuff out in more than enough quantity.Turchin blames elite overproduction; it seems a much more fundamental issue than social media.  Haidt even provides evidence for that here:&#34;These two extreme groups are similar in surprising ways. They are the whitest and richest of the seven groups, which suggests that America is being torn apart by a battle between two subsets of the elite who are not representative of the broader society.&#34;Now, don&#39;t get me wrong, I am no fan of FB or Twitter, but I don&#39;t think Haidt&#39;s take on this is accurate.  The stupidity of current discourse uses social media, of course, because that&#39;s the dominant media, but I don&#39;t believe they caused it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"“He described the nihilism of the many protest movements of 2011 that organized mostly online and that, like Occupy Wall Street, demanded the destruction of existing institutions without offering an alternative vision of the future or an organization that could bring it about.“Calling Occupy nihilistic is strikes me as blinkered, and shows the neoliberal bias of the author. Occupy is where the 99% vs. 1% lens arose, which is a reasonable description of concentration of wealth and power across Western countries and especially the US. Occupy attempted to employ more empowering and less alienating peer-to-peer governance.Occupy didn’t “succeed”, probably due to both internal and external forces, but it wasn’t nihilistic."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s not really fair to compare this, which takes heat at 2000°C, to a steam turbine that takes heat at say 550°C.A turbine system would have much better efficiency than 40% if its heat was available at that temperature. For example a closed Brayton cycle gas turbine + steam turbine system. Certainly complex and expensive, but could get much better than 40% efficiency."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"OK, so perhaps it&#39;s not the de-carbonization future we all wanted, but this could be an absolute game changer for planetary exploration, where RTG (nuclear-decay-driven thermal engines) are common. The existing efficiency for those is abysmal, which is actually OK since heat is such a useful product in itself.I&#39;m looking at Dragonfly, specifically, where an RTG provides the electricity and heat to keep everything alive. Imagine what 10x longer flights would do for that mission."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The university where I did a post-bacc had a research project back in the late 1990s to build a TPV-powered hybrid electric car that used compressed natural gas to heat an emitter surrounded by water-cooled PV cells.With the technology at the time they weren&#39;t able to get the efficiency to be competitive with an internal combustion engine, but something like this probably could&#39;ve made it competitive. I&#39;m not sure if there&#39;s any need for it with today&#39;s battery performance/price, but maybe as a range extender or something.https://vri.wwu.edu/viking-series-cars-history/ (scroll down to Viking 29)https://www.sae.org/publications/technical-papers/content/97...

					<h3><a href="https://consilienceproject.org/endgames-of-bad-communication/">The endgames of bad faith communication</a></h3>

					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30997666">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A well-written article, especially clearly listing out the differences in the forms of communication helped make the point.
But sadly, the people most prone to bad-faith communication are also probably least likely to take this criticism and improve. I have also resorted to bad-faith communications in conversations where it seems like that is the only way to be heard.Consider this example:
Person A, displaying some humility, says : &#34;You might be right, there is a chance politician X is in the wrong&#34;.
Person A assumes this is interpreted by Person B as: &#34;There is uncertainty about politician X being in the wrong&#34;
Person B actually interprets this as: &#34;Person A has admitted, without any doubt, to politician X being completely in the wrong&#34;If I ever find myself in a conversation where I&#39;m in the shoes of Person A, using good-faith communication means actually risking a complete failure of communication. Why even bother to communicate?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s an alternative ending: what if good faith communication was superior to bad faith in a systemic way ?Clues:- at a personal level: have you ever tried to put in practice &#34;highly skilled, non-naive good faith communication&#34; ? If you did, you&#39;ve probably noted that more often than not, it doesn&#39;t make you weaker. It increases your value, your status, even your financial success. So maybe this could also be a contagious/unstoppable strategy simply because it has an edge for personal success ?- as an organization: good faith leadership, good faith communication... seem to overall be a competitive advantage because it goes hand-in-hand with happy &amp; productive people- as a society: democracy emerged despite a world of tyrants to take over most a the world. Why ? Maybe because it was stronger in a systemic way ? It unlocks collaboration, decentralization, resilience... Moreover, it doesn&#39;t sound unreasonable that democracy would be fittest as poverty diminishes. So maybe authoritarianism, not democracy, is in danger of extinction in the end ?Result: instead of spiraling bad faith, maybe we will have (though slower) spiraling good faith ? Maybe &#34;good faith&#34; will win simply because it&#39;s stronger, in a kind of evolutionary sense.This has implications in everyday life : practicing &#34;highly skilled, non-naive good faith communication&#34; may be the best way to personal success.
And this may also be the best way to incidentally induce a &#34;good faith&#34; society"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It would be great for people who desire good faith communication to call out people who are resorting to bad faith techniques.  Especially, and most importantly, when those bad actors are of the same political stripe.It&#39;s impossible for those bad actors to hear criticism from &#34;the enemy&#34;.  Only people who share a position of almost total fundamental agreement, can maybe be heard in any criticism of how to better deal with the opposition.TLDR:  We should be most aggressive and loud in criticism of those we agree with most."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Deno core team member and TC39 delegate here.We have pondered about capability based security for Deno in the past. Our conclusion has always been that this is not possible to do securely in JS without freezing all prototypes and objects by default. The reasoning for this is that you need to make sure the capability token does not ever leak. For example as a malicious user I could override `globalThis.fetch` to exfiltrate the capability token destined for `fetch` and use it myself later.One could also override `Map.prototype.set` / `Map.prototype.get` to exfiltrate  a token every time it is added or removed from a `Map` (people will want to store tokens in a `Map`).One could also override `Array.prototype[Symbol.iterator]` to exfiltrate tokens  stored in arrays if those arrays are destructored, spread, etc.There are many more cases like this, where one can exfiltrate tokens because of the very dynamic nature of JavaScript.It is unlikely that freezing all intrinsic prototypes and objects is even enough. People will find ways to exfiltrate tokens."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The impression I get from the companies I&#39;ve worked at is to not trust packages that are mostly maintained by one person. Ironically, those packages are usually the ones that don&#39;t have outrageously large dependency trees and can usually be audited by a developer on a weekend, and the more &#34;trustworthy&#34; larger packages with hundreds of maintainers typically have monstrous dependency trees.Not saying 1-man tools are inherently better, but in my experience, these tools seems to have a tighter focus and less chances of scope/dependency creep."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Founder of Socket (https://socket.dev) here, a new tool built by npm maintainers to help solve JavaScript supply chain security.I totally agree with the idea that we should assume all open source packages may be malicious. Socket.dev uses &#34;deep package inspection&#34; to characterize the behavior of an open source package. By actually analyzing the package code, Socket can detect when packages use security-relevant platform capabilities, such as the network, filesystem, or shell.For instance, to detect if a package uses the network, Socket looks at whether fetch(), or Node&#39;s net, dgram, dns, http or https modules are used within the package or any of its dependencies.This entails running static analysis (and soon, dynamic analysis) on a package – and all of its dependencies – to look for specific risk markers.In this way, Socket can detect the tell-tale signs of a supply chain attack, including the introduction of install scripts, obfuscated code, high entropy strings, or usage of privileged APIs such as shell, filesystem, eval(), and environment variables.We are taking an entirely new approach to one of the hardest problems in security in a stagnant part of the industry that has historically been obsessed with just reporting on known vulnerabilities."</p>
