								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"During my time as a research assistant / grad student there was a remarkable shift in the atmosphere. It started with massive layoffs of research staff, linked to the more general savings of our government.More esoteric professors were replaced with more efficient manuscript machines submitting manuscripts to more prestigious journals. Soon after the layoffs, the university&#39;s innovation and commercialization services became extremely active. Recurring events at lecture rooms where we were blasted on how our work is IP of the university, how the university takes only 50% cut if something works, how cool is it to be a researcher who commercializes ideas in comparison to being one those dusty farts in the science cave studying one protein or butterfly for their entire life.Being a believer and practitioner of open source, I once asked how does this all this apply to computational science. Basically all algorithms and tools should be passed through them to see if they have commercial potential - if no, we can go ahead. Found it appalling and interfering with my intellectual freedom, one of the many events that made me pursue life outside the academia."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wouldn&#39;t be the first time universities have acted like patent trolls. For example, you know the filament-style LED lightbulbs that are really popular these days? The University of California has been going after a bunch of retailers with patent lawsuits for selling them, complete with PR push about how it was their invention that had been stolen from them. I looked at what they&#39;d actually invented and patented at the time, and it was nothing like those filament LED lightbulbs - it was a old-fashioned resin-dome LED that replaced the metal anvil the die is usually mounted on with a TIR reflector, supposedly to improve efficiency. This was completely impractical, pointless and had no market value - the metal anvil is really useful both as mechanical support and a heatsink, you&#39;d almost certainly lose any possible efficiency gain that resulted from capturing more of the rear light output due to higher temperatures. However, they&#39;d worded their patent claims in such a broad way that they could cover nearly anything, and the university used this to file for patents that were actually similar to the LED filaments after they&#39;d already been invented by someone else and put on the market but backdated in validity to their original patent.This isn&#39;t just a software-related problem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Grants from the NSF, etc. should only be granted on the condition that the research produced enters the public domain. Taxpayer dollars should not go towards producing research the public cannot benefit from without paying to license a patent or access a $100 journal article."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Starting conditions (where one was born, levels of wealth and opportunity there, one&#39;s parents&#39; education and jobs) are shockingly predictive about an individual&#39;s future. Hard work leading to social mobility has always been the exception, not the rule. Most will not beat the odds since if they did, those wouldn&#39;t BE the odds. A lot of us are just so deluded by survivorship bias borne of listening only to success stories, but it seems more and more people are seeing through the illusion. In my opinion, that&#39;s a good thing, as recognizing the true state of things is the first step to improving them, and this combination of consciousness and lived experience can prove to be potent immunization against bad faith actors who want to maintain the illusion of widespread social mobility."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Working hard but doing so for someone else can often not lead to significant gains.  Many services like Uber or InstaCart or even McDonalds or Amazon Warehouse or Walmart or Retail Sales or call center, you can work hard but there is no where to progress to.  Your rewards are capped.You need to find a way to work hard such that your rewards are not capped artificially.  Startups were you get equity.  Large companies where you can progress to high salaries if you are able to rise.  Starting your own business and being competent at it.  Working on commissions in an area where the commissions can be large -- true sales, or real estate.  Being a professional, e.g. doctor, accountant, lawyer, has traditionally had high wages and you often run your own business.You need to work hard in a way that has unlimited rewards, or at least high rewards possible, and that aligns with your aptitudes.You need to not work hard at a minimum wage job if you can get something better.And if you are stuck in a minimum wage job, maybe you can organize with your fellow employees to demand better wages and benefits?  This is also another way of working hard in order to get more for yourself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As trite as it sounds, &#34;Success = Hard Work + Opportunity&#34; is still the default equation that makes the most sense to me.And while people from all strata of life work very hard, opportunities are obviously and incredibly unequally distributed (and perhaps becoming more so?).If you were born middle-class in US/Canada 20 - 40 years ago, your access to opportunities to improve your station were/are immense. Layer on your ethnicity, if your parents were in a stable relationship, if you grew up in relative safety, if you had a decent education... hard not to think that your opportunities were 10x or 100x someone who had none of those things.But you also need to define &#34;success&#34;. To this crowd, is &#34;success&#34; merely &#34;leading a better life&#34;? I&#39;d argue most of us already have this as our default reality. I.e. the gradual reward for working hard via promotions and relative safety of career.I remember after my startup was acquired, a few people would say to me (well-meaning obviously) &#34;wow it&#39;s great your hard work paid off!&#34;. And I just said something like &#34;thanks, ya, lots of people work a lot harder than me but didn&#39;t get the same outcome - so there was a lot of luck involved too!&#34; etc. Even thinking of my own immigrant grandparents - what THEY did was HARD.I think about those exchanges often. Tech -- at this particular moment in history -- disproportionately rewards &#34;hard work&#34; (which many of us find fun anyways). Or perhaps better to say that Tech provides access to the right kind of opportunities that allow for a DEFAULT &#34;life gets better&#34;, with the possibilities of &#34;life suddenly gets 100x better&#34;."</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27513201">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m always super intrigued by the reMarkable 2, but I think it&#39;s because it paints an image of the type of person I think it&#39;d be cool to be, someone who can just write down notes and draw stuff with a really cool, slim device. Someone who carries around moleskines and uses them, instead of just buying so many of them in different shapes and leaving them in a drawer packed to the brim with notebooks.The problem keeps coming back to the fact that I&#39;m absolutely not the type of person who wants to carry that thing around everywhere and who likes or is good at hand writing or drawing. I realize I won&#39;t base all my life and processes around this one device that is also supposedly hard to get info off of easily into things like OneNote. If I was somewhere without a computer, then I wouldn&#39;t be carrying this big tablet on me. I&#39;ve bought enough tablets and laptops with writable screens and MS surfaces over the years to know that I still never drew or took notes with the pen, but I still keep buying them hoping I will.The thing is still so cool and I want it, but maybe I&#39;ll wait for version 3 or 4 and extra disposable income that will go to waste on it!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I bought a Remarkable 2 a month or two ago because I wanted a cool hackable e-ink Linux computer. But instead I immediately started using it as an e-book and document reader and note-taking pad, and nothing else. And, so far at least, that&#39;s perfect.The screen is beautiful (a bit gray, but the black is really black so the contrast is still good), the device is thin and reasonably light, I only have to charge it once a week or so, and there are absolutely no distractions. I have even rediscovered the visceral pleasantness of writing by hand.I especially like that it&#39;s *not* running Android (which I dislike more with each release). The biggest drawbacks, to me, are the fragile pen nibs and the inability to just SCP a PDF or EPUB to the device and have it work (their sync software works but isn&#39;t great)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I bought the Onyx Boox Note Air some months ago, and I must say that I&#39;m really happy with it. Screen refresh is good, there&#39;s almost no ghosting in default mode, and refresh rates are acceptable.There are only two downsides about it: The vendor does not respect FOSS and does not publish the sources for their modified Linux kernel, and the device constantly phones home to China. However, the device can be rooted easily [1], and you can install a firewall to stop the preloaded apps from phoning home (verified it with Wireshark).[1]: https://blog.tho.ms/hacks/2021/03/27/hacking-onyx-boox-note-..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"https://archive.is/0hGwx"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a great example of why Google FLoC is not incentive-compatible with consumers nor business owners.  Amazon (like Facebook) has a monopoly on ad targeting on their target properties—- properties they own.  Google FLoC is Google’s attempt to (further) monopolize their target properties—- the web at large, which Google does NOT own.  Google does NOT pay to service the traffic they generate.  Google does NOT pay to fulfill consumer orders.  Google wants you to think they’re acting in your best interests with FLoC.  Maybe if Google offered more free GCloud credits and subsidized conversions they generate, that would be a different story. (Maybe Google could start by paying Wikipedia for some of the traffic they generate).  But Sundar wants you to think FLoC is about privacy, because Sundar has said time and time again that Google has lost people’s trust."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, the bias in this article is unbelievably blatant:&#34;[Amazon is] preventing Google’s tracking system FLoC — or Federated Learning of Cohorts — from gathering valuable data reflecting the products people research in Amazon’s vast e-commerce universe&#34;Compare with, e.g.:&#34;Amazon is taking steps to protect its user&#39;s privacy by blocking Google&#39;s heavy-handed overreach in leveraging its Chrome browser to spy on user&#39;s personal shopping habits and sell that information to other retailers&#34;.(Note: I&#39;m not saying my rewrite is unbiased.  It&#39;s not.  It&#39;s just biased in a different direction to highlight the contrast.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To me this editor gets it right in the sense that we don’t need to get rid of code as the “nocode” movement is trying. Instead we need to make coding more enjoyable and figure out ways to make it more interactive.One specific thing Utopia addresses to me is the need for the code and the actual thing to be treated more as one single interactable component and not two separate things.Instead we&#39;re treating the thing as a one-way compile step. There&#39;s no way to sync the DevTools in-memory changes we make to the DOM with the actual code.The fact that Utopia allows the two things to be treated as one is a huge step towards making webdev more enjoyable.And they’re following good steps… SwiftUI’s editor is very similar in this regard. Using the code as the main thing but having all kinds of interactable components around it that make writing code simpler with cool visual autocomplete widgets &amp; visual aids.Before with direct DOM changes building something like this was impossible but now with the React paradigm is seems natural to have this sync between code and visuals.Kudos to the team for pulling this off."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"After five minutes of playing with it and failing to find it... where is the panel of components to drag and drop into the tree? Seems like the most basic functionality in an editor like this. Something that VB had in 1993. This should be something that is obvious and visible on a first glance.Another issue I have with the UI is that a lot of elements are greyed out even though they remain interactive. The convention is that UI elements that are greyed out are not interactive due to the current state of the application (wrong mode, unmatched requisites etc). This application seems to violate that and I&#39;m still baffled as to what greying out of UI elements means in in this app. If they aren&#39;t disabled why are they greyed out?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Product designer here. I just spent the past few hours fine-tuning some visual details in our Figma component library. Now I need to file tickets for each change and work with our frontend developers to make sure the updated Figma details get properly mapped over to React.I&#39;ve grown numb to the friction, but I think this Utopia demo just reset my pain tolerance. Going back to manually mapping designs from Figma mocks to React components feels so dated. Almost like those PSD2HTML websites of the early 2000s.The market absolutely needs a product like this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I can’t help but see some kind of special interest or agenda whenever I hear a news story now. You have to ask why they chose to report this, why they slant things one way or another with their choice of wording and emphasis. What is the aspect of this story that is too politically incorrect or unfashionable to be included?I have never researched a topic deeply and found that the media had been covering that topic accurately, ever. The harsh truth is that generally speaking the news is almost completely useless. You might as well just never watch it.I think the very final nail in the coffin was the leaked recordings of the CNN technical director basically admitting what everyone pretty much already knew. That they spread misinformation deliberately, only give interviews to subject experts who they know will say what CNN prefers them to say and ultimately design everything they put on the screen to get hooks inside your limbic system and keep your eyes glued. The main tool they use to do this is the emotion of fear, and it was for this reason and no other that they created a COVID death counter. And every single one of those points is explicitly, literally and plainly stated on video by a very senior employee of CNN for all to see. so I’m afraid that I can’t be brushed aside as a Russian bot. It’s right there on YouTube.And what about all the other media companies? This CNN leak, which is maybe the very embodiment of a scoop, was not on the front page of any major newspaper or news website. It was not elaborated on. It was basically not reported."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Anyone else burnt out from the outrage cycle in recent times?I don’t know if it’s selfish but I just don’t have the energy anymore to care about what bad thing person X or company Y did this week.My current philosophy is to treat news/Reddit/social media like email in the old days.That is: log on to a desktop computer once a week and read the highlights. It is not accessible except through the desktop computer.The funny thing is this approach is completely opposite the “stories” trend in social media. It makes you really aware of the FOMO-by-design pattern these days."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Bill Ackman runs a hedge fund and was a guest on CNBC right at the beginning of the US getting hit with the pandemic proclaiming travel industry going to go downhill while having made bets on that happening. [0] For those outside the US, CNBC is a business/financial/stock market news channel.&gt; “America will end as we know it. I’m sorry to say so, unless we take this option,” he told CNBC on March 18, five days before ending his bet against the market. “We need to shut it down now. ... This is the only answer.”He then made $2B a week later.  I would assume most guests on that network are there to make statements to try and sway the market in some way to their favor.  You just don&#39;t know if they are long or short on whatever they are talking about so without those disclosures.If you think more online based news is better like Motley Fool.

This needs to stop. All in the name of providing services or improving lives of people. Who cares about the dark side? How much profiling has gone into the collected data? What kind of risks it may pose in the future?This needs to stop... the sooner the better...Everyone has the right to be private.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Nice to see turtle graphics mentioned in this context. Back when I learned to code, it was one of the more common teaching techniques, and I still believe that it&#39;s one of the most &#34;hands on&#34; ways to explain loops, recursion etc.As far as development environments - have you tried Thonny (https://thonny.org/)? It has some nice features in it that are specifically geared towards explaining how things work. For example, when you debug, you can step through subexpressions, and their values are automatically substituted in the editor as they are computed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great post. And kudos to the groundbreaking work by Eben Upton and others in Cambridge, for giving the Raspberry PI to us so this kind of effort can now happen anywhere in the world at minimum cost.PyTurtle is a great library for educational use - I used it to teach 11-year-olds in Scotland how to draw a house. The approach take was: instruct pupils to draw a house on paper, using only straight lines; teach them briefly what a coordinate system is (assigning numeric addresses - pairs of numbers - to points), which they haven&#39;t had in their maths curriculum at that stage, but which they easily picked up; translate the paper-based house into a sequence of PyTurtle Python commands."</p>
