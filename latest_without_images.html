								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m going to explain what has happened so far. What happens next entirely depends on how inflation continues and the feds reaction.1. We had zero percent interest rates. This causes the value of assets with cash flows out into the future (think speculative tech, Tesla) to accelerate.2. We had massive herding in megacap tech. These valuations are high in part because for a decade you would not have beat the index without having these names in your portfolio.3. These valuations blew up even further because of call squeezes during the 2020-2021 bull. Tesla even managed to get itself into the S&amp;P.5. Then in December, the megacaps we&#39;re squeezed further until the S&amp;P 500 had a negative return relative to price!A lot of this occured because people remained under the impression that bond yields would never normalize. Now that they have, there is a risk free alternative to stocks.Now for the next complications: Ukraine + Russia, economic war with  China, inflation, how the fed will respond, gas prices.If inflation continues and the fed becomes aggressive with hiking, all assets are dead. Bonds will be wrecked, stocks will be wrecked, cash is wrecked, even gold (depending on how aggressively they hike) will be dead because it&#39;s actually a really good deal to buy bonds when they yield north of 10% (if we get there).Say the fed decides not to hike as aggressively and inflation slows, then you&#39;ll be holding the S&amp;P 500 likely for yield than growth. In the case of a recession or further inflation, that yield may be at risk depending on the sectors you&#39;re invested in.In this context the correction in names like Target make perfect sense. The dividend was near zero at it&#39;s price before the cut. Same thing happened in a company like Newmont mining."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I would be planning to ride this thing out for at least eighteen months or more.I&#39;m betting more like three to five years.I was talking to a friend (another old guy, like me, but really rich, unlike me).We&#39;ve both been through at least two recessions (big, nasty ones, with teeth and claws). We realized that there&#39;s an entire generation of folks; many running companies, that have never seen a real bear market.It&#39;s likely they are having a shit hemorrhage, right now.The company I used to work for, was (still is) an over 100-year-old Japanese company. They lasted through a devastating war, a depression, multiple recessions, and were still around. I&#39;m hoping that they stay around. They&#39;ve made some choices that could be disastrous (I think that sidelining my team was one ;), but not the same kind a lot of companies are making now. Lots of people are leveraged to the hilt. Bad place to be, when the economy starts tanking.HODL is the word. Live cheaply, so you don&#39;t need to cash out in a trough. Don&#39;t rely on other people&#39;s money, keep debt way down, keep margins high, optimize processes, etc.Old-fashioned stuff. It worked 100 years ago, and still works today.Not everything old is bad."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; In the early 80s, the G7 economies tightened the money supply, raising interest rates dramatically, in an effort to bring inflation under control.This article points out a similarity between the early 80s and now. So I think it&#39;s appropriate to point out a major difference as well.Consider this chart[1] which shows both the short term interest rate (Federal Funds rate) and long term interest rate (10-year Treasury yield) since 1962. Before rates started rising in the late 70s, the market was used to an interest rate between 5-10% (both long and short term), after which it rose to 15% (long term) and 20% (short term). Compare this with the current situation. Markets now have been used to 0% short term interest rates and 2-3% long term interest rates for over 10 years. The little blip you see to the far right of the chart is how much interest rates have risen so far (to 0.83% short term and 2.85% long term). If such a tiny blip (historically speaking) is the cause of the current correction, then it seems reasonable to expect that this is only a tiny part of a much greater correction that comes if interest rates get even close to the levels seen in the start 80s.[1] https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=PIsi"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a very interesting theory, but also low-quality evidence. It merits further study, but hard to say that it merits any change in behavior just yet.As far as I can tell, the &#34;340 000&#34; person study was finally published in 2020[1]. The study was an observational analysis of 342,000 dialysis patients. There was no attempt to measure personal exposure to UV (FTA: &#34;it was not feasible to determine personal exposures to UV radiation and temperature&#34;). Rather, these exposures were approximated by dialysis center zip code.I can understand why David Fisher would say that he doesn&#39;t question the data, but doesn&#39;t agree with the implications.1 = https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/JAHA.119.013837"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I read this article a couple years ago and it definitely influenced my thoughts on the matter.I think this is yet another case of us collectively ignoring common sense. We know that UV radiation is damaging to the skin and can cause skin cancer. Instead of rubbing chemicals on our skin to negate these effects, it is better to avoid being out in direct sunlight when the UV index is high, especially if you&#39;re super pale. If you have to go out at mid day for a decent length of time, wear a big hat and clothes that cover you up.I&#39;m on the pale end of the spectrum and if I go out at say 2pm when the UV index is at 10 it&#39;ll be physically painful within a few minutes.However, when I go for my daily walks earlier in the day or later in the afternoon when the UV index is say 3-4, I go without sunscreen and feel great. And even though I supplement vitamin D, the effects of sunlight is clearly better.Also I think it is safe to imagine that most of our ancient ancestors weren&#39;t going out in the most intense sunlight and stripping close to naked for hours to develop a nice tan."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I didn’t see discussed was the possibility of the reverse causation. People that have more diseases spend less time outside and therefore have lower levels of vitamin D.Would explain why vitamin D supplements don’t seem to work in the studies mentioned in the article.Does anyone here know?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Cool pet project, admirable engineering etc.My comment is about something else: net neutrality, as someone already mentioned.I was teaching English in Laos for school kids. I was amazed that some of their families struggle with providing (nutritious enough) food for their children, yet, everyone had smartphones with always-on 4G,even in the countryside - however, no WiFi almost anywhere.The brains of these kids are like sponge. They WANT to learn, they&#39;re shy, but they want to speak, to read, to practice English. They also like to (constantly) sing (something that is badly missing from western schools), so at one point I referred them to &#34;simple English Wikipedia&#34;, where they can research their favorite singers with easy-to-process articles.Empty stares.&#34;so instead of Wikipedia.org, you go to simple.wikipedia.org.&#34;Still nothing.I had to realize later that even if they knew that this free, always available encyclopedia exists, it&#39;s NOT included in their 4G subscription.Yes, you guessed correctly: those subscriptions are sponsored by big US / Chinese corps, so all these kids had were Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and TikTok, everything else costs ~10$ which is days worth of meals for whole families there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My experience with in-flight message-only WiFi is that they&#39;re just really slow and the ping times are long. Some services are actively blocked, e.g. Skype wouldn&#39;t work at all even for text messages, but browsing the internet is usually allowed. My VPN wouldn&#39;t work, but I suspect it might have if I used an obfuscated connection instead of OpenVPN or whatever the default is (e.g. over SSL). I could load GMail in the browser and Wikipedia probably would have worked. It&#39;s strongly website dependent. Hacker News is extraordinarily resilient to lousy connections and generally the index would always load without any trouble. It works even on a 3 second ping over satellite internet. Very few websites are that tolerant.The flight crew (BA) knew what&#39;s up. They specifically warned us to check which package we were getting, because evidently they get a lot of complaints when people buy the message-only bundle and are surprised that nothing works.Singapore gave out free passes for single devices last time I flew with them. It was possible to rotate MAC addresses by forgetting the connection and then re-joining. The connection was quite good, you could watch YouTube in potato resolution. It&#39;s quite fun to chat to people and send them photos out of the window."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Many years ago (2012) Delta inflight wifi would allow DNS queries out without paying. Being a very frequent flyer I used to run an ip-over-dns tunnel using Iodine[1]. It was slow but worked. I wonder if they’ve blocked that hole yet.[1] https://code.kryo.se/iodine/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have tried to faithfully summarize the video here. If you notice a mistake or omission, please correct me.Rossmann’s main message: “to complain about something that is an option rather than complain about all of the options that are missing misses the forest for the trees”.Key points:1. For certain repairs, Apple’s repair program has “made availiable the exact same OEM parts and tools that they use” via rental. Renting these tools is optional and not required; Rossmann recognizes that while he (and in his opinion, most people) will likely not use these tools, their availability is a non-issue.2. Sean Hollister’s article in The Verge was highly critical of the entire self-repair process, and called out the weight and price of this completely optional tool rental. Per Rossmann, “part of the problem with tech journalism in general is… focusing on the things that are easy rather than focusing on the things that matter”.3. Rossmann reminds us that the right-to-repair fight is far from over. Board schematics and individual components are still not available even to authorized repair shops. He argues that these would enable him to more efficiently perform repairs.4. Rossmann: While the tech press’s complaints are “making the right to repair people look like… fools”, “it is important to [know] that they don’t represent us [normal repair shops and average users]”."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good on Rossmann for calling out bullshit on his own side. Legitimate issues often get hijacked by do-nothing whiners, yet all too often they get ignored or even encouraged for the sake of prioritizing short term political gain."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I totally agree with Rossmann: the more important thing is that you can lease the equipment from Apple but there is no obligation. The equipment is intended to do a job compliant with Apple standard but, if you don&#39;t care to replace the water proof sealant, etc, you can use tools you already have or more cheap from your regular sources ( hardware stores, ebay, etc). The right to repair is a serious matter, without activist like Rossmann, who spent his time to speak to the US Congress, we wouldn&#39;t even have the spare parts from Apple: this is the real vantage, not the possibility to lease the tools."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So many memories. I am one of those who grew with WinXP (though I usd Win95 at school and for a few years Win98 at home), and as someone said in another comment, what else could a teen geek want besides WinXP with a bandwith connection?I still feel that seeing a XP Desktop screenshot invites to much more experiences (possibly online) than a Win10/Win11 screenshot. It may be with the fact that I associate it to different internet eras as well. With XP I used to browse websits, fansites, blogs, forums, chats, MSN messenger/Yahoo Messenger/etc, whil now everything seems to be the boring social networks where almost everything is generated/shared.Internet used to be much fun back then, and it may be the reason why most of the people have good memories about XP. I think the main reason (and I wanted to write an &#34;essay&#34; about this for a while) it&#39;s that we were offline by default in our lives, and we used to &#34;go online&#34; for a few hours durnig the day. Then you had your experience in the real world and went online to talk about them. Now it is the other way around - we live online by default, sharing photos and videos from a concert almost in real time, photos from a museum, etc. I think it took away its novelty."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The most important point in this article is that whether Tether is fully collateralized ultimately doesn&#39;t matter. As long as there are well-capitalized parties (Bitfinex, other exchanges) that want to prop up Tether, it will be fine. Nobody should be under the illusion that Tether is decentralized or anything other than a bet on Bitfinex."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; As of this writing, on May 20th, it has yet to regain the pegThis is misleading.  Tether has consistently traded between $0.998 and $0.999 between May 13th and May 20th.  See https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/Is it trading at 0.1% lower than it was before the Terra USD collapse? Yes. Has it &#34;lost its peg&#34;?  No."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem here is that everyone in the crypto industry is taking George Soros&#39;s approach to bubbles: “When I see a bubble, I rush in to buy it.”There is more money to be made on the gravy train of providing liquidity for trades, yield farming, etc. than in trying to short Tether and potentially bleeding out before it goes bust."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you haven&#39;t seen this before, you should definitely give it a try.  I am a big CLI person but I still find it useful, especially for displaying/visualizing metrics/performance.If you&#39;re on a RHEL or Fedora base, it might be already installed and running.  You just hit it on port 9090 with your web browser, and log in with your OS creds (same that you use for SSH).  If it&#39;s not installed yet and/or you want to also add performance co-pilot[1], it&#39;s pretty easy to do:    # Install cockpit and pcp and activate services
    dnf install -y cockpit pcp cockpit-pcp
    systemctl enable --now cockpit.socket
    systemctl enable --now pmlogger

    # If needed, open port 9090 in the firewall
    firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-service=cockpit

    # Alternatively you can open it for just your own IP
    firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-rich-rule=&#39;rule family=&#34;ipv4&#34; source address=&#34;38.14.154.124&#34; port protocol=&#34;tcp&#34; port=&#34;9090&#34; accept&#39;

Here&#39;s the same commands in a gist if preferred:  https://gist.github.com/FreedomBen/62b348ed45045e53356aeb714...[1]:  https://cockpit-project.org/guide/latest/feature-pcp"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oh hey, Cockpit; I remember when this was started. It was the Red Hat desktop team&#39;s skunkworks project to make an actual good server UI after the last few attempts failed; I can&#39;t find any evidence of it, but I swear there was this ridiculous project to generate a &#34;Linux API&#34; by automatically combining every other API and adding prefixes and headers. That came down from management since &#34;APIs&#34; were the hotness.The goal was to make in-roads on Windows Server-like deployments. &#34;Cattle, not pets&#34; was becoming uber-popular, but the thinking on the desktop team was that there was still a wide market for pets. People with toy servers, small businesses that just want a server inside their network, they all deserve UIs that don&#39;t require heavy sysadmin-ing.I think it turned out quite nicely, and it seems it&#39;s still going!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Cockpit is an impressively robust “server in a box” frontend for homelabs or my favorite, running on a little ARM SBC with a USB Ethernet gadget exported.Why is this a cool setup? B/c I can carry around a little Radxa Zero that looks like a USB-C Ethernet adapter to my iPad, Windows laptop, etc., and gets powered by the same port, and gives me Cockpit on a known local IP, mDNS advert, etc.It’s a pretty good “hacking on the plane/train/mountain” setup, if you’re ever in the mood to try such a thing. :)Edit/P.S.: why not just run a VM? See above re: iPad or other locked-down device; also, exposed GPIOs are useful sometimes too."</p>
