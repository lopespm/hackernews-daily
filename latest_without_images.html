								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m just going to come out and say something that I&#39;ve had a hard self reflective time coming to the conclusion of. I don&#39;t believe in free speech without limits.I have strongly felt that the actions taken by these companies is morally and ethically the right thing to do, for any business and that is inconsistent with believing in true free speech. My line for free speech seems to lie in speech that incites violence or speech that discriminates against people for immutable characteristics of their person, both of which I know Parler harbors in abundance. I think there are simply some ideas that are too repugnant to not rebuke.That said I don&#39;t like how centralized we&#39;ve become on these existing platforms either. Monopoly on communication means it&#39;s too easy to let that window slide on what is acceptable speech to limit."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It must feel pretty surreal to be someone that is constantly moving to different communication apps and instantly finding them pulled by anyone and everyone.We&#39;ve seen an escalation of this from higher-level platforms (obviously Twitter can ban an account if they desire) to medium-level platforms (I suppose Apple gets to pick what I can do on my own phone even if it feels a bit wrong), but I&#39;m curious if this will also escalate to low-level platforms (will hosting companies, registrars, or even ISPs start taking similar actions on a regular basis?).At this point it appears to be in a bit of a feedback loop as well, since it&#39;s obvious that deplatforming groups will make them feel persecuted and even more upset, which then makes them more likely to be deplatformed by whichever platform they move to next.Could this escalate even past low-level companies and result in decentralized, uncensorable, and end-to-end encrypted technologies having action taken against them (as more users, including some that are radicalized, seek them out)? I certainly hope not, but I have no faith in our government&#39;s various administrations here to begin with, especially given that we are likely only at the beginning of these types of conflicts.(Obligatory note that I am not defending any given platform, group of people, or anything of that matter, as I find it much more interesting to talk about how systems like this may play out instead)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s more serious reasons this file picker is broken.Here&#39;s a trivial to reproduce and obvious issue that&#39;s been there for several years now:1. Open a directory that loads slowly (e.g. one with thousands of files on a smb3 mount)2. While the list is loading, select a file (but do not open it)3. Wait for the whole list to loadOnce the list finishes loading, the file on the very top of the list gets automatically selected (discarding your selection).Thus, if you select a file and click open, in the time between you select and click open, the selection can auto-change and you&#39;ll end up opening something else than what you&#39;ve selected.It is this bad."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I find more a pain in the ass of the GtkFileChooser, it&#39;s that I can&#39;t type the path. It&#39;s very annoying, when you need to jump to a path that you have on the clipboard and you can&#39;t, and you are forced to navigate to these path because the removed a simple text field to puth the path.
The equivalent from QT/KDE does this far better. It allows the user to switch from the graphical &#34;user friendly&#34; path representation to a crude text field where you can write/removed/modify/copy/paste the path."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You will find lots of such examples of a feature which you personally find very important and wonder why such a simple thing is not supported yet. I guess everyone has such examples. And you will also find such examples for MacOSX or Windows.For me personally, I wonder why mouse wheel/scroll acceleration is still not implemented. I implemented it a while ago for Xorg, which is outdated now, and also the maintainer was not happy with my approach. It&#39;s now a long outstanding proposal for libinput, https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/libinput/libinput/-/issues/7 / https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver/-/issues/405 (original bug report from 2010: https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=29905).Anyway, I guess there are actually not too much people caring about this feature. And the intersection of those who do and those who have enough free time and knowledge to implement this is just empty.Btw, I don&#39;t quite understand the comment about KDE. It sounds like the the author claims that KDE lacks other relevant features. But comparing Gnome vs KDE, it is quite clear that KDE has much more features. This is never a complaint I heard about KDE."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am surprised that the comments haven&#39;t mentioned the role of SEO in Wikipedia&#39;s growth and defensibility.Wikipedia&#39;s habit of deep interlinking helped it rank back in the early aughts when the SEO rules were rather simple. Add to that the subdomain-driven localization strategy and many other moves that were considered SEO best practices back in those years when the on-page factors used to matter.But that was just the start. Wikipedia killed it in SEO when it was easy to do so, but it also did one other thing that most SEO-driven sites (eg: About) didn&#39;t do correctly - it cared deeply about the content quality and also resisted to run ads (anyone remember Jason Calacanis&#39; articles on how they are leaving $100m on the table? See [1]). So when Panda came around, Google correctly rewarded Wikipedia with #1 rankings for over 50% of its terms (!!), and Jason Calacanis had to shut down Mahalo which got destroyed by Panda.Wikipedia&#39;s dominance continues because it&#39;s basically impossible to overcome its lead in inbound links and domain authority. Add to that a surprisingly under-the-radar company culture which has avoided any major blow ups despite its community wielding so much leverage over the world&#39;s education and having to make a lot of difficult calls on a daily basis.Well done.[1] https://calacanis.com/2006/10/28/wikipedia-leaves-100m-on-th..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In grad school back in like 2007 I took a 2-credit class called &#34;The History of Nuclear Enterprise&#34; taught by one of those long white-haired Doc Brown type professors. The final project was for each of us to make Wikipedia pages describing some important topic that wasn&#39;t covered yet. I made one on the university&#39;s nuclear reactor which had just been shut down. I dug through many linear feet of archived info, scanning photos and collecting various info for the page. It was super rewarding. I was hooked.Variously since then I have gone deep into some fringe but important-to-some topic and found hard-to-find sources. I&#39;ve found it effective to collect and present this information in Wikipedia pages.Like a few months ago I made the page for the Aircraft Reactor Experiment [1], the world&#39;s first molten salt-fueled nuclear reactor, built and operated with intent to make nuclear-powered long-range aircraft. I&#39;m pretty proud of the page, and go back to use it somewhat regularly. Having the platform of Wikipedia inspires me to go the slight extra mile in personal research in a way that can be used by everyone.Thanks Wikipedia, for existing.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_Reactor_Experiment"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ah good stuff - I love Wikipedia more than almost any other non-living thing that has been created in my lifetime. If you had told me the idea as a pitch 20 years ago I would have assumed you were capital I insane for thinking it would work.It was pretty fresh when I was in college and I remember my professors all being pretty explicit about not using it as a source. Thought I had figured out the world’s biggest life hack when I started using the sources listed on Wikipedia as my sources for papers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This looks neat, but anyone interested should know there&#39;s also a whole mature field to solve similar problems. The field of control theory has some really simple and really robust methods for getting a system from state A to state B. If you aren&#39;t trying to learn how the system works simultaneous to your algorithm being deployed, it can be a really a good fit.This book and control theory solve different problems. I&#39;m just commenting because I sometimes see modern ML folks trying to apply super duper general techniques to problems that are easily solved specifically with simple undergrad-level techniques from the specific fields (including this material to control problems). Also, I just think control theory is really cool and perhaps under-discussed in &#34;cool math/eng stuff&#34; circles."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Advertising is evil episode 3457I know I say this a lot but ad-supported business models are corrupting. Spam is the original sin of the open internet and the unwillingness to get to grips with this is a big part of why we can&#39;t have nice things.Context: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurence_Canter_and_Martha_Sie...On Usenet, which ran on NNTP, every user could maintain their own killfile, which would allow people to hide spam. But it wasn&#39;t easy to share killfiles, and while the more technically capable people would easily filter it out they were also blinding themselves to a problem that eventually choked the life out of the community. Similar observations could be made about advertising on the web, from standardized banners leading towards today&#39;s web horrible mess.The basic problem is that the costs of spamming and lying are generally a lot lower than the potential profits, so the more opent he system the more spam it tends to attract. Try looking at used car adverts on Craigslist for example, dealers in busy areas tend to run a hundred ads a day with 500 keywords. Some people flag them, of course, but most don&#39;t bother and the profit in selling a single car is worth the minor downsides."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve worked at both SV and traditional companies, and I feel like this very closely matches my experience.One of the things I worry about is that even at companies that are doing &#34;Agile transformations&#34; and adopting methodologies like Scrum, in practice have &#34;Product Owners&#34; who are there to give instructions via Jira tickets. Other roles like &#34;Business Analysts&#34; are there to ensure that lowly developers never have to worry about things like understanding the business themselves.So I get funny looks when I suggest that engineers should go talk to people in the business, and write design docs. Silicon Valley engineering practices can look very non-Agile to a lot people from traditional companies that are doing Agile."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In my experience in the traditional companies none of this applies to “engineers,” it only applies to “software engineers,” mostly because they’re called “programmers” and are basically not considered “professionals.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"No focus on a structured product definition and leaving it to engineers to &#39;figure it out&#39; does not bode well for the end user or business itself.This is a real experience in a FAANG company - we were developing a new product in enterprise space targeted to small enterprise IT admins who may not be highly trained or experienced.One of tiny feature was the ability to download and self manage security certificates (upload again if any issue with security), it took literally weeks to define this feature by the engg and UX team. From tiny things like how to name the downloaded security files.. should we have the app name in the file or not - otherwise how would IT admin locate the file when they search, should file have time stamp because later we discovered that these d**n things expire, is there a &#39;standard&#39; to begin with that defines the naming convention of these things, and so on..All this because? The detailed level of spec is never written by product managers. Which I think is a very foolish culture, particularly in enterprise space."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was on the fence about this, but reading the comments convinced me it was the absolute right decision.The fact that all these institutions just allowed this horrible hateful speech for four years, in the name of free speech etc, despite all the harassment, harm (mental and otherwise) it caused to so many people in America actually emboldened so many to the extent that now that they crossed this invisible line, they can&#39;t even really understand the ramifications of what happened. That what gets me.To be hyperfocused on the free speech or &#34;big brother&#34; aspect of these bans, not the fact that a small group of rioters were just a few feet away from irreversibly staining American history with the blood of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th in the chain of command of the United states of America, as well as overrunning the seat of power of the most powerful nation in the world, on national TV ... just tells me that things really went too far and should have been shut down much sooner.I&#39;m sure a lot of the people at the capitol that day have the narrative running in their minds that they are the heroes of America democracy, but the reality is that there is simply no justification for any of this, that can be told. A smarter group of individuals would take all this on the chin, make penance in some way while staying under the radar to regroup and reconfigure their message/approach instead of citing private business overreach as some sort of justification for what happened"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is a difference between bank accounts, Visa/MasterCard access and Internet service, on one hand, and App Stores, Twitter accounts and payment providers, on the other hand.The First Amendment promises both free speech and free assembly. Core to the latter is the freedom not to assemble. This freedom is regulated. You can’t refuse to do business with protected classes. But political affiliation is not a protected class.There are utilities, which have limited freedom not to assemble. Then there are private persons and private businesses. Stripe and Twitter are clearly the latter. AWS and Visa feel like the former, though they are legally the latter.The cost of switching private activity to a utility model is a loss of innovation and an increase in political involvement. We are re-evaluating, as a society, the balance between the freedoms of speech and assembly. Let’s not forget these are freedoms in balance, not a spectrum of tyranny and anarchy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"“All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.”— George Orwell, Animal FarmI understand the moves by Stripe, Twitter, and co. However, I would argue that the long term implications set by this precedent are much worse. When the Snowden story first broke back in 2013, many on HN argued that, hey it&#39;s all good, I have nothing to hide, and I trust our President. Three short years later, who took the office? Would you have every imagined that? The same goes for this. Think five minutes into the future if you will.If the leader of the free world can be banned from all social media and co, who are based in the very same nation, and who are monopolies, then what hope is there for the rest of us?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There isn&#39;t exactly a shortage of examples where mmap() was in the short-term quite convenient to get to market quickly with something Good Enough to appear production ready, that in the long-term proved to be rather problematic.Mongodb&#39;s original mmap storage engine (32-bit support anyone?), ultimately required replacement (wiredtiger was purchased in part for this reason IIRC).systemd-journald read side (journalctl, `systemctl status`, sd-journal API), performance/scalability definitely suffers from the decision to use mmap for all IO.mmap IO is extremely seductive in terms of programming style/convenience as it facilitates writing procedural, IO-naive code that assumes file-backed memory accesses Just Work.  But this is transparently blocking, synchronous code.Since your program isn&#39;t explicitly scheduling IO and continuations for execution upon completion of IO, there&#39;s zero application-level IO parallelism.  The only asynchronous IO possible is what the kernel can automagically perform using relatively dumb page fault heuristics and madvise() hints.When your process triggers a major fault on an mmap region, everything comes to a grinding hault; no speculative execution past that point, no potential for triggering other page faults in other files or independent regions of the same file, it all stops until the data is read from the backing store.  Not without the use of threads, which brings a host of other issues."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Claiming &#34;mmap is faster than system calls&#34; is dangerous.I once worked for a company where they also heard someone say &#34;mmap is faster than read/write&#34; and as a consequence rewrite their while( read() ) loop into the following monstrosity:1. mmap a 4KB chunk of the file2. memcpy it into the destination buffer3. munmap the 4KB chunk4. repeat until eofThis is different from the claim in the article -- the above monstrosity is individually mmaping each 4KB block, while I presume the article&#39;s benchmark is mmaping the entire file in memory at once, which makes much more sense.After I claimed the &#34;monstrosity&#34; was absurdly stupid, someone pointed to a benchmark they made and found that the &#34;monstrosity&#34; version was actually faster. To me, this made  no sense. The monstrosity has triple the syscall overhead vs the read() version, requires manipulating page tables for every 4KB block and as a consequence had several page faults for each 4KB block of the file. Yet it was true: their benchmarks showed the monstrosity version to be slightly faster.The idealist in me couldn&#39;t stand this and I reverted this change, using for my own (unrelated) experiments a binary which used the older, classic, read() loop instead of mmap.Eventually I noticed I was getting results much faster using my build on my single-socket Xeon than they were getting on their $$$ server farms. Despite what the benchmark said.Turns out, the &#34;monstrosity&#34; was indeed faster, but if you had several of these binaries running concurrently on the same machine, they would all slow down each other, as if the kernel was having scale issues with multiple processes constantly changing their page tables. The thing would slow down to single-core levels of performance.I still have no idea why the benchmark was apparently slightly faster, but obviously they were checking it either isolated or on machines where the other processes where running read() loops. I guess that by wasting more kernel CPU time on yourself you may starve other processes in the system leaving more user time for yourself. But once every process does it, the net result is still significantly lowered performance for everyone.Just yet another anecdote for the experience bag..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not sure the conclusion that vector instructions are responsible for the speed-up is correct. Both implementations seem to use ERMS (using REP MOVSB instructions)[0]. Looking at the profiles, the syscall implementation spends time in the [xfs] driver (even in the long test), while the mmap implementation does not. It appears the real speed-up is related to how memory-mapped pages interact with the buffer cache.I might be misunderstanding things. What is really going on here?[0] Lines 56 and 180 here: http://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=sysdeps/x86_..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/896/censorship&gt; In general, sedition is defined as trying to overthrow the government with intent and means to bring it about; the Supreme Court, however, has been divided over what constitutes intent and means.&gt; These acts made it a federal crime to speak, write, or print criticisms of the government that were false, scandalous, or malicious.It is frightening to me that so many U.S. citizens get their perception of reality through social media channels; that is to say they get messages that are amplified by algorithm with insufficient regard to refutability (and a requirement of evidence to refute or confirm.)As someone who cannot visit every single polling place in the country (I visited zero and voted by mail) I cannot with absolute certainty proclaim that there there was no widespread, coordinated and shockingly well-concealed election fraud. As a person of logic and reason and based on multiple sources of information that I consider reputable, I strongly believe this did not take place, and I would need multiple, reputable sources of information and likely trusted peer acceptance before I would change my mind to believe it did.My way of trying to only accept what I believe to be accurate information will always be imperfect, and, at times, fail me. But I believe it is only shades different from what someone who believes in election fraud does. Their sources include the content of speeches made by the President of the United States, news anchors and journalists of conversatively-biased news, and perhaps most importantly, peers they trust liking and sharing those same speeches and articles with them as a stamp of acceptance.That&#39;s a complex and very human problem that is not readily solved with gut reactions, broad strokes and absolutes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is not an original idea/thought that I have, but feel repeating it is vital:This whole censorship crusade that the Facebook, twitter &amp; now reddit is on is a dangerous precedence we are setting for our society. Whatever they call it, this is censorship.Already due to AI suggesting similar contents on services like Facebook &amp; Youtube and the design of sub-reddits on reddit, we have living inside echo chambers. Atleast users have an option of searching for different contents on the platform. It&#39;s a bit easier to come out of the echo chamber. Now, by pushing people off the platform, echo chamber platforms are coming up like parler &amp; rumble. The divide is widening.I am not sure what other options are there, but censorship is the worst option."</p>
