								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Context on what I believe they mean by &#34;fraudulent&#34;.Steam back in the day used to accept 0 confirmation bitcoin spends. This means that the transaction has been gossiped on the bitcoin p2p network but had not yet been mined into a block and thus had minimal finality guarantees. Steam could see that they were going to receive a bitcoin payment (when the transaction was mined into a block) and would credit the users account instantly for a better purchase UX.Turns out anyone with some deeper understanding of bitcoin could construct another transaction spending the same bitcoin back to themselves before their original transaction was ever put in a block. The bitcoin community moved away from accepting &#39;0 conf&#39; transactions pretty much everywhere because of this reason.In fact the high fee era (2016-2018) saw many wallets incorporating this &#34;double spend&#34; feature into their wallets. This is known as RBF, &#34;replace by fee&#34; and is really useful when you need to bump your transaction up the queue. You replace your old transaction, that is waiting to be mined, with a new one that offers a higher fee to incentivize miners to add it to a new block.I think its rather unfortunate that 0 conf transactions were written off so quickly. There are many context where a 0conf tx makes sense, mostly IRL. But, if you are running a business online and you don&#39;t trust you customers you should wait 3-6 blocks after the transaction has been mined before delivering your goods."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unfortunately no details were given about what makes 50% of all bitcoin transactions “fraudulent” ?What does that even mean?* did someone try to send something other then bitcoin to a ₿ address?* did a client claim he payed and did the payment seem to fail on his end?* did a client not realise that you as payee also pay for the network fee?Nowadays these kind of problems would be easily prevented by using bitcoin lightning payments, because they work in a fraction of a second and specify the exact amount that has to be payed.
Also they are almost free of transaction costs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There seems to be a basic misunderstanding on the part of the pro-btc ppl here all saying &#34;how is that fraud?&#34; or &#34;how is that steams problem?&#34;If you run a business that can be used in a money laundering scheme, even if you are not a victim, you have a legal responsibility to try to limit/prevent that actually.The crypto crowd may not like that, but it&#39;s not up to them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This with WINE is what I think is the perfect combination of GUI and CLI... but as a long-time Windows user, several things stood out and made it look slightly off:    the menu bar and padding around the icon labels is too tall
    the window borders are slightly too wide (compared to the default)
    scrollbar buttons shouldn&#39;t disable at end of travel
    sort direction indicator in header control (which first appeared in Win2k) should be a grey triangle, not a black arrow
    &#34;KiB&#34; and &#34;GiB&#34;
    font has some weird keming in some places

Nonetheless, this is a lot closer lookalike than some of the others I&#39;ve seen, such as this one:https://kmandla.wordpress.com/projects/lookalike-windows-xp-..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Make Linux look exactly like Windows 95... I mean *exactly*.Good try, but if you&#39;re going to emphasize the exactness, I&#39;m going to nitpick.In the top picture ( https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_p... ), the menu bar has too much vertical padding and lacks mnemonic (underlined) letters. The amount of padding on the desktop icon text also looks off. A good example is https://socket3.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/w95ptoys-1.png .In the second picture ( https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_p... ), Calculator just looks completely off. The Taskbar has too much space between the icon and window title. The tray icons should go in the same box as the clock, not outside. Good examples: https://i.pinimg.com/originals/27/fc/05/27fc05d3f826760c7fd0... ; https://www.cultofmac.com/ezoimgfmt/cdn.cultofmac.com/wp-con...And this isn&#39;t even going as far as to nitpick the exact font-rendering algorithm down to the pixel."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Microwave drilling. It&#39;s a known thing at small scale.[1] If it can be done at larger scale, it ought to have other applications. Doing it downhole at the end of a long pipe string is going to be much harder than doing it in a factory. So why isn&#39;t this an industrial machining process already, like plasma cutting?GA Drilling was pushing plasma drilling back in 2018.[2] They&#39;re still pushing it, but not making holes.The University of Minnesota was pushing electro-pulse boring in 2015.[3] Again, no deep holes.There&#39;s something called ThermoDrilling, which, despite the name, is more like a water jet cutter.[4]Successful projects are still using mechanical drilling.[5]So there are a lot of deep hole drilling approaches being studied. Anything that works would be used by the oil and gas industry, and if they&#39;re not trying it, one suspects it might not be working.[1] https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270653673_Microwave...[2] https://www.gadrilling.com/[3] https://experts.umn.edu/en/publications/electro-pulse-boring...[4] https://www.geodrillinginternational.com/deep-geothermal/new...[5] https://geothermalengineering.co.uk/united-downs/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Something I&#39;ve always wondered.Wouldn&#39;t massive scale geothermal end up pumping more heat into the atmosphere that otherwise wouldn&#39;t be there?In contrast, the energy collected by solar and wind generators is from the energy added to Earth by the sun and would be energy in our atmosphere regardless of whether  or not we collect it.But it seems like the heat inside the Earth&#39;s core should be fairly well insulated by the lithosphere, and it only slowly leaks out over time. If we start pulling that energy out at a faster rate to generate electricity, could that have a noticeable net increase on total energy under the atmosphere, or is it such an insignificant amount of energy relative to the sun&#39;s to not even bother worrying about?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yeah right. They drilled in Strasbourg, France, to get this &#34;free&#34; energy. When they entered production, the city was experiencing an earthquake every month, waking the city at night.
After a magnitude 4 earthquake, they finally shut down the plant.A town in Germany is  devastated also due to geothermal power: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staufen_im_Breisgau"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Something interesting I guess most people don&#39;t know, the pro-ukrainian mobilisations in Poland (I can only speak about Poland) is amazing. My FB wall is full of people providing their apartments for free, giving jobs etc. There is over 100 cars long queue at a border willing to transport Ukrainians escaping war where they want. They can travel by train for free in Poland.Now not so good tidbit. Just few months ago we had a lot of people lured into Belarus by Lukashenko trying to come to Europe. Poland treated them really really poorly. Catching them after crossing border and pushing them back. The society was split among pro-refugees and anti. The political parties almost all focused on &#34;protecting our border&#34;.I was afraid that this natalist sentiment might repeat, even though Ukrainians are one of the closest people to Poland. I am very happy to note I haven&#39;t heard anyone speaking against refugees from Ukraine, not on twitter not on facebook not by far-right parties, altough I am sure some people are silent about their opinions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Context:Portugal has a large and extremely well integrated Ukrainian community.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Portugal is such an awesome country. I love going there and wouldn&#39;t mind staying there a bit longer at some point.More countries should do this; Germany and my home country the Netherlands in particular. I live in Berlin currently as a foreigner (perfect place for that). Lots of people from all over eastern Europe live here, lots of companies here outsource all over eastern Europe, lots of people that I know either come from or have friends/family from the Ukraine. Also, about 200k people of Russian origin live here that chose to move here after the wall fell. And I assume quite a few Ukranians.I remember meeting refugees from the former Yugoslavia in the nineties. I think 25 years later, a lot of those people did pretty well. I actually visited Bosnia for work last summer and met a guy that went to school in Munich. Likewise a lot of Syrian refugees that ended up in Germany seem to be doing OK. Quite a few ended up here in Berlin. In times of war, people are generally grateful if you accommodate them; even if it isn&#39;t always with open arms.It&#39;s usually the smart, free thinkers that need to flee. Incidentally those are also people likely to find a way to make it in life; start businesses; or otherwise be generally successful.The US is full of such people that emigrated there after various wars in the last century. Now is not a time to be xenophobic about this sort of thing."</p>

So to shut off their central bank from the international financial system, or at least the dollar and euro economy, is a massively destabilising move potentially,” said Lipsky.’Edward Fishman, a former US official now at the Center for a New American Security, said it would present a “devastating blow” to the Russian economy that would eclipse the significance of a ban on Swift.’"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It is definitely the last one.&gt;Last, using swift as a weapon against Russia could hurt long-term American interests. America holds sway over international finance thanks to the dollar’s dominance and its pre-eminent role in global settlement systems. Further politicising swift would give China an incentive to bolster cips, its rival to swift for cross-border payments in yuan. It would also help China court any country with uneasy relations with America looking for alternatives.I would imagine there are additional politics in play with disabling SWIFT. I dont how many countries will need to agree before shutting down SWIFT access, if it is at the will of US it would be more like a semi-nuclear option.Although I am already surprised by CIPS, one eighth of transaction volume of SWIFT is not &#34;well behind&#34;. From many POV this already seems like a battle the west are clearly losing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Why the West is reluctant to deny Russian banks access to SWIFT&#34;Because Europe is dependent on Russian gas (thanks to an ill thought out denuclearization drive), and both Europe and US governments prefer their economic and electoral interests over Ukraine or the international order. The rest of the article are really silly excuses (Russia is a relatively small economy and can&#39;t meaningfully hurt the dollar etc.)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It can be, relatively speaking, quite easy to defend a city, the Syrian rebels in East Aleppo became quite good at it pretty fast, the same goes for the rebels in the Damascus neighbourhood of Jobar (for this latter example I recommend this video [1], it gives a general idea of how it well went; bear in mind that it was filmed from the pov of the government forces).The problem is that the attacking force at some point realises that the defendants are pretty well dug in and the commanders of those attacking forces also realise that one of the few solutions available in order to achieve victory is to, almost quite literally, flatten the city. That&#39;s what happened in East Aleppo (with the help of the Russian airforce), that&#39;s what happened in Jobar, too. Not sure if the flattening of Kyiv would be the best thing for the Ukranian people going forward.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9ZXPhmR7lQ"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting read. I guess it&#39;s self-evident, but not having thought about the topic, the utility of rubble and repurposing semi-destroyed structures, as well as how important snipers are, were new to me. Maybe the importance of snipers makes civilians being handed out guns in Kyiv now seem less futile.Would be interested to read a basic explainer along these lines on &#34;How to Rebuild a City&#34; -- I guess one divergence from urban planning/development literature would be on how to reuse rubble? Given the many destroyed cities through history including this century which have been at least partially reubilt (perhaps Grozny was first of this century?) I guess there must be plenty written on this topic."</p>
