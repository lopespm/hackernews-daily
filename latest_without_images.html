								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For the professional (or former professional) astronomers among us, I will make my somewhat amused observation that what people are most paying attention to is not really the distinguishing features of JWST.People seem most impressed by the apparent increase in resolution of the images, which is not from a certain point of view the hardest thing to do .  HST might have done that if its instruments had been of different pixel size or imaging array size / focal length.   Ok, the much larger mirror is an achievement.   But anyway, the resolution of the images is often not what really is the limiting factor for photometric observations.  Yes it is sharper/higher resolution, but that wasn&#39;t the key selling point.The new thing is observations in the IR, which is somewhat a technical footnote in many gushing announcements of these images (or some discussion here too).   And the general public knows little about that detail&#39;s importance, especially since the images are stylized / colored anyway to look just like RGB images that we are so familiar with.   But everyone can easily appreciate a sharper image.Anyway, still a momentous achievement.  And thank god we have a scientific field where stunning images was enough to get the public to support a $10B project.**Edit to add: I did not mean to detract from or diminish anyone&#39;s appreciation of the images and accomplishment at whatever level they are enjoyed.   And of course many here are technically knowledgeable about the IR aspect.   I just write to point out that for the most headline-grabbing images and newspaper writers, the sharpness of the images over the actual IR frontier is what grabs the attention."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s a backyard telescope versus Webb: https://twitter.com/AJamesMcCarthy/status/154694183270093209...More comparisons on Twitter, some zoomed in:- https://twitter.com/Batsuto_/status/1546899241880240128- https://twitter.com/Batsuto_/status/1546900387931766784- https://twitter.com/JBWillcox/status/1546881033597075457- https://twitter.com/jason4short/status/1546626672488632321I&#39;m not a physicist, so I&#39;ve only recently learned about redshift. Hubble&#39;s deep field images were very dark red/orange because further objects appear redder (into infrared) before they disappear to the observer. Webb&#39;s sensors are more red/infrared-sensitive than Hubble&#39;s, so along with extremely fine, super-cooled optics using exotic materials to align and capture every single photon, its red sensitivity allows Webb to peer deeper, further, and dimmer than we&#39;ve ever been able to before.And I&#39;ve read that the &#34;spikes&#34; coming off the brighter stars are generally from stars in our own galaxy and they&#39;re not lens flares. They&#39;re caused by the edges of the telescope. Hubble&#39;s stars would have 4 spikes in a cross; Webb has 6 in a snowflake because of the shape of Webb&#39;s mirrors having 6 sides. Or something like that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Question for anyone who happens to be an expert: Is there any way to quantify how much better Webb is independently of the amount of time used to take the exposures? Like, could Hubble achieve the same quality of images as Webb if it was given 100x (or whatever) more time exposure?I&#39;m trying to understand how much the improvement is &#34;speed of convergence&#34; vs. &#34;quality of asymptotic result&#34;. (Though... is that even a valid way of trying to understand things?)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Watching the livestream i was more than surprised, that color correction actually happens in Photoshop.Also, there seem to be multiple layer-masks involved for specific regions and objects.I get that you can shift and composite color, based on hue, apply filters etc, but: Photoshop?Curious if anyone can explain, that what we see is actual science or some touched up version of objects in our universe.p.s.: What struck me the most is the absence of noise, especially for the deep field photo. Hubble took many exposures over weeks, which normally would allow for reliable reduction of noise, webb took some shots over the course of hours and there’s hardly any noise to see. Weirdest part is seeing them just “healing brushing” away some dots - how is the decision process on altering images like that?(edit for typos)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&lt;https://www.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/www/files/home/jwst/d...&gt;The science performance report of JWST is a fascinating read. Some of the highlights that sent me down a rabbit-hole- On Predicted lifetime of consumables - Before launch, JWST was required to carry propellant for at least 10.5 years of mission lifetime. Now that JWST is in orbit around L2, it is clear that the remaining propellant will last for more than 20 years of mission lifetime.- On Orbit - Orbit around L2 is maintained through regular station-keeping burns, which are scheduled every three weeks- On observatory lifetime - At present, the largest source of uncertainty is long term effects of micrometeoroid impacts that slowly degrade the primary mirror.- On Other spacecraft performance - JWST is now generating 1.5 kW to match the power load, with a capability of &gt; 2 kW- On Fault management - Of the 344 single point failures at launch, almost all of them related to deployments, only 49 remain; these are common to most science  missions (for example, only one set of propellant tanks, only one high gain antenna)The section on &#34;Pointing and guiding&#34; which mentions how complex sub-systems interact to achieve &#34;line-of-sight stabilization&#34; and how its not possible to test those systems together in an end-to-end fashion on the ground is interesting."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Meta - I am honestly surprised, and sightly appalled at the general attitude in these comments (and also in yesterday&#39;s thread).Uber has essentially not just broken laws, but outright exploited workers/drivers... and people comment &#34;Aah but the local taxi mafia was bad&#34;...??!? I&#39;m sorry but that does not justify exploiting workers. That does not justify using political influence to enter/gain markets. This isn&#39;t some messiah coming to save us all from the &#34;horridness of local transport&#34;.I&#39;m not saying that having Uber as a player is necessarily bad, mind you. But it&#39;s possible to have some positive benefits for some people while hurting a lot of others. I sincerely doubt too many HN users have driven taxis, but my conversations with Uber/regular taxi drivers hardly painted a favorable picture of Uber. (Nuance - please note that my taxi drivers doesn&#39;t represent all drivers. There will be happy and sad drivers, my point being it&#39;s not always sunshine and rainbows... which the article speaks about too.)I wonder if this being a YC owned communication platform affects/biases users (some of whom I&#39;m sure are YC founders etc themselves), however the ratio of apathy/&#34;taxis were already bad&#34; to &#34;Uber shouldn&#39;t exploit workers, nothing justifies it&#34; is disappointingly low.(I know this is a particularly ranty comment and I had kept quiet on the last thread but seeing the same type of comments here pushed me.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My personnal experience.
I come back from a trip in romania - bucharest.
At first I didn&#39;t take Uber but tried for the regular Taxi from the airport.
All of them requesting ~40USD.
At the end I go with one who put the meter and indeed arrived to 200 Lei (~40 USD). I payed in euro because I didn&#39;t have enough local currency, hopefully I had some and the driver accept.Taking some information it&#39;s way too much, but would I have argue with how the meter was operating anyway?Now, I need to comeback to the airport at 4am.So instead, I reserve a airport transfer from the airline itself, pay in advance something like 30 USD this time.And... no one show up at 4am. Mobile phone of the transfer is not answering... I never heard of them *So I install Uber, hopefully it&#39;s working, enter my visa (from my country, no need for local currency at all), after 10 minutes, someone very nice take me and I just paid like 15 USD to get to the airport, at 5 in the morning, with the invoice by mail.How do you compete with that? Taxi business need to reflect. And every country is the same strangely, it&#39;s as universal than taxes: you can&#39;t escape!* Edit: In fact I know what happened, and there is nothing to do, because I looked at the invoice and on the third page of the voucher PDF there, it&#39;s said that I needed to call 24h before to confirm the transfer... They don&#39;t call, you have to call. Even after the first confirmation I already did for confirming the pickup address some days before, I wasn&#39;t feeling paranoid enough. So you can&#39;t say nothing because I didn&#39;t read the last page, but it&#39;s a dumb heavy process, do people changes their mind and decide to live forever in the country frequently?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Shocking stuff like this, weaponising drivers against city governments to do Uber&#39;s bidding to lobby:&gt; MacGann insists that Uber drivers were seen by some at the company as pawns who could be used to put pressure on governments. “And if that meant Uber drivers going on strike, Uber drivers doing a demo in the streets, Uber drivers blocking Barcelona, blocking Berlin, blocking Paris, then that was the way to go,” he said. “In a sense, it was considered beneficial to weaponise Uber drivers in this way.”&gt; The files show MacGann’s fingerprints on this strategy, too. In one email, he praised staffers in Amsterdam who leaked stories to the press about attacks on drivers to “keep the violence narrative” and pressure the Dutch government.Uber was weaponising their workers (while fighting as hard as possible to not call them workers and pay for workers&#39; benefits) against local governments, they were behaving like a tech-mafia, a mob with sprawling power across the globe.What the actual fuck?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the interesting aspects of giving a shit is that it will lead sometimes to you doing things which are not in your short-term selfish narrowly-defined &#34;best interest&#34; but because you give a shit you&#39;ll do it anyway.  Some of these lead to long-term value that is very significant but you can&#39;t know at the time.I was once asked by a client (bank) to take a call with one of _their_ clients (a pretty important hedge fund). I did this as a courtesy even though I thought our product wasn&#39;t appropriate for the hedge fund.  Anyhow I get on the call and it&#39;s the COO, the Chief Investment Officer, the CTO and a couple of other _very_ important people at this big fund. (ie a much more senior call than I really expected).  Anyway, because I give a shit, I told them our product wouldn&#39;t really be right for them and explained why.  They thanked me and I heard nothing more of it.Until a couple of years later where I offered a job out of the blue because one of the people on the call had been impressed by how I had dealt with it, and by pure coincidence his partner was a recruiter who was tasked with headhunting for a CTO role and he said &#34;hey you should check this guy out&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Everyone saying it doesn&#39;t scale is missing the point.Scaling is a winner-take-all, venture capital mindset. The article is about service businesses, which do not need to hit web scale! We are talking about services here not your web startup.Even beyond services, giving a shit and building saas is not impossible. In fact, I wish more tech companies started small and stayed small. I absolutely want to run a digital small business and I want to give a shit, it makes the building feel purposeful instead of this product-led growth at all costs bullshit.I hope we see a software middle class grow in the next decade. Middle class tech companies are going to be coming from the bootstrapper + founder focused funds (TinySeed / Calm) and they are going to have a distinct advantage if they understand their strategy/context in their chosen verticals."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Are you saying I can outsource my shit-giving activities?Sign me up. I&#39;ve been unable to give a shit for quite some time. I wish I could give a shit, but the world has become a pretty ugly place, in large part because of deliberate attempts to demoralize those who give a shit.You see it all over the place on social media. People do a weak-ass form of shit-giving in the form of &#34;raising awareness&#34;, the least conceivable level of effort for something you wish you could give a shit about, but don&#39;t actually give a shit.Of course even if somebody tried to GaSaaS, the space would promptly fill with people giving as few shits as possible for as much money as possible. Too many major charities do that: they&#39;ll take your money and spend it mostly on advertising for other people to give their money, too, and very little on the things you&#39;d expect if they actually gave a shit.I know TFA is more about the business sense of giving a shit, but I&#39;d love to see somebody able to give a shit in a larger sense. Unfortunately, I can&#39;t give a shit because it seems nobody gives a shit any more -- except the people who are passionately devoted to making sure other people feel miserable instead."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Sorry if I miss something obvious, but how is this not solvable by the compiler?I&#39;m a huge functional programming evangelist, but high-level stuff like this does not belong in a low level language bytecode like WASM.Wasm should only care about two things: Security and Performance.With the standard blowing up like crazy we&#39;ll get neither. Worse, we&#39;ll cemenent the current duopoly of browser engines, because we&#39;ll make it (again) so complex that no-one can create an alternative.We shouldn&#39;t have GC, Exceptions or Tail calls in WASM, as long as the compiler can provide them.What we should have is multi memory support and memory read permissions, because without them WASM lacks basic security primitives.[1]Reference types maybe.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve talked about this on HN but I&#39;ll say it again.A couple years ago, after being an Android fan for the better part of a decade, I finally bought myself an iPhone and pried myself away from Google&#39;s ecosystem wherever I could. And Apple didn&#39;t even need to do any work for me to make this decision. It was the years of abuse from Google that you experience when you decide to use a Google product or service. And a big part of that was the constant A/B/C/D/E/F testing. I never felt like I was using a complete product, everything felt like a constant beta that could be changed or rearranged at any point, and I was just doing free testing work for them while they harvest all my data.Every app update was a risk of the app rearranging itself, or features appearing/disappearing. Eventually it didn&#39;t even come from app updates in the Play Store, and new interfaces would just appear one day when a server somewhere marked your account as being in the group that gets the new UI. This app that you were familiar with could at any point be rearranged when you open it on any given day. Then maybe a week later you open it and it&#39;s back to how it was before. A button you thought was here suddenly isn&#39;t, and you question whether something actually changed or if you&#39;re losing your mind. It&#39;s a subtle gaslighting that eventually I couldn&#39;t stand any more.To me, A/B testing means you don&#39;t respect your users. You see them as just one factor in your money machine that can be poked and prodded to optimize how much money you can squeeze out of them. That&#39;s not to say a company like Apple is creating products out of the goodness of their heart, but at least it feels like it was developed by humans who made an opinionated call as to what they thought was the right design decision, and what they would want to use. And in my 2 years of owning an iPhone, I&#39;ve never opened my reminders app to find out that it&#39;s completely unrecognizable, or my messages app has been renamed or rethemed for the umpteenth time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem with AB testing is that it&#39;s a short-term strategy. For example, if a news site runs AB testing with headlines, they&#39;ll find that bullshit clickbait headlines get more pageviews than concise, accurate headlines, but the constant use of clickbait headlines will over time destroy overall traffic to your site. More frustratingly, sites run by smart people tend to fall into a balance where the worst articles get the most alluring headlines."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is not a historic low, but a definitive low. There are several reasons for this.- in time of a crisis, the world seems to ralley around the dollar, as it is backed by the strongest economy and the strongest military.- this crisis has hit Europe hard, as it is not only close to the war, but of course, too dependant on Russian oil and especially gas.- there was a lot of inflation internationally, the US federal bank was the first to raise interest to combat inflation. The EU lags behind and is limited in action due to the fear of destabilizing some of its member countries with too high of a debt.Consequently, there is a lot of good reason for the Euro to be weak at these times. However, if the energy crisis can be solved and the war contained, a weak Euro also is also pushing exports from the EU. So there is a lot of reason for this trend to be stopped, if not reversed, until the other extreme is reached again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is bad for Europe because our salaries (before tax) have already been lower than US salaries. Additionally we pay much more taxes than you guys on salaries (up to 50%) and on VAT (~20%).Means at the moment until salaries get inflation adjusted that we pay a premium price for everything."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"PepsiCo Inc (PEP, Nasdaq) isn&#39;t merely a beverage company - as explained in this strategy document - it is a space company. The Pepsi Universe, with respect to its 8 light year characteristic length, reflects the scale of the total addressable market (TAM) that PepsiCo can expand into.Noted short-seller and equity valuation skeptic Jim Chanos once described the TAM of space companies as infinite, because space itself is infinite. This pessimistic take anchors our low-end fair value estimate of PEP to $infinity / share. Since PEP currently trades at around $170 / share, we believe there is considerable upside to the long term buy and hold investor."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t think the title prepared me for this. I saw the first page and thought &#34;oh, that&#39;s a terrible graphic, why are you moving away from the future&#34;. the mona lisa and taijitsu symbol seemed a bit over blown but still  sorta grounded. I literally burst out laughing when I saw the contour lines and energy fields. Definitely was not prepared for &#34;Pepsi Universe&#34;, either. I assume that by that point in the presentation the energy in the board room must be fever pitch for no one to point out how stupid that looks.Edit: Upon further reading about the guy who&#39;s behind this, Peter Arnell, it turns out he&#39;s possibly the harvey weinstein of the marketing business[^1]. It&#39;s a huge shame  that neither this pseudointellectual bullshit, nor his string of workplace abuses, ruined his career. A consolation is that in 2011 his company got bought out and he got sacked.[^1]: The Newsweek article is a good read here: https://www.newsweek.com/crazy-genius-brand-guru-peter-arnel.... There&#39;s also a Gawker piece that gives a pretty clear idea of how big of a piece of shit this guy is if you can stand the fact that it&#39;s Gawker: https://www.gawker.com/244608/new-yorks-worst-bosses-peter-a..."</p>
