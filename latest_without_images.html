								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s annoying for sure. I deal with abuse at a large scale.I&#39;d recommend:- Rate-limit everything, absolutely everything. Set sane limits.- Rate-limit POST requests harder. Preferably dynamically based on geoip.- Rate-limit login and comment POST requests even harder. Ban IPs that exceed the amount.- Require TLS. Drop TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1. Bots certainly break.- Require SNI. Do not reply without SNI (nginx has 444 return code for that). Ban IP&#39;s on first hit that connect without. There&#39;s no legitimate use and you&#39;ll also disappear from places like Shodan.- If you can, require HTTP/2.0. Bots break.- Ban IP&#39;s listed on StopForumSpam, ban destination e-mail addresses listed there. If possible also contribute back to SFS and AbuseIPDB.- Collect JA3 hashes, figure out malicious ones, ban IPs that use those hashes. This blocks a lot of shit trivially because targeting tools instead of behaviour is accurate."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Really glad to see someone finally talking about this.Does anyone know what&#39;s going on with that &#34;Duke de Montosier&#34; spam botnet? It accounts for more than half of the botspam attacks on my sites, and I can&#39;t find anyone talking about it online anywhere, except one tweet dating back to mid-2021. It&#39;s identifiable by several short phrases that it posts:Duke de Montosierfor Countess Louise of SavoyTestaru. Best knownAnd cryptic short posts that can assemble into creepy sequences:Europe, and in Ancient RussiaCentury to a kind of destruction:Western Europe also formedand was erased, and on cleanedonly a few survivednumber of surviving European55 thousand Greek, 30 thousand ArmenianMany of the IPs involved seemed to be in Russia, China and Hong Kong, though they&#39;re coming from all over (eg European &amp; US VPNs, Tor exit nodes). From tracking the IPs on AbuseIPDB, the weird spam posts seem to be just one layer, while behind the scenes it also attempts SMTP Auth and IMAP attacks on the server.I&#39;m eager to know more if anyone knows, and especially if anyone is trying to shut this thing down. But I can&#39;t find anyone even talking about it. (Maybe there&#39;s a reason for that?)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;  They&#39;re a major part in killing off web forums, and a significant wet blanket on any sort of fun internet creativity or experimentation.&gt; The only ones that can survive the robot apocalypse is large web services. Your reddits, and facebooks, and twitters, and SaaS-comment fields, and discords. They have the economies of scale to develop viable countermeasures, to hire teams of people to work on the problem full time and maybe at least keep up with the ever evolving bots.This is not true at all.  There are web forums that are not &#34;web-scale&#34; and don&#39;t spend all day fighting bot spam.  The solution is real simple: it costs 10 bux to register an account, if you&#39;re a nuisance your account is banned and you pay 10bux to get back on.Even the sites that don&#39;t require payment for explicit registration - often succeed by gating functionality or content behind paywalls.  Requiring a &#34;premium membership&#34; to post in the classifieds forum is an extremely extremely common thing on small interest-based web-boards (photrio, pentaxforums, homebrewtalk, etc).  That income supports the site and supports the anti-bot efforts as a whole.  The customer isn&#39;t advertisers - it&#39;s the community itself, and you&#39;re providing the service of high-quality content and access to people with similar interests.You need to bootstrap a community first, of course, but it doesn&#39;t need to be a large community, just a high-value one.The twitters and facebooks of the world just don&#39;t like that solution because they value growth above all other considerations.  They&#39;d rather be kings of a billion user website with 200 million bots than a 1k-100k user forum with 100% organic membership and content.  And they value engagement over content quality, which is the entire reason comment-tree/vote-based systems have been pushed heavily over web-1.0 threaded forum discussions as well.This botpocalypse is the inevitable outcome of the systems that social-media giants have created, not inherent outcomes of the internet as a whole."</p>

Any blame is deflected away from Firefox itself.Then it makes me feel doubly bad because I immediately realize I&#39;m getting upset at something incredibly trivial, but man it annoys me!!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Also stop treating your users like idiots. The &#34;Something went wrong&#34; of Microsoft products is just offensive when it doesn&#39;t even show you the error code - it&#39;s basically saying that you&#39;re too stupid to understand, so we&#39;re not going to show you exactly what happened. I&#39;d maybe understand if it was just MS Word doing this, but when an Xbox Devkit does that, which you know - by definition - only professionals can have and use, then it&#39;s worse then useless, it&#39;s actively condescending."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a fairly ubiquitous pattern, these days, with mega-corporations, using &#34;folksy&#34; or humorous, language (Slack/Salesforce comes to mind).I think that it has its place, but, like so many cultural artifacts, needs to be done very, very carefully.Humor and colloquialism doesn&#39;t usually translate. That&#39;s not just between languages, but also between cultures. Canadian humor may be lost on Americans, and vice-versa.The users of a product are often of a drastically different culture from the creators. It&#39;s quite possible that &#34;folksy&#34; stuff from the creators, meant to be comforting and approachable, is perceived as &#34;condescending,&#34; or &#34;patronizing,&#34; to the end-user.Also, error reporting is an extremely sensitive area. Often. the user is under a lot of stress, and can feel intimidated by the product (and, by extension, its creators).Some developers may feel that &#34;puts the user in their place,&#34; but I&#39;d argue that may not be a desirable outcome. I like the users of my stuff to feel comfortable, and in control of their user experience.I have noticed that there&#39;s a pervasive disrespect for users, in our industry. In some cases, it comes down to naked hatred.I guess, if we look at the users of our products as cattle, to be fattened, sold, and slaughtered, it&#39;s inevitable."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Sorry for your loss and everyone else who is sharing.About 10 years ago, my mom came down with cancer and was in hospice care for some time. I had the opportunity to sit with her and hold hands and talk. She was a person of faith, I am not. She asked me to light the yahrzeit for her which I of course agreed to do, and did, although I had to consult the internet to figure out how.She asked me if I would reconsider my rejection of faith, I had to be honest with her and said that I was sorry that I could not do that. She said if she got up there, into heaven, and could get me a message, would I change my mind. I said sure Ma. We came up with a goofy pass phrase, that only her and I knew, and pinky swore never to tell anyone. No, I have not received the message, but I do the candle. It is coming up on the 10th the web site says."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sorry for your loss.The thing I noticed is that I have my own life - my grandparents passed some stories to me as well as my parents and they are part of my life. I have photos from like 1900&#39;s passed to me as family heirloom.But I came to realization that I am unable to understand even 15% of any other persons life. Even my SO life will be maybe tops 40% that I can grasp or share as we spend really a lot of time together.Maybe that is me but I feel that we are really isolated and our communications with words is really limited. Even being together in the same moment - each person feels/reacts a bit different.I paint it as tragic in a sense but it is also beautiful that we really are unique snowflakes in the end.So in the end I don&#39;t feel like it is even important for me to make some kind of interview - important part is to remember that they were alive and their life was their own and only their own as I cannot touch it I cannot grasp it - hence all life being special and to be celebrated, because there is not going to be second one that is identical with its struggles and with its dreams."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminded me of a project from long ago. When I was growing up, I was not particularly good about expressing gratitude to my family. I recognized this in myself and in college and wanted to make up for lost time.I went around and interviewed my extended family and some of my mom&#39;s friends over the course of about 6 months. I asked each person for any fun or touching stories they had. There were a lot. I edited down many hours of footage into a 45 minute video that basically said, &#34;thanks for the last 22 years&#34;.Days before I moved across country to start my job after graduation, I got the family together and had a viewing party. Unbeknownst to my mom this wasn&#39;t a going away party for me, it was an appreciation party for her. It was a wonderful moment.Two people who I interviewed as part of this project have since passed away. So I dug up and digitized all of the unedited footage so that I can easily pull it up on my computer. There are some wonderful memories from my grandma and my father at a happier/healthier time in their lives. In their final years they were not really able to speak at all, so this footage really captures them at their relative best. It has been a helpful way for me and my family to deal with grief.OP: Thank you for sharing your story. Sorry for your loss."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For our dating site, which of course has to deal with many prinses, Nigerian or otherwise, when we manually verified an account to be a scammer, we reject logins with a message stating that the IP address has been blocked. Scammers will usually go through all of their VPNs/bots in order to try to login, allowing our system to flag them all.We&#39;ll manually review all accounts that use (more than one of) those ip addresses. Works like a charm! :-)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ok, I have no issue with tactics like these when they&#39;re wasting spammers&#39; time. But sometimes it seems like real users get caught up in these honeypots for scammers and hackers.A lot of the crap real sites make people go through e.g. when they lose access to their account or login to a VPN or the site just &#34;can&#39;t verify their identity&#34; for some reason.  Where you go through a bunch of hoops and captchas, only to have some step fail or reach a dead end. They really seem like they&#39;re just set up to intentionally waste people&#39;s time.For example, Steam has a system where if you enter too many invalid passwords, it will present you with a captcha which you can never actually solve. It&#39;s a lot more annoying than just saying &#34;you have been locked out of trying to log in for X hours&#34;.But this, this is fine. It&#39;s pretty clear that the person you&#39;re targeting is a spammer, and it&#39;s pretty clear to the user after about 60 seconds that you&#39;re password system is a joke."</p>

					<h3><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08815">Why do tree-based models still outperform deep learning on tabular data?</a></h3>

					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32333565">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have a theory - tree based models require minimal feature engineering. They are capable of handling categorical data in principled ways, they can handle the most skewed/multimodal/heteroskedastic continuous numeric data just as easily as a 0-1 scaled normal distribution, and they are easy to regularize compared to a DL model (which could have untold millions of possible parameter combinations, let alone getting the thing to train to a global optimum).I think if you spent months getting your data and model structure to a good place, you could certainly get a DL model to out-perform a gradient boosted tree. But why do that, when the GBT will be done today?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Results show that tree-based models remain state-of-the-art on medium-sized data (∼10K samples) even without accounting for their superior speed.Is that really &#34;medium&#34;? That seems very small to me. MNIST has 60,000 samples and ImageNet has millions.I think the title overstates the findings. I&#39;d be interested to hear how these methods compare on much larger datasets. Is there a threshold at which deep learning outperforms tree-based models?Edit: They touch on this in the appendix:&gt; A.2.2 Large-sized datasets&gt; We extend our benchmark to large-scale datasets: in Figures 9, 10, 11 and 12, we compare the results
of our models on the same set of datasets, in large-size (train set truncated to 50,000 samples) and
medium-size (train set truncated to 10,000 samples) settings.&gt; We only keep datasets with more than 50,000 samples and restrict the train set size to 50,000 samples
(vs 10,000 samples for the medium-sized benchmark). Unfortunately, this excludes a lot of datasets,
which makes the comparison less clear. However, it seems that, in most cases, increasing the train set
size reduces the gap between neural networks and tree-based models. We leave a rigorous study of
this trend to future work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s baffling to me how little research attention there has been to improving tree-based methods, considering their effectiveness.For example, LightGBM and XGBoost allow some regularization terms, but the variance/bias is still mostly controlled by globally setting the max depth and max node count (and then parameter searching to find good settings).Surely there must be more powerful and sophisticated ways of deciding when to stop building each tree than counting the number of nodes?  If this was neural nets there would be a hundred competing papers proposing different methods and arguing over their strengths and weaknesses.I&#39;m not sure whether the problem is that neural nets are just fundamentally more sexy, or that in order to make SOTA improvements in GBMs you need to dive into some gnarly C++.  Probably both."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Re: the age of &#34;That&#39;s what she said&#34;:I thumbed through The Frogs (Aristophanes) at a used book store once.  This play was written circa 400 BC.  In the prologue, one character is offering to entertain the audience with a few jokes, and another character says, &#34;Yes, but not &#39;That&#39;s what she said.&#39;&#34;  The joke was too over-used.I was astounded to think that the joke was that old!  But it&#39;s actually not.  The old jokes of ancient Athenians were a little too obscure, I guess, so the translator picked a modern example.  Still, that translation of The Frogs is from the 1950s, so the joke was old at least that far back.  (Here is the translation: https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.65406/2015.6540...)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These remind me of a category of &#34;joke&#34; that some of my middle-school peers and I engaged in: the non-joke. The only one I can remember went something like: a man walks into a bakery and asks for two baguettes. The baker looks at him, thinks for a moment and says &#34;It&#39;s OK, you can leave your bike outside&#34;.Looking back, I think this idea was somehow rooted in the idea that jokes have delivery and that if you use that delivery (rythmn, emphasis, body language) maybe you could say anything and be funny. There was also the peer effect - if you had an audience &#34;plant&#34; in the school yard that would start the laughter, sometimes it would catch even for these non-jokes.Decades later, the idea I described above seems both obviously false, but also true, in the sense that a lot of modern stand up is based on &#34;say anything the right way and people laugh&#34;. However, &#34;the right way&#34; for standup is very different than the &#34;telling a joke&#34; structure.On the other hand, it does feel to me at this point that this is the crux of the contemporary poetry slam: read an arbitrary text in the right way, and while it may not win any prizes, it will feel like poetry, because that&#39;s what make it poetry."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wrote this summary of what emissions sources matter if you want to move the needle, and how reputable sources argue for resolving them: https://climate.davis-hansson.com/p/big-picture-2020/I used that as a basis to look for roles that - I imagined - actually would help make a dent. In the end, I took a job in the smart electric grid space, writing code to help the EU grid take on more cheap renewable generators at Tibber.There’s a lot of software in many of these spaces! Decarbonising the grid, electrifying transport, building heat and industry, reducing agricultural emissions and so on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This was a variant of the question that I had when I left Stripe in 2019. After hearing someone say “We are the first generation to feel the impact of climate change and the last generation that can do something about it.”, I became fixated on the question of what can I, with my software skillset, do to have a meaningful impact on climate?.  The answer (in hindsight), is a ton.My particular approach was to start a company (Watershed[0]), but today there are lots of great options as a software engineer. There are already plenty of great examples in the thread of places to look for companies (MyClimateJourney community, climate job boards, etc). I think the most important thing is not to feel like you need to learn a ton before jumping into the fray. Most engineers that joined us had zero climate experience beforehand. All you need is to be curious, be an effective engineer and you can learn what you need on the job.My email is in my profile if you want to chat![0] We’re hiring (https://watershed.com/jobs)
 and engineering is absolutely our rate limiter in helping companies decarbonize. We’ve built a climate platform that’s powering the climate programs of some of the world’s leading companies (Block, Shopify, Doordash as a few examples). Our goal is to be responsible for reducing the world’s yearly carbon emissions by 500 megatonnes of carbon by 2030 (1% of global emissions)."</p>
