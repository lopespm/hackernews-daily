								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;Don&#39;t try to make a career out of optimizing the SQL queries to display a preference page on a line of business app at a company that no one has ever heard of. That is not the straightforward path to having other people learn you are capable of doing meaningful work.&#34;This is so sad. Optimizing that SQL might require being really clever and can bring enormous value for the company that maybe nobody heard about but might be providing some not so sexy but useful service for half of the country.I&#39;ve never heard about company that is building software that runs nearby power plant, but certainly this company is much more useful and have more positive feedback for the society than something &#34;sexy&#34; like Facebook."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I mean, what the hell is with all this 60-90 hours per week stuff going on? Am I an incredibly defective human being or something - I cannot even fathom working anything even CLOSE to that (in software/tech, maybe if you&#39;re in med school or work an an ER I can see it). There is no way in hell I could ever even be close to productive for that period of time for more than, say, one week a year or something (and even then I&#39;d need weeks to recover).  I&#39;d guess I&#39;d ask everyone, &#34;Really?&#34;. When you work those kind of hours, are you _actually_ doing value-adding or value-optimizing things, or just engaging in work theater?I&#39;ve found the most incredible thing is just to say &#34;no&#34; to things. Not doing things has this fantastic side effect of not causing more work. When you don&#39;t do more things, you don&#39;t cause more problems, which doesn&#39;t need more work, which doesn&#39;t need more staff, which doesn&#39;t require more money, which gives you less stress, and gives you happier staff, happier customers, and a happier self.I wonder if I&#39;ve totally lost my marbles if this kind of thing only makes sense to myself..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like this framing.In graduate school, I worked for 2+ years before my first paper was published. In that time, I passed my PhD qualifying exam, took classes, wrote code, read papers, learned math, and so forth. Yet when I applied for internships, I received no interest from employers. I suspect this was because I had no concrete signal that I knew anything in my field.While working on my second paper, I started blogging. In the language of this article, I started generating public intellectual capital for myself. I have definitely experienced the effects of this capital on subsequent job hunts. Now I can point people to my blog to demonstrate knowledge, technical skills, and communication skills beyond the scope of my peer-reviewed work. Furthermore, there is no question about who contributed to my blog, and when I learn something new, I can externalize that quickly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Nyxt seems amazing, but it&#39;s hard for me to imagine using a browser without Ublock Origin. I understand that it doesn&#39;t really make sense for everyone to support webextensions, and it&#39;s a huge amount of extra work, but it&#39;s just a huge barrier to adoption.It&#39;s hard to trust the smaller browsers to keep me private online if there isn&#39;t something that gives me that same level of control over blocking. And there&#39;s a huge adblocking community built around this software that maintains lists, fixes websites, and it&#39;s just a bunch of privacy-focused community effort that is hard for any small team to replicate.But aside from webextension support, Nyxt looks really exciting, and I&#39;m glad that people are building browsers that are actually innovating in this space."</p>

There&#39;s a social process whenever humans make a thing where we rumble around a lot and try different things and eventually we settle on a kinda-ok-for-now-if-I-can-make-some-adjusments thing (like how I just used written english).I&#39;m a little skeptical (for me) that we&#39;ve arrived at a &#39;durable state&#39; for the web. I think it may change a little too quickly for it to make sense (for me) to invest time into learning this particular browser but I am very excited about the trend.Edit: I wrote this comment without even seeing that they support list but of course they do."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Pay careful attention to the response from Backblaze:&gt; &#34;Hi Brett! The pixels we use are primarily for audience building when we advertise on other platforms like Facebook for example.&#34; [...]The carefully calculated cutesy &#34;Hi Brett!&#34; with the exclamation point is the same reason big tech companies use infantile graphics [0]: by seeming playful, they create the illusion they are a Safe Friend you can Trust.[0] http://jollo.org/LNT/public/nursery.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"PSA for any devs out there implementing FB Pixels:– Facebook&#39;s pixel will, by default, attach click listeners to the page and send back associated metadata. This simplifies implementation needs, but can create unintentional information leaks in privileged contexts. To disable this behavior, there&#39;s a flag[1] you can use. After which, you can manually trigger FB Pixel hits and control both when they&#39;re fired and what information is included in them.– There&#39;s a feature for the FB Pixel called Advanced Matching[2] that allows you to send hashed PII as parameters with your FB events. &#34;Automatic Advanced Matching&#34; can be enabled at any time via a toggle in the FB interface. I believe that setting autoConfig to false as mentioned above will similarly prevent Automatic Advanced Matching from working (since it disables the auto-creation of all those listeners to begin with). When manually triggering pixel calls like above, you can use this functionality via &#34;Manual Advanced Matching&#34;[3].As a general rule, I&#39;d strongly encourage anyone implementing a Facebook pixel to also include the autoConfig = false flag. This makes it work like most other pixels, where the base tag just instantiates an object. After which, hits only occur when explicitly defined in the site code, and include specifically what details you include in it. That way you&#39;re fully aware of the scope of data disclosure happening and any need from marketing to include sensitive (or potentially sensitive) information in these calls has to be explicitly requested (and theoretically vetted) as part of the standard dev process.[1] https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-pixel/advanced...[2] https://www.facebook.com/business/help/611774685654668[3] https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-pixel/advanced..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One easy way to avoid this kind of mistake in your own product: make a clear distinction between your publicly-facing web site (&#34;corpweb&#34;) and your web app for logged-in users. Preferably, they should be served from separate infrastructure.Corpweb should be as static as possible, except for whatever third-party JS the marketing professionals think is necessary. It&#39;s their job, they know what&#39;s best.Your app should have zero third-party JS except for technical analytics (New Relic, Datadog, whatever).(This distinction can be fuzzier for free services, and for consumer stuff with non-sensitive data; Backblaze is neither of those.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love this concept, I just really want one with an e-ink screen instead.I think there&#39;s a great niche for &#34;embedded&#34; devices around the home -- weather readout panels, lighting controls, music player, intercom, etc. -- but glowing rectangles mounted to the wall are just too... glowing. E-ink panels is where it&#39;s at, and a Raspberry Pi powering it is perfect.Unfortunately, the only real general-purpose e-ink tablet I&#39;m aware of is the Boox, but their models are all $400-800, which is way too expensive (when similar tech in a Kindle is $80).All I want is a relatively low-power, low-memory, low-storage touchscreen e-paper tablet (i.e. specs of an old Kindle) that I can run Linux and a WebKit browser on.And I want them to be cheap enough in bulk so that other companies and startups can build home devices on top of them to resell."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Huh. Like other commenters, I’m surprised to see a multi part JOIN be the answer for “I want the results of Query A as well as the results of Query B”.If anything, I think many folks would say “whatever, make the two requests in parallel and zip them together in the application”. If not, WITH expressions to make the two independent queries and then a final SELECT to merge them however you prefer would be reasonable (whether that’s a join flavor or UNION/INTERSECT/etc.), but the super explosion JOIN just doesn’t cross my mind.I think there must be a different example that they tried to anonymize for this post, otherwise they don’t need the IDs (and probably want a sum of quantity). If the author is around, what was the more realistic example behind:“In order to audit inventory, the logistics team at the corporate headquarters requests a tool that can generate a report containing all meal_items that left a given store’s inventory on a particular day. This requires a query that includes items that were both sold to customers as well as recorded as employee markouts for the specified store on the specified day.”?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Keep your matching logic simple.With SQL, matching is (by far) the most computationally expensive bit of most queries. Your goal should be to use only sargable[1] operators, and eliminate any functions, in all your WHERE clauses and JOINs.Complicated matching criteria will force the engine to make tough trade-off decisions, which can be affected by out-of-date table statistics, lousy indexes, and a million other things, and will often force the engine to rule-out more optimized algorithms and fall back to the cruder, primitive algorithms.[1] For most queries, &#34;OR&#34; is not usually a sargable operator: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargable"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author didn&#39;t mention the reason the query is slow.I dare to challenge that the non-optimal query is something that a person with advanced SQL skills would do. A seasoned engineer knows that by joining two tables, you are looking at, worst case, NxM comparisons.The problem is that you are joining the customers table with THREE other tables - the merged result of stores, employees and markouts. No matter how hard you try, you can&#39;t escape the fact that you are joining way more rows than just stores and customers.I would call it a layman issue SQL beginners learn the hard way. Advanced SQL users know the very basics of the db they are working with."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Please test their models before you take it at face value.Eleuther has a history of claiming to replicate projects when they haven&#39;t. For example, they shipped a DALL-E repo a few days after OpenAI announced it (https://twitter.com/theshawwn/status/1348017515897659392) which was broken, and they&#39;ve walked back their GPT-3 replication claims to replicating 1.5B due to the fact that their architecture doesn&#39;t scale.As far as I can tell, they&#39;re generating a large amount of hype with grandiose claims that they can&#39;t deliver on.All I care about is whether you like their models and actually use them in practice. If you do, please let me know and I&#39;ll pipe down. But so far, I haven&#39;t heard of anyone who uses anything they&#39;ve produced, and that worries me. Has anyone?One specific claim they made: https://twitter.com/BlancheMinerva/status/134727697554780980...&#34;DALL-E is quite straight forward and already coded. We just need data to train it.&#34;No, DALL-E is neither straightforward nor was it successfully coded, especially back on January 7th.Anyway, carry on. I really don&#39;t like speaking badly of AI projects, and I hope that they succeed. The model release today is a good step forward, assuming it works. But it might be better to have the expectation of &#34;the models don&#39;t work&#34; until proven otherwise.I&#39;d also like to point out that there are some capable people doing work at Eleuther. Sid in particular is one of the best TPU hackers in the scene. I just wish they would scale down their claims, release more models, and not claim that they&#39;ve done X until actually doing X. For example, the readme says they have &#34;the ability to scale up to full GPT3 sizes (and possibly more!), using the mesh-tensorflow library,&#34; which they don&#39;t."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a nice release, but the title is a bit misleading as the released sizes (1.3B and 2.7B parameters) do not yet compare to the size of GPT-3 (175B), but rather GPT-2 (1.5B) instead (although future releases may have significantly more!).Edit: title improved, thank you!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have some recommendations for you as an EE graduate, you can club Digital Circuits and Systems, Embedded Systems and Digital Hardware with one book in one continuous course withthe book Digital Design and Computer Architecture by Harris and Harris (A RISC V Edition will release soon in 2-3 months, buy that one)For Electronic circuits choose Microelectronics by Behzad Razavi.  Instead of Purcell go for &#34;Engineering Electromagnetics with Ida&#34;, it is more intuitive.And th first book you should start with is &#34;Foundations of Analog and Digital Electronic Circuits&#34;Then you go for DDCA and Ida in parallel.The list does give me head scrather, this is too broad to be ever accomplished. My recommendation to redo the list is first find out what piques your interest in EE, Digital hardware, analog hardware or control systems or embedded systems and try to have a self study focus in that concentration.The way I see it with this plan you are setting yourself up for failure.Edit:Removed the ditching recommendation as I see it relevant to OP&#39;s goals."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why push yourself through a degree-style path? So much of what EEs learn in their coursework is of low utility. (I&#39;m a physicist who transitioned to working as an EE. I have never had a single EE course, and yet I find myself with no obvious deficits compared to my colleagues who have.)There are two ways to learn an existing technical-ish subject: you can spend a lot of time reading textbooks, then  do some projects (the &#34;slow-fast&#34; approach); or you can dive in to projects and refer to textbooks when you get stuck (the &#34;start-stop&#34; approach). In the slow-fast approach you will go slowly through a lot of textbooks for a long time, and then in theory you will be able to do projects very quickly once you are done. In the start-stop approach you will start a project, quickly get stuck and spend a while searching for and understanding the answer, then go back to your project.In my opinion electrical engineering, being a subject where fast feedback is generally possible, is very well suited to project-first learning. I would recommend grabbing a few textbooks (Horowitz and Hill&#39;s Art of Electronics holding pole position for a practically-oriented learner, in my opinion), reading their introductory material (table of contents, preface, etc.; enough that you know what each book has in it), and then setting all the books aside until you need them. Avoid books targeted at &#34;makers&#34;; most are fine but a sizeable fraction are written by people with no clue what they are doing, and they will actively set you back. (It is very difficult to learn from an author who does not themself understand the subject, and all the worse if they do not realize that they do not understand. Since there are plenty of better sources out there, it&#39;s little trouble to just avoid the whole class.)Trying to work on brain-computer interfaces is challenging because it blends biology with electrical engineering. The biology will naturally drive things, because you cannot really control it like you can the electronics. So learning EE in this context is about two things: 1) What can I do with circuits? and 2) What do organisms behave like and respond to electrically? Your project is then using your knowledge of circuits to solve R&amp;D problems relating to bioelectric signals.This isn&#39;t easy (I think you know that), but the benefit is that you can quit with &#34;just&#34; EE skills and still come out ahead."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used to build BMI systems in graduate school, from the lowest level (mixed-signal analog design for 70 uV extracelleular signals) to DSP (128 DSPs doing real time analysis) to the network (built my own ethernet MAC, foolishly!) to all the vis and RT-linux-based analysis. I left the area and switched into ML in grad school, but if I had to do it all over again there&#39;s one thing I think is missing:Optics. Optics optics optics.A tremendous amount of neural interfacing, especially in non-human primates and other organisms, is done via optics. ~All the advances in neural data acquisition over the past decade have been optical. Microscopy is the future for a tremendous amount of neuroscience and more and more people are considering it seriously for human-scale BMI.I know optics isn&#39;t always thought of in an EE context, but it should be! Many people doing amazing computational imaging and optics work are in EE departments. Computational imaging is the new hotness and can let you combine your existing CS skills with signal processing and optics to do things like build a lensless camera! https://waller-lab.github.io/DiffuserCam/If I were you I would ditch the RF part of your plan and study optics. Yeah, it&#39;s all EM, but the order-of-magnitude differences in the frequencies involved makes the underlying engineering quite different."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Richman was even named an &#34;innovator&#34; winner in Goop&#39;s &#34;The Greater goop Awards&#34; and at its peak, uBiome was valued at $600 million.Considering how questionable Goop is that the fraud seems about right.In the meantime the whole medical start up where they suddenly can test, for cheaper, better, etc seems to regularly come up short on the actual testing, results, or even just valid use cases.Much like Theranos nobody ever seems to explain how these kind of companies can just suddenly test for more so easily where the existing medical industry just hasn&#39;t been able to.Of all the things that the start up ... &#34;system&#34; can do well I kinda question their ability to suddenly become amazing complex medical device inventors / scientists.   I recall some folks who work in that industry and they noted that creating new tests and diagnostics and equipment is often incredibly slow and iterative.  That doesn&#39;t seem very start up-ish.   The magical breakthroughs are rare."</p>
