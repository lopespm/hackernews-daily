					<h3><a href="https://twitter.com/element_hq/status/1355290296947499013">Element (Matrix chat app) suspended from the Google Play Store</a></h3>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So we got notified by the developer console at 21:45 UTC that the app had been suspended, but still haven’t had an email to explain why - it’s 02:24 now.Our assumption that this is due to someone reporting abusive content in Matrix to Google, and Element catching the blame — although this is currently speculation.To be clear: Element is a Matrix client just as Chrome is a Web browser, and just as it’s possible to view abusive material via Chrome, the same is true of Element.However, we abhor abuse, and on the default matrix.org server (and other Matrix servers the core team maintains) we have a fairly strict terms of use at https://matrix.org/legal/terms-and-conditions#6-play-nice-cl... which we proactively enforce. Meanwhile we have a comprehensive toolset at https://matrix.org/docs/guides/moderation to help folks moderate, and are making good process with decentralised reputation to empower users and admins to filter out stuff they don’t want to see, as per https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/19/combating-abuse-in-matrix....So, it’s very unfortunate and frustrating that we’re in this position - hopefully Google will explain what’s going on shortly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is this google starting to test the waters when it comes to arbitrarily kicking out software they personally don&#39;t like? (open source, decentralized, privacy oriented etc.) I might of course be exaggerating a bit here, keep that in mind.- Element and Matrix are growing but still not equipped to fight back at large against this, so it is unlikely to create too much negative press- If Google starts to catch too much critique for this decision they can put it back and always blame $errorI believe Element will be back soon, the problem I see here is that it will be framed as an &#34;honest mistake&#34; and then become forgotten until they pull another stunt like this.Even if these removals are temporary, they can still hurt growth. Let&#39;s assume a bit more malice: Couldn&#39;t Google just monitor and analyze metrics of an undesirable app (downloads, usage, hype), pick a critical point in its growth then &#34;accidentaly&#34; remove it for a few days, causing damage that isn&#39;t immediately apparent, but nonetheless long lasting?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I believe that removal of Element from Google Play Store is a violation of EU regulation 2019/1150. Element has legal entities in Britain (which is affected by Brexit but has similar law) and France. Google is LEGALLY required to provide a justification for removal 30 days before application removal.Anyway, you may try contacting Google using EU regulation 2019/1150 violation procedure, see https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/9969397 for more information. This may be more effective than using a regular contact procedure, as it would show Google that you are aware of this regulation and they are unlikely to win.Note that I&#39;m not a lawyer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Let me get this straight:1) RH automatically makes every account a Margin account.2) RH doesn&#39;t make this clear to their customers (buried in the TOS where they know newbie investors won&#39;t look, which makes up probably 99% of their customers).3) RH allows people to initiate money transfers into RH, but also allows purchasing of stock immediately (on Margin) without informing the customer.4) Investors believe they&#39;ve outright purchased stock, because RH app shows the stock in their account, and money now gone (even though it&#39;s still pending the transfer).5) RH then &#34;margin calls&#34; all of the people who had money transfers pending at the time of GME purchase.Ya... that seems pretty predatory in my opinion. Downright shady business... How can this not be construed as market manipulation, even if RH had to do this to save themselves yesterday. RH got themselves into this position in the first place..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you read the other threads it&#39;s clear what&#39;s happening is that robinhood&#39;s product isn&#39;t designed to cope with high volatility[1]. Is this a flaw in their product? Yes. But then again, they are a discount brokerage for a reason. It&#39;s not any different than any other consumer product that shits the bed during 99.9 percentile events.[1] Specifically, they&#39;re required by the DTCC to put up a deposit on every trade their users make. During periods of low volatility this is fine because they can come up with the money, but when volatility goes up so do the deposit requirements, which can cause them to become insolvent. This is further compounded by the fact that their product invisibly hands out margin, eg. &#34;instant&#34; deposits of $1000, or giving you the money before it settles (2 days later)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; &#34;And though traders may be outraged by the surprise, Robinhood’s terms of service grant it permission to close a trader’s position under a number of circumstances.&#34;The terms of service for EVERY service we use are entirely legal jargon for &#34;we can do whatever the f*k we want to do with any data on our service, and you have no legal recourse.&#34; No matter what the company says about &#34;privacy&#34; or any other rights you think you have, buried in there somewhere is a clause that says that no matter what happens, you can&#39;t sue. What do you expect when you&#39;ve abdicated the right to sue the company for something you think is illegal or injurious? It&#39;s supposed to be the bastion of last resort, to keep everyone honest. When the safety net of the legal system is gone (e.g., forced arbitration) -- or only used for one side, there&#39;s nothing to restrain these humungous companies which are running the world now. We&#39;re a long way past needing a legal reset on &#34;terms of service.&#34;"</p>

Trust me, you need much less to build something like this, and there&#39;s no excuse for it to suck so bad.I&#39;m also curious, anyone know where the development actually happened?

Generally expect them to do absolute minimum necessary to meet the contract. The code was obfuscated to ensure support contract.

He has secured a profit of $13.8 million dollars, and his remaining open position is valued at $45 million.I would caution people to not quickly fall into the &#34;if he&#39;s still in, I&#39;m still in&#34; meme. He has secured a $14 million bag, regardless if the stock goes to zero he&#39;s already secured a life changing amount of money, he can afford to weather the storm. If you&#39;re holding because he&#39;s still in and you haven&#39;t taken any profits you are nowhere near in the same position as him.A hodling mania has overtaken the subreddit that would make btc blush. Know that we don&#39;t know what kind of deals are happening behind closed doors in these two last days of manipulated activity. A sustained short interest does not necessarily mean that the shorts are holding their initial position, they could have closed and reopened at these elevated levels.The narrative has changed so quickly from this being a value play, to a short squeeze, to now militant activism via buying stock as a means to sticking it to the man. The rhetoric is as volatile as the price. The overall market is stressed, things are getting weird and I would not be surprised if this is the beginning of another stock market crash."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I often question the motives of my company. It has only 100 or so employees. Has been in business for 25+ years. But we are on a continual drive to increase sales, hire new people, add size to the facilities. But it wasn&#39;t always this way. It only happened once it went public. Now we are working for the investors. They need to see an increasing return on their investment. Management choices are no longer about the customer or providing a great product/service. It&#39;s about squeezing margins and duping the customer to join our mailing list or accept cookies. Otherwise &#34;the list won&#39;t grow&#34;. And how can we market to more and more people if we can&#39;t track how many pages they&#39;ve viewed?I&#39;ve gone a bit off track there, but the point being, there IS no answer when I&#39;ve explicitly asked &#34;why&#34; with regards to these things. Nobody knows. They just know they have &#34;targets&#34; and the targets are constantly moving./rant over"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I once worked at a company where I didn&#39;t understand why they took certain decisions. In the end, it all became very clear. My mindset from &#34;these guys have no idea&#34; shifted towards &#34;wow, they are smart, I didn&#39;t get this part&#34;.Basically, they were acquiring customers faster than anyone could follow. Our development goal was &#34;fast and opportunistic&#34;. As you can expect, the product was full of bugs, and customer support had their hands full. It was a shitty product with a lot of customers.I didn&#39;t see how this would ever turn into a success story. We were digging a grave. But I didn&#39;t realize 1 thing: we were not selling a product, we were selling the company.In the end, a huge Canadian competitor wanted a foothold in the European market, and so they bought us (and our customers). They were going to introduce their own product to the customers, and so our product was thrown in the wastebasket.In the end, it all ended as planned, and the founders walked away with a lot of money. Basically they built a customer base in EU, and sold that one to another company. Big eye opener for me.Looking back, it is also very interesting to see how they positioned their company within that market, to be acquired."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Go big or go home&#34;.  This seems to be a uniquely north-American attitude.  Germany, or maybe Europe, is full of so-called &#34;Mittelstand&#34; companies that are good in what they do, have 500-ish employees, have been in the same family ownership for generations and provide a good solid living for everyone involved.  What is wrong with that?  It goes without saying that staying mid-sized doesn&#39;t mean staying complacent, but you can innovate without growing huge.Here in Ottawa, there was a debacle a few years ago.  A typical such company, Swiss Pastries, changed ownership or at least management.  The new attitude was &#34;grow at all costs&#34;, they overextended themselves, went bankrupt, and Swiss Pastries is no more.  Ottawa now has no local source of soft pretzels along with other delicacies that they made.  It&#39;s almost a scorched earth approach.  If you can&#39;t make the company huge, you might as well destroy it, because not being huge means you&#39;ve failed.The previous paragraph is based on reading a few news articles at the time.  If I&#39;m wrong, I&#39;m guessing it still makes a textbook example of &#34;go big or go home&#34; going wrong and I&#39;d love to see more details."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Fair warning. Buying stocks with high short interest is, over the long run, a terrible investment strategy. Mountains of academic research has consistently found the most heavily shorted stocks to significantly underperform the market[1] (to the order of 10% per year).Heavily shorted stocks tend to be the companies with the most negative cash flow shocks[2], low quality earnings statements[3], negative earnings revisions, and future bad news[4]. In other words, when a company is heavily shorted it&#39;s almost always for a good reason. (Like being a brick and mortar video game retailer, that&#39;s losing mountains of cash with no turnaround plan.) High short interest is a tell-tale warning of a bad investment.This shouldn&#39;t be surprising. Research has consistently found that short-sellers are the most sophisticated and well-informed investors in the market[5]. There activity strongly predicts soon-to-be released negative public announcements[6].
