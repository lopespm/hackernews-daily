								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Really neat! My only complaint is that the handling is very sluggish. Also it might be nice to have a first-person vew, maybe the camera view contributes to the sluggish feeling.I love the procedurally-generated landscapes. It really captures the feeling of driving on unfamiliar roads.I&#39;m curious how the physics works. Is this using raycast wheels? A couple of years ago I made a racing game for Oculus Quest using Godot[0], based on Godot&#39;s &#34;VehicleBody&#34;, and getting the physics to work satisfactorily was a major headache. But a procedural world would have made it so much cooler.[0] https://sidequestvr.com/app/1403/ghost-racing-vr-wip"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A small note: 80 miles an hour on windy roads, driving in the middle of the road, is not slow and chill. That&#39;s &#34;I want to die&#34; fast and reckless... maybe have two autodrive settings. &#34;slow and chill&#34; going appropriate speeds and driving correctly (left/right toggle?) and &#34;landscape zoomies&#34; or something for what it currently does. Right now auto pilot is literally stress inducing =D"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I folded his hydrangea design recently, following a video tutorial[1]. It is amazing. The finished model is a beautiful fractal flower. The folding steps aren’t terribly hard to do, but robinhouston‘s description - „magical and startling“ - fits this model very well.[1] https://www.happyfolding.com/instructions-fujimoto-hydrangea"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Shuzo Fujimoto designed the most magical and startling origami model I&#39;ve ever seen, the Fujimoto Cube. Fortunately that one is famous enough that you can find instructions and videos online, but most of his designs are hard to find. I recently enquired on Twitter about his design for an octahedron, which I was able to find only because a kind stranger responded with a samizdat copy. It&#39;s very exciting that his wonderful designs are to become more readily accessible."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Having your own email/domain isn’t about privacy. Email has become essentially the key to almost everything in modern life. If I lose access to my email I lose access to basically everything I own and it would be a massive hassle to switch emails. Banks, schools, apps, etc. Often times these services won’t even let you change to a new email if you don’t have access to an existing one. Some use email as 2factor. It’s a nightmare. Owning your own domain separately is crucial. Who hosts your email matters less."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this is everywhere. In India, people in the departments, especially the Governments usually ask, &#34;What is your Gmail?&#34; Almost everyone uses Gmail here and it is extremely rare to find their own custom domain.I&#39;m actually surprised that the Government Departments do not have a service that takes care of these! They will fine Google but almost all of the government email IDs are Gmail.I was one of those that distributed hundreds if not thousands of Gmail invites when it started. However, since 2010-ish, I left Gmail to be just for Newsletters, and the ones that I&#39;m not serious about. I&#39;m always reminded that a day will come when I will just have no access, lock out and be done with it.I had used my name&#39;s domain and had used the web hosting provided email service and I felt nice using the likes of `webmaster@brajeshwar.com` (early 2000s). Then I got a shorter domain with our family domain and is, now, powered by Google Workspace (with a plan to move to the competitors soon before the yearly plan expires). I had so many domains under the Google Suite free version since its beta. I did upgraded my primary domain to the paid version, when I had few mail delivery issues so I can talk to a person and that was also the time I realize I cannot go back. That was almost/about 10 years ago."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unpopular on HN, but I just don&#39;t see a problem with Google having my email, for what they provide me. Almost unlimited uptime, global redundancy, best search experience, storage all for free. I&#39;m ok with the trade off for now.Its just not worth the hassle."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hey HN - author here.This was my burnout recovery project in April of 2020. Very much a labor of love and a surprising way to realize I still liked programming. I wrote some scattered thoughts here [0]I also &#34;run&#34; this project quite differently than I usually do - when I receive a pull request instead of merging it I do a quick glance through the user&#39;s github to make sure they&#39;re not a spammer before giving them _commit access_ and asking them to merge their own PR [1]. It has worked wonders.[0]: https://notes.jordanscales.com/ffa53b57[1]: https://twitter.com/jdan/status/1528026508564078593"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Tiny nitpick – buttons don&#39;t look like that when pressed in Windows 98 (or any version of Windows for that matter).This is what they&#39;re supposed to look like: https://imgur.com/a/iFMJCER (98.css on top, Windows 98 below)As far as I&#39;m aware, the only buttons that look like that when pressed are the Start menu button and taskbar buttons.Similarly, buttons are supposed to have a black border in addition to the dotted outline when they&#39;re focused."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve previously attempted this for Windows 95. I tried very hard to be pixel-accurate. https://hikari.noyu.me/demos/ shows off a bit of what I achieved, but alas it lacks most of the UI elements.I learned some interesting things from the process. The biggest one for me is that web browsers have only one kind of focus, but Windows has two, a dotted line on the inside (element affected by space bar) and a black outline (element affected by return key). You therefore can&#39;t get exactly the same UI in a browser without adding some JS to simulate this second type of focus."</p>

					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33277985">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My biggest concern about this is that now it is in Emacs, there&#39;s no easy way to contribute to it, or follow development. Previously it was on GitHub and there was zero friction to contributing other than figuring out your elisp changes. But now, I think that Issues in the github site are discouraged, and so there will be no convenient way of watching issues and feature requests raised against the project, or of following discussion of proposed patches and code review. In principle of course, these things are possible by using old issue tracking applications and following often dysfunctional/cantankerous discussions in a email list, both of whose scope is the whole of emacs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting, I&#39;ve been using &#34;the other one&#34;: lsp-mode, and have been quite happy with the results. Will see how eglot has progressed and if I can slim my config a bit."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I use eglot (via doom emacs) and it works but configuration always feels like a slog--the language server it wants to start is often not in the PATH, or is configured incorrectly or something. Javascript&#39;s eslint/prettier/tsc are particularly finicky. I&#39;d love to have some method to denote that the presence of .eslintrc/eslint in package.json means run format-on-save, otherwise don&#39;t. But I also can&#39;t really see how it could be _that_ much better on any other editor?"</p>

				<div class="story__comments">
					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33307950">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I feel like there&#39;s a large class of tools in this space now (Vercel, Netlify) that do all of this and more, and this post is less about Cloudflare Pages and more about the (really good) state of static hosting these days?One thing that stuck out was the comment about &#34;Twitter cards&#34;, since Vercel/Next now has this built in: https://twitter.com/vercel/status/1579561293069316096"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What is really annoying is that Cloudflare pages will strip the file extension off of your html pages, and perform permanent redirects to those new URLs. Now if you&#39;re intending on moving to a new hosting service that doesn&#39;t do that (cgi-bin), all Google search results to your site will 404.Github pages and likely others also supports this format, so moving between those two services doesn&#39;t exhibit this problem. Moving to cgi-bin will.I&#39;d suggest Cloudflare shouldn&#39;t try to establish their scheme as canonical url and rather implement github pages behavior, but what do I know... I&#39;m just hosting an old fashioned blog, not a JAMstack/SPA/whatever thing"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In 10 years time when cloudflare goes bankrupt/withdraws the free offering, will you be able to redeploy to another platform or will you start having to delve into 10 year old code and porting it to a new API?Is there at least an nginx-cloudflare module that lets you self-host this stuff?"</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33306168">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For anyone who actually used those models for more than few days and learns their strengths and weaknesses it is completely obvious all this talk of &#34;societal impact&#34;, or as you called it self imposed limits are 100% bulls**. Everyone in the field knows it.99% of those using this tactics use it to justify not releasing their models to avoid giving competition a leg up(Google, openAI) and to pretend they are for &#34;open research&#34;. As I said this is 100% bull.The remaining 1% are either doing this to inflate their egos (&#34;hey look how considerate and enlightened we are in everything we do!&#34;), or they pander to media/silly politicians/various clueless commentators whose level of knowledge about this technology is null. They regurgitate the same set of &#34;what ifs and horror stories&#34; to scare the public into standing by when they attempt to over regulate another field so they can be kingmakers within it(if you want an example how it works look at the energy sector).All this sillyness accomplishes is to raise a barrier to entry for potential commercial competition. Bad actors will have enough money/lack scruples to train their own models or to steal your best ones regardless how &#34;impact conscious&#34; your company it.Now, I don&#39;t claim everyone should be forced to publish their AI models. No, if you spent lots of money on training your model it is yours. But you can&#39;t lock all your work behind closed doors and call yourself open. It doesn&#39;t work like this. One important point is that there is value even in just publishing a paper demonstrating some achievements of a proprietary model, but if the experiment can&#39;t be reproduces based on description given that is not science and for sure it is not open."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Let&#39;s be realistic, just like building codes, medical procedures and car manufacturing sooner or later we will also be subject to regulations. The times where hacking culture and tech was left unbothered are over.Twenty years ago we were free to do whatever we want, because it didn&#39;t matter. Nowadays everyone uses tech as much as they use stairs. You can&#39;t build stairs without railings though.Keeping the window for abuse small is beneficial to the whole industry. Otherwise bad press will put pressure on politicians to &#34;do something about it&#34; resulting in faster and more excessive regulations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really, really hope that there aren&#39;t any people who think the way you&#39;ve outlined. Technology has empowered small groups or even single individuals to create things that have the potential to change the course of civilization, so I for sure hope those individuals think twice about the potential consequences of their actions. How would you feel about people releasing a $100 &#39;build your own Covid-variant&#39; kit?"</p>

					<h3><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/10/21/1062001/spacex-starlink-signals-reverse-engineered-gps/">Starlink signals can be reverse-engineered to work like GPS</a></h3>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33287224">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think there is a bit of an issue here that isn&#39;t addressed in the article. They reference using the SpaceX published ephemerides which are created from the GPS receivers onboard the SpaceX satellites:&#34;SpaceX satellites regularly downlink accurate orbital information from onboard GPS. We use this orbital information, combined with planned maneuvers, to accurately predict future ephemerides, which are uploaded to Space-Track.org three times per day&#34; [0]So using the positioning information of the SpaceX satellites is already dependent on GPS. Saying that it could be used as a backup to GPS is a bit non-sensical to me. Sure you could go back to using ranging measurements for each of the satellites to get TLEs from NORAD or LeoLabs or one of the other commercial space tracking companies, but it would likely be less accurate and not updated as frequently as the SpaceX satellites don&#39;t have a precision clock onboard for timing and propagation like the GPS satellites do.[0] https://www.spacex.com/updates/index.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"GPS is also coupled with WAAS which relies on a network of ground stations at known coordinates to determine GPS error. These errors are caused by bulges in the ionosphere that throw off timing. Error is calculated, broadcast up to satellites and then rebroadcast down to GPS receivers that are WAAS enabled. This is known as a satellite based augmentation system. The other satellite nav systems that compete with GPS are building similar augmentation systems (like GAGAN, EGNOS, MSAS and SDCM). These systems are required for precision approaches like LPV for aircraft on instrument flight plans. Regular GPS precision due to ionosphere changes is too low. They&#39;ve enabled the FAA to lower the minimums for GPS approaches down to levels that are close to ILS, removing the need for expensive ILS installations at many regional airports. So replacing GPS isn&#39;t just about creating a system to locate a point in space. You&#39;d need to replace critical systems like WAAS that enable precision approaches during instrument conditions, for example."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Massively impressive! A very exciting paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12334v4 from the first two authors shows how Starlink can be fused with ordinary GNSS to get extremely impressive +56 dB anti-jam advantage (see Figure 1)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Best part of PocketCast is the stats. It can tell me that since 2016 I&#39;ve listened to 135 days worth of podcasts and apparently I&#39;ve &#34;saved&#34; 46 days by increasing the playback speed and 3 days from trimming silence. (I also have 350 hours in my &#34;up next&#34; queue ...)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reading this made me grin. Pocket Casts is one of the only applications that&#39;s survived me bouncing between iOS and Android and back again over the last who-knows-how-many years and I paid for their web player a long time ago, too. I&#39;ve tried other players and none of them stick; the differences in affordances in something like Castro or Overcast send me back to Pocket Casts every time.They seem to have had a rough time of it over the last few years, and seeing them end up at Automattic (&#34;land of the misfit web toys&#34;) was nice. This is a cherry on top."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"After being a user for many many years, I just recently tested out to Snipd [1] and have not looked back since.  Pocket Cast were great but I don&#39;t see them innovating. With Snipd there is almost always a full text transcript available including a surprisingly accurate AI generated Table of Contents to cue through.  Then I can easily save a transcribed clip of some section I am listening to  for export to a TfT program like obsidian.  Not sure how I ever lived without these features now I am used to them lol.[1]  https://www.snipd.com/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a great step.  Subscriptions errode first sale protections by subscription-gating physical objects, allowing OEMs a work-around to first-sale doctrine.  If you buy something, you should own it, and be able to fix it, scrap it, re-sell it, whatever you want.It&#39;s interesting NJ included self-driving in the subscription ban.  These require significant overhead in compute, engineering resources and greatly impact safety, and if Tesla&#39;s pricing is any indication of overall market, FSD will cost a pretty penny.If full self-driving was offered at 10k up front for the life of the car, or $80/mo, I would imagine many buyers of lower-end vehicles would prefer a subscription."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Go New Jersey! Now get Texas and California on board so car companies don&#39;t bother offering these in the country at all"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this is great, and though I agree that determining whether there is an &#34;on-going cost to the manufacturer&#34; will be a gray area that automakers will try to game, I think that&#39;s a solvable problem.The heated seats example is a great one. There is no reason for this not be a one-time charge.On the other hand, I think it&#39;s fair to offer autopilot/&#34;full self driving&#34; on a subscription, or at least the upgrades as a subscription. Clearly there is a large ongoing cost to continually improve self-driving capabilities, and it seems reasonable to me to have a pricing model that reflects that."</p>
