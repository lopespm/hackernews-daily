								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Anecdata (only because I don&#39;t have access to the data anymore). Customer satisfaction is so much higher when they get a one click unsubscribe. In fact, when the friction is so low, the customer is likely to start the subscription back.I say this as someone who worked in customer service automation. The worst customer satisfaction score with lowest rate of re-subscription is from companies that make it hell to unsubscribe.I&#39;ve seen customers send messages like &#34;Cancel and refund immediately!&#34; Since our response was ai driven, we cancel and refund no questions asked in less then a minute (we do fraud check in the background). Many times you get a response back from the customer apologizing for their tone and praising the product. Some of them restart the subscription a cycle or two later.When you make it hard to cancel, you lose customers on the long term. Make it easy, in fact make it friendly. Unless you are selling a shady product, there is no reason to believe customers won&#39;t come back.Edit: typo"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; including an option that’s “at least as easy” as the one to subscribeWeirdly enough this sounds like a loophole.I can already see some companies trying to bullshit their way through an investigation: &#34;Oh sure, we don&#39;t provide online cancellation, because our way to cancel is even easier than online:&#34; *presents a way to cancel that is in practice more difficult than online*.I think either mandating that cancelling must be possible using the same workflow as subscription or more clearly defining what &#34;easy&#34; means would be important."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"California SB-313 (https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtm...) was passed in 2018 and has this requirement:&#34;... a consumer who accepts an automatic renewal or continuous service offer online shall be allowed to terminate the automatic renewal or continuous service exclusively online, which may include a termination email formatted and provided by the business that a consumer can send to the business without additional information.&#34;But I have one recent anecdote that suggests this language is not specific enough to lead to a very good outcome.I had a SiriusXM subscription for my car, and paid $52.21 for the past 12 months of service. And they wanted to renew me for something in the ballpark of $20/month ($240/year). I absolutely hate that business practice and having to go talk to them to negotiate a better rate, otherwise they auto-renew you for a much worse rate than you were already on.So I went to cancel. There is no click to cancel option. You have to call or do online chat. I think the online chat is how they can say they follow California law.It still took me about 30+ minutes to actually cancel the service, because the person responding to the chat has to run through a script to try to retain you. First they want to know if you are enjoying the service. Then they want to know what stations you like. Then it&#39;s &#34;I&#39;ll switch you to this new plan that&#39;s only $12/month, can I go ahead and do that?&#34;All the while I&#39;m telling them that the reason I&#39;m cancelling is that they tried to auto-renew me to a much higher rate, and now they are making it super hard to cancel, which makes me want to cancel more.So I had to go round and round insisting I wanted to cancel. Never did they offer me anything close to the previous rate I was paying. Though I see now that if I re-enabled my subscription I&#39;d get close to that rate again for 6 months. But for a service that I only use when I don&#39;t have good cell phone coverage, and the annual time waste they put me through to avoid over paying... It&#39;s not worth it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Based on all the dumbfounded and cynical replies, I don&#39;t think people understand why this is happening.Anybody saying this is a response to recent anti-trust headlines doesn&#39;t understand how a company the size of Apple works. When an announcement like this is made, it means this program has been in the works for YEARS.My guess, this is all part of Apple&#39;s slow shift towards a recurring revenue services model, and a better integration of customer &amp; business incentives.It used to be, the worst thing that could happen to Apple was the customer stops upgrading their phone.But now, when the revenue growth is coming from services instead of hardware, it doesn&#39;t pay to piss off customers by making them buy a new phone a year early because the battery died.The worst thing that can happen now under this new business model is the customer leaves the ecosystem or buys less services because they aren&#39;t happy with the hardware.Hence why you&#39;re seeing Apple do things they never would have before. Capitulating on the MacBook Pro and rolling back on the Touch Bar, opening up to more repairability, etc. etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sorry for the tangent, but I&#39;m sad to see even Apple is now pumping out terrible Alegria corporate art.In 10 years people are going to look back on all this terrible art and wonder what the hell every tech company was thinking.There&#39;s even a subreddit dedicated to hating the Alegria trend: https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckalegriaart/top/?t=all"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My daughter has this as an school assignment, with some implication that it is some sort of a contest, and we managed to grow quite a few of similar quality to the seed crystals on the site in 4 days, which was the original (poorly thought IMO) deadline. 
The trouble is that no one else was able or cared to do it so fast, so the deadline has been slipping for a couple weeks now, with our best crystals going to school and back a few times, getting scratches and broken bits instead of nicely growing undisturbed. 
A bit discouraging. I&#39;m now remembering how frustrating was for me to take school related things too seriously and discover you cared more than your teachers when I was her age."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I was an organic chemist, growing crystals was of paramount importance for certain structure determinations using X-ray crystallography (to answer &#34;did I really prepare what I think I prepared?&#34;)With sensitive compounds, sometimes you can&#39;t just let things evaporate. Also as the article states, weather conditions might mess you up.
IMO the coolest trick we had to solve this was osmosis of an anti-solvent into a saturated solution.A small sealed container with a saturated solution of your compound/salt is punctured, and put in a bigger sealed container containing a worse but miscible solvent for the compound under study. Slow diffusion into the inner container causes very reproducible crystal growth, as long as you can control the temperature."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is worth reading purely for the writing alone. Scott Alexander is a treasure:&gt; As best I can tell, this is some kind of Egyptian trial. It might or might not be an RCT; it says stuff like “Patients were self-allocated to the treatment groups; the first 3 days of the week for the intervention arm while the other 3 days for symptomatic treatment”. Were they self-allocated in the sense that they got to choose? Doesn’t that mean it’s not random? Aren’t there seven days in a week? These are among the many questions that Elalfy et al do not answer for us."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While reading this piece I got a little depressed that most journalism is just such utter trash compared to it. I&#39;ve read so many articles on ivermectin and none of them gave me even ten percent of the clarity that this article gave me. Can you imagine if writing and journalism of this calibre was commonplace among practising &#34;journalists&#34;? And look at how this piece compares to the CDC&#39;s and WHO&#39;s science communication. It&#39;s a shame that clear thinking and communication is so scarce."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The real story (in my opinion) behind Ivermectin are the studies not being conducted. Here you have a ton of studies claiming to have found benefit with a worldwide, massively available drug that has practically zero risks for most people (and it&#39;s an extremely well understood drug) and we don&#39;t have first world countries conducting RCTs to understand it better.So you have to ask yourself - when do we get high quality RCTs, who funds them and why? This to me is a clear cut indicator that we have very maligned incentives for health science. How can we be this far into a global pandemic, with all of this funding and not have multiple high quality RCTs on this drug? It&#39;s sad to say the least. Even if Ivermectin ends up being fairly weak or completely ineffective - surely there&#39;s something to learn here..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is kind of an amazing implosion all at once on Twitter. The OBS Project accused Streamlabs of this after another streaming company, Lightstream, noted that Streamlabs had copy-and-pasted a marketing page from their product to use for Streamlabs&#39; product, down to word-for-word copies of the &#34;user&#34; recommendations.https://twitter.com/Lightstream/status/1460709404609757185And, also in that thread, El Gato -- makers of the hardware Stream Deck -- chimed in with a wry &#34;know that feel,&#34; showing that &#34;Streamlabs Stream Deck&#34; was, let&#39;s say, strongly reminiscent of their product.https://twitter.com/elgato/status/1460722403261046789"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You know, I&#39;ll admit that this is ignorance on my end, but I honestly thought that Streamlabs was the owner of OBS, in that OBS was just an internal project that they open sourced.Clearly I&#39;m wrong but I doubt I&#39;m the only person who thought that.  Seems like they&#39;re being douchebags if they&#39;re just taking the offensive and filing predatory trademarks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If this is true, the detail that sticks out to me is that before the legal filings StreamLabs thought to reach out about using the name. If StreamLabs thought the names were similar enough that they reached out about using the name, that proves that even from their own former perspective, they&#39;re using a mark that was already recognized in the industry and similar enough to their own mark - surely consumers could have the same perspective (many in the comments here were already confused). They also can&#39;t claim ignorance. Why should they expect trademark law to now protect the name for them?The same thing apparently happened with Meta: http://meta.company/."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Beware if you load this on a mobile device with metered data!This animation is implemented by loading a large number of ~200KB PNG files, each 800x800px, such as this one [1] and then drawing them into a &lt;canvas&gt; as you scroll.Having scrolled through the entirety of the animations, Firefox reports that it transferred about 220MB of PNGs on top of the 3.4MB of JS and an inexplicable 202KB of CSS.Maybe I do not understand some key requirement. Shouldn&#39;t it be possible to encode a high quality video file, embed it with &lt;video&gt;, and control it from JS, and still come out with a much smaller file size?  Perhaps there&#39;s just a requirement I&#39;m missing but that&#39;s an eye watering amount of data being served by Cloudfront to every visitor, and Cloudfront isn&#39;t exactly the cheapest.[1] https://d11poao410tx6l.cloudfront.net/616f05008e9fa70027fff3...edit: I got nerd sniped and downloaded all the frames. Considering only the largest animation (da2783d9-383d-43ec-8778-9b52f984c35a):  - 230 PNG frames: 51MB
  - WebM (VP9, alpha, lossless): 6.7MB (-86.7%)
  - WebM (VP9, alpha, crf15): 2.3MB (-95.5%)

Instead if I use all the frames in one big video:  - 1087 PNG frames: 271MB
  - WebM (VP9, alpha, lossless): 39.0MB (-85.6%)
  - WebM (VP9, alpha, crf15): 12.0MB (-95.6%)

I used ffmpeg 4.4.1 with the following commands:  ffmpeg -i &#39;frames/%6d.png&#39; -c:v libvpx-vp9 -lossless 1 lossless.webm
  ffmpeg -i &#39;frames/%6d.png&#39; -c:v libvpx-vp9 -b:v 0 -crf 15 crf15.webm

To my eye, crf15 is very very good quality, but I included lossless encoding so there can be no quibble about quality differences :)And yes I know Safari can&#39;t do VP9 but there&#39;s no reason you couldn&#39;t also encode a HEVC and AV1 version and list multiple &lt;source&gt; elements and let the browser decide which format it prefersedit to the edit: It seems that smoothly scrubbing through a &lt;video&gt; element is more tricky than I originally knew.  Still, a lot of mileage could be gained by encoding the individual frames as AVIF or WebP and using them in supported browsers"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"At my last job, I found our code review process was terribly slow and set about analyzing it and coming up with solutions.  I found a lot of developers were blocked on reviews.  They either task switched (expensive) or babysat their review (expensive).  Even though we were using Phab, few did stacked commits because of how unfamiliar the tools were which made them feel brittle.Improving the stacked workflow is one part of the equation but I&#39;d recommend being careful of letting that mask other problemsI identified a series of busy-waits including:- Post, wait, CI failure, fix, post- Post: wait for reviewer, ping reviewer, wait, find feedback was posted, fix, postSome of the root causes included:- Developers weren&#39;t being pinged when the ball was in their court (as author or reviewer)- Well, some notifications happened, but review groups were so noisy no one looked- The shared responsibility of review groups is everyone assumed someone else would look.- The tools we were using made it hard to identify active conversationsMy ideal solution:- Auto-assign reviewers from a review group, allowing shared responsibility of the code base while keeping individual accountability of reviews- Review tools that ping the person the review is blocked on when they are ready to act- Review tools that give a reminder after a set period of time- Azure DevOps&#39; tracking of conversation state with filtering (and toggling between original code and the &#34;fixed&#34; version)- Auto-merge-on-green-checks (including reviewer sign off)With this, responses are timely without people polling the service, letting machines micro-manage the process rather than humans."</p>
