								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a big frustration of mine, too. The other is that Spotify is extremely biased towards playlist listening and makes browsing and listening to a library of albums really painful.The good news is that Spotify&#39;s SDK and API are actually powerful enough that you can build up an entire alternative interface, which is actually what I recently started doing: https://i.imgur.com/ar7VrYy.png.It&#39;s still work in progress but actually works perfectly well already. It&#39;s not ready for public use yet and also isn&#39;t open source yet though. If you want to follow development I guess the best place to do that is my twitter: https://twitter.com/tom_j_watson."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I use Winamp for my MP3 collection that I downloaded of my T1 line at the office.When I turn that mother up on and my CRT monitor starts smoking because of the Winamp addons that spikes all kinds of shit whenever the tune is changing, then I know I have found the right track.Then I get cracking on the floor. Break dancing and caps flying around. The neighbors come jumping in the door and starts clapping and the music just keeps going.Everybody can understand a list of songs, even my grandma who&#39;s pushing 84. So we battle out songs on each of ours computers, but we don&#39;t use Spotify any more."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Spotify&#39;s UI is a case study of the negative impact of assigning single screens to single teams, designers and managers. There is no cohesive vision. The useful functionality is all obscured by esthetics. I am perpetually annoyed at how poor spotify is at it&#39;s basic purpose. They have leaned way too far into recommendation systems and over designed layout. 99% of the time, I know what I want to listen to. Spotify&#39;s UX is designed for people to &#39;browse&#39; the app. That doesnt resonate with me, at all. I know what I want.My biggest gripe with spotify is it&#39;s inability to reliably answer the question of &#34;what playlist or source am I currently listening too?&#34;. A constant flow that spotify fails to deliver on is this: Search for a song, play the song, then the rest of the album, on repeat, without shuffle. It&#39;s annoying to have to load multiple slow UIs to navigate from search to album, visually search the album&#39;s track list and play the song your after.Itunes and Windows Media Player set the standard for how media should be navigated and Spotify should use some of those old standard concepts.EDIT:Try browsing Armin Van Buuren&#39;s massive discography on Spotify."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Now this is how the project documentation should look like! Explains what the project does, gives some short examples of the most common features, then goes into the details - while being easy to understand for the target audience. Kudos to whoever wrote this! (and rr sounds like a nice tool too ;) )"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Historically, rr has not worked on AMD processors, which is a bummer. However, I have been able to make good use of it on my 5950X now with the workaround script and newer versions of rr. This is good news.I&#39;ve not read their extended technical report, but I am kind of curious exactly what performance counters AMD is implementing poorly and how that impacts rr."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is incredible!For those that have used it, how useful it is for debugging multithreading heisenbugs? Can I let a process run under rr for days, wait until it crashes to due a heisenbug, and replay the trace without rr having to go through days of recording? i.e. is it possible to fast forward the trace, somehow?(I nerd sniped myself a bit here, wondering how fast forwarding could be implemented. I think it might be achievable with periodic process memory snapshots and incremental traces.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m the co-author of one of the papers referenced in the blogpost, (Fast Quicksort Implementation Using AVX Instructions), we did write the AVX512 code back in 2015, just had nowhere to run it, at least publicly. The paper also very explicitly says that the lookup tables can be instead replaced by the AVX512 compress instructions. The code for that paper is available in https://github.com/vkrasnov/avx_qsort"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wonder how fast it is compared to djbsort https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/blob/master/libc/nexgen... and longsort https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/blob/e011973593407f576d... djbsort is outrageously fast for 32-bit ints with avx2 (which unlike avx512 it&#39;s the avx we can reliably use in open source). But there&#39;s never been a clear instruction set to use on Intel / AMD for sorting 64-bit ints that&#39;s reliably fast. So if this thing can actually sort 64-bit integers 10x faster on avx2 I&#39;d be so thrilled."</p>

Just a tip to everyone job hunting I guess. Watch what executives do (not what they say). Well, and human history of speculative bubbles.I didn&#39;t think it was a coincidence Coinbase did a direct listing rather than an IPO, since an IPO has a waiting period for insiders to sell.

					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31624401">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Losing confidence? No, I lost that years ago. For quite some time the vast majority of the listings have been drop-shipped AliExpress garbage. Many of them are obvious because of terrible photoshops, randomly named branding, and those strange bold brackets in the product description.But some can be harder to spot because of tricks that sellers use to essentially hijack listings for other products to carry all the positive reviews along. Or they may just go the route of putting completely fake reviews on the product. Some may even be from verified purchasers because they packed a card along with the product offering compensation for a 5 star review. Or they can get verified reviews in an even slimier way involving ordering from themselves and then shipping random crap to people who&#39;ve they&#39;ve sent stuff to before.And then there&#39;s the inventory that&#39;s poisoned with counterfeits. Thanks to inventory co-mingling counterfeit and legit products can end up getting mixed together. There&#39;s a chance that even buying from a fully legit listing will end up with you getting sent a counterfeit product.However, despite all of that I do still use Amazon. Their immense investment into logistics means that many things will make it to me next-day. And their return policies allow me to order with the confidence that if I get a fraudulent item (or just something I don&#39;t like) it will be fairly painless to get a replacement or my money back.That said, I have also been making more efforts over the years to not use Amazon. I tend to buy all my major electronics from Best Buy or direct from the manufacturer. And I would never buy any food or medicine from Amazon. I don&#39;t want to risk things that go into me being counterfeit."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A seller offered me a gift certificate if I left a 5 star review.  Basically a little note in the box saying if I left a 5 star review, took a screenshot &amp; sent it to their email address, they&#39;d send me the gift certificate.It was not a 5 star product.  It was a 2 star product, at best.I tried to mention the fact they were paying for reviews in my review (to explain the other 5 stars).Amazon rejected my review.It&#39;s against Amazon policy to let others know that sellers are buying reviews."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like you&#39;re several years late to the party here. I think it&#39;s pretty common knowledge at this point that certain types of goods sold on Amazon have a huge chance of being counterfeit and everyone knows reviews are faked/not to be trusted blindly.At this point people seem to not care since Amazon will give a refund/exchange pretty much no questions asked. It&#39;s still extremely annoying and it&#39;s definitely not a good look for their business, but I assume the number crunchers have determined actually dealing with the fraud isn&#39;t yet worth it financially."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Seems like an innocent enough mistake. Remind me of when I once helped organize a volunteer hackathon with people from different companies. We created a Slack organization just for the occasion. At the end of the event, I was supposed to ask all attendees to delete all the data we had given them before they went home. The message I posted to #general (the channel everyone in a Slack organization is required to be in) with @everyone tagged was something to the effect of:&#34;Thank you everyone for contributing to our shared mission. When you are done with your work today, please delete all the data from your machines. Hope we see each other again soon!&#34;Slack gave me a dire warning that my message would send notifications to so many people across so many time zones. This didn&#39;t surprise me because attendees came from various countries for the event. So I dismissed it.But I had accidentally sent it to my company&#39;s Slack organization instead of the hackathon-specific one. I didn&#39;t realize it until a co-worker sent me a private message asking why I had just tried to fire everyone at our company."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The only notable thing here IMO is the lack of limits imposed by GitHub on notifications. Apparently a random tag of `@microsoft` in the comments was enough to notify 4000 people [1] as well.I have no idea why the user is even being mentioned in this headline. I haven&#39;t used GitHub in a while, and am unfamiliar with orgs and subgroups, but tagging a developer subgroup on a PR seems...a reasonable thing for a new contributor to do? How is it their fault that the developer subgroup has been hijacked by this organization to mean &#34;Anyone who has ever signed the Terms of Service To View Our Code&#34;?The correct thing for Epic Games to do here would be to rename the group to `@EpicGames/terms-of-service-signatories`, and restrict `@EpicGames/developers` to people who have requested access to open a PR. Assuming that people should magically know not to mention `@EpicGames/developers` in their PRs because Epic is doing some ToS shenanigans is preposterous.I guess I&#39;ll be looking carefully at mentions the next time I have to use this social network [2] masquerading poorly as a code review tool to submit a pull request.----------------------------------------[1] https://github.com/EpicGames/Signup/pull/24#issuecomment-114...[2] Looking at the profile of the contributor making the PR tells me that GitHub has apparently decided to let their users independently rediscover the experience of SuperWall on Facebook circa 2007."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Innocent mistake.The kid is barely 18. The emotion and stress resulting from mistakenly sending a notification to 400,000 is likely overwhelming. Now his real name is going to stay at the center of the internet for a while thanks to being 1st on HN. I would definitely not have coped well with that much internet attention at his age. Some Github replies are more immature than the initial action and I hope he does not receive any threat.I hope the Epic developers reach out to him nicely with constructive feedback and maybe a thanks for his well-meaning PR."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The one thing that sours the entire experience for me is that songs take like 5-15s to start playing when selecting one that isn&#39;t super popular.This happens on my ipad, mac, android phone.It feels like some server is spinning up a hard drive to stream it.Apart from that, why the hell is the title and artist only shown in one line that starts scolling instead of showing multiple lines if it doesn&#39;t fit, at least in the album view and the player. It&#39;s such a pain listening to classical music when the composer and the performer and section are not visible without playing it and waiting for the line to scroll, like wtf."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve never seen a search box that couldn&#39;t actually handle input before, but Apple Music made it.If I click in the search box and start typing, the box will lose focus at some random time and all my next keystrokes will count as play commands, usually pausing the music. If I come back to the search box, it happens again.I know &#34;text boxes&#34; are cutting-edge technology that&#39;s barely 3 seconds old and developers are still learning to program them safely. Still, I expected more from a trillion-dollar company."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like Apple Music because it integrates well with the Apple line.More importantly though it is one of the highest paying per stream to artists [1].  Streaming needs to be much more lucrative for artists and consumer choice helps that.It is nice to be able to buy the music as well if you want to support. Being part of Apple One is huge as well.The latest music streaming royalty rates are as follows.    PLATFORM     ROYALTY (PER STREAM) STREAMS TO MAKE $1

    Tidal Music        $0.01284       78

    Apple Music        $0.008         125

    Amazon Music       $0.00402       249

I have lots of mp3/stored music as well and Spotify client started taking like 20-30 minutes to start up. Wasn&#39;t sure what it was doing...Some of their patents for tracking are a bit dystopian as well.New Spotify Patent Involves Monitoring Users’ Speech to Recommend Music&gt; The streaming platform is interested in extracting data points like emotional state, gender, age, and accent to hone its recommendations [2].Nah.

Bob will find out his crush’s public key, encrypt &#34;you are my crush&#34; message to it and post it with his own signature to public bulletin (blockchain can be good shelling point). When crush decrypts message they will see proper string, while everyone else will see gibberish.- to solve problems with key distribution we can use &#34;identity based encryption&#34;. it requires trusted third party (e.g. school administrators) but it solves problem for key generation of participants. With identity encryption bob can encrypt message to some canonical identity such as school email.
