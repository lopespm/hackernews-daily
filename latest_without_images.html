You want &#34;permillionage&#34;, or maybe more colloquially &#34;DPM&#34; for &#34;Defects Per Million&#34; or even &#34;DPB&#34;.You&#39;ll still get false positives though, so you provide an appeal process. But what&#39;s to prevent the bad actors from abusing the appeal process while leaving your more clueless legitimate users lost in the dust?(As the joke goes: &#34;There is considerable overlap between the intelligence of the smartest bears and the dumbest tourists&#34; [1])Can you build any vetting process, and associated appeal process, that successfully keeps all the bad actors out, and doesn&#39;t exclude your good users? What about those on the edge? Or those that switch? Or those who are busy, or wary?There&#39;s a lot of money riding on that.[1] https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/08/security_is_a..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like Google is a case study in an engineering only company. Everything is reduced to a technical problem. Incentives are aligned to solve technical problems. No one wants to work on something unless it is technically interesting and new. There is no incentive at all for delivering an excellent user experience over the long term - which usually can&#39;t be done with tech only, and involves a lot of dredge work of continuous introspection and improvement.We see this again and again. The cynic in me sees Stadia as yet another internal promotion scheme, masquerading as a product.I doubt this will ever change. The internal momentum of the company culture will make it so. What does it mean for investors? Google has enough money they can just buy their way into markets indefinitely. It will probably keep them going, but I don&#39;t expect huge growth. I&#39;d probably be putting my money into other stocks if I had to choose. I honestly don&#39;t think people would miss Google much if it was gone."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is possibly tied to the recent assault on the ZXing Barcode scanner app[1].This is a legit open source app that&#39;s been recently flooded by 1-star reviews claiming that the app contains malware, probably in order to get users to switch to the other apps.
The funny thing is this app has not been updated since 2019 on the Play Store, so those reviews are clearly bogus.It takes a special kind of scum to slander an open source project in order to push malware.[1]: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.zxi..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Even legitimate app developers have no incentive to keep their apps sterile. Someone just has to approach you with your 10+ million users barcode scanner app and offer you +50,000$ in order to install some automated ad clicker for them.Don’t be naive, the majority will accept the money and gladly.I believe that particularly makeshift applications such as e.g. barcode scanners are susceptible to this kind of overtake. Apps that offer what should have been offered by the OS vendor in the first place. Why should the app developer refuse the money if what their app offers will be incorporated in a next OS update by anyways? Why defend your mini-adapter-app in an ocean of mini-adapter-apps, with yours becoming so large just because of a random seed and path dependency?This can have a big impact for end users. Imagine an authenticator app ending service to all their users in such a scheme and how you will be cut out from all your accounts by this. How many authenticator apps do you have to use in parallel to mitigate this risk of a single point of failure?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The only reason this was detected was very overt behavior - opening AD popups. So I guesstimate for each one of these we have 10 that go undetected. 
This means the whole ecosystem is broken, as there is no reason this will happen only for updates and not for new apps as well. Apple&#39;s ecosystem is somewhat better, but I can&#39;t imagine they go through every line of code in each package, so most of their review is probably done with some combination of automatic static and dynamic analysis, and these can be fooled. The problem with both platforms is that they don&#39;t provide run of the mill users the option of installing an effective firewall and security solutions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The decision making power within the Rust project is uniquely delegated and distributed; with the core team holding little more privilege than other more specialized teams. [...] And the potential of such a system has bore fruit: It is not a mistake that such a promising technology has emerged from such a progressive conception of collaboration.These are values and thoughts describing an approach that the KDE community (and its foundation; hello from another board!) holds equally dearly and has inscribed in its Manifesto (https://manifesto.kde.org/, cf. Common Ownership).While maybe not unique, I&#39;m excited to see another organization adopt this idea set (a support body not interfering with technical agenda, low barriers to participation, not entrenching maintainers, working succession mechanisms, etc.) as a core message. We&#39;ve seen it work very well to sustain a productive community for 25 years and I think this bodes well for Rust!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m really happy to see this happen. I&#39;m also really thrilled to see Lars Bergstrom on the board, and am excited about taking Rust farther both at Google and across the industry. Rust is evolving from being centered at Mozilla to being a true community and collaboration between many different groups, including big companies, so I think a well-supported foundation is key. I&#39;m very hopeful for the future."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Bitcoin is a mystery to me. Somehow it&#39;s hailed as revolutionising the economy, by replacing currency with a worse kind of currency.It feels like this is where all the &#34;how to get rich quick&#34; book writers and other hustle bros went and created one giant financial pyramid, which works in quite simple way:
- buy bitcoin
- tell everyone around how revolutionary it is, so they buy it and what you holding increases in value, then tell them to do the same.Keep repeating the above two steps through different layers of abstraction, so it&#39;s not so obvious anymore.The other thing that comes into play and makes it grow even bigger is when people see others who made money on this bunch of bollocks, and think that the fact they are rich somehow makes them smart. Then they buy into all of the cryptocurrency platitudes wholesale without stopping for a moment to critically evaluate it.I think I&#39;m a bit sour, because this whole crypto-crap infested the idea space of decentralisation, which is imho very important step that we should try to take take as a society. Now it&#39;s just forever tainted with bitcoin and all the greed fuelled people there, while the decentralisation should be quite the opposite in nature.You know what would be revolutionary? Getting rid of currency altogether."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oh noes, if this starts a trend, becomes widespread, and businesses start hoarding crypto tokens instead of investing in building stuff, it could cause a great depression pretty much the same way gold hoarding caused the economy to collapse in 1929.When people, businesses and banks start hording tokens instead of investing in building and maintaining the production capacity of consumables, the ratio of value of tokens meant to buy consumables vs the actual production of consumables gets out of wack.When the music stops, people realize that others are sitting on tons of seemingly valuable tokens but stuff to buy with them is getting scarce because capacity is not being maintained, they reverse their trade, prices of stuff go up, volatility ensues in an incredibly destructive cycle.Too much savings being tied to tokens instead of assets that create real value is an economy wide coordination failure, a terrible Nash equilibrium. It can be hard to solve because it&#39;s a prisoner&#39;s dilemma where the first people to invest in real production are disadvantaged so everyone hoards tokens instead.This is what central banks are designed to prevent. We don&#39;t want cryptocoins to cause another great depression like gold tied currencies did almost a hundred years ago."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This comment is unlikely to win me many friends here, but it is worth considering that while Bitcoin is, nominally at least, decentralized and free from government control, internet access is not.A simple glance at the trend of governments to partially or to fully shut down internet services to certain areas in times of unrest or mass protest means, in the case of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies requiring collective transaction verification via online communications, that a loss of internet constitutes an inability to conduct financial transactions for those thus affected.While I applaud the efforts of so many to free the world from government control of &#34;money&#34;, the full implementation of this effort should be preceded by freeing internet communications from the control of those same governments, otherwise what appears to be a new financial &#34;power&#34; is actually a new financial &#34;weakness&#34;.Think over this carefully."</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26059517">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Anecdata: Trello and Jira both have free plans that I used that caused me to recommend them for paid usage at multiple companies I’ve worked with. Those free plans resulted in $xx-$xxxx monthly subscriptions.Asana has a paid plan with a 5-user minimum limit. I never bothered to even try it since I wouldn’t have the extended time to play with it. As a result it never even got mentioned to companies I’ve worked with.So, it’s important to have a free plan (or at least very cheap paid plan as the article recommended) for “influencers” to get heavily involved with."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is really aggressively oversimplifying a complicated problem that exists across a huge number of different types of software. In some cases, sure, a free plan is going to cost more in effort than it pays in users who convert to paid. That said, the objection that free users are going to take up too much time is pretty easily solved... look at Google, which has zero customer support and an enormous number of free users. As long as you set expectations up front, you can offer minimal customer service to free users (which also means you can sell it as part of paid plans).But even beyond that, there are just so many generalizations here that may not apply to you. Deciding whether to have a free plan or not should depend on what the actual percent of your users that convert from free to paid is - you shouldn&#39;t just go with no free plan because someone says, &#34;Many users will never ever pay, regardless of how good your product is and how much of a problem it solves.&#34;There&#39;s some reasonable thoughts in here, but the absolutism of it shows that the author hasn&#39;t really considered the breadth of possible scenarios here - likely they&#39;ve gone through this analysis with a product or two and come to the right conclusion, but that doesn&#39;t mean that conclusion is anywhere close to 100% applicable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It is sad but true that users that pay less, or zero, are more demanding on customer support and make unreasonable demands via social. Had a guy this week using our free product that has 90% of the paid products features berating us on Twitter for not being 100% free and demanding we convert and rely on donations to support our 40 person team. Makes me regret having a free offering. In my 20 years doing software startups I’ve seen this over and over. Simply raising your prices, which we’ve raised to over 5x, dramatically reduces load on the  CS team per dollar earned."</p>

https://securityheaders.com/?q=https%3A%2F%2Fdashboard.clerk...For me it is also a red flag to include third party CDN JS (especially without SRI) on security critical applications (like the login for the dashboard and customer logins do with jsdelivr)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So, first, congrats on launching your product. :) Personally, I don&#39;t have a need for it, and if I did, I&#39;d be very reluctant to use a proprietary service, but I&#39;m sure there are companies out there who will be happy to use you. Good luck!------------That said, maybe the HN community can answer something I&#39;ve wondered about... Why isn&#39;t there an Open Source, standardized, self-hosted, version of this kind of service? Or, why hasn&#39;t one, or two, options emerged that everyone uses and I would have heard of by now?User management, authentication, and authorization, are all problems that have been solved in many apps, and there are plenty of best practices. So, just like you shouldn&#39;t roll your own hashing algorithm, I&#39;d think we&#39;d want to do the same with this. It would make sense for one of the open source companies or organizations like Canonical, RedHat, Apache or Mozilla to have at least tried to do this.The closest I can think of to an attempt is Persona...Anyway, just been wondering about this for a while, and thought I&#39;d take the opportunity to ask."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Really good stuff. The Next.js integration story is already really quite good[1] and the Clerk team has really good ideas on how to make it even better and more seamless.It&#39;s great to see a service focus on taking away all the pain related to user management, not just login.[1] https://frontend-docs.clerk.dev/react/quick-starts/next.js"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was surprised and happy to see this also being open sourced. As a developer of OpenLieroX (http://www.openlierox.net/), we also took inspiration of Soldat. The main difference is mainly the way you control the game, i.e. with mouse aim cursor in Soldat, and purely with keyboard in Liero. And also the ninja rope.Once we added mouse aim support to OpenLieroX as well, but the Liero community didn&#39;t liked it, and basically it became another game. Network play between both versions would be unfair. It would really need a different name.Teeworlds (https://www.teeworlds.com/) is also a more recent very similar game, also with mouse aim, and ninja rope.Interesting also that Soldat is implemented in Free Pascal / Lazarus."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What a surprise to see Soldat on hackernews :)I maintained Soldat back from version 1.5+ to 1.7 before someone else took over for a few years.The current version on Steam is Soldat 1.7 while the open source version is an unfinished Soldat 1.8 and needs some love before it can be released (gui is missing, new netcode, switch to lazarus/fpc, macOS and GNU/Linux support, new config file format to name a few.)So don&#39;t expect everything to work out of the box if you compile it.Any help is welcome btw ;)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Looks super fun, I&#39;ll give it a try!Something like 10 years ago I had a similar idea - a 2D shooter with the feel and gameplay of a FPS, only that in my case I thought of making it top-down, and the plan was that visibility would be a huge thing - your 2D character would only see things from their point of view that weren&#39;t blocked by the level geometry or other players.I never completed that game, for various reasons. But in the course of making that prototype, I did a lot of research about the networking model. I read every article I could find about client-side prediction, server reconciliation, and entity interpolation. I didn&#39;t want all this effort to go to waste, so I wrote what I had learned in article form, and put it on my website.That&#39;s the never-told-before origin story of my multiplayer networking articles :)https://gabrielgambetta.com/client-server-game-architecture...."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Internet-accessble industrial control systems have been a problem for many years now. It&#39;s a documented issue but it&#39;s difficult to fix for a variety of reasons:1. Difficult to identify the owner: a lot of the devices are on mobile networks that don&#39;t point to an obvious owner.2. Unknown criticality: is it a demo system or something used in production?3. Security budget: lots of smaller utilities don&#39;t have a budget for buying cyber security products.4. Uneducated vendor: sometimes the vendors of the device give very bad advice (https://blog.shodan.io/why-control-systems-are-on-the-intern...)That being said, based on the numbers in Shodan the situation has improved over the past decade.
