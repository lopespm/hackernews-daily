								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Adium (https://adium.im/) used to be the MacOSX native version (port) of Pidgin. It seems they still recommend it. However, Adium seems kind of dead? Last commit (https://github.com/adium/adium/) was in 2016.I build a MacOSX app bundle for the original Pidgin long time ago (https://sourceforge.net/projects/pidgin-macosx/). At that point in time, this was not so trivial, as the GTK support for native MacOSX was experimental (http://www.gtk-osx.org/). You could simply use the X11 GTK version but I rather wanted to have a native version. I have no idea what the current state is with GTK on MacOSX. This Pidgin build is obviously very outdated now (from 2009), and probably does not run on recent MacOSX versions (they are frequently breaking backward compatibility...)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ah! the glorious days of integrated chat clients.I had friends of MSN Messenger, Yahoo Messenger, GTalk and for a very limited time ICQ (Actually it was the same guys on all networks :) ). There weren&#39;t any network effort, people were willing to try out different IMs for their uniqueness.Lots of companies were trying to produce integrated chat clients - Pidgin, Meebo, Trillian, Digsby and a whole lot of guys on Mobile targeting Symbian OS (could recollect only Nimbuzz though.) I loved Digsby because it acted as a POP client too.I even worked for a company that forked Ignite Realtime Spark and tried adding Gtalk and MSN support. When I was freelancing one guy asked me to clone meebo for $500 .. and I accepted :facepalm."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Does nobody remember Pidgin?  It was one of the first things a lot of people installed on their machines 15 years ago along with Firefox.  We used it as an alternative client to AOL Instant Messenger and Yahoo Messenger.  It used to be called GAIM."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; On one scuba diving excursion while in the compound having lunch, Brad engaged a couple from Germany in conversation. Brad asked about the fellow travelers occupation and discovered he was a computer programmer. Lifewise, Brad was asked about his life&#39;s work and stated I am also a computer programmer. &#34;What do you do?&#34; Brad was asked. I wrote Objective-C. Astonished, the gentlerman said, &#34;No, Brad Cox wrote that&#34;. &#34;Hi, I am Brad Cox&#34;, was the response and the introduction.Wonderful story. I wish his family all the best.I love Objective-C and consider it a beautiful language. Back in the day I re-discovered my love for programming when I started to learn this language. This was when I was still in the Java world.As a side project I tried to build a drone (unmanned navel vehicle) powered by objective-c. I have abandoned the effort but posted the code on GitHub - it was a joy to work with the language and the funnest side project I’ve worked with.These days I work with python and golang for job/hobby but I always am grateful to have spent time with objective-c. Reflecting back if I haven’t spent time with this language, today I would of not been a programmer.Thank you Brad Cox for your work and positive influence."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am giving a talk in work soon around method swizzling in iOS and was delving into the history of Objective-C a bit and came across Alan Kay&#39;s talk about the power of simplicity and how we&#39;ve all screwed up OOP.In the talk, Alan talks about the ant who lives his life on a single plane of existence, the &#34;Gulley World&#34; or &#34;Reality&#34;.The ant goes to work, he finds stuff to eat, he lives his life in this Gulley World, which is depicted as a pink 2D plane. However some times on this pink plane there are little spots of blue. They represent thoughts that don&#39;t belong in the pink plane.Sometimes those blue spots turn into blue planes, and the ant we are following starts to move along that plane instead of the pink one. Everyone in the pink plane thinks he is wrong. Everyone can see the pink plane, in all its reality. It is not until you walk on the blue plane until you can see &#34;another way&#34;.The metaphor being that we developers built a world where we started to take the general idea of OOP and construct a lot of &#34;reality&#34; around it. A lot of process, a lot of formalization so we could build mechanical systems of gears that slotted together. I think Alan&#39;s idea of OOP was something more fluid, more organic than this. The world is messy and we often try to abstract the mess away in these overbearingly weighty and hierarchical programs that everyone agrees is the right way.I think Objective-C was the most widely used and successful walk on this blue plane. Millions of developers were exposed to the idea of message passing as a form of OOP, which is an astounding accomplishment. It really is a neat language, and I had a lot of fun learning it.Brad definitely walked on the blue plane. RIP."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Two years ago I started writing an app in Swift. After a two year sabbatical, this was going to be my first app.When using Swift, the compiler was painstakingly slow. Because of that, I tried Objective-C and it is so clear to me that I love it. It is the best language in my humble opinion. The dynamism clicked and the modern features make it a real breeze to use.Messages are so flexible. I also love how it has “gradual typing.”My only gripe with it is that Categories can’t formally conform to protocols—which I understand is an easy to build feature that Blaine Garst did finish but Apple never released.I know I’m talking about the language more than I am talking about Brad Cox, but that’s because it’s the first time I really fell in love with a language. Using Objective-C to build it brings me joy. Lots and lots of joy.Thank you Brad. My prayers to your family. May you find peace in heaven."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was, long ago, an old-school Unix sysadmin.  While I was technically aware of how powerful smallish servers have become, this article really crystallized that for me.64 cores and 24 NVME drives in a 2U spot on a rack is just insane compared to what we used to have to do to get a beefy database server.  And it&#39;s not some exotic thing, just a popular mainstream Dell SKU.If you price it out on Dell&#39;s site, you get a retail price north of $200k.  That is really what made it clear for me.  That you could fit $200k+ worth of DIMMS, Drives, CPUS into a 2U spot :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m thankful for their OpenZFS tuning doc which they developed as part of this server migration: https://github.com/letsencrypt/openzfs-nvme-databasesThe one thing that I get hung up on when it comes to RAID and SSDs is the wear pattern vs. HDDs. Take for example this quote from the README.md:We use RAID-1+0, in order to achieve the best possible performance without being vulnerable to a single-drive failure.Failure on SSDs is predictable and usually expressed with Terabytes Written (TBW). Failure on spinning disk HDDs is comparatively random. In my mind, it makes sense to mirror SSD-based vdevs only for performance reasons and not for data integrity. The reason is that the mirrors are expected to fail after the same amount of TBW, and thus the availability/redundancy guarantee of mirroring is relatively unreliable.Maybe someone with more experience in this area can change my mind, but if it were up to me, I would have configured the mirror drives as spares, and relied on a local HDD-based zpool for quick backup/restore capability. I imagine that would be a better solution, although it probably wouldn&#39;t have fit into tryingq&#39;s ideal 2U space."</p>

					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25874497">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Truly mind blowing being able to actually see the atoms align in an instant and the crystal structure just pop into existence.Hard to believe it’s not a computer model. I mean, I guess underneath there must be a hell of a lot of signal processing going on to render that video, but atomic-scale video is wild.Funny that it looks kinda like MPEGS online circa 1990s."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is incredibly cool:&gt; Two novel techniques, atomic-resolution real-time video and conical carbon nanotube confinement, allow researchers to view never-before-seen details about crystal formation. The observations confirm theoretical predictions about how salt crystals form and could inform general theories about the way in which crystal formation produces different ordered structures from an otherwise disordered chemical mixture.&gt; To hold samples in place, we use atom-thick carbon nanohorns, one of our previous inventions. With the stunning videos Sakakibara captured, we immediately noticed the opportunity to study the structural and statistical aspects of crystal nucleation in unprecedented detail.Creating shaped nucleation sites using carbon nanotubes (nanohorns?) sounds like a fascinating technology. I don&#39;t have access to the paper unfortunately - I&#39;m curious what other types of crystals could theoretically be grown with this technology. The authors mention graphite - what about silicon? Could it be used to grow more regular crystals for use in electronics? With fewer defects, I&#39;d imagine we could reduce the failure rate in manufacturing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; “Salt is just our first model substance to probe the fundamentals of nucleation events,” said University Professor Eiichi Nakamura. “Salt only crystallizes one way. But other molecules, such as carbon, can crystallize in multiple ways, leading to graphite or diamond. This is called polymorphism and no one has seen the early stages of the nucleation that leads to it. I hope our study provides the first step in understanding the mechanism of polymorphism.”I&#39;m amused that Chemists / Physicists also have the word &#34;Polymorphism&#34; and that it means something completely different from the programming term."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi all; I designed a site called Iconduck (https://iconduck.com).There are so many dope open source icon sets out there. I brought a bunch of them (132 so far) under one roof. I made them searchable (using typesense.org), and list out the license details and link back to the site or GitHub repo.I&#39;m not much of a designer, and it&#39;s just a first stab at the concept. It&#39;s been done, but I wanted to also build it API-first, since I know it would be useful to be able to search through them all for developers.I&#39;m always on the lookout for new icon libraries to include, and plan on making it easier to learn more about the designers themselves. If you have any ideas on icon sets or libraries to include please let me know in the comments :)"</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25864078">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has completed a regulation permitting low volume motor vehicle manufacturers to begin selling replica cars that resemble vehicles produced at least 25 years ago. Congress enacted a DeLorean Motor Company-backed bill backed by the Specialty Equipment Market Association (SEMA) DeLorean Motor Company, and others into law in 2015, which streamlined requirements for small automakers, but implementation was delayed while awaiting the NHTSA regulations. Companies like DeLorean will now be able to apply for authorization to produce and sell vehicles under this program.I assume this means they waive certain modern safety regulations in order to allow companies to make new cars (in low volume) that resemble old cars?&gt; That said, with EV’s becoming more mainstream, we’ve been considering switching to an all-electric as the future. It certainly makes for an easier path through emissions maze which still looms large over any internal combustion engine.That makes sense.  If ever there was a car that looks like it should be an EV, it&#39;s the Delorean.  They could even do a stickshift EV if they wanted to, though most car companies seem to not think it&#39;s worth the complexity/maintenance, and I get the impression that electric motors are hard on transmissions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"TBH I’m surprised Musk hasn’t bought them out yet and “released” a limited edition Model 3 with a DeLorian body kit for like $500,000... if Cyan can release a Volvo P1800 for 500K and you usually need to provide the 50 year old P1800 for them to convert and tune there clearly is a market for these things."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; 700k paintingsThis figure immediately reminded me of a very interesting EconTalk episode[0] on the management of art museums. The premises from the discussion (as I recall):- Art museums have more than 10x the number of pieces in their archives as they do on display. Some of this art will never be seen by the pubic.- When art galleries charge admission, patrons feel the need to &#34;get their money&#39;s worth&#34; so they rush to see as much of the exhibits as possible, without taking time to thoroughly enjoy anything.- The purpose of art is to be enjoyed. The above two points make this goal much harder.The conclusions:- Museums should be free admission and funded by selling pieces from the archive (really interesting discussion on how this is taboo for curators)The second-order effects:- Patrons can sit and enjoy a very small section of the museum instead of rushing through, since they can simply come back for more later- More people get to see fine art- Second- and third-tier museums start to gain access to better art, since they can simply buy it instead of waiting for estate donations (which go to larger museums)I think it&#39;s worth a listen.[0]: https://www.econtalk.org/michael-ohare-on-art-museums/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"People in the UK should know that the Tate Gallery, being a publicly-funded museum, are required to make any items in their collection available for you to see on request. When studying sculpture I was really interested in a 1972 piece by Marcel Broothaers called Tractatus Logico-Catalogicus and noticed that the Tate had it in their collection. I emailed them and set up a time to visit a warehouse in SE London, and they brought it out for me to look at it. It&#39;s so much better than seeing things in a packed gallery, let alone a packed Tate, and you get a real sense of what the work is like in the flesh, stripped of all the spectacle and didactic trash that generally surrounds works in somewhere like the Tate."</p>
