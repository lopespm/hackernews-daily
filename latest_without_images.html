								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Oh, this is exciting. The performance and latency is a huge variable though.For a lot of these experimental hacker-friendly devices, I&#39;m willing to tolerate a lot of compromises. Even here, the software, the out-of-the-box experience isn&#39;t really that important to me. Arguably, you can get away with even more compromise on a device like this than on something like the Pinephone. But it has to have amazing pen performance, or it&#39;s just not worth working with. Everything else except that is either fixable or something that probably isn&#39;t getting in the way of the core point of the device.IMO Remarkable got this right -- their software support is by many metrics quite bad (although I guess it&#39;s slowly started to improve). Their device handles PDFs kind of poorly from what I can tell. It&#39;s expensive. The interface seems slower and more laggy than many other EReaders. But none of that really matters, what matters is they have arguably the best pen latency and physical texturing on the E-ink market, and that writing on the device feels good.So the same thing applies here: the price seems completely reasonable to me, I have no issues with a $400 price tag. I&#39;d pay $600, the price isn&#39;t the issue. But I need to see videos and testimonial that the pen latency isn&#39;t just &#34;acceptable&#34;, but that it&#39;s really good. Otherwise it&#39;s not even worth $100.Writing experience is one of those things where once you get used to a lack of latency/offset, and used to a more accurate feel, it gets progressively harder and harder to go back to anything that&#39;s worse."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Looks like a direct competitor to the Remarkable[0] which I own, and is a great device. The Remarkable is also &#34;mostly&#34; open. The main binary running the UI of the system is proprietary, but the Linux system underneath is ssh-able, and the hacking community of the device is pretty active and large [1].Looking at the announcement page of the PineNote I&#39;m very excited! I&#39;m hoping the open software running on the PineNote will be comparable to the Remarkable, and if it is I&#39;m definitely going to be making the switch.As a side note, I&#39;m hoping maybe this encourages the Remarkable team to open source their proprietary binary. Their advantage here is definitely the hardware not the software.[0] https://remarkable.com/[1] https://github.com/reHackable/awesome-reMarkable"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a pretty sweet looking device. Even despite this call out “As for the actual user interface, we’re currently talking to the good folks at KDE and trying to figure out whether Plasma Mobile or regular Plasma (with panel-specific tweaks of course) will be the best fit for this particular device. As you can probably tell, this is an uncharted territory for all parties involved, but we’ll figure it out. Needless to say, the software isn’t finished – indeed, we don’t really even know yet what will work well with this technology and what won’t. It is just the beginning of our journey with e-ink technology, and it will take a long time and much effort to make the PineNote end-user worthy.” This still seems worthwhile to pre order if you’re a heavy reader and note taker.Anyone know how this compares with the remarkable?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There are two interesting (to me) books on Pixar - one is by the (tech) founder Ed Catmull and is good on the storytelling and hard work side, and a really good &#34;other side of the coin&#34; is by Lawrence Levy who Jobs brought in as &#34;the money guy&#34; to find a way to make Pixar profitable as they tried to land Toy Story - it goes from a little way into the pre-production of the film all the way to the IPO - and it really shines a light on the inner thinking.  No one really had a clue how to monetise things, the IPO was a huge risk etc etc.Fascinating all of it, But for me the big thing to contrast is how Ed Catmull described the IPO (how did Steve plan this, how did he know? I am axed at his business acumen) versus Levy (we were all terrified, movie studios refused to give us their business models, the IPO could have failed at any moment).In short there is always several sides to a story, and if anyone is confident of a future plan but has not done it twenty times before, they are faking it !"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t buy the whole premise about storytelling being the big thing.  In particular I think doing the thing is much much much much much more important than telling the story.  If you do the thing then the story tells itself.I was 1 of a team of 2 or 3 on every pitch in 2 or 3 separate processes to raise over 1bn dollars and make the company I worked for (OakNorth) the most valuable fintech in Europe at the time. We did about 30 investor meetings covering everyone in the PE world, some of the big tech investors, some key VCs, some family offices etc.  We ended up massively oversubscribed so and picked the investors we thought were the best fit. In every single pitch the most important things were:    1. your company should actually do something important/valuable.  Solve an important problem etc.
    2. you should have a plan for a future where the unit economics work, and you should know the plan inside and out
    3. you should have thought through something about how what your company does intersects with *this particular investor&#39;s* interests, and be able to articulate that clearly
    4. You should have clear asks - not just money for valuation but what else you&#39;re looking to get from them (strategic advice, intros, synergies with other companies in their portfolio etc).

The deck, pitch itself etc are much less important than doing something important and actually knowing what you&#39;re talking about. In particular, avoid the thought that you can hack the process with a slick pitch and a cool-looking deck.  It may take you to a first meeting, but it&#39;s not going to get you to close with anyone of substance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That way of boiling down Finding Nemo seems to miss why the story is designed that way. It doesn’t describe anything about what happens to Marlin as a character, just a few basic plot points, and then in the end he somehow learns that “love depends on trust”. Uh, ok.If you actually want to understand why Finding Nemo “consistently tugs at heartstrings worldwide”, Craig Mazin used it as his primary example in “How to write a movie”, episode 403 of Scriptnotes[1]. (TL;DR: the purpose of everything that happens in a movie is to expose the hero to as much agony as possible, so that the change they’re forced to go through feels real. I don’t know what that means for your startup pitch, though.)1: https://johnaugust.com/2019/scriptnotes-ep-403-how-to-write-..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In other HN comments on this subject I&#39;ve (hopefully) made it clear that I&#39;m not really in favor of this project of Apple&#39;s, and that there&#39;s a legitimate &#34;slippery slope&#34; argument to be made here. So I hope people will entertain a contrarian question without downvoting me into oblivion. :)Here&#39;s the thing I keep circling around: assume that bad actors, government or otherwise, want to target political dissidents using internet-enabled smartphones. The more we learn about the way Apple actually implemented this technology, the less likely it seems that it would make it radically easier for those bad actors to do so. For instance, the &#34;it only scans photos uploaded to iCloud&#34; element isn&#39;t just an arbitrary limitation that can be flipped with one line of code, as some folks seem to think; as Erik Neuenschwander, head of Privacy Engineering at Apple, explained in an interview on TechCrunch[1]:&gt; Our system involves both an on-device component where the voucher is created, but nothing is learned, and a server-side component, which is where that voucher is sent along with data coming to Apple service and processed across the account to learn if there are collections of illegal CSAM. That means that it is a service feature.Will this stop those bad actors if they&#39;re determined? No, of course not, but there are so many ways they can do it already. They&#39;ll get cloud storage providers to give them access. If they can&#39;t, they&#39;ll get network providers to give them access. And if those bad actors are, as many people fear, government actors, then they have tools far more potent than code: they have laws. It was illegal to export &#34;strong encryption&#34; for many years, remember? I&#39;ve seen multiple reports that European lawmakers are planning to require some kind of scanning for CSAM. If this goes into effect, technology isn&#39;t going to block those laws for you. Your Purism phone will either be forced to comply or be illegal.I wrote in a previous comment on this that one of Silicon Valley&#39;s original sins is that we tend to treat all problems as if they&#39;re engineering problems. Apple is treating CSAM as an engineering problem. Most of the discussion on HN about how horrible and wrong Apple is here still treats it as an engineering problem, though: well, you can get around this by just turning off iCloud Photos or never using Apple software or throwing your iPhone in the nearest lake and switching to Android, but only the right kind of Android, or maybe just never doing anything with computers again, which admittedly will probably be effective.Yet at the end of the day, this isn&#39;t an engineering problem. It&#39;s a policy problem. It&#39;s a governance problem. In the long run, we solve this, at least in liberal democracies, by voting people into office who understand technology, understand the value of personal encryption, and last but certainly not least, understand the value of, well, liberal democracy. I know that&#39;s easy to dismiss as Pollyannaism, but &#34;we need to protect ourselves from our own government&#34; has a pretty dismal track record historically. The entire point of having a liberal democracy is that we are the government, and we can pull it back from authoritarianism.The one thing that Apple is absolutely right about is that expanding what those hashes check for is a policy decision. Maybe where those hashes get checked isn&#39;t really what we need to be arguing about.[1]: https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/interview-apples-head-of-p..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Apple will publish a Knowledge Base article containing a root hash of the encrypted CSAM hash database included with each version of every Apple operating system that supports the feature. Additionally, users will be able to inspect the root hash of the en- crypted database present on their device, and compare it to the expected root hash in the Knowledge Base article.This is just security theater, they already sign the operating system images where the database reside. And there is no way to audit that the database is what they claim it is, doesn&#39;t contain multiple databases that can be activated under certain conditions, etc.&gt; This feature runs exclusively as part of the cloud storage pipeline for images being up- loaded to iCloud Photos and cannot act on any other image content on the deviceUntil a 1-line code change happens that hooks it into UIImage."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don’t like the idea of stuff running on my device, consuming my battery and data, when the only point is to see if I am doing something wrong?An analogy I can come up with is: the government hires people to visit your house every day, and while they’re there they need your resources (say, food, water, and electricity).  In other words, they use up some of the stuff you would otherwise be able to use only for yourself — constantly — and the only reason they’re there is to see if you’re doing anything wrong.  Why would you put up with this?"</p>

Though old coding exam questions would equally offer up some great material to push this thru it&#39;s paces."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Here is a link to the arXiv version of the paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00010Incidentally, I used to work in dynamics and Hagai is great to work with.  To give you a sense of him, I went to a conference on dynamics that he organized about six years ago, and he opened it with the following story:Many years ago, the philosopher Nasreddin was on his farm looking out into the distance and saw some people approaching.  He had heard that there were bandits in the area and became afraid that they would come, beat him, and steal all his things.  So Nasreddin ran away.  As he ran, he came to a graveyard, and there he found an open grave.  In case the bandits followed him, he decided to take off all his clothes, get in the grave, and pretend to be dead.It turned out that the men were not bandits, but were Nasreddin&#39;s friends.  They saw him run off and wondered where he was going and so followed him.  As they were walking through the graveyard, they came upon the open grave and saw Nasreddin lying there naked.  So they asked him, &#34;Nasreddin, why are you lying in this grave with all your clothes off?&#34;Nasreddin opened his eyes and saw it was his friends, and replied, &#34;My friends, there are some questions which have no answers.  All I can tell you is that I am here because of you, and you are here because of me.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"T-Mobile has had recurring data security deficiencies. I know because I served as CTO of the FCC&#39;s Enforcement Bureau, before returning to academia.In 2017, the FCC determined that T-Mobile had violated federal law in a data breach involving customer credit information [1]. There was reportedly no fine because Congress has imposed a strict one-year statute of limitations on FCC enforcement actions.In 2020, the FCC charged T-Mobile with again violating federal law in failing to protect customer location information [2]. The FCC proposed a $91.6M fine, widely criticized as insufficient at the time [3-4]. I don&#39;t believe the FCC has finalized or collected that penalty.There have been several other incidents, including in 2018 [5], 2019 [6], early 2020 [7], and late 2020 [8].I hope there has not been a new data breach. But if there has been, this is the latest in a pattern, and the incentives have to change.[1] https://www.nexttv.com/news/fcc-admonishes-t-mobile-breach-1...[2] https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-proposes-916m-fine-against-...[3] https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-20-27A4.pdf[4] https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-20-27A5.pdf[5] https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/24/17776836/tmobile-hack-dat...[6] https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/t-mobile-disc...[7] https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/t-mobile-data...[8] https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/t-mobile-data..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like companies like this should have to register a data breach like this in a national register, and then should someone become a victim of identity theft, the companies on that register associated with that person should bear the costs associated with that theft (importantly without the victim having to show that it was a direct result of that breach). E.g. John Smith ss#123-45-6789 (T-mobile, Experian) has a false refund filed in his name, $10k in legal costs associated with clearing his name, t-mobile and experian each owe him $5k…Until companies are held accountable for the negative externalities they are causing, this won’t end."</p>

I live in The Netherlands. I was more than 10 years ago customer of T-Mobile Austria.I immediately informed T-Systrms via their crappy contact form on their crappy website. After a couple of days I received an e-mail which I could not reply to, asking me to provide more proof that I was receiving someone else&#39;s emails through. It also said I can&#39;t reply directly to the email and I had to provide this info via their crappy contact form on their crappy website.I refused to do so, since I had already given them the name, address, and customer id of their new customer and it seemed that the procedure is going to be unnecesarily time consuming.After that I received emails about tracking of a package containing the hardware for the internet connection. Then I received an email that nobody was home to pick up the delivery and when the next attempt will be. UAnd utimately that the package was going to ve returned. After that I guess the customer got in touch with T-Systems and fixed the email error.Nobody from T-Systems contacted me asking to destroy the documents and emails containing someone else&#39;s personal data."</p>

They don&#39;t really care about you and it shows, also, they were kind of rude when I reported some bugs to them.I moved to typesense and it&#39;s a whole different world, their creators truly enjoy that you&#39;re using their product; same thing with sonic, Valerian is the kind of hacker you&#39;d want as a friend, super talented, super easy going, you could ask a completely dumb question on their GH and he takes the time to explain things to you at length. I know its open source, I know I didn&#39;t pay a dime, but for me, that kind of attitude makes it or break it. Plus, you actually get a superior product.1: https://typesense.org/2: https://github.com/valeriansaliou/sonic"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In my journey to learn Rust I sought for a person criticize my Rust skills, so I searched for a &#39;good first issue&#39; in GitHub, by writing a PR in Rust I could fullfil two dreams of mine
1. Learn Rust.
2. Having a code that I wrote run on large amount of devices across the world.Eventually I ended up on MeiliSearch repo, I fixed an interesting bug, and I must say that the maintainers were super nice across all the process, a couple of months after my contribution they sent hand written letters and a bunch of stickers to all of the project contributors, one of the nicest interactions I ever had on the internet (ironically the first PR that I wrote that got accepted involved one line of CSS, which is field I&#39;m proficient at)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The older and more experience I get the more I find myself turning into a complexity zealot, to a really extremist extent. Every time I see something introduced at any level that isn&#39;t 100% strictly necessary to the problem being solved it triggers a kind of accumulated PTSD is almost physically painful.I know everyone thinks they like simplicity but my observation is that about 95% of software developers have a complexity fetish. Literally any opportunity they get to introduce something over and above what is essential to the job they are doing they will do it. For many its almost built in as a part of their value system (if all I do is solve the basic problem then I&#39;m just a mediocre mundane developer right? I want to be a rock star who develops frameworks and invents new things that other people use).  And yet the epitome of genius in my mind is finding the solution that solves the problem without introducing anything at all.Again, I know 80% of the people reading my comments right here will nod their heads and identify with it and yet still go away and see themselves as exceptions to the rule and create another abstract class or define an optional configuration file or make their code automatically parse an extra environment variable with a regular expression or .... you get it....We had to add something to the database the other day. Big argument. Should be one to many? many to many? what if this or that happens? what if requirements change? You know what - for the requirement wa actually had it was solvable with a single integer field on an existing table. But this is a battle that has to be fought ... over and over and over ..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is one more level where you hate everything, but then embrace loving the people that make shit.I bought a new truck, and after putting 100 miles on it the transmission started acting strange. I take it in, and they don&#39;t know what is wrong with it. So, they are going to replace the entire transmission next week.Now, I could say &#34;oh, why did I buy that brand&#34; or be like &#34;lolz, these people are n00bs&#34;. Instead, I realize that they are making something at a massive scale and bad things will happen, so I&#39;ll accept the inconvenience and move on with my life. Shit happens, and that&#39;s life.I&#39;ve hated software for a long time because I value precision and reliability, but these are exceptionally hard to scale organizationally. Suppose you fix reliability today, well tomorrow&#39;s feature could just fuck it up.Now, I still hate software, but I come at with a mindset that software is an artifact of a culture which requires nurturing and love."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It goes both ways. I certainly hate un-needed complexity but somethings are just complex. Good examples are font rendering https://gankra.github.io/blah/text-hates-you/ and text input https://lord.io/text-editing-hates-you-too/  You think it&#39;s going to be easy. It&#39;s not. It just isn&#39;t.Often software is too simple. I just recently got my first &#34;Smart Lights&#34; (my mistake). I&#39;m using Apple Home to control them. I put 3 bulbs in a 3 bulb standing lamp. Home has no way to for me to designate those as a single lamp. To Home they are 3 lamps. The solution is supposed to be use normal bulbs and a smart switch. But that precludes being able to set the colors of the bulbs. In other words, they thought it was simple but it&#39;s not.It gets worse. At first I thought this would be cool, but now I realize if I have a house guest, they won&#39;t be able to turn on the lights if I left them off. Arguably, if the power is cut and comes back on, maybe the lights should default to full white? At least then, in an emergency they just work. But again, designing lights that do that would be more complexity, not less.I can even add another wrinkle. My Siri is set to Japanese. So, my English speaking house guests will not be able to ask for the lights to be turned on if I had a HomePod, which I don&#39;t. More complexity because the world is complex"</p>
