								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Plenty of skepticism in these comments. I&#39;ve been following CFS for a while and can present a point of view for why this time might be different.Fusion energy was actually making rapid progress in the latter half of the twentieth century, going from almost no power output in the fifties and sixties to a power output equal to 67% of input power with the JET reactor in 1997. By the eighties there was plenty of experimental evidence to describe the relationships between tokamak parameters and power output. Particularly that the gain is proportional to the radius to the power of 1.3 and the magnetic field cubed. The main caveat to this relationship was that we only had magnets that would go up to 5.5 Tesla, which implied we needed a tokamak radius of 6 meters or so in order to produce net energy.Well that 6 meter tokamak was designed in the eighties and is currently under construction. ITER, being so large, costs tens of billions of dollars and requires international collaboration; the size of the project has led to huge budget overruns and long delays. Recently however, there have been significant advances in high-temperature super conductors that can produce magnetic fields large enough that we (theoretically) only need a tokamak with a major radius of about 1.5 meters to produce net gain. This is where SPARC (the tokamak being built by the company in the article) comes in. The general idea is that since we have stronger magnets now, we can make a smaller, and therefore cheaper tokamak quickly.Small tokamaks do have downsides, namely that the heat flux through the walls of the device is so large that it will damage the tokamak. There have been breakthroughs with various divertor designs that can mitigate this, but to the best of my knowledge I&#39;m not sure that CFS has specified their divertor configuration.This was just a short summary of the presentation by Dennis Whyte given here [0]. I do not work in the fusion community.[0] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkpqA8yG9T4"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is exciting. Magnetic field strength is a key component for enabling magnetic confinement fusion. This is because energy gain and power density scales to the 3rd and 4th power with magnetic field strength but only ~linearly with reactor size. See following equations for more details: https://youtu.be/xJ2h3vbOag4?t=306So, why is this particular announcement exciting? There are 3 factors:1. This is a high temperature superconductor. I can&#39;t find any references, but as far as I remember the substrate they are using needs to be cooled to (WRONG, it was cooled to 20degK, see reply by MauranKilom) 60-70 degK to achieve super conductivity. Compare to magnets used in ITER which need to be cooled to 4degK. This is the difference between using relatively cheap liquid nitrogen vs liquid helium.2. Field strength of 20 Tesla is significantly higher than 13 Tesla used in ITER. Given that magnetic confinement fusion scales significantly better with field strength vs reactor size, this will enable much smaller reactor to be power  positive. See following links for more details on ITERs magnets: https://www.newscientist.com/article/2280763-worlds-most-pow... https://www.iter.org/newsline/-/27003. Finally, the magnet was assembled from 16 identical subassemblies, each of which used mass manufactured magnetic tape. This is significantly cheaper and more scalable than custom magnet design/manufacturing used by ITER.The kicker is how 3 of the factors above interact with the cost of the project. Stronger magnets allow smaller viable reactors. High temperature superconductors + smaller reactors allow for a much simpler and smaller cooling system. Smaller reactors + scalable magnet design further drives down the cost. Finally, cost of state of art mega projects scales somewhere between 3rd and 4th power with the size of the device. Combining all of the above factors, SPARC should be here significantly sooner than ITER and cost a tiny fraction (I would guesstimate that fraction to be between 1/100 and 1/10,000).edit: typos + looked at the cost of ITER and refined my cost fraction guesstimate + corrected some stuff based on the reply by MauranKilom."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These university press releases are always very positively framed. This one makes the new magnet seem incredibly promising and fusion seem like almost an inevitability now, but decades of failure have us conditioned for skepticism. What&#39;s the catch this time?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This reminds me of my (now dead) open source Dropbox alternative Syncany [1] and all the different storage plugins I made for it [2]. Long story short, a storage plugin only had to implement the API methods upload, download, list and delete, so you could literally use anything as a storage backend (FTP, SFTP, S3, WebDAV, ..).I made a few fun plugins that would encode data (after deduping, compressing and encrypting them) into PNG or BMP and store them on Flickr (which gave you 1TB of free storage for images) or Picasa (now Google Photos). It was actually relatively efficient and not slower than the other methods, and it looked super cool to have albums full of what looked like images of static. It was a blatant violation of their ToC, so obviously not serious.The code is still online, it&#39;s from 2014/2015. The Flickr plugin with the PNG encoder is here [3], and I&#39;m not entirely sure if I ever published the Picasa one.[1] https://www.syncany.org/[2] https://github.com/syncany?q=plugin[3] https://github.com/syncany/syncany-plugin-flickr/tree/develo..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I once made a music player similar to this. It converted music files into image files, and saved them to Flickr. One trick that I employed was that the output image files were also visually recognizable, featuring album covers and lyrics.[1][2] The way I used to hide information was pretty barbaric, but it was still a fun experiment.[1] https://www.flickr.com/photos/barosl/albums/7215763383971356...[2] https://github.com/barosl/flickr-music-player"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This has all its place on hacker news because it is a fun hack, but it&#39;s not at all practical. Not only it doesn&#39;t work in all browsers even fairly recent ones (service workers), but even when it works it necessitates javascript enabled, and imposes a non negligible additional load time. And more importantly, with the way it is recommended to use it using 404.html file as a &#34;catch all&#34;, it means all your pages are served as 404 errors, which can be a problem for a lot of things (starting with search engine indexing)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We should have some kind of dashboard tracking how many people die from terrorism, car crashes, heart disease, COVID, etc., and how much time and money we spend trying to prevent these deaths. We are just so terrible at evaluating risk, for some reason it is OK to waste everyone&#39;s time with over the top security to stop a tiny portion of terrorism deaths, while still being OK with high speed limits that kill thousands of people per year. Not that I&#39;m advocating for lower speed limits, just that there is a contradiction here.I bet that if instead of having people go through security at sporting events, you had them all do 20 push ups, you&#39;d save more people from dying of heart disease than would die of terrorism."</p>

But in Europe taking off a belt is often required while in the US it is not. In Budapest they stopped having us remove laptops from bags a bit ago.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"After getting a (non-DIY because as much as I like hobby electronics I have a tendency to scope creep my little projects straight into incompletion) about a year ago, my main learnings have been:- Cooking is insanely bad for the air in your house, even with an outside-venting hood. Any sort of medium-high heat cooking will spike the PM2.5 to multiple times that of the haziest days here in NYC, and with the windows shut it will stay elevated for hours after.- The 20&#34; box fan + MERV furnace filter hack is super effective for cutting down on the PM. A few days this July the wildfire smoke from the west coast settled on NYC and we had 40-70 ug/m3 PM2.5 outside. The box fan filter took it down to around 5 in a matter of minutes. I didn&#39;t even bother taping the filter to the fan.- My A/C system&#39;s ability to precisely hold the temperature within fractions of a degree of the thermostat setting is impressive.- With two people working from home in an old, unventilated-but-kinda-drafty ~700 square foot apartment, the only thing that gets the CO2 levels into &#34;drowsy&#34; territory (my original point of curiosity when buying the sensor) is running the gas oven for a while."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I did a similar thing -- set up AQ sensors in the house.I used the sps30 from sparkfun, CAD&#39;d up a panel mount, 3d printed it, built a wooden box for it + a pi, set up all the networking and hosting, and packaged my utils for debian.Anyway, the AQ is fine, HEPA filters work when in-line with the A/C, and there&#39;s nothing much to monitor even when AQ is mod/bad outside. Boring, but nice to know, and fun to learn all those new skills.Just don&#39;t burn incense."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I actually initially wanted to be on Coinbase’s side here, but after a quick google of “Howey test” and reading even just the introduction on Wikipedia, I cannot imagine how they don’t see the SEC’s reasoning about Lend wrt Howey. If you want to argue that Howey does not apply or fight the decision/lawsuit, then fine. But feigning ignorance of something a (non-legal expert) programmer can connect the dots of instantly just makes me feel like they’re playing a PR game. Seeing as they are already offering APY on staked Ethereum, I don’t see “concern” reflected in their actions. Seems like they are trying to get out to the public before the SEC does to farm some good will."</p>

These two cases are from 1946 and 1990.Trying to make out like Howey is some obscure precedent from decades ago which the SEC is nitpicking over. The Howey test is the test applied to determine if something is an investment contract."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"“We have no idea why the SEC intends to sue us! It is a complete mystery.”(Later in the post…)“All we’ve done is create a thing that people can trade which we are moving towards selling to investors against specific SEC advice to the contrary, but it is definitely not a security and as a result it is completely fine even though we have not complied with SEC regulations in any way with respect to it.”A mystery indeed…"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a little confused by the framing of this article, because LAPD actually can&#39;t demand the social media information of everyone they stop. They can ask, and it is problematic that they do since many of the people they stop won&#39;t realize that they can simply decline, but the police have basically no authority in the general case to require it.Without individualized suspicion, the police can barely even ask for ID. They&#39;ve lost cases over it. Even with suspicion, it&#39;s unlikely that they can forcefully demand social media information. (They can, with sufficient evidence, arrest you and conduct a search of your person to try to uncover it, but arrests are a big deal; they can&#39;t dragnet arrest.)With that in mind, I assume the productive article to write here is the one framed around informing people that they shouldn&#39;t cooperate with requests like these."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Zig is a very interesting language. You are able to do thing that would require wizard level skills in C with simple plain language construct. Like serializing/deserializing an enum variants over the wire for example in the most efficient way (look at std.json.{parser, stringify} [0]).&gt; soon we’ll also have a package managerThis. If they succeed to do this (and I have my doubts) it will be a paradigm shift for low-level &#34;system&#34; programming.Let&#39;s hope this is not vaporware.Finally, it&#39;s relatively easy to contribute to Zig. Andrew Kelley is very opinionated on where the language should go with an emphasis on simplicity which sometimes can make things awkward but he is also persuasive and welcoming. I have been using Zig for a month and I am still positively surprised so he must be onto something.[0]: https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/master/lib/std/json.zig#..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The build tooling of Zig is very impressive. I&#39;m a sponsor of the project not necessarily because of the language itself, but because it surely has the potential to make waves in some way or another (edit: though the language itself is also quite interesting).One thing I wish the blog post had brought up is testing! Zig has some great tooling around tests, and that is something sorely lacking in a lot of C projects. If nothing else, you can pretty easily use Zig to simply write some tests for a C project! Even that would be a big improvement to the ecosystem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Generally speaking, what killed C++/C for me is the absolute insanity that comes with it&#39;s build systems/third party dependency management.I feel like the notoriety that C++ gets for it&#39;s absurd complexity comes not from variadic template metaprogramming/rvalue references/unique_ptr or whatever, but the absolutely humongous effort needed to understand automake/CMake/autotools just to build other people&#39;s code (god forbid on a different platform than the original author)."</p>

This only compares average time on app.• It could also be totally skewed, if let&#39;s say 100M people spend 2h/day on average on Youtube, and 1k (a tiny amount) spend 2.5h/day on average on Tiktok, that&#39;d be already good enough to say &#34;average time per user spent on the apps is higher for TikTok&#34;.I haven&#39;t read the report, but wanted to point out these two warnings. As we say in Spanish, the easiest way to lie is with statistics. And of course any half-decent PR person will take any numbers and blow it up into a headline, so tread with caution.(Absolutely not wanting to discount on Tiktok, which has been growing at an incredible rate, just wanted to say that the wording on how exactly they are &#34;winning&#34; sounded a bit contrieved)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Patent lawyer here.  There is a lot of dubious stuff already in this thread, so be careful with legal opinions from people on the internet.Some relevant claim language is below.  Of course a lot of this stuff has been known for a while, but you have to have everything together--or an evidenced argument that combining things in this way would have been obvious--before you can conclude anything about the validity of the patent.  And on unpatentable subject matter (i.e., being an abstract idea), there is a pretty good argument that this improves the functionality of the computer, not just uses a computer to do something known, which recent cases have started using as the de facto dividing line.1. A system comprising:
one or more computer processors;
one or more computer memories;
a set of instructions incorporated into the one or more computer memories, the set of instructions configuring the one or more computer processors to perform operations for automatically managing a set of memory chunks within the one or more computer memories at runtime for a computer application, the operations comprising:
receiving a set of entities from the computer application, each of the set of entities including a set of components, wherein each component of the set of components has one type of a set of types;
classifying the set of entities into a set of archetypes, each archetype representing a different count of the set of components or a different combination of types of the set of components relative to other archetypes of the set of archetypes;
based on a determination that one of the set of archetypes corresponds to a new archetype, building a new memory chunk, adding the new memory chunk to the set of memory chunks, and populating the new memory chunk, wherein the populating of the new memory chunk includes adding data from the set of components included in one or more entities of the set of entities that are classified under the new archetype, the adding of the data including contiguously adding the data to ends of a set of component data arrays included in the new memory chunk, each of the set of data arrays included in the new memory chunk corresponding to a respective component of the set of components included in the one or more entities that are classified under the new archetype."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Setting aside whether or not this patent is silly or abstract or obvious or anything else, I have one important question: what does Unity plan to do with this?Most big tech companies have a constant stream of patent applications, many of which are granted. But they rarely sue over 99% of them. Sure, Amazon had one-click for however many years and they cared about it. But the other tens of thousands of patents Amazon owns (a couple of which have my name on them as &#39;inventor&#39;) are never going to see a court room.Why do they patent everything? So that patent trolls can&#39;t patent it first and then sue them for patent violations. It&#39;s a defensive patent.Is ECS going to be Unity&#39;s &#34;This is ours, no one else can use it without paying us&#34; lawsuit-generating patent? I doubt it. They know they&#39;d lose in court eventually, and along the way the entire industry would stop doing business with them. It would be a complete lose-lose move.On the other hand, now that Unity owns this patent, no patent troll can go and patent ECS then start suing small-studio Unity customers, like parasites leaching off the success of Unity."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ironically, Unity&#39;s ECS development effort has gone radio-silent in the last few months.  Their latest versions of the Unity Editor (2021.1+) are no longer compatible with ECS, and Unity&#39;s forum reps have not responded to the many game devs left in limbo and begging for info or an update.Something with ECS development is clearly going haywire, and the silence from the Unity people is troubling."</p>
