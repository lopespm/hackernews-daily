There&#39;s a blog post with the technical details if you&#39;re curious about how it works and whose work it builds on: https://blog.persistent.info/2022/03/blog-post.htmlThere are also a couple of variants that boot either System 7.5.3 or KanjiTalk 7.5.3 (the Japanese version of MacOS): https://system7.app/ and https://kanjitalk7.app/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What does one have to do to get as clear and pretty of a UI as that on the modern desktop OSes? Everyone switched from bitmaps to vectors over a decade ago and now everything is fuzzy, antialiased, scalable, flat, hard to make out.Of course you can always run dwm on linux with a hodgepodge of makeshift utility apps, write your own keybinds to set your brightness and volume and other such inanities, but in order to get a &#39;complete&#39; desktop experience you kinda have to opt-in to GNOME/KDE which are trying to do the same things as Apple or Microsoft, aesthetically speaking. And tough luck if you actually use Apple or Microsoft to begin with. I tried running bug.n and it seems to not work in win10, let alone win11."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This took me on a trip down memory lane back to my days in elementary school. I recall our class going to the computer lab once a week and having an hour to spend on an iMac G3, of which some were on OS8 and others OS9. Going back even further to kindergarten, our logins on those Macs were forced to use a simplified UI that displayed only icons/tiles of applications -- no browsing files or anything sophisticated from what I remember (edit: looks like they were called &#34;Panels&#34;) [0]. The Incredible Machine [1] was what I personally looked forward to playing most. I&#39;m sure nostalgia plays a big role in the feeling I get when toying around with emulators like this, but I&#39;m also convinced that the simplicity, curiosity, and novelty of computing in the late 90s/early 2000s is something that I may never be able to replicate again in my lifetime.[0] http://toastytech.com/guis/macos9users.png[1] https://macintoshgarden.org/games/the-incredible-machine-3"</p>

Calculating a minimal perfect hash by creating acyclic random graphs. This conjecture gives now tresholds when to stop trying creating random graphs and start afresh.This eg is needed for large perfect hashes in gperf or integer sets in compilers, such as eg. for C switch statements with Unicode. switch in C is only efficient for dense tables, but not sparse. sparse tables are linear, but could be constant. A switch in Pascal was constant, but so far GCC and llvm didn&#39;t care. gperf neither.see http://ilan.schnell-web.net/prog/perfect-hash/algo.html and http://programming.sirrida.de/hashing.html#c_case_of_string"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From the original letter:  While well-intentioned, we believe that many of the changes proposed by the CMF are deeply misguided and will disproportionately harm under-resourced students. Adopting them would result in a student population that is less prepared to succeed in STEM and other 4-year quantitative degrees in college.  The CMF states that &#39;many students, parents, and teachers encourage acceleration beginning in grade eight (or sooner) because of mistaken beliefs that Calculus is an important high school goal.&#39;

The updated CMF looks better, but I just don&#39;t see how an educator who knows math or how to teach math could come to such a conclusion (that Calculus should not be a goal). If it is well-intentioned, what was the intention... to dumb down math in high school? Perhaps we need to educate those who are coming up with the math frameworks in math and science, or to get people who care on the California Department of Education?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"SF CA resident, parent of two school age children chiming in. The direction with math seems pretty dismal, in that as of right now, everyone is singly tracked together for math through freshman year of high school. This results in children who have higher aptitudes[1] to not be well served by schools. The majority of people I know who have the means opt out of the public school system, which probably makes the problem worse generally but solves a pain point for them.[1] - I take it as a fact that different people have different talent levels for different things, but not everyone agrees with that, and disagreement on this point is a big driver (but not the only driver) in the &#34;everyone gets exactly the same&#34; approach that is trending now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Something is rotten in the state of academia when looking at the evidence there are mathematicians, scientists and social scientists standing bravely in favour of a high bar and a quality education program in mathematics.On the other side of the argument you have people from the Department of Education who specialize in Mathematics Education who seem happy to lower the bar as far as possible in the name of equality.When I was in University the Department of Education was the most woke department on campus, except for perhaps the Department of Gender Studies. We are now seeing policies that favour wokeness ahead of the best interests of the students affected by the policies."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi, all.  Author here.  Thanks for all the great feedback.I&#39;ve learned a lot from your comments and pointers.The Zed project is broader than &#34;a jq alternative&#34; and my bad for trying out this initial positioning.  I do know there are a lot of people out there who find jq really confusing, but it&#39;s clear if you become an expert, my arguments don&#39;t hold water.We&#39;ve had great feedback from many of our users who are really productive with the blend of search, analytics, and data discovery in the Zed language, and who find manipulating eclectic data in the ZNG format to be really easy.Anyway, we&#39;ll write more about these other aspects of the Zed project in the coming weeks and months, and in the meantime, if you find any of this intriguing and want to kick the tires, feel free to hop on our slack with questions/feedback or file GitHub issues if you have ideas for improvements or find bugs.Thanks a million!https://github.com/brimdata/zed

								<p class="story__comment_others">"jq is incredibly powerful and I&#39;m using it more and more. Even better, there is a whole ecosystem of tools that are similar or work in conjunction with jq:* jq (a great JSON-wrangling tool)* jc (convert various tools’ output into JSON)* jo (create JSON objects)* yq (like jq, but for YAML)* fq (like jq, but for binary)* htmlq (like jq, but for HTML)List shamelessly stolen from Julia Evans[1]. For live links see her page.Just a few days ago I needed to quickly extract all JWT token expiration dates from a network capture. This is what I came up with:    fq &#39;grep(&#34;Authorization: Bearer.*&#34; ) | print&#39; server.pcap | grep -o &#39;ey.*$&#39; | sort | uniq | \
    jq -R &#39;[split(&#34;.&#34;) | select(length &gt; 0) | .[0],.[1] | gsub(&#34;-&#34;;&#34;+&#34;) | gsub(&#34;_&#34;;&#34;/&#34;) | @base64d | fromjson]&#39; | \
   jq &#39;.[1]&#39; | jq &#39;.exp&#39; | xargs -n1 -I! date &#39;+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S&#39; -d @! 

It&#39;s not a beauty but I find the fact that you can do it in one line, with proper parsing and no regex trickery, remarkable.[1] https://jvns.ca/blog/2022/04/12/a-list-of-new-ish--command-l..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Whenever jq comes up I feel obligated to mention &#39;gron&#39;[1]. If all you&#39;re doing is trying to grep some deeply nested field, it&#39;s way easier with gron, IMHO.[1] https://github.com/tomnomnom/gron"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wish that LineageOS could accept the &#34;signature spoofing&#34; patch that is needed for microg (possibly with a toggle switch that would be &#34;off&#34; by default), so that we could avoid the need for the less-frequently-updated https://lineage.microg.org/ and properly install apps from Play Store without the Google Service Framework (that essentially give root access to Google on your smartphone).(and actually I also wish they could implement the shims developed by https://grapheneos.org/usage#sandboxed-google-play in order to sandbox the google play services, so that the user could choose between approach 1 (microg with signature spoofing) and approach 2 (sandboxed GSF) on any smartphone supported by LineageOS (grapheneos only supports Pixel phones due to their ability to relock the bootloader))"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just switched to LineageOS 18 w/ MicroG and oh my lord is this stuff still complicated. I&#39;m fairly familiar with this stuff and yet still it took me many hours to set everything up correctly. To be clear, this is not the fault of LineageOS, this is simply the state of the FOSS Android environment and the fact that Google has no interest in supporting this setup whatsoever, to put it mildly. Not only is it complicated, it also seems to change pretty much every year.First the question is how to transfer all your application data, for which there still seems to be no surefire way. I settled on &#34;Neo Backup&#34;, which mostly worked fine, except for Signal (of course...), and the darned Microsoft Authenticator.So first unlock the bootloader (good luck), then you need to find the correct TWRP for your phone (and careful with 32/64 bit) and flash it via fastboot.Then I flashed LineageOS, which worked fine. Luckily I found an image which already had the signature spoofing patch included, so I didn&#39;t have to worry about that. How do you get root? SuperSU? XPosed? Magisk? OK it seems everybody&#39;s using Magisk nowadays. OK, flashing worked fine, but now, how do you get MicroG on it? If you look at the MicroG homepage, you might think you can just install it with F-Droid, and you actually can, but many things won&#39;t work (like FCM notifications). It needs to be a system app. I tried using the F-Droid Priviliged Extension, flashed it via TWRP, which seemed to work fine but actually wasn&#39;t installed and not working at all. Now what? There&#39;s a multitude of information in forums what to do. Some say to flash NanoDroid, but the last release was in January 2021, it seems it&#39;s not updated anymore? I settled on the &#34;MicroG installer revived&#34; Magisk module, which worked fine (btw, there&#39;s no curated Magisk module repo anymore, you have to search the web and hope you find something that&#39;s not malicious).Of course my banking apps refuse to run because &#34;U ROOTED UR PHONE&#34;, I search for Magisk Hide, it doesn&#39;t exist anymore, now you need to configure a &#34;Zygisk deny list&#34;, whatever that is. Then I also need to hide the Magisk app, my banking works now thank you very much. FCM notifications also work after I uninstall and reinstall my apps which need it...To be clear: I&#39;m eternally grateful to all the developers who make this possible in their spare time. This is not their fault."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s nice to see that Lineage OS is still a prominent alternative OS. Back when I couldn&#39;t afford new smartphones, it would allow me to keep years old devices on relatively new software (these were the CyanogenMod days). Using it opened my eyes to tinkering and the possibility of a de-googled digital life. It&#39;s a shame that due to the ongoing 3G shutdown, people won&#39;t be able to keep old devices working."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I switched from Linux Mint desktop to an M1 Air last year.Performance-wise, the M1 is very impressive, probably feels about 80% as fast as my 6 year old desktop (that sounds like snark, but it isn&#39;t). Meanwhile, the battery life is insane (I&#39;ve never brought the charger anywhere but my desk, and will often use it for a week out and about).I opted for the Magic Keyboard and Magic Touchpad, because I had a lot of trouble with everything else.I could not get a mouse setup that worked (I&#39;m strictly no acceleration, and macOS&#39;s acceleration was literally making my arm ache).I switched because I stopped being a fulltime developer, my main machine was getting old (6 years), and macOS has good MS Office support.Overall I&#39;d say I&#39;m about 70% efficient vs on Linux, a bit less so when in active development. The mobility makes up for it, and efficiency just isn&#39;t as important to my day-to-day for now.Many of my gripes are listed elsewhere, but things like middle-click paste is something that is easy to write off but was actually a gigantic part of my process. Also, the fact that everything I want to tweak requires buying an app?I had to pay for an app in order to properly emulate middle clicks on the touchpad! That&#39;s bonkers!I&#39;ll leave this final tidbit though:On Linux:* Open Spotify* Press play button on keyboard* Spotify playsOn Mac:* Open Spotify* Press play button on keyboard* Apple Music opens ??????"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"2 of these 3 things, I have done multiple times on a Mac.  Mounting NFS is natively supported in macOS and has been for nearly a decade.  Mounting SSH is supported by 3rd-party tools, yes, but they&#39;re the same cross-platform 3rd-party tool you&#39;d use in Linux... sshfs, which is built on top of FUSE, which is something you can install on a Mac and is not installed by default in most Linux distributions (although fair enough it&#39;s installed by default on Ubuntu).The only thing I wasn&#39;t familiar with is MTP, which is apparently a Windows-specific protocol that Microsoft forced into the USB standard in later versions, and as far as I know across decades of using Linux, BSD, Windows, and macOS across multiple computers on the same network with shared peripherals I&#39;ve never even used this protocol.What&#39;s the complaint again?OS choice is mostly a personal preference.  As far as I am personally concerned, FreeBSD is the best OS possible to use, and macOS is second best.  But I don&#39;t write blog posts telling people that their preference is incapable of doing things my preference is capable of doing, and if I were to do so, I&#39;d at least do my research first to make sure it was correct."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Read MTP devices&gt; Mount an SSH or NFS driveI know fanboy debates are tiresome, but... I really do struggle to comprehend taking a device that can&#39;t do these things seriously as a computer.As a toy yes, or as a specialised tool for video or audio rendering, which... fair enough. But moving bytes is something any general purpose computing device should be good at. It&#39;s almost something you have to actively design out. It&#39;s certainly a deliberate, non-budget-constrained choice from Cupertino to be bad at this.Crap like &#34;should Apple be [scanning for CSAM | scanning for copyright | scanning for anti-CCP | whatever I&#39;ve almost stopped caring ] before uploading to iCloud?&#34; exists primarily because the devices are so bad at moving bytes around without relying on iCloud."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Well done. That&#39;s a respectable number of sales for your first year!The economics of self publishing is interesting. When I think back on
my first book I count at least 5 years research that enabled me to be
able to write it, 3 years writing it and then many years selling the
thing around industry.  By a pessimistic account I was about £500k
down :) Like you, the first year I sold about 500. Unlike online
fulfilment today, I spent that time stuffing envelopes, staring at a
slowly shrinking pile of boxes in the corner of my study, printing
labels, with occasional trips to the post-office. It was actually
work, and many times I thought &#39;this is crazy&#39;. It doubled for two
more years until dealing with the orders actually became too much
(while doing a &#34;real job&#34;).On the other hand, it got me a string of well paying jobs, established
me as the go-to consultant in a niche, invitations to talk and teach
all around the world, and basically transformed my career. So putting
a &#34;net profit&#34; number to it seems unfathomable. Each book you write,
if researched from scratch, is kinda equivalent to a PhD.What happened next is that I sold the title, from my own publishing
company to a large publisher (MIT). Publishers don&#39;t take many risks
these days, but they will buy a book that already has reasonable
number of sales as a going concern. The advantage is that all
mechanics and business is suddenly off your hands. Without an advance
to pay back you then have a modest income stream and time to write the
next book.Another effect of being a semi-professional writer, as a side gig, is
that other people want to pay you to edit, typeset, and review
works. Learning LaTeX and various markups and text processing tools
has been a huge gift. That can be quite fun if you&#39;re in a vibrant
field that genuinely interests you. And you don&#39;t have to be
associated with academia or a big-name institution for that to
work. In fact I&#39;d say that academics these days never have time for
writing and that most other successful authors I know are independent.I hope your book takes off even more, but right now I think you can
count 600 sales in the first year as a definite success!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My own experience convinces me there are many extra benefits to having written a book. My first book has been out for 4.5 years now. I know many people on Hacker News have read it and I&#39;m grateful to all of you.I&#39;ve enjoyed getting emails about it. Especially regarding &#34;badly managed startups&#34; and  &#34;abusive bosses&#34; many of you have reached out to share similar stories. Maybe at some point I&#39;ll do a blog post that collects some of those email stories. Some people thought I was destroying my career by revealing the dark side of startups, but some entrepreneurs appreciate my realism and practicality, so I&#39;ve gotten three very lucrative consulting jobs, thanks to that first book. And, surprisingly, the book has gotten more and more popular. It sold more this last year than it sold during its first two years. I assume that at some point the book will seem dated and obsolete, but at least for now it still strikes people as current, so the benefits of writing that book continue to pay dividends."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I sold around 300 in my first year (which ended recently), which is much less than the other book I wrote via my publisher. Yet, even though it is sold at a lesser price, my self-published book made almost more money. This is essentially because the percentage I make on every sales with my publisher is really low (10%). So for my next book, I&#39;ll self publish as well.(the book btw https://securityhandbook.io/)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Happy to see “secretlang” out in the open! I have been following development from afar and really like the idea of a “simple” take on a language, but with a lot of wisdom and affordances added since the state of the world back in 1972. In short, Hare seems to be a language that I really should like and I want to take it for a spin.What I find a bit confusing though is the licensing. I belong to the “BSD school”, but can at least claim that I understand (and respect) how GNU looks at things. Looking at Hare’s licensing [1], I am somewhat stumped and my usual modes of thinking no longer apply. What is the threat that warrants this level of complexity? A commercial fork? A community fork? Proprietary drivers? Are these really realistic enough threats to warrant this level of license complexity rather than just stamping ISC and CC-BY on the whole thing and not worry about forks at all? Yes, there is some writing in the README, but perhaps I am too thick to “get it”?[1]: https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/hare#licensingLastly, a sanity check, am I reacting too strongly to this if I feel that it has a bit of chilling effect in terms of my excitement?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Tagged union type seems a defining feature of Hare to me. It is not exactly &#34;tagged&#34; in the sense that it internally has tags but users don&#39;t explicitly see them [1]. This kind of types are normally headaches for language designers (cf. polymorphic variants in OCaml), but the Hare type system is simple enough that it doesn&#39;t pose a significant problem. In turn it gives an intuitive model of conversion; you don&#39;t have to convert from, say, one type of error to another type of error. Zig error type is also similar in this aspect, but it is not as general as Hare&#39;s tagged union type.[1] I really want to refer this as to &#34;untagged&#34; union type, but of course this will cause a confusion with C-style unsafe unions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Since the language is officially announced now, here&#39;s an interesting analysis on the language: https://tilde.team/~kiedtl/blog/hare/Personally I&#39;m very interesting in playing with it. Generics, functional programming constructs, and a lot of the syntactic sugar you find in modern languages have their uses but I think there&#39;s a lot of merit to the idea that you might not want them in a systems language. I think cleaning up some of C&#39;s rough edges and providing batteries while keeping things extremely simple and clear is very compelling. I&#39;m also appreciative that it doesn&#39;t seem overly opinionated where it doesn&#39;t need to be.It&#39;s kind of a bummer that there&#39;s no MacOS support so I&#39;ll have to SSH into my linux box to play with it. I hope the language takes off and support for other platforms materializes. Congratulations to everyone who worked on this."</p>
