								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Amazon founder and former CEO Jeff Bezos saw his warehouse workforce as necessary but replaceable, and feared that workers who remained at the company too long would turn complacent or, worse, disgruntled, according to reporting by the New York Times.Wow.  Think about what this is really saying: Amazon adopts the explicit policy of not wanting their workers to stay on long enough to figure out that they are getting a bad deal.So it&#39;s not that they are running out of people to hire, it&#39;s that they are running out of people who have not yet figured out that working for Amazon is a bad deal.Now I understand why I&#39;ve been seeing so many commercials lately about how great it is to work for Amazon."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this article might bury the lede a bit:&gt;Walmart is offering some workers with past warehouse experience as much as $25 an hour. An Amazon executive told Reuters in late 2021 that the company was bumping the average starting wage for new hires in the US to more than $18 an hour, attributing the decision to intense competition among employers.People used to work for Amazon warehouses in the 2010s because $15/hr was a much better wage than they could find elsewhere in their geographic location.After the pandemic and ongoing inflation, it&#39;s not difficult to find easier work which pays better. Amazon responded with a token raise that doesn&#39;t even cover CoL adjustments, but history shows that they need to pay well above market rates to hire the quantity of people that they need.It&#39;s funny to see this dynamic at a time when the federal minimum wage is still stuck at $7.25/hr."</p>

If they don&#39;t like you, they are free to fire you (within legal bounds).

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a sucker for good little microinteractions. The author&#39;s checkbox may not be one of those, as it seems a bit overdone, but I&#39;d have to try it to be sure. It&#39;s easy to go too far.But, some other examples that I love:• https://www.joshwcomeau.com/animation/3d-button The red &#34;push me&#34; button is great, but also check out the sun/moon icon near the top right!• https://www.jam3.com/#contact The hover states on the buttons.• https://citymapper.com The top-left hamburger icon.(I also happen to be quite proud of the hover states on my own site: https://jonathanalland.com/)Making this type of stuff is definitely what I miss most about working in web design."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The animations on things like this can be cute and fun the first time, but man they can get annoying if they&#39;re constant and can&#39;t be skipped. Hearthstone is an example of this; there&#39;s tons of cute animations for the various cards, but they can take way too long.Hiding &#34;no animations&#34; for power users under accessibility is a great way to go."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s pretty cool! As experiments I really love andy.works&#39; work. I appreciate what he&#39;s trying to accomplish. And I think he&#39;s on to something with the idea. But the execution is always a little off to me.I just don&#39;t find this checkbox all that satisfying. Why? The thing I find satisfying about checkboxes is the same as any switch – the click. On/off. It&#39;s snappy. I don&#39;t think about it. Click... click... click click!So this grandiose check animation is taking something inherently snappy and prolonging it to its own defeat. Even the sound effect is like an ethereal chime or something, rather than a snap. The scale is super big for the actual space of the phone. The animation too long. I also don&#39;t like the angle of the 3D checkmark itself. It&#39;s not really oblique, not really at any sort of satisfying geometric angle? I can live with that though.Anyway really cool work. Wish it were more satisfying."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hello, author here! As the website says, the compiler itself is still in a very early state where basic things like functions, types, traits, inference, monomorphisation, and codegen are implemented. The fun stuff of algebraic effects, lifetime inference, and refinement types are not however. Though I can elaborate on implementation strategies of these for anyone curious. For example, algebraic effects in existing languages can be quite slow at runtime due to the use of continuations, the translation to a monad stack, and/or dynamically finding handlers at runtime. It is my plan to monomorphise them away and inline all these cases as in the following paper (1). With this, handlers are inlined into functions, continuations are normal closures, and continuations that aren&#39;t called multiple times are inlined.(1) Zero-cost Effect Handlers by Staging:
http://ps.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/publications/schuster1..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I avidly follow descendants of Scheme and Haskell (I figured out for example how to build Idris native on an M1 Mac), and I plan to follow Ante. I just spent $5k of lunch money on an M1 Ultra Mac Studio, to use as a math compute server. How do I keep it busy? Haskell. My &#34;Hello world&#34; parallel benchmark, using reverse search to enumerate the 66,960,965,307 atomic lattices on six atoms, took 14 hours in 2009. It now takes four minutes.I&#39;d love to start again with a new, small language. I love Haskell, but it&#39;s decades old, and one struggles to work with it without being torn apart by the gravitational tides of the black hole at the center of its galaxy. All jokes aside, Haskell really does reward a PhD in category theory, or the self-taught equivalent later.Functional languages make parallelism easier, and Haskell has put particular effort into this: Adding a dozen lines to a program can keep the 16 performance cores of my Mac Studio running full tilt. I have yet to read any account of how someone else&#39;s favorite language makes parallelism easy, that is aware of the comparison with Haskell. If I thought there was a reasonable alternative, I&#39;d jump at trying it.Rust appeals because it replaces GC with modern control of allocation lifetimes. I love how Ante will also explore this. I use cyclic data structures; how one handles this functionally, and how one handles this using reference counting, is exactly the same problem.Parallelism should be the first consideration, designing any new language in 2022. Parallelism is the reason I keep using Haskell, despite newer alternatives. Any language that runs on a single core is a toy. This is a plea!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The syntax looks a little funky to me but it&#39;s still quite interesting. Is there a reason why you would make fn(1) and fn 1 equivalent? For me personally it makes readability worse and looks strange when chaining functions like in their last example on their landing page.On mobile horizontal scrolling through the code snippets will trigger switching to the next snippet on my phone."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"After a rather dismal first couple of runs I read the blog post for some hints. The best I found was to try to raise rates during the good times so there is wiggle room during downturns. I was able to get 443,904 by raising to over 10% during the initial prosperity period and was able to cut rates in half as soon as there was a crash. Ultimately I stabilized at around 3.5%. As of the time of this post I think that is the highest or close to highest score, only slightly higher than those that did a constant -0.5%.I’ve always been apprehensive of how low interest rates dropped around 9/11 and nobody had the political courage to raise them after that, leaving little room for leverage. What I have learned from racing games is that in order to win, it’s not all about holding down the gas pedal the hardest. Its about keeping on the track first, which requires lower speeds to navigate complexity, and only using max speed in straightaways.Or to quote the eminent Charlie Sheen, right after his infamous ’banging 7 gram rocks’ he said, “I only have one speed, I only have one gear: GO.” History tells how well that worked out.That may work on a straightaway, but in this world, there’s people and there’s pandemics and wars and politics. Had rates been at a higher level they could have been slashed at the start of the pandemic, but there was no room to drop at that point."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I made this game in order to try to wrap my head around central banks, inflation and macroeconomics, in order to get a better understanding of the aftermath of the global financial crisis and the current period of high inflation.Here is a blog post that goes into further details: https://benoitessiambre.com/simcb.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I tried to keep inflation between 1.5-2% for the first 50 months and then decided to find out what happens if I YOLO permanently fix the interest rate to -0.5%.After the 240 months I somehow ended with GDP 442999 and 1.53% inflation.How come? Shouldn&#39;t I have a runaway inflation?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The biggest problem with GNOME right now is Gtk3 and gtkfilechooserwidget.c. It is so spaghetti and so many things rely on it that no one at GNOME is willing to work on it for fear of breaking something. And for the same reason they won&#39;t accept drive-by patches. It is, effectively, frozen broken, and has been for many years. This applies to any attempt to add thumbnails to the file chooser but there are far worse, actual bugs, beyond the lack of thumbnails.As of right now if you File-&gt;Open in any program using modern Gtk3 and try to paste a file path in you&#39;ll get an error instead of pasting your filepath in a text field to open, &#34;The folder contents could not be displayed\nOperation not supported&#34; http://erewhon.superkuh.com/gtkfilechooserwidget-paste-fail....It&#39;s unfixable behavior because the GNOME devs stopped respecting their own gsettings, org.gtk.Settings.FileChooser location-mode, to FORCE the path-bar experience on everyone. Because no one needs to type file paths, apparently. So why bother respecting the settings for path-bar or filename-entry? Their demographic doesn&#39;t care. Unfortunately gtk3 is used by far more than GNOME&#39;s demographic.They have fixed this bug in gtk4, for all the good that does."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My top gtk3/gnome 30 wtfs:- the (all too well-known) file picker issue where when you type something it interprets it as file  name filter rather than, you know, the file name you want to save under- missing top menu (but a bar is still there wasting space for a ... clock wtf)- general window positioning; like, if you open an app, rather than just opening a window as new top window, gnome opens it behind others and pushes a notification &#34;FF is ready&#34; wtf- mainstream desktop apps not ported to dark mode, so those icons look even more puzzlingI could go on, but I&#39;m definitely leaving gnome/gtk apps behind. I&#39;ve eyed KDE Plasma which could give me everything I ever wanted from a DE, but I was using Ubuntu/gnome because it was mainstream enough that everything just works OOTB. I&#39;m also totally not looking forward to wayland, containerize-all-the-things such that basic file workflows stop working, and other attitudes, all the while the apps I&#39;m using are exactly the same I&#39;ve used 15 or 20 years ago, without new ones coming.I think I&#39;m going back to Mac."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Gnome people basically looked as how Apple managed to be firm about design and though they can be even tougher since they do it for free.Such reasonable / obvious requests linger for decades and after a while the system has been rewritten and bugs are auto-closed.I no longer report any bugs nor care."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In the past 5 years I&#39;ve seen maybe a dozen &#34;how elliptic curves work&#34;, but this is the first to actually illustrate how they work on a small field. I think that&#39;s key to understanding, seeing it in a small enough field that you can literally see all of the points. Nicely done.If you want to keep going, as an advanced beginner I&#39;d like to see:Arbitrary bigint math - how do you do Exp/Sqrt with arbitrary sized ints? (I&#39;m familiar with two crypto libs that do this, and MPIs &amp; branches confuse me).Second: why is C25519 faster than SecP256R1 or BrainPool? maybe some insight there? (Isn&#39;t Ed25519 the signature name? and X25519 the ECDH name?)Greedy of me, but thanks!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My broken record take on this stuff is that whatever value there is in visualizing elliptic curves, there&#39;s more intuition to build just by playing with the curve formulae directly (it&#39;s pretty basic math) and seeing how the operations work in code. I don&#39;t have the math background to back this up but my understanding of the group rules is that they&#39;re --- at least for the application we&#39;re using them in --- a little arbitrary."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Brex founder here.We&#39;ve made the difficult decision to no longer offer services to the small business market.Back in April we launched Empower, and we decided to put the full weight of Brex towards building the best global payments platform for tech startups and larger companies. With that, we realized we couldn&#39;t do a great job serving the small business community at the same time. This has been an incredibly difficult decision for me and the team, but we believe small businesses deserve a partner that is entirely focused on them.We know how changes in financial services can be disruptive – especially in a moment like now. We&#39;re doing all we can, and working with other financial service providers to make this transition as smooth as possible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why Brex is no longer qualified to be our bank:We’ve put $millions through Brex cash/cards and will almost certainly leave after reading this. This doesn’t affect us (I think?) but that they’d do something like this in this way is a breach of trust that signals bigger problems down the line. What is “Empower” and why would I believe they won’t sunset the current Brex offering to push some upmarket sales nonsense on us as it that new thing becomes the focus?We had kind of outgrown Brex anyway, but this is sad to see. What really irks me here is that I know my first company, a bootstrapped e-commerce thing that was a healthy “small business” would have been axed by this, but the current one is big enough that they wouldn’t want to lose us. Just doesn’t sit right with me.I appreciate how tough this decision probably was, but I hope they properly modeled who else they’d lose via loss of faith, like us."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not surprised by any of this. Feels like it comes from the top, culturally.I had a terrible experience &#34;onboarding&#34; with Brex last year. They actually &#34;approved&#34; my bootstrapped startup and sent me a physical card only to rescind it a shortly thereafter, because--even though we met the funding minimum--it wasn&#39;t &#34;professionally invested&#34; on further review. Bootstrapping apparently required a $1MM minimum.Here&#39;s what they told me:&#34;While being professionally invested is not a requirement for the Brex card with monthly payments, without professional investment, the minimum cash balance requirement shown in connected accounts is $1mm. If you&#39;re able to provide proof of XXXXX&#39;s professional investment, the minimum cash balance requirement shown in connected accounts is $50k.&#34;Left a really bitter taste in my mouth. Won&#39;t ever use them.Currently banking with Mercury and love it BTW."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The announcement says it wants to &#34;protect consumers&#34;, but it changes user tracking from opt-in to opt-out... How about ensuring that companies stop tracking people unnecessarily?I see so many websites – even club websites or private blogs – that have a cookie consent banner, but which wouldn&#39;t actually need one if they&#39;d just turn off Google Analytics. I just don&#39;t get it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From what I understand the way this is currently shaking out, is that it largely won&#39;t impact marketplace sites as credit cards can be used as a form of age verification. You might have to create an account and associate a credit card before you&#39;re able to browse which would be an awful user experience...For other sites though, if the this passes into law I suspect it will have a much more intense cooling effect on the availability and access to sites. For the unpaid service sites I run, I&#39;m certainly not going to pay for identity verification or allow that garbage on my sites. I&#39;m much more likely to hide or disable any user generated content, or just serve a static page to users in the UK saying the site isn&#39;t available in your region.They&#39;re really doubling down on removing themselves from the world community..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For me, this is the important part.&gt; The UK is also planning to legislate to remove the EU-derived requirement for the Data Protection Officer, as the person responsible for safeguarding an organisation’s users’ privacy rights, while simultaneously demanding under the OSB that companies appoint named individuals who are subject to personal arrests and criminal sanctions for failing to prevent bad things from happening on the internet.*subject to personal arrests and criminal sanctions* seems like the limited liability companies no longer limit the liability.I have a legal entity registered in Scotland. Seems like it might be time to wind that up and move it to another country. Where is a good company within the EU to registered?"</p>
