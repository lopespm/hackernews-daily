It&#39;s a known thing that you can buy DVDs (yes, DVDs) with personal data from millions of Brazilians customers on the streets of Sao Paulo. Daylight market (called Camelo&#39;s).There was some news articles about it a few years ago. Even the former president data was there. Social Security Number (not as secret as it is in the US and Canada), address, name, phone number. Even some family relations. It was pretty cheap."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In the opinion of a last semester CS student who has never written an application from scratch that needed more than a SQLite DB (so take me with a half grain of salt), it seems like premature optimization, while always talked about, is very common. I see people talking about using Kubernetes for internal applications and I just can&#39;t figure out why. If it&#39;s a hobby project and you want to learn Kubernetes, that&#39;s a different situation, but in the case of making a real application that people will use, it seems like a lot of us can get away with a single DB, a few workers of our app, and maybe a cache.I&#39;m speaking out of little experience though. I just think that a lot of us can get away with traditional vertical scaling and not think too much about it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The assertion that PostgreSQL can handle dozens of TB of data needs to be qualified, as this is definitely not the case in some surprising and unexpected cases that are rarely talked about.PostgreSQL&#39;s statistics collection, which is used by the query planner, doesn&#39;t scale with storage size. For some ordinary data distributions at scale, the statistical model won&#39;t reflect any kind of reality and therefore can produce pathological query plans. It is quite difficult to get around this scaling behavior. Consequently, I&#39;ve moved away from using PostgreSQL for data models with distributions such that these query planner limitations will occur. These pathologies occur well before the &#34;dozens of TB&#34; range.The statistics collector is not a scalable design generally, but that is another matter. In its current state it does not degrade gracefully with scale."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The difficulty with this advice is that it assumes that you have many small transactions.Yes, of course, you should try to build your application so queries and transactions are very short. That solves a great many problems.But sometimes you can&#39;t. Sometimes you just have to do joins across large tables. There just isn&#39;t any other way. Your query is going to run for 5, 10, maybe 30 seconds. That&#39;s a huge burden on your server, and it will slow down the other tenants. In that case, the only answer is to distribute the queries across other boxes.I agree with the advice in general -- delay moving to a distributed system as long as possible -- but sometimes you just can&#39;t."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"IMO if you&#39;re really concerned about anonymity and securing your email from credential-stuffing, and willing to pay for such a service (I used to pay for 33mail), it&#39;s easier to just buy a domain and route * to your inbox.It won&#39;t get banned by some services, you have complete control over the domain and account, you can send email from any address you wish, you can sign up for domain-wide haveibeenpwned alerts by verifying domain ownership via TXT records, and you don&#39;t have to worry about the service going out of business in 2 years.After going through my password manager last year and changing as many logins and emails as I could, I&#39;ve found several services that have sold my email address to third parties and one that was hacked.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I appreciate the author&#39;s framing of &#34;transaction costs.&#34;  These costs are often hidden.It seems that as systems scale (in size) they tend to become inherently lower-trust. Consider a physician who makes house calls (not uncommon as recently as a few generations ago, and certainly not incompatible with modern medicine) and a large medical system such as Kaiser Permanente or NHS.The economic benefits of the larger-scale system are obvious, and are directly measured, but the economic detriment due to increased transaction costs (derived from decreased trust) are neither obvious nor readily measurable.Upsides of systems at scale can still outweigh downsides, and often do, but I suspect many industrial systems have a maximum scale above which efficiency gains lose out to, in this author&#39;s framing, transaction costs.This abuts certain natural &#34;borders&#34; for system growth, such as national (or in the case of EU, common market) boundaries."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This applies to the workplace too, not just society at large. That&#39;s why if I&#39;m ever at a company where I feel like I am mistrusted, or I mistrust the people I work with, I do what I can to leave. Not only is it an unpleasant environment to work in, but it feels predictive of failure."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who grew up in very low trust country, I have to point out in response to several other comments that trust is also not natural. Trust needs to be fostered and guarded, and one sure-fire way in which it erodes in people is if they see norms being violated with impunity. That both makes it more acceptable for people to violate norms (like that riot paper I can&#39;t find now, where they found each person would throw a rock if they saw N people around them throwing rocks, so it&#39;s a cascade of higher and higher Ns); but also more importantly creates a cynical attitude in those who won&#39;t violate the norms that their chief goal is to protect their own well-being from bad/stupid people, the rest be damned (the bad and stupid people might as well suffer, and the others, well I guess they should just also fend for themselves).This applies on all levels from govt corruption, to e.g. neighborhood care. Russian cities are full of shabby-looking flats (&#34;condos&#34;) with cars parked on the lawn, the playgrounds that are lightly vandalized, and dirty unmaintained common areas; however, many of the cars are luxury and if you visit someone you&#39;d see they have a nice (if small) pad even by Western standards. And probably a steel door.
That is because you see people treating common areas like crap, so at worst you also treat them like crap (&#34;everyone parks on the lawn!&#34;), and at best you retreat into your own little world and make it perfect, outside and everyone else be damned, and traversing from your flat to your car becomes sort of a tolerable necessary evil, who cares what it looks like.I&#39;ve been thinking about this a lot given the recent deterioration of the West coast cities. I&#39;ve definitely become much more lower trust than I used to be, and I realized another reason I don&#39;t like houses is that you cannot just put a steel door in and be mostly safe from crime - too many entry points :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; The cost, however, is steep — the list, or wholesale, price is $3,960 a month, or more than $47,500 a year. The list price for the one-time initiation dose is $5,490.Median income in the US is ~$31K apparently. So even in a rich country, this is like 50% more than the income of a typical person.My understanding is the funding for the trials was partly from NIAID. This seems like yet another case where public funds are used for research, but a company ends up with the ability to dictate pricing.I&#39;m glad that this works and that there is another, more convenient and effective treatment option. But shouldn&#39;t we have some setup where if tax dollars pay for the research, the government should own a share of the IP commensurate with their funding level, and should then be able to have some say in pricing?Or, if you think that the government itself shouldn&#39;t own IP for a product on the market, can we create an independent non-profit which receives ownership, and whose charter aligns with actually treating as many people as possible?I&#39;m not saying that when real, innovative work happens, pharmaceutical companies shouldn&#39;t get some meaningful return on the money they put in. But when the public supports the work, we shouldn&#39;t get nothing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have always heard that Truvada (prep) was extremely effective at preventing HIV infection. These new injectables are reported by the article to be 89% and 66% more effective at preventing transmission.What is this based on? Was I misinformed about Truvada&#39;s effectiveness? Is this a decrease in an already very low chance of transmission? Or is this in comparison to people forgetting to take their daily pills vs a shot that a health care provider had record of administering?It&#39;s currently common in the gay community for sexually active, healthy people to take Truvada proactively to protect against HIV because it&#39;s understood to be even more effective than condoms. If there is a better option or if the current option is not as effective as widely believed then standard of care should change."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who is in this high-risk community: good news.(Well, except for that price tag.)People, to a first approximation, are just terrible at pill compliance. Doesn’t matter the demographics, people just aren’t perfect at taking a pill, every day, at the same time, forever and ever. Having that injection where you can set it and forget it? Nice advance. Not game-changing, but still a nice move forward.And I think it’ll be a bigger move forward for people who are at high risk of HIV, but also have not great access to medical care where they live. If you…oh boy, here I go, potentially getting into trouble. Non-white and/or non-affluent communities tend to come down much harder on homosexuality. It is much more discreet to get a periodic shot than heading to Walgreen’s and bringing home a bottle full of blue pills. It’s safer. It’s a bit more private."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; The AFR for 2020 dropped below 1% down to 0.93%. In 2019, it stood at 1.89%. That’s over a 50% drop year over year... In other words, whether a drive was old or new, or big or small, they performed well in our environment in 2020.If every drive type, new and old, big and small, did better this year, maybe they changed something in their environment this year?  Better cooling, different access patterns, etc.If this change doesn&#39;t have an obvious root cause, I&#39;d be interested in finding out what it is if I were Backblaze.  It could be something they could optimize around even more."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have always loved these posts, they paint a picture of smart people with good processes in place. It&#39;s confidence-building. Unfortunately we were evaluating Backblaze around the time they went down for a weekend and didn&#39;t even update their status page, which was a bit of a blow to that confidence."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Over the last year or so, we moved from using hard drives to SSDs as boot drives. We have a little over 1,200 SSDs acting as boot drives today. We are validating the SMART and failure data we are collecting on these SSD boot drives. We’ll keep you posted if we have anything worth publishing.Would love to see SSD stats like this in the future. Recently was talking to some friends about what SSD to buy. I personally really like my HP EX950 - one friend said he&#39;d never buy HP hardware. He said he was getting an Intel - I said I had an early Intel SSD fail on me, and I don&#39;t think QLC is the best option, but it is a nice value play. For performance, I do like Samsung, though they are expensive. Another friend said he&#39;d never buy a Samsung SSD, as he had a reliability issue, and found lots of similar stories when he was researching it.Of course these are all anecdotes and they aren&#39;t useful in making an informed choice. I suspect most SSDs are reliable &#34;enough&#34; for most consumer use, and not nearly reliable enough for certain kinds of critical storage needs. But it would still be nice to see the big picture, and be able to factor that into your SSD purchase decisions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This brings back the memories. Another true story to add to this one. I (like many Sun cohorts) loved the burritos at La Costeña market, and we had adopted the FAX trick from Adobe.Then along came the &#34;Distributed Objects Everywhere&#34; project (which invented CORBA) and they wanted an example application so they created &#34;BurritoTool&#34; which used CORBA to find the server that was connected to the fax line, and a nice WYSIWYG window to select your burrito condiments. Everyone loved it, it was a great tool and we all used it.Then one day we show up and they tell us they have turned off their fax machine. We asked why, and they show us faxes for burrito orders that started coming in at 6AM and went non-stop until they turned it off. Some seemed legit but many were clearly not from someone who knew the place.We go back to the office and do some snooping and see a bunch of requests to the burrito server in the wee hours before anyone is at work. We trace the IP address to a hotel in New York city. We call the Hotel and as it turns out Sun Sales is hosting an event and one of the things they are showing off at the &#34;pavilion&#34; is our cool distributed object technology. And using Burritotool! But CORBA has done its job and when it hadn&#39;t been told there was a local burrito server it sent packets back to HQ and found the one in the systems group lab. Starting at 9AM eastern and going all morning long, people had been making random burrito orders as part of the demo code!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Related: Sun had a demo for NeWS (fancy desktop display system) called PizzaTool.  Don Hopkins did a writeup: https://medium.com/@donhopkins/the-story-of-sun-microsystems...(One question: that writeup says Solaris 2, but I think I might&#39;ve used PizzaTool under OpenWindows 2.0 on SunOS 4.1.1 on sun4c.)Inspired by PizzaTool at the time, but my employer having a gazillion dollars of workstations and servers, yet none with a fax card (and my group having daily ad hoc lunch outings), I wrote LunchTool for the Suns.  It was a GUI with a database of local lunch places, which someone could choose to decide on a lunch location and time and such, then print a fancy announcement sign to hang where everyone would see it.  (Not everyone checked email, and I liked typesetting and programming PostScript anyway.)  I was most proud of the bitmap burger icon.When Google first solicited third-party apps for Android (it might&#39;ve been a contest?), I almost stole the idea of PizzaTool, since it still seemed like a fun idea, as a gimmick or experience.  Not that one really needed to see composited pineapple bits, to know whether they wanted it on their real-world pizza, but I thought the visual made adding toppings fun, and not a bad early demo for Android."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"compare this nearly 30 year old script with the absolute red hot hell of trying to order anything at all through toast,caviar,grub hub,uber eats or postmates and you&#39;ll want to check out the latest RCS and build it on X86 before the end of the day.im serious.  compared to the relatively clean, coherent and transparent burrito script, the dumpster fire that constitutes modern online ordering is an unforgiveable travesty.again this is not delivery...no gig shit this is just simple pickup n go we&#39;re trying to do here but at the end of the byzantine transaction you make on a vendors website you&#39;ve opted into a dozen mailing lists and you&#39;re getting menus and direct mailers from any and every local and non-local restaurant and bar...complete with mailers from the goddamn platform itself shilling you to either get in your car and play delivery drone or sign up for endless datamining.and hell, you might not even be ordering from the restaurant itself.  most of these platforms set up the virtual equivalent of a pop up tent in front of the business.  If nothing else, this script has pushed me to reconsider email-to-fax orders to the handful of small local restaurants in the neighborhood."</p>
