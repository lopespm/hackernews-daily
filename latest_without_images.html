								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have mixed feelings about this.Younger me learned a lot of problem solving skills and most importantly spent a lot of time learning how to read by playing RPGs and games that required lots of reading. My reading skills would not have been as advanced if i wasn&#39;t playing text heavy games that had a lot of plot like Square Enix games and the CRPGs of the time.Modern games though are clearly designed to get you as addicted as possible and to play as long as possible to an extent that made the old school 90s RPGs grinds look tame and mild. (the grinds in those games basically existing to make sure you had to play long enough to not be able to return it to the store or beat it via rental)Modern UX of games is designed so that you dont have to really read or understand the game mechanics even to be able to play and get into that feedback loop. To the point where when a game comes along like Dark Souls that asks you to learn the game systems to beat it, gamers go gah gah over &#34;how hard&#34; it is."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"People talking about the benefits of games reminds me of people talking about the benefits of, say, a glass of wine with every meal: it&#39;s worth looking into but at the same time it&#39;s the sort of thing that obviously doesn&#39;t scale linearly with the amount/intensity of consumption.I similarly have mixed feelings as well, but for slightly different reasons. I&#39;ve read about studies that say that musical training (which is often believed to translate to improvements in other cognitive aspects of life) doesn&#39;t actually correlate to said improvements, and I suspect that the same might be true for games (e.g. solving game puzzles doesn&#39;t necessarily mean you get better at school math or whatever)This line of reasoning is also supported by research on correlation between games and violence (i.e. the consensus is that no such causation relationship exists).All of these suggest (to me) that gaming is just its own activity without much impact on life other than opportunity cost itself.However, there are some aspects of gaming that can affect overall well-being, specifically aspects related to repetitiveness (e.g. grinding). Repetitiveness is something that does come up in a lot of disciplines (e.g. its soothing effect in autist kids, or repetitiveness as tool in the context of meditation, etc).The &#34;addictive&#34; aspect isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing either, IMHO. Games are, almost by definition, supposed to be engaging. But that addictiveness may come in a form of trade-offs, for example, back in the day of grindy RPGs, delayed gratification was basically the entire point of grinding. The one aspect that I think is justly vilified is monetization strategies that tie to addictive elements of gameplay (especially the gacha variety) and this is something that I&#39;d actually commend China for trying to address via regulation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Disclaimer: Involved in both KDE (including kde pim and kalendar) and Nextcloud. See bio.* I wouldn&#39;t call Nextcloud codebase old. It&#39;s a PHP 7.3 codebase with sure quite a lot of legacy stuff but a lot of thing has been improved and refactored with the time. It&#39;s maintained, there is an active community and an healthy enterprise behind the project. IHMO  this is that matters more than the programming language used.* SabreDAV supports WebDAV and this is that we are using at Nextcloud for our webdav/caldav and carddav support.* KOrganizer does run on Windows but it require to be built from source. I have been told that a better Windows support is being worked on for the entire PIM suite and I hope that at some point exe can be distributed. Technically there is nothing that makes it impossible to use on macOS, we just need more helping hands to help with fixing the platform specific issues. There is also a modern alternative to Korganizer being worked on called Kalendar. More on it can be learned on https://claudiocambra.com/ (Disclaimer: I was the mentor of this GSoC project)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Surprised nobody has mentioned this yet, but Org-mode for Emacs [1] is just great, and fits very well to the requirements:- Source of truth: these are text files, so any of git, nextcloud, syncthing etc. will do.- Consistent interface: using emacs might be tough on mobile, but there are some pretty good web interfaces for it [2].

The architecture is a postgres db exposing CRUD API endpoints and all changes are broadcasted over MQTT so I can easily hook into everything for automation and extension.I have a desktop application in JavaFX and a mobile Android app so I can use Kotlin as one language across all clients and backend. Lots of code sharing going on for things like API models."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"“ MarkMonitor sells themselves as the domain registrar that does not make mistakes.

They have not responded to any of our communications.”Should anyone be surprised that a company that claims to not make mistakes, but has no way to report vulnerabilities gets their vulnerability on the front page of HN? (And this is a good case scenario, as opposed to their customers being hacked: which could have happened by an attacker claiming some of these domains)Let’s hope they make at least the change of putting a bug bounty program in place."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oops. People pay a lot of money to MarkMonitor because their promise is to not make such mistakes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; This issue is not entirely the fault of MarkMonitor. While they need to be careful with handling parked domains, AWS is at fault for not being more stringent with claiming S3 buckets. Google Cloud, for example, has required domain verification for years, rendering this useless.This sounds like more of an Amazon problem than a MarkMonitor problem to me. And it makes a good case for using other cloud providers over AWS, as with GCP this attack wouldn&#39;t have been possible. Merely creating the DNS records pointing to the cloud provider&#39;s nameservers shouldn&#39;t be enough for anyone to then claim it and start hosting."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Classical music is one of the hardest genres to surface through existing music apps.Where an app may have an &#34;artist&#34; field, classical music will have &#34;composer&#34; and then for the performers it will have &#34;orchestra&#34;, &#34;conductor&#34;, &#34;principal soloists&#34;. For an opera all of those are primary fields that could be considered &#34;artist&#34;.The variations of the data is huge, only last week I had to correct Tchaikovsky in my own data and looking at the variations I see online:    P. I. Tchaïkovski
    Peter Ilyitch Tchaikofsky
    Peter Tchaikovsky
    Petr Ilitch Tchaïkovski
    Piotr Ilic Tchaikovskij
    Piotr Ilyitch Tchaikovski
    Piotr Tchaikovski
    Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky (this one is arguably most correct)

This is something everyone gets wrong, and yet whomever gets it right is going to help make it easier for people to find and celebrate classical music, and to expose more people to classical music.Even if today you know that you love Beethoven&#39;s Symphony No 3... finding the best performance and recording is almost impossible, and if you do happen to stumble upon it on a streaming service getting back to it later (if it wasn&#39;t the only one in your recents) is difficult.I&#39;m really glad someone is investing in this, and it needs to be a different app / interface to handle this difference in metadata and in weighting of the fields. Capturing the intent of &#34;oh, this person really just wants to search Gould as a principal soloist and weight the search that way&#34; is far easier when you have an app that can provide a classical music perspective and filter over an existing library.PS: Plex does this really badly too... whatever you do, don&#39;t let the Plex Music Agents decide the metadata, Verdi disappeared and had the metadata for Veridia which I believe is a rock band."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Primephonic is no longer available for new subscribers and will be taken offline beginning September 7. Apple Music plans to launch a dedicated classical music app next year combining Primephonic’s classical user interface that fans have grown to love with more added features. In the meantime, current Primephonic subscribers will receive six months of Apple Music for free, providing access to hundreds of thousands of classical albums, all in Lossless and high-resolution audio, as well as hundreds of classical albums in Apple Music’s Spatial Audio, with new albums added regularly.This is utter insanity. I understand acquiring, and &#34;sunsetting&#34; the acquisition when it makes sense, blocking new user signups, and heck I&#39;d even say its pretty cool that they&#39;re planning on releasing a totally separate experience for Apple Music classical listeners.But why shut down Primephonic before this new experience is ready? It just pisses off the already niche and hesitant customer-base you&#39;ve announced you&#39;re trying to court!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The most interesting thing about this is that Apple&#39;s pre-announcing that they&#39;re going to be launching a dedicated classical music app. Presumably it&#39;ll be very closely based on the current Primephonic app, and worked on by the same developers.This has some close parallels to Apple buying Workflow and turning it into their now-platform-standard Shortcuts app. It&#39;s still being worked on by the original developers, too.Shortcuts has been given fairly high priority in all Apple&#39;s recent OS releases, particularly as it ties into their home automation ecosystem, and it&#39;s resulted in surprising bursts of popularity. E.g. last years &#34;#aesthetic&#34; complete-homescreen-customization boom was entirely based on using Shortcuts as a hack to customize app icons.It&#39;s been honestly weird to see such a relatively high profile part of the OS being run as a mostly-independent subsidiary like that, particularly given Apple&#39;s notorious control-freak ways. Them expanding the approach like this rather than just cramming it into Music suggests that they think it&#39;s working well for them..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The post title was a tad misleading - I got the impression that it was saying that Godot isn&#39;t ready and we shouldn&#39;t wait for it to become ready. I suppose it got my attention by being like that, and that was the point. Maybe it&#39;d&#39;ve been better as &#34;Stop Waiting for Godot - Game Jam&#34;.Happy to see Terry Cavanagh is trying Godot. I love Super Hexagon and VVVVVV, and am planning to play Dicey Dungeons in the future. Looking forward to see what he makes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a friend who&#39;s been trying to go all-in on Godot but decided recently to switch over to something else, largely due to ongoing issues with its lighting system. When toying with it, he encountered poor lighting overall and some particularly counterintuitive behavior with the (rather simplistic) lighting system.For example, a simple scene with a wall intersecting the floor and a light placed on one side. In this scenario, you get weird light spilling around the edge onto the vertex where the wall meets the ground (see [0] and [1]).  There&#39;s also poor handling of multiple light sources; if you cast a shadow and place a light directly on top of the shadow area, it&#39;s impossible to displace the shadow (see [2]). These sorts of things are very noticeable, and part of the recent work that they&#39;ve just released was supposed to address this. However, these examples came from the most recent release, which made my friend begin considering other options with more robust lighting.[0] https://imgur.com/rsxjV5u

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hm, I&#39;ve been trying to learn godot, but I kinda keep hitting walls I&#39;m not sure how to navigate. I pretty much get the idea, for a simple platformer, you&#39;d build your enemies, players and level elements as scenes, and then you use godot as a level editor to build your level, instantiating these scenes.However, I&#39;m seriously struggling to think some different scenarios. For example, how to structure the application in order to have some procedurally generated contents for a level and how to add that into the godot structure.Or, another thing was I had some situations where it feels like I need to parametrize a packed scene with some other instances of a packed scene. Think of a toolbox filled with tools, which are again instances of other packed scenes. That grew into a really weird monster pushing paths of instances around, but became very unwieldy quickly.At that point I&#39;m confused if I have a mental block because I&#39;m thinking incorrectly about the problem, or if godot is not a good fit for stuff like that, or if there is a great way to structure this in godot.Dunno. Somewhat rambling, but maybe someone has some pointers there."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think a lot of this is because our profession does not have an accepted universal bar everyone can jump over to be considered ‘qualified’.  Every technical interview feels like rolling the dice in proving I am a competent developer.  Giving me 50 minutes in a high pressure situation in an environment i am unfamiliar with and people I just meet will never product my best results, and then add to the fact that I could be asked any question, and my ability to answer is it being ranked against other candidates.  Maybe someone else _just_ did a similar question in another interview and it’s fresh on his mind.  Maybe someone spend their entire career focusing on just this type of problem given in the interview, but the question in the interview is only partly related to the actual job."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We made the interview process very simple and traditional in our current organisation. 30 minute chat, judge whether the person can do the job or is a good fit, if yes then offer a year contract with 1-3 months of evaluation period. Changing a job is risky also from the candidate&#39;s perspective so if the person is pretending, the lies will catch up. Most of the scenario it has worked pretty well.Sometimes, people who you think are not capable to do the job, often outperform expectations too. It is all about taking a risk on a person and giving them respect and a chance. We could have done leetcode, or pair programming session. It takes more energy and effort to do it from both sides and probability of finding a good candidate is more or less the same."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very few firms want to hire juniors, while nearly all firms desire senior-level talent.This manifests inflated job vacancies because so many firms have an evergreen job posting for &#34;Senior Full Stack&#34;.  Because talent is scarce these roles rarely get filled (hiring managers expect million-dollar candidates to accept $100-200k compensation).Also, because lots of software requires specific expertise, there are vacancies that can&#39;t be filled because of a knowledge gap (novel industries / projects, etc).  For example, how could SpaceX possibly fill all their engineering roles?  Surely money is not a limiting factor, but rather the limited supply of qualified expert rocket engineers?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Full title too long for HN &#34;French Appeal Court affirms decision that copyright claims on GPL are invalid; must be enforced via contractual dispute&#34;There was a brief HN discussion on the initial ruling 2 years ago https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24478769 the case just went to appeal earlier this year.Note that the last HN discussion never really happened, it gathered both too many votes and flags in 20 minutes and got automatically hidden, only to be unblocked by a mod later. It would be great if you could refrain from flagging this time, even if the ruling comes as a culture shock to you.I assure you it is not clickbait. The authors of GPL software are really spending years and a fortune in court only to have all their copyright claims dismissed. The ruling passed the High Court (TGI), the Appeal Court and the CJUE."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I think is the real meat of the story:&gt; That is to conclude, by having a contract (a license is a contract), you lose your rights to pursue any IP/copyright claims (the two are exclusive in French law).GPL was written by lawyers for the American system of law and France is not part of the USA. The systems of law are different and therefore the implications of GPL-licensing code are different.I&#39;d be very surprised if France is the only country that treats software licenses like this. The basis of the USA system of law is completely different from even other European courts, let alone non-Western systems of law. Assuming you can write a license for use in the USA and enforce it the world around is quite foolish."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; The Rust or Haskell compilers, for example, insist on policing whatever private understanding you might have about the meaning of your code.The thing about &#34;private understandings&#34; is that they&#39;re just another way of saying &#34;we expect ceaseless, flawless vigilance&#34; (as one writer put it), not to mention &#34;flawless communication and training.&#34;Languages which impose weird restrictions tend to do so because it allows them to offer (nearly) ironclad guarantees about something else.There are certain programming idioms that work brilliantly in Haskell. Those same idioms would be utterly miserable in the presence of unrestricted mutation.Or to take the author&#39;s other example, Rust forbids shared mutable state, and it keeps careful track of ownership. But I can freely use native CPU threads without worrying about anything worse than a deadlock, and I can bang directly on raw bytes without worrying about anything worse than a controlled runtime failure. And this remains true even if team communication occasionally fails or if someone makes a mistake.Sometimes I want to rule out entire classes of potentially dangerous mistakes, and not just have a &#34;private understanding&#34; that nobody will ever make certain mistakes.As always, it&#39;s a matter of using the right tool for the job. If you need to write a high-performance, heavily-threaded network server that parses malicious binary data, Rust is a great tool because of those restrictions. If you need to do highly exploratory programming and invent new idioms to talk about your problem domain, Common Lisp is awesome. And if you need to build libraries where everything has a rigid mathematical structure, Haskell is a great tool.In my experience, Commony Lisp is a deeply opinionated language, and its most dramatic opinion is that &#34;your code and your data should have identical representations and structures.&#34; And for the right problem, that restriction is extremely powerful."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I was younger I used to write a lot of Common Lisp. A lot. And I also had this idea that Haskell/OCaml/Scheme were strict, ivory tower totalitarian languages, while Common Lisp was this incredibly powerful, expressive, liberating tool. For building organisms, not pyramids, like Sussman said. And the S-expressions were aesthetically appealing to me. But at the time I was working mostly on smaller commercial projects and solo open source projects.Maybe it&#39;s cognitive decline from no longer being a teenager, or the experience of working on larger, O(100,000) line codebases with large teams, but nowadays I find a high degree of dynamism just exhausting. I don&#39;t want more expressive power, I want fewer nightmares.A common problem I faced with Common Lisp is I&#39;d write some module, then go on to write another module that depended upon the previous one, and get an exception through from the first module. Usually a type error. And I&#39;d have to go back, context-switch, fix that, and climb back up to the other level.With ML/OCaml/Haskell that is far less common. Being able to look at a module and say, &#34;this is done and it&#39;s correct&#34;, is a very powerful thing. Confidence, rather than safety, is the primary benefit of static typing for me.And I find that I no longer use the REPL. I&#39;ve been working on a compiler in OCaml and for some reason Dune won&#39;t run utop (lol) so I&#39;ve just not been REPL&#39;ing and it&#39;s not been a problem. The code typechecks. Things work on the first run. If I change something, I get notified what needs updating.The problem with interactive development is that it&#39;s like unit testing: it can prove the presence of bugs but not their absence. Type systems can eliminate large classes of bugs ahead of time.Just so this is not entirely negative or depressing: there&#39;s something beautiful about how maximalist Common Lisp is. It&#39;s a big, messy language with every programming paradigm (and you can invent new ones) and different naming conventions in the core language itself. I was learning new things about Common Lisp years into using it productively. And I compared the experience to moving to a huge stately home, that has a room for the piano, a vast attic, a wine cellar, all manner of things, and then trying to move back to a shoebox apartment. Where do I fit the piano? CLOS, the MOP, the Lovecraftian beauty of LOOP and FORMAT: it&#39;s like a wild garden next to the (comparative) spartan minimalism of practically everything else.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; These &#34;big idea languages&#34; tend to assert a kind of &#34;programming ideology&#34; over reality, and tend to, in my opinion, distance you from the thing you are trying to do, often, they claim, &#34;for your own good&#34; ... &#34;You want to give HOW many objects a mutable reference to this value?&#34; complains the Rust compiler. &#34;Are you insane? You are a Rustacean, you don&#39;t do that kind of thing!&#34;I agree with the spirit of this line of thought: in general I favor pragmatism over zealotry, and I think it should be up to the programmer to determine how a tool should be used, not the tool itself.However when we talk about something like the safety constraints imposed by Rust, it&#39;s more about citizenship than it is about the compiler being overly opinionated.  By baking those constraints into the language, I can have confidence when I use third party code that it reaches at least some standard in terms of memory safety and thread safety.  Much in the same way as a strict type system, those constraints free me up to not have to think about certain types of issues.If I am writing code which only I will consume, I&#39;m also free to use escape hatches to sidestep these constraints when I know they&#39;re not relevant.I&#39;ve written tens of thousands of lines of Rust by now, and I&#39;m still not convinced the Rust model is the right one in terms of achieving its goals, but I think the approach is &#34;reality based&#34; with respect to avoiding some of the problems which can occur while developing software in collaboration with others."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"After spending years in manufacturing IT, there are hundreds if not thousands of systems like these running, where the company that created the software is long gone.This where you end up with DOS, Windows 3.1 and even Windows NT computers controlling machines that make millions of dollars worth of product, 24 hours a day.We&#39;ve spent hours scouring eBay or industrial auction sites finding parts of computers to keep &#39;just in case&#39;. None of this software virtualizes easily or can even be moved to a machine of similar vintage without relicensing. Some of it is hardware dongles, some of it software keys.It seems like you could create quite a business being able to crack this software. Companies would pay tens of thousands to get these machines running. Often times the &#39;new&#39; version of the hardware and software is $100,000 US.In a few years, internet-based licensing will be the thing to crack."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"More precisely, this is about reversing the license key generation/verification algorithm.I got a bit confused by the title at first, thinking they were trying to deduce the specific licensing terms or something."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oh hey, I&#39;m the author of the post! Happy to chat about any aspects of it.This project is a spiritual successor to an earlier project reverse engineering a gaming DRM system, so if you enjoy this post you might enjoy that older one too: https://yingtongli.me/blog/2018/11/16/drm1-1.html"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Microsoft used to release a &#34;checked&#34; build for each version of Windows on MSDN/Visual Studio Subscription downloads. [1] This was a build with the same compiler optimization settings as the release build, but with debug-build-only assertions and checks included. In the checked build kernel, the system uptime had 49 days artificially added to it [2], precisely to help developers find out problems like this.At one point when I was on the Windows team at Microsoft, there was an internal push for us to selfhost (dogfood) checked builds of Windows, since they theoretically provided better bug telemetry than &#34;free&#34; builds (release builds, which are free of debug-only code). &#34;Slows your dev box down by just half!&#34; was the basic pitch of that campaign in a nutshell.[1] I don&#39;t know if this was ever done for Windows 95. It was done for Windows XP up to Windows 10 version 1511, but it appears to have stopped since then, at least according to my quick search.[2] https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/sysinfoapi/nf-s..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"EPILOGUEHere&#39;s the exact point of the crash (cued to 5 seconds prior): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdrRoSdBM5M&amp;t=9778sThe counter overflows/resets, everything wraps around, the system counts 6 more seconds, then Windows 95 freezes.The mouse cursor still seems to work, but the message pump seems to have frozen, to the extent that End Task itself is unresponsive, and a second CTRL-ALT-DEL is needed to reset the machine.---This whole thing started back in July, over here (warning: megathread): https://twitter.com/Foone/status/1413694652822163459"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Having used Windows 95 back in the day, I am deeply impressed someone managed to keep it from crashing for so long.I have seen a Windows NT 4.0 system with an uptime of more than five years, but with Windows 95, even a whole day of uptime was pretty close to a miracle."</p>
