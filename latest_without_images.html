								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A title that actually describes the post, mostly paraphrasing the first paragraph:Reasons why this buffer overflow wasn&#39;t caught earlier despite doing all the right thingsAnd then to give those reasons:- &#34;each component is fuzzed independently&#34; ... &#34;This fuzzer might have produced a SECKEYPublicKey that could have reached the vulnerable code, but as the result was never used to verify a signature, the bug could never be discovered.&#34;- &#34;There is an arbitrary limit of 10000 bytes placed on fuzzed input. There is no such limit within NSS; many structures can exceed this size. This vulnerability demonstrates that errors happen at extremes&#34;- &#34;combined [fuzzer] coverage metrics [...]. This data proved misleading, as the vulnerable code is fuzzed extensively but by fuzzers that could not possibly generate a relevant input.&#34;The conclusion is, of course, to fix those problems if your code base also has them, but also &#34;even extremely well-maintained C/C++ can have fatal, trivial mistakes&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the main surprising thing here is that people are putting smallish arbitrary limits on the sizes of inputs that they let their fuzzer generate.With the benefit of a little hindsight, that does feel rather like saying &#34;please try not to find any problems involving overflows&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don’t understand why the “lessons learned” doesn’t recommend always* passing the destination buffer size (using  memcpy_s or your own wrapper). It has been a long time since I wrote C++, but when I did this would have been instantly rejected in code review.*…with, I suppose, potential exceptions in performance-critical code when you control and trust the input; I don’t believe that this code qualifies on either count."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love adventofcode. I have a rule I follow now which makes it a lot more enjoyable: if I can&#39;t make headway on a problem after trying for a day or so, I&#39;ll use the subreddit to find a hint, and then usually that&#39;s enough to help me to the answer. Very occasionally I just completely cheat (often the pure math based questions).I don&#39;t like missing out on the stars.... I mean it&#39;s the only way you get to see the awesome ascii art when you collect all 50 for the year.Many thanks to Eric and team for what must be a huge effort to run such a fun programme.Oh, the other thing I do: I don&#39;t even start until sometime in January :) far less stress and keeps the whole family much happier ;)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d like to remind everyone that it&#39;s totally okay to do the first 10-15 days and leave the really hard stuff to people who are smarter or maybe have more free time. The first few days will still be fun.I&#39;m checking out Elixir this year, because I write 95 % Ruby at work and I&#39;m getting really intrigued by the functional stuff seeping into it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I respect that AoC gets very difficult and is for an audience that isn’t me.But I love the format and what I’d enjoy is a similar project where the difficulty doesn’t really increase, but each day is a different problem domain. Breadth not depth.For example, perhaps we start with some data processing from a file. Then answer some basic statistics question about the data.  Then maybe some basic signal processing.  We form an image. We transform the image. We play the image as audio.  We break it into packets of some sort then share it on a “network.” We reassemble it. We build a state machine and pass it the reassembled data in some way. We discover some new output.Etc. etc. culminating with some fun discovery that inside that original data was a secret code or whatever.And instead of an intense challenge, we’ve just had a fun walk through an intro to two dozen subdomains of CS/sweng. You may not have immediately known the answer to each puzzle but you never felt lost."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This uses the &#34;wave function collapse&#34; algorithm. Oskar Stalberg also made a great demo of how it works[0], but it might not make sense just from that. Martin Donald made a really nice youtube video on how it works[1]. The name &#34;wave function collapse&#34; can be off putting but it&#39;s pretty straightforward, and an algorithm that can come in handy for many uses both in game development and just general software development.I&#39;m actually procrastinating on HN from working on a GPU parallelised version that can generate millions of positions every frame. In Townscaper you can actually see that the algorithm runs quite slow and lags behind the players input, there&#39;s just a bunch of animation to hide it. I&#39;m hoping to eventually get a version that can run in log2(mapsize) time.[0]http://oskarstalberg.com/game/wave/wave.html

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Reputation is a fragile thing. I&#39;ve got no horse in this, it&#39;s not my industry and I&#39;m just a spectator. But two days ago I thought of Stripe as a top notch company, with top notch leadership. Since I&#39;m well aware that PR is a thing, that reputation also tends to be brittle, but while nobody had said anything bad about Stripe, I thought they were tops. This is not so much about Stripe as about the PR world we&#39;ve created: we know that everything we&#39;re told is polished to make it look as nice as possible, so when the facade cracks, we should adjust heavily.So now I&#39;m going to have to shift my priors, and it may well be unfair to the firm. For one, I don&#39;t know if the allegations are true. I also don&#39;t know whether this is a one-off, or whether this happens all the time and this is the tip of the iceberg. I do know that whatever I hear is going to be deeply invested one way or the other.Specifically about the rescinded offers, the only acceptable reason to do that is when the person has gotten the offer in bad faith, eg they lied about their CV or claimed to have done something they provably hadn&#39;t. Other than that, someone who&#39;s gotten an offer may well have started moving house, taking their kids out of school, gotten their spouse to quit their job, and all sorts of hard-to-reverse decisions. It&#39;s an utterly crappy thing to have happen, and any company that does it should be outed for it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Stripe&#39;s recruitment pipeline is well known (at least in most ruby dev circles) to be fucked. I&#39;ve experienced this first hand and even gotten lip service from exec leadership (see my HN comment history). Stripe is very good at PR, aren&#39;t they?The thing is, there are lots and lots of companies who don&#39;t have these types of problems; that don&#39;t treat candidates poorly, follow thru with the offers they make (I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m typing that!).Hiring is already a power dynamic slanted for the employer... this shit just seem excessive and like 0 fucks are given.As a job seeker, don&#39;t waste your time interviewing at companies that have these fundamental problems just getting in the door. The odds will never be in your favor, but these types of problems make for a much larger mountain to climb.Knowing these things, and how good Stripe is at PR, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if things on the inside are actually a dysfunctional mess. I hope not."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some people are getting side-tracked asking if this is a common problem. I think that&#39;s a distraction: the right number of rescinded offers to engineers and other individual contributors is 0.[0]If the actual number of candidates affected is small, then it would be cheap to make it right for them. You could find a team that can take the engineer (we&#39;re not interchangeable parts, but Stripe is a big company), and/or offer monetary compensation for the opportunity cost.[0] I&#39;ll reserve judgment about higher level management. I don&#39;t know if the norms and circumstances are different. Obviously this also excludes failed background checks, candidates being dishonest, etc, etc."</p>

					<h3><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29403947">Ask HN: What are these low quality “code snippet” sites?</a></h3>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29403947">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For years now I&#39;ve ran a programming site (stackabuse.com) and have closely followed the state of Google SERPs when it comes to programming content. A few thoughts/ramblings:- The search results for programming content has been very volatile the last year or so. Google has released a lot of core algorithm updates in the last year, which has caused a lot of high-quality sites to either lose traffic or stagnate.- These low-quality code snippet sites have always been around, but their traffic has exploded this year after the algorithm changes. Just look at traffic estimates for one of the worst offenders - they get an estimated 18M views each month now, which has grown almost 10x in 12 months. Compare that to SO, which has stayed flat or even dropped in the same time-frame- The new algorithm updates seem to actually hurt a lot of high-quality sites as it seemingly favors code snippets, exact-match phrases, and lots of internal linking. Great sites with well-written long-form content, like RealPython.com, don&#39;t get as much attention as they deserve, IMO. We try to publish useful content, but consistently have our traffic slashed by Google&#39;s updates, which end up favoring copy-pasted code from SO, GitHub, and even our own articles.- The programming content &#34;industry&#34; is highly fragmented (outside of SO) and difficult to monetize, which is why so many sites are covered in ads. Because of this, it&#39;s a land grab for traffic and increasing RPMs with more ads, hence these low-quality snippet sites. Admittedly, we monetize with ads but are actively trying to move away from it with paid content. It&#39;s a difficult task as it&#39;s hard to convince programmers to pay for anything, so the barrier to entry is high unless you monetize with ads.- I&#39;ll admit that this is likely a difficult problem because of how programmer&#39;s use Google. My guess is that because we often search for obscure errors/problems/code, their algorithm favors exact-match phrases to better find the solution. They might then give higher priority to pages that seem like they&#39;re dedicated to whatever you searched for (i.e. the low-quality snippet sites) over a GitHub repo that contains that snippet _and_ a bunch of other unrelated code.Just my two cents. Interested to hear your thoughts :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Somewhat tangential but I believe Google Search is going downhill, they seem to be losing the content junk spam SEO fight. Recently, I&#39;ve had to append wiki/reddit/hn to queries I search for because everything near the top is shallow copied content marketing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not only SO threads, I particularly hate the ones that mirror GitHub Issues. They don&#39;t even link back to the original thread, for Christ&#39;s sake!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I used to be a volunteer teacher for a 3-hour weekly class in a local prison.One of the things this article misses is that gangs – which are especially active in prison systems – use books to pass ciphered messages.  Highlighting, underlining, dogeared corners, scratched out characters, etc. are used prolifically as encoded messages that would appear to be regular wear to a casual observer.  The &#34;tradecraft&#34; these guys employ is amazing (albeit for a horrible purpose).  We were allowed to have books shipped directly from publishers or known third-party entities (e.g., Amazon) and there was a request form an instructor could fill to add new approved vendors.All that to say, I understand the policy, even though it&#39;s not ideal for those honestly wanting to read.  It&#39;s hard for most people to imagine but a lot of the people in prison are some seriously bad dudes, and there are real cases of warring gangs orchestrating &#34;hits&#34; on other gang members through innocuous looking content."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the things that happens with used books being donated is that the paper will be used as a medium for getting contraband drugs into the prison.An example of this (letters) https://nypost.com/2021/11/05/wisconsin-inmates-to-get-photo...&gt; Wisconsin prison inmates will begin receiving photocopies of their mail next month as officials attempt to stem the flow of paper laced with drugs into correctional facilities.&gt; The Wisconsin Department of Corrections (DOC) said paper and envelopes can be sprayed or soaked in synthetic cannabinoids such as K2 and then sent into prisons, where they are torn into strips and smoked and sold to inmates.&gt; The Fox Lake prison switched to photocopying prison mail in April after nine “potential overdoses” and two incidents of violent behavior connected to drug use. In the months since, the prison has seen numbers in both categories drop before reaching zero in August, officials said.That&#39;s for a single sheet of paper - consider the difficulty of verifying that a couple hundred pages of a novel haven&#39;t been tampered with.One of the easier ways to do this is to have the book be new and come directly from a distributor."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Given all these discussions about drug laced paper makes you wonder if a system of shuffling books could be employed. Given the price of media mail, it seems like prisons could just do regular swaps so that the books always came from someone else&#39;s collection. Ideally, you&#39;d get a tragedy of the commons where all the books stopped being drugs because no one was getting back what they put into it."</p>

Interactive rebasing requires you to edit a goddamn TODO file in your editor? Are you kidding me? To stage part of a file you need to use a command line program to step through each hunk and if a hunk can&#39;t be split down any further but contains code you don&#39;t want to stage, you have to edit an arcane patch file by hand? Are you KIDDING me?! Sometimes you get asked to stash your changes when switching branches only to realise that after you switch and unstash that there weren&#39;t even any conflicts and it would have been fine to just checkout the branch directly? YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!&gt; If you&#39;re a mere mortal like me and you&#39;re tired of hearing how powerful git is when in your daily life it&#39;s a powerful pain in your ass, lazygit might be for you.I sympathise, deeply.
