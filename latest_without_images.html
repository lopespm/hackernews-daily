								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The real problem here is that there is no consequence for incorrect takedowns.  If content is taken down and then it turns out to be fair use, no one suffers a penalty.The DMCA and similar laws provide protection to the platform if they act quickly on takedown notices, but the law needs to be updated to provide penalties for the reporter for inappropriate takedowns.This would allow Google/Facebook/et al to change their tools from automatic takedown to reporting the violation to the copyright holder, and then it is up to the copyright holder to file a claim.  If perhaps the copyright holder makes too many erroneous claims, they lose their copyright altogether.Let the platforms be neutral, put the liability on the copyright violators and copyright holders equally, so both have a reason to act fairly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Good that OSM is accurate in cities as well, because in hiking, skiing, or even some ferry routes, OSM simply wins because that&#39;s often the only mapping provider to even have _any_ data. Some of my first hand experiences:- French GR-20 routes. Google maps are laughably empty, while OSM has you covered with almost the same information as the hiking maps you can buy on the trail.- Anapurna - similar to GR-20 situation. This route gets changed often due to landslides, but there is always some person doing a great job updating information not too late after.- Volcanoes - OSM maps often contain camping grounds, water sources, etc. This is something I actively contribute too. The level of detail is amazing. Some guides in fact lose potential clients because of this.OSM is a wonderful feat by all its contributors, and isn&#39;t appreciated as much as it deserves."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t know which mapping options Lyft/Uber/etc use, but in my neighborhood, Google Maps has given street names to the allies behind people&#39;s houses. You can tell the drivers that have a clue, and will realize they should not turn down an alley. Drivers that are less cognizant of how the world works, follow the instructions dutifully, and waste time trying to figure out why everyone is confused."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been looking to replace Google Maps with OSM on my smartphone.  OSM itself is great, but I&#39;ve been having a harder time finding a good app to use it with.  Is anyone familiar with a good option?  I mostly use a maps app for location searches and real-time GPS navigation, but offline maps and location sharing are nice-to-have features.I&#39;ve been using OsmAnd and it&#39;s okay.  The interface is pretty good.  It supports offline maps, but not location sharing.  Map tiles are kind of slow to load compared to Google Maps, which is odd since the tiles have to be downloaded to local storage.  The location search often includes redundant results and whatever database they use to store place data is sparse on details like pictures, hours, or reviews.  I&#39;ll keep using it to stay de-platformed from Google as much as possible, but I&#39;d be willing to pay a bit for something more responsive and polished."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not proving solutions to textbooks seems to be a common theme in mathematics and theoretical computer science. It makes it difficult for those outside of the traditional classroom to learn the material. Instead textbook writers seem to have this adversarial approach against readers, thinking they’ll “cheat themselves” if they look up solutions or attempt to verify their work. Experts make mistakes, beginners would presumably make even more mistakes. Without a feedback mechanism beginners can’t truly know whether their logic is impeccable or if they have a subtle error that they themselves cannot detect. They could easily fool themselves that they have correct understanding.Due to that I will not recommend this current book to any colleagues.If you want an example of a fellow hacker news member that did things right, check out 
http://joshua.smcvt.edu/linearalgebra/He provides solutions and lecture videos... this is truly a democratization approach to learning and a model that other academics should follow."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From https://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/hwex.html#...&gt;Please do not ask me for solutions. With very rare exceptions, I will say no, even if you are an instructor. I recognize that my stance limits the utility of these materials, especially for self-learners, but I&#39;m trying to optimize the learning experience of my own students at Illinois. The point of homework is not to solve that particular homework problem, but to practice solving a type of problem and get honest feedback on your progress. I&#39;ve found that when solutions are available, my own students are much more likely to rely on them, rather than trying to figure out the problems themselves, which means they get both less practice and less honest feedback, which means they do worse on exams and in the course overall.Interesting. I was asked multiple times for solutions to my self-pub ebooks that I relented. I didn&#39;t add them initially as I wanted readers to solve by themselves or ask for help if needed (and I did get a few mails, saw one of them asked on stackoverflow as well).See also https://github.com/tayllan/awesome-algorithms for more learning resources, practice problems, visualizations, etc."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Core dev Larry Hastings [0] puts it well. The cost-benefit case for this complicated language feature is limited.&#34;I dislike the syntax and semantics expressed in PEP 634. I see the match statement as a DSL contrived to look like Python, and to be used inside of Python, but with very different semantics. When you enter a PEP 634 match statement, the rules of the language change completely, and code that looks like existing Python code does something surprisingly very different. It also adds unprecedented new rules to Python, e.g. you can replace one expression with another in the exact same spot in your code, and if one has dots and the other doesn’t, the semantics of what the statement expresses changes completely. And it changes to yet a third set of semantics if you replace the expression with a single _.I think the bar for adding new syntax to Python at this point in its life should be set very high. The language is already conceptually pretty large, and every new feature means new concepts one must learn if one is to read an arbitrary blob of someone else’s Python code. The bigger the new syntax, the higher the bar should become, and so the bigger payoff the new syntax has to provide. To me, pattern matching doesn’t seem like it’s anywhere near big enough a win to be worth its enormous new conceptual load.&#34;This while we have elephants in the room such as packaging. Researching best practices to move away from setup.py right now takes you down a rabbit hole of (excellent) blog posts, and yet you still need a setup.py shim to use editable installs, because the new model simply doesn&#39;t yet support this fundamental feature.I can&#39;t afford to spend days immersing myself in packaging to the point of writing a PEP, but would help pay someone to do it well. I can see no way to fund packaging efforts directly on the PSF donations page (edit: see comment). It&#39;s great to see Pip improving but there is still not even a coherent guide that I can find for packaging using up-to-date best practices. This appears to be because the best practices are currently slightly broken.[0] https://discuss.python.org/t/gauging-sentiment-on-pattern-ma..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"IMO the match statement has some very unintuitive behaviour:    match status:
        case 404:
            return &#34;Not found&#34;

    not_found = 404
    match status:
        case not_found:
            return &#34;Not found&#34;

The first checks for equality (`status == 404`) and the second performs an assignment (`not_found = status`)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;the Times’ tech team quickly donned their hall-monitor goggles and Stasi notebooks to warn that the Bad People had migrated to Signal and Telegram. This week they asked: “Are Private Messaging Apps the Next Misinformation Hot Spot?” One reporter “confess[ed] that I am worried about Telegram. Other than private messaging, people love to use Telegram for group chats — up to 200,000 people can meet inside a Telegram chat room. That seems problematic.”I&#39;m already hearing this in local debates. It seems to seriously scare some folks that there are places where they cannot deplatform whoever they want for anything.(PS: Open groups and channels are not encrypted on Telegram servers and can be reported. It is just that Telegram doesn&#39;t have a history of letting other abuse it.)Edit: I&#39;ve been planning to subscribe for a while. I do now.Do it if $5 is pocket money for you.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some thoughts on the bigger picture-1: Really?  Do you have to write &#34;r-word&#34; instead of &#34;retard&#34; when you&#39;re writing about someone saying something?  What if Marc literally said &#34;r-word&#34; and I&#39;m vastly underestimating how woke this reporter is?  Wait, I have a solution. Use the actual word that a person said when quoting them.  Just write the exact sentence where you think Marc said the word retard.  Nobody should prosecute you for quoting someone without endorsing their opinion.  Obfuscating your reporting to avoid a word is bad writing style.1.5: Otherwise, the above seems to limit us to 26 taboo slurs in the English language.  A-word, b-word, c-word, ... There are other rude words, but there can only be a single r-word so bad that I mustn&#39;t spell it.  To prevent confusion, I have to completely spell/say the rest of the r-words.  What I&#39;m getting at is whole thing of not saying a word is silly.  Everyone knows that the c-word means cunt (at least in the USA).  If this wasn&#39;t common knowledge then you couldn&#39;t say c-word and have everyone know what you meant.  (Who decided that cunt was a worse word than chink anyway?  That&#39;s marginalizing Chinese people and totally not-woke. /s)2.  There are people that exaggerate and sensationalize something to get more views.  Some people are even fine trying to ruin someone&#39;s reputation.  But we are getting wise to these sorts of things.  If it&#39;s an isolated event these things kind of go away.  Even if Marc is on record once saying &#34;retard&#34; he&#39;s probably not a bad guy. Just from growing up in the 90&#39;s I&#39;ve easily said it a thousand times.  If I start to hear several other instances accusing Marc of using a slur and saying it in a hurtful manner then I&#39;ll revisit the issue."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"He&#39;s right. When I started writing in the 90&#39;s, there was an idea of journalism as telling stories in the principled defence of minority interests and as a public check on institutional power, but it has mutated into the unhinged and corrupt prosecution of deviance from official narrative lines. Social media is just a way for neighbours to denounce one another in a new snitch culture that rivals any 20th century system. I&#39;m usually a couple of years ahead of the curve on trends, and I even dropped Slack last year because it&#39;s not a place for real discourse."</p>

[...]&gt; I&#39;ve given in my resignation at my current place of employment and will be seeking an exclusively back-end role for my next adventureOh boy. I sympathise entirely with this post, but the story&#39;s exactly the same on the backend.Kubernetes. Docker. AWS and its gazillion impenetrable product names. The days of security updates, pentests, honeypots and captchas you have to go through in order to put up a webapp that won&#39;t be commandeered by (insert bad guy here) within hours.

Sorry."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s disheartening to explain this over and over again, but these frameworks are a-ok because user&#39;s expectations for the web have grown astronomically. The complicated web is here because users insist on interaction, and if any web page has more than around 10 interactions on it, the resultant complexity is best handled by a framework. I recently got to do a jQuery job for a client-- it wasn&#39;t a pleasant blast from the past but a kludgey swamp to slog through.The build pipeline complaint also strikes me as hollow. Create React App outputs folder you can drag and drop onto a  server and serve, same for Angular and I would assume Vue. Yes, it is a lot of JS from a ton of NPM libraries, but that&#39;s the trade-off when you get an entire ecosystem of code for free. If your application is security critical then consider either writing your own libraries or hosting security vetted copies of the libraries.The real reason to leave this industry is that it&#39;s all the same work at the end of the day. Despite what application you build, whether it&#39;s a social network, a security application or collaborative tool like Figma or Trello, it all runs together as a mish-mash of views, data and DOM elements. Unless you&#39;re really invested in the product, it becomes hard to maintain enthusiasm. You can only roll a CSS library, or auth scheme or API library so many times before you&#39;re ready to start some new adventures in coding."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a bit of hyperbole in the article, but it strikes a nerve.I originally came from Java and was so fed up with the hulking class lib and the arcane build systems sprinkled with Ant snippets and XML galore, so JS felt like a fresh breeze.AngularJS was a bit convoluted and the syntax was not nice. But OK, data binding was nice. Bit like dependency injection on the Java side made the code much harder to reason about but helped build certain classes of applications.Angular 4 was just WTF. Somewhat cleaner module system but now with a clunky OOP language instead of the elegant functional expressions that JS had and Java finally adopted. For which reason exactly?And I tried Vue which is a much lighter framework but like Angular, the build system is just retarded. Instead of many dozens of JARs with dozens of sub-dependencies, modern JS goes for the kill and literally imports several hundred of npm package with thousands of dependencies.And in the end, I end up having to use &#34;browserify&#34; to have JS running in a browser. It&#39;s a clowns world in IT, but modern JS really takes the cake. I&#39;m back in backend, solving real problems instead of wrangling my build chain."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve worked on the support side of the hosting industry for a Long Time. A few observations. 
1) Hosting is hard. It doesn&#39;t seem like it should be, but it is. cPanel simplifies and complicates it because you&#39;re locked into doing things The cPanel Way whether you like it or not.2) Hosting is getting more expensive because cPanel keeps jacking up prices, and I strongly suspect that this host threw in the towel due to the severity of the compromise but also the razor thin margins. Digging out from under it was likely more trouble than it was worth, especially if they didn&#39;t have insurance for this kind of thing.3) KEEP YOUR OWN BACKUPS. For the love of all data that is important, keep your own backups. Did I mention that anyone with a website on any provider on any continent should keep their own backups?
