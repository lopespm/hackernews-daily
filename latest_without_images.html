								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Sadly, note that the study talked about here [1] is investigating the effect of the N501Y mutation, not the more worrying E484K mutation found in the South African 501.v2 strain that likely does escape antibody drugs and reduces neutralization by convalescent sera from past infections. [2][1]: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.07.425740v1[2]: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.31.425021v1"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The bigger question I have is when will we be ready to confidently claim that the vaccine doesn’t just prevent symptoms but also prevents spread? (Edit: at the same or nearly the same 95% rate)I can’t see a human trial being able to show this, and contact tracing is overall so poor how long will we have to wait to not see a case that can be tracked back to a vaccinated individual before we are willing to agree that the vaccine is highly effective at stopping transmission?For example, by Feb 1 we will have millions of people who are effectively protected at least from symptoms due to vaccine. So e.g. by March 1, if we have no, or single digit, reported cases of 2-week post-jab transmission?The corollary is how durable is the effect?To fully reopen the economy you need some kind of consensus on where the truth lies to these two questions.I wonder if public health agencies will never really admit, but just the case count will start to dwindle and mitigations will start to lessen, without ever really coming out and admitting vaccinated people don’t need mitigations 2-weeks-post-jab.Similar to how we’ve never really admitted that people who’ve had COVID are immune and can no longer spread it.I think fundamentally gov’t is too afraid of having two classes of citizens, and mainly, that one class (the antibody negative class) lying that they are actually the other."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What worries me is that there doesn&#39;t seem to be some global coordination in the distribution of the vaccines. It looks more like an individual race, than a synchronized collective effort.In the scenario where only the old accept to get vaccinated, and the vaccine doesn&#39;t reach the required threshold to stomp the virus. The virus become manageable, the economy reopen but the virus run rampant in the asymptotic population slowly mutating over-time until it finds a variant that is resistant to the vaccine by successfully infecting a vaccinated person.And it just needs for this to happen in a large population cluster where the vaccination doesn&#39;t reach the threshold, either because they do not have access to the vaccine yet or because some fraction of the population decide to  not get vaccinated, for everyone to get screwed-up again.Then we get a new vaccine every year."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Okay. I was at Amazon too in that time frame, and I don&#39;t recall the Sun to Linux transition to be all that big a deal.Amazon was always at that time facing challenges on every front, the dot-com bubble breaking etc. There was a large build out of distribution centres around this time  that was very expensive.This was just one more of the challenges they faced. I may not have been senior enough to be privy to all the details, but I don&#39;t think this particular migration brought the company to near bankruptcy. That&#39;s a stretch.I think the big migration was the database, and it took time, and Oracle was having some difficulties with running on Linux. But we were already using Linux boxes on our desktops since 1999. Webservers had switched to Linux around 1999. And migrating core code base which mostly C/C++ with Java starting to appear to Linux was mostly a challenge for the infrastructure teams and one of those routine large projects that every company has. I don&#39;t recall anybody talking of bankruptcy for this reason."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From replies to that thread, it looks like there are multiple errors.One reply is from one of the original engineers working on EC2 that said this swapover had nothing to do with AWS and it&#39;s origins, and another reply is from a former distinguished engineer stating that they swapped from compaq/digital tru64 alpha servers, not sun."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well this was an interesting thread to see pop up.Hi, I&#39;m Zack, I was a Sr. Unix Administrator at AMZN in 1999 and worked alongside very talented folks like snovotny, lamont, yvette, grabatin, gborle, jamison, craig, and so many others. The responses from Benjamin Black and Peter Voshall are correct.We definitely were on DEC Tru64 at this time. Sun was running the big databases like ACB. I recall worries that obidos might not be able to build in a few months time so the engineer with the little corgi (Erik?) spiked out a linux build and then it was linux pizza boxes as quickly as we could build them.We built CMF and other things to handle mass provisioning but it was chaotic for quite a while. I don&#39;t recall anyone talking about what would later become AWS in those days."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; if you&#39;re in a real rush, just read Section (c)(1), which is only 26 words, and is the part that basically every single court decision (and there have been many) has relied on.&gt; (c) Protection for “Good Samaritan” blocking and screening of offensive material (1) Treatment of publisher or speaker
&gt; No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.Wouldn&#39;t repealing Section 230 mean more censorship and restrictions as the liability would be too great to be on the hook for what some random account might decide to publish, no?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Dismissive article that misrepresents both why &#34;normal&#34; people out there are unhappy about section 230 and what the higher levels of conversation about changing it really look like right now[1]. Articles like this are read meat for Hacker News. You endlessly reassert your political bias while pretending you are &#34;informing&#34; some imaginary group of stupid people (who in reality isn&#39;t even here to be &#34;informed&#34;).[1] Here is a recent discussion about 320 from a few lawyers and an YouTuber who used to work for the mainstream media:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a5H1A65wOMAs you will see if you watch the video, it is much more nuanced than the aggregate straw-man set up by the article....The crux of the issue is that Section 320 was drafted with a lot of assumptions in mind. At the time the Web was a fledgling thing. At the time Section 230&#39;s practical effect was to empower emerging platforms to do some common-sense moderation without fear of being held liable for all content they distributed.Does the law still has this effect? Yes, it does. But that is no longer the primary effect in terms of how this law affect most of the people out there. Today its primary effect is to give an impenetrable legal shield to giant tech corporations that engage in deliberate society-wide manipulation of information. That is what most people out there are unhappy about, even if they don&#39;t quite know how to phrase it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I started reading this in the smug knowledge that I knew it already, that I wasn&#39;t wrong about 230.But then I saw this passage:&gt; The &#34;user&#34; protections get less attention, but they&#39;re right there in the important 26 words. &#34;No provider or __user__ of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker....&#34; That&#39;s why there are cases like Barrett v. Rosenthal where someone who forwarded an email to a mailing list was held to be protected by Section 230, as a user of an interactive computer service who did not write the underlying material that was forwarded.I didn&#39;t know that! I guess I was wrong about Section 230 :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have never worked on Capitol Hill but I&#39;m going to go ahead and say this is misinformation. I did work for the DOD, and arguably the DOD does not have access to nearly as sensitive information as the State Department or at times Congress. The most basic procedures for classified information require that it be stored behind locked metal cages, in bank-style vaults, with encrypted hard drives, accessed via SMART cards, and transferred via an armed escort. When I left for Afghanistan there was one person carrying Top Secret information and the case it was carried in was handcuffed to him, not only was he armed but he had an armed escort as well.The notion or idea that some Congressperson has Classified+ information sitting behind a wood or glass door sounds highly suspicious.Edit: changed &#34;fake news&#34; to &#34;misinformation&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think it&#39;s a little bit beyond &#34;half&#34; baked, but I built a thing I call Logsuck last year: https://github.com/jackbister/logsuckThe idea is to have a free Splunk alternative which you can set up with just one binary. I use Splunk at work and love it, but it just doesn&#39;t seem like a product for solo developers (I can&#39;t even find a pricing page on splunk.com), and the primary free alternative, the ELK stack, seems a bit complicated to set up.I am sure that I&#39;ll never be competitive with Splunk or Elastic in terms of features or scalability but I&#39;m trying to build something that is at least useful for my own projects.I built it in Go and use SQLite with the FTS (https://sqlite.org/fts3.html) extension to store the log events in a way where they can be searched quickly."</p>

Also, perhaps its greatest form (like many things I&#39;ve made) might be as half-baked.Now the question is: do I make more?

					<h3><a href="https://lemire.me/blog/2021/01/06/memory-access-on-the-apple-m1-processor/">Memory access on the Apple M1 processor</a></h3>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25659615">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Great practical information. Nice to see people who know what they are talking about putting data out there. I hope eventually these persistent HN memes about M1 memory will die: that it&#39;s &#34;on-die&#34; (it&#39;s not), that it&#39;s the only CPU using LPDDR4X-4267 (it&#39;s not), or that it&#39;s faster because the memory is 2mm closer to the CPU (not that either).It&#39;s faster because it has more microarchitectural resources. It can load and store more, and it can do with a single core what an Intel part needs all cores to accomplish."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can&#39;t find any info about the memory bus of apple m1. Is it 8 channels 16 bit each? That&#39;s drastically different from AMDs 2 channels 64 bit each.It looks like apple m1 is much less eager when caching memory rows. Maybe because it doesn&#39;t have l3 cache.Edit: This test utilizes the 8x16bit memory bus of apple m1 fully. It&#39;s mostly just fetching random locations from memory, which can all be parallelized by the cpu pipeline. It explains why the results are exactly 4x slower on my ryzen 3 with 2 memory channels.So the summary is that m1 is optimized for dynamic languages that tend to do a DDOS attack on RAM with a lot of random memory access, but it might take a performance hit with compiled languages and traditional HPC techniques that tend to process data in sequence like ECS."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is the article saying that the M1 is slower than we would have expected in this case?My understanding, based on the article, is that  a normal processor, we would have expected 
    arr[idx] + arr[idx+1]
and
    arr[idx]
to take the same amount of time.But the M1 is so parallelized that it goes to grab both arr[idx] and arr[idx+1] separately.  So we have to wait for both of those two return. Meanwhile, on a less parallelized processor, we would have done arr[idx] first and waited for it to return, and the processor would realize that it already had arr[idx+1] without having to do the second fetch.Am I understanding this right?"</p>
