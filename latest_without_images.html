								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I will miss him terribly. He was the guy who let me crash in his room at Defcon when I was a minor and was too young to book my own room. This kicked off 20 years of friendship. He was brilliant, zany, ADD x 1000, and always endearing and loving.In 2008 I was lucky to collaborate on DNS issues with Dan when he discovered a new form of DNS cache poisoning and spent years helping the Internet upgrade and defend against a serious and significant vulnerability. We all owe him a debt of gratitude for this and so much of his other work.He was a hacker&#39;s hacker, and the guy you want in your corner. Very sad to hear this news."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember attending Dan Kaminsky’s talk at DEFCON 12 and being blown away by it. Three years later, I went on the original “Hackers on a Plane” trip and ended up seated next to Dan on one of the flights. We quickly became friends. His mentorship over the years had an enormous impact on me.We both went back to CCCamp in 2011. I excitedly told him about a reverse DNS scanning project (0.0.0.0/0 in 12 hours on AWS for like $50), and then we ended up talking about the Debian RNG bug and password security, walking around camp watching the lightning in the distance.When I was doing my original brainwallet research back in 2013 and cracked the woodchuck wallet the first thing I did after showing my ex (then girlfriend) was call him. I told him I’d found something but didn’t feel comfortable discussing over the phone. He invited me over.My ex and I hopped on BART headed into SF and met him at the loft he was living at above a motorcycle shop. We talked and carefully planned and then I accidentally made 250 BTC vanish.Dan looked at me and said “[my ex] and I are going to go for a walk and return with burritos. You’re going to calm down and have this fixed by the time we get back. It’ll be okay.”It was, and I did. I’d simply forgotten about change addresses for a brief moment of terror.I think the first time he mentioned wanting to hire me was a few months later at a Bitcoin conference in San Jose. He believed in me. I went on to work alongside him at White Ops (now known as Human Security) in 2014. He brought me on stage with him at DEFCON that year.He spent a lot of time helping me put together a CFP submission about my brainwallet research for DEFCON the following year and then helped me put together slides, rehearse, and had a professional help me refine everything. I couldn’t have done it without him.My wedding was about six weeks before DEFCON - Dan showed up in an Uber, about an hour late. He explained that he’d confused Menlo Park for Morgan Hill when planning to leave. I was just thrilled to have him there.Dan was a supportive friend, a great mentor, and a delightful colleague. I really can’t overstate what a positive impact he had on my life. It’s hard to believe he’s really gone. That I’ll never get to swap stories about our respective side projects with him again.I miss him.https://rya.nc/threads/dakami-eulogy.htmlhttps://twitter.com/ryancdotorg/status/1385989257638993922"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"RIP, Dan. I work with a lot of very smart people. So, I&#39;ve gotten a bit used to it and don&#39;t normally find myself in awe of many people&#39;s intelligence. Dan was a person that I was absolutely in awe of. The fist time I met him very long ago (almost 20 years), he showed me code he wrote to share movies through abused DNS slaves... building a p2p network like Napser/Gnutella from the technology. No one had ever thought of such a thing. I don&#39;t think anyone else in the world knew DNS well enough to be inspired to think of it. He was so kind and friendly to everyone. It was fun to talk with him about tech/security because he had such enthusiasm and excitement... like a little kid on Christmas or a puppy. :) I learned a lot from him. I have nothing but great memories of him. I remember once when someone hacked him. He even took that in good humor and didn&#39;t let it bother him."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Super excited for your project. I have been using map tiles from Mapbox, MapTiler, OSM Buildings for my project and am coming to the point that I need to merge elevation data with building height data in order to cast realistic shadows across the earth. Unfortunately elevation data and building data come from two different tile sets from two different tile providers and it&#39;s a lot of download/processing overhead to merge the two data sources. I need to make my own tiles!I spent part of today on the OSM wiki trying to wrap my head around Mapnik, how tiles are generated, how I am going to host this cheaply because my project is non-commercial, and then the HN gods smiled on me. Thank you for taking this on and I&#39;m coming along for this journey!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is very nice! Happy to see a few of my libraries in the dependencies :)Also check out https://github.com/kothic/kothic-js, an older but similar attempt at making a full-fledged map renderer using 2D Canvas. It has a pretty good label rendering in particular which you might find useful."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is really interesting to me. I do a lot of mapping of natural surface single track trails (for hiking and mountain biking) along the way be sure to properly name things, add intersection markers, and create relations (routes and superroutes) to document the systems.The biggest downside thus far is a good way of displaying the data. mtb.waymarkedtrails.org gets close, but I&#39;d really like something that displays relations in the specified color, has sane intersection markers, etc.I feel like there should be something out there which effectively lets me design a style sheet and then apply it to a map which I embed somewhere (maybe even in an app).This... feels like it? Or if not this, can any of you recommend another system?Ideally I&#39;d love something I can self-host. I tried getting a copy of waymarkedtrails going and then modifying that, but it&#39;s a bit too specialized and I kept running into quirks getting the toolchain set up.EDIT: Looks like this might not include the highway=path data that I need, much relations. Alas."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve kept an eye on Blender for the last 15 years and tried it again recently after having almost exclusively used Maya.  It&#39;s continually improved in just about every way, is relatively easy to use with just a trackpad, and it performs really well.In contrast, Maya is has more features overall but is... a piece of shit in many ways.  It doesn&#39;t matter what hardware I&#39;ve used; it&#39;s a rule that Maya has to crash randomly when doing basic things.  I used to be able to just open the Hypershade, but with Maya 2020 merely opening it causes the entire application to crash.So I&#39;ve decided to ditch it for Blender.  I&#39;m not doing character animation anymore, but I still enjoy modeling and rigging some things I want to conceptualize in 3D space, as well as create 3D printables, and Blender is absolutely up to the task.It kind of baffles me how little interest the motion picture and television industries have had in Blender.  Big studios are still using Maya, which I know also crashes for them and has performance issues.  They could pour all their money into improving Blender and eventually not have to pay Autodesk anymore for licenses for poorly managed software that seems to rarely receive bug fixes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Deprecation&gt; OpenCL rendering kernels. The combination of the limited Cycles split kernel implementation, driver bugs, and stalled OpenCL standard has made maintenance too difficult.I am not really up to date on the GPGPU world, but is OpenCL in such a bad shape that it is not really usable? If so that is very sad. Are there any alternative open hardware agnostic GPGPU apis or has CUDA eaten the entire market?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Watching Blender become more and more prominent over the last several years has been extremely satisfying. This looks like another great step."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Note how this is built in the &#34;stacked&#34; method, i.e. old school Lego.  Even with technical parts, this was uniquely accessible.  My proudest achievement was a smooth running, jamproof pump for elevating marbles; you can see it from about 0:27 in this old camcorder video:https://youtu.be/Mw3dUbRfMSw?t=24These Legos encouraged engineering thinking all the way and were the defining toy of my childhood.Modern Legos are stunning.  Look, for example, for the Rubik&#39;s cube solve machine that can twist a (lubricated) cube to completion in a few seconds.  However they&#39;re no longer stacked from bottom to top; they&#39;re built &#34;inside out&#34; and the best tool to come up with a design for them is probably a CAD program.  Stunning results for those who have put in the time, but not so encouraging for tinkerers just starting out.  So it&#39;s nice to still see &#34;old school&#34; stuff being built."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know a chem prof who built a Lego spectrometer. https://publiclab.org/wiki/lego-spectrometerLegos are just wonderful.edit: I know nothing about woodworking or crafting any building materials, but I always wish I could perform those types of projects. And whenever some potential project comes up, I think to myself, &#34;but I could build it with Legos.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s hard to believe that it&#39;s been over 50 years since humans have been outside of low earth orbit. It&#39;s like we sprinted forward so fast, going from horse drawn carriage to space flight in a generation, only to get frightened and recede back from the highest point, never to go back.Granted there has been an enormous amount of innovation in the last 50 years, but by some accounts we&#39;ve been going backwards. Humans are no longer capable of mach 3 flight, or making Roman concrete.I think we assume that technology will keep progressing. We assume Moore&#39;s law will continue into the future and we forget that there are people behind the progress. The technology that produced those pictures are gone, we might be able to take ones like them again, but never with the same rockets and never with the same photo-chemical processes. Progress is fragile, not inevitable and everything we have can be lost in a generation just as easily as it was made."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"FWIW, if you wanted to get the static from-scratch go image a lot smaller, try running the binary through UPX. It typically improves compiled go binary sizes by absurd amounts: https://upx.github.io/Also, https://busybox.net is a 1.0MB static binary that provides all of the standard posix-compliant tools (sh, grep, tail, etc) and actually comes with an httpd implementation. So if you wanted a more useful container at about 1MB, you could use it.Edit: here&#39;s a previous thread on UPX that has 80 comments talking about the tradeoffs it makes. You should definitely consider these if you intend to use UPX: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15456980"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing I&#39;m wondering -- why are people obsessed with container size? A lot of enterprise is Java shops which deal with huge dependencies, huge distributions, and generally pretty heavy software -- with internet speeds what they are today, it&#39;s not hard to throw 100-500MB around internal networks (building the code closer to the deployment area is also a solution). Even gigabyte size containers are not impossible to deploy these days with the right caching (lord help you if you invalidate a bunch of layers though).In a world of xTB thumbdrives, why are we so worried about containers being &lt;1MB? Security is one thing, minimalism is another, but I do sometimes wonder about this.Anyway, if you want to build minimal containers and want to do it with a bit more backing than this one (pretty well written) blog post, probably also check out distroless:https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distrolessI personally find most of the time alpine-based containers are more than small enough and good enough with nice ergonomics (sometimes you just want to shell in to the container), but maybe it makes sense to build containers with and without debugging/inspection tools (a `project:vx.x.x` and a `project:vx.x.x-debug`) and switch them out when problems arise."</p>

Then, after the helicopter hovers briefly, it will go into a slight tilt and move sideways for 7 feet (2 meters). Then Ingenuity will come to a stop, hover in place, and make turns to point its color camera in different directions before heading back to the center of the airfield to land.&#34;via https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/status/294/were-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In all the downward-facing images from Ingenuity, I find it surprising that the rotor blades have a lighter shadow than the rest of the helicopter. I asked about this on Twitter and was told the sensor for each pixel isn&#39;t fully shielded from light. The fast-moving rotor blades allow for latent light to enter into the sensor during the image scan, causing the rotor blade itself to appear slightly lighter.

No one in their right mind would leave a Jenkins server open for anyone to trigger some workflows.  It&#39;s silly that everyone effectively does that because they see some Github branding on a page and feel safer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Toyota was one of the leaders in just-in-time manufacturing, yet they&#39;re doing just fine with the chip shortage. They stockpile parts, and try to understand how they work in depth.&gt; After the [Fukushima] catastrophe severed Toyota’s supply chains on March 11, 2011, the world’s biggest automaker realised the lead-time for semiconductors was way too long to cope with devastating shocks such as natural disasters.&gt; That’s why Toyota came up with a business continuity plan (BCP) that required suppliers to stockpile anywhere from two to six months’ worth of chips for the Japanese carmaker, depending on the time it takes from order to delivery, four sources said.&gt; The sources said Toyota has another advantage over some rivals when it comes to chips thanks to its long-standing policy of ensuring it understands all the technology used in its cars, rather than relying on suppliers to provide “black boxes”.https://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-fukushima-anniversa..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Most comments I&#39;ve seen on this and other related articles on HN are too focused on the high-end chips doing fancy stuff. There are not only supply constraints on these sorts of high-compute chips, but also big shortages on practically all ICs in general.I&#39;m a hardware engineer for a medical device company, and we&#39;ve been dealing with supply constraints not only with our MCUs but other ICs like high-side power switches, LDOs, memory, and more. It&#39;s tough when we&#39;re low volume (a few thousand a year) and the huge automakers and other huge consumer electronics giants are gobbling up all the parts."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; What has made the auto industry particularly vulnerable is its reliance on just-in-time delivery, where parts are brought in when needed, rather than being stockpiled.It&#39;s fascinating that the response is to close production rather than increase prices.Those warning of inflation point to events like this as support. But inflation requires that higher producer costs be accepted by consumers.And for that price transmission mechanism to work, there needs to be supply actually available at the higher price. It appears that just-in-time economics mean that in the event of a shortage your supply just goes offline. You don&#39;t get higher prices, just empty shelves."</p>
