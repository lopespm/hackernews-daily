								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;&gt; The G7 group of advanced economies has reached a &#34;historic&#34; deal to make multinational companies pay more taxNo, it hasn&#39;t. Some finance ministers met and talked:&#34;Finance ministers meeting in London agreed to battle tax avoidance by making companies pay more in the countries where they do business. They also agreed in principle to a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% to avoid countries undercutting each other.&#34;I have no idea how it works in other countries, but in the US, finance ministers don&#39;t have the power to agree to treaties. Treaties in the US require a super-majority (two thirds) vote in the Senate. Unless Mitch McConnell has signed off on this, the G7 group of advanced economies did not reach a deal on anything. I don&#39;t even see the word &#34;Senate&#34; in the entire article.US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen can tell reporters whatever she wants. Without buy-in from Republicans in the Senate, finance ministers agreeing &#34;in principle&#34; amounts to finance ministers agreeing that if they had ham, they could make ham and eggs, if they had eggs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The first proposal of having a minimum corporate tax rate probably doesn&#39;t mean a lot because you to then start policing what subsidies governments give to effectively discount below 15%.The more interesting part is what I hope is the start of serious efforts to tackle profit-shifting, which is a name invented for &#34;transfer pricing&#34; because that is technically illegal. But it&#39;s the same thing.A good starting point is that if you book x% of your revenue in country A then country A should get to tax x% of your profit.Here&#39;s another part of this they should adopt: borrowing money should count as repatriating profits. In the era of zero interest rates debt is used to effectively defer taxes forever. There&#39;s no legitimate reason to allow entities to borrow money at near-zero interest rates instead of repatriating retained earnings."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I do wonder if we wouldn&#39;t be better off eliminating corporation tax entirely.The revenue of a corporation can, roughly, be:1. Spent on goods or services from another company (including freelancers, contractors, etc.)2. Spent on rent3. Spent on capital purchases4. Spent on wages5. Spent on debt repayment or other forms of financing6. Paid out in dividends7. Spent on share buybacks8. Invested in something elseItems 1-5 are all good things that we want companies to do, and corporation tax is normally applied after this spending is accounted for. Items 6 and 7 ought to be taxed, and frequently are (dividends and buybacks create income for individuals who will pay tax on that income). Item 8 is a bit vaguer, but probably shouldn&#39;t be taxed in most cases (if we&#39;re worried about companies parking cash in very low-risk assets, then super-low yields are effectively a tax on that anyway).All that the corporation tax adds to this picture is the creation of work in tax avoidance services, and an unjust inequality between those firms that can afford those services and are structured to take advantage of the rules, and those that can not and are not.It&#39;s not obvious to me that corporation tax /can/ be fixed, and so it may be better simply to scrap it and replace it with something more difficult to dodge.EDIT: formatting"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s JPEG 2000, which is nothing like classic JPEG. It doesn&#39;t have the artifacts classic JPEG introduces at sharp edges, so you can read text. It has more color depth if you want it. It also doesn&#39;t mess up non-color data such as normal maps the way classic JPEG does.JPEG 2000 is not used much. Decoding is slow, and encoding is slower. The decoders are either buggy or proprietary. It has way too many options internally. 
The big users of JPEG 2000 are medical. It has a &#34;lossless&#34; mode, and medical imagery is usually stored lossless because you really don&#39;t want compression artifacts in X-rays.(I&#39;ve been struggling with JPEG 2000 recently. Second Life and Open Simulator use it for asset storage. Some images won&#39;t decompress properly with OpenJPEG, a free decoder. I finally found out why. There&#39;s a field used for &#34;personal health information&#34; in JPEG 2000. This is where the patient name and such go in a CAT scan. That feature was added after the original version.  Some older images apparently have junk in that field, which causes problems.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The XVideo extension, commonly used by MPlayer (at least in the past, maybe still?), has supported sending YUV images to your video card for 20½ years, since XFree86 4.0.2: https://www.cs.ait.ac.th/~on/mplayer/en/xv.htmlThere are various problems in XVideo that make it hard to use for general application display, but the fact that this was a thing they included in it makes me think that a substantial number of video cards have included YUV decoding capability in hardware since the previous millennium."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the challenges with Y&#39;CbCr (what Carmack is calling &#34;YUV&#34;) is that there are so many flavors.He mentions 4:2:0 chroma subsampling. But he doesn&#39;t mention chroma siting. Or alternative sumbsampling schemes. Or matrix coefficients. Or full-range vs video-range (a.k.a. JPEG vs MPEG range). Heck, how you even arrange subsampled data varies by system (many libraries like planar; Apple likes bi-planar; etc.).I&#39;d love to see more support for rendering subsampled Y&#39;CbCr formats so you don&#39;t have to use so much RAM, but it gets complicated quick."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The timeline of browser extensibility is quite fascinating. There&#39;s really not a single place that covers all of it, so I decided to research my own timeline/history:  - Consumer web browsers (1993-)
  - Plug-ins (1995-2015ish)
  - User Style Sheets (1998-2019)
  - Bookmarklets (1998–)
  - Browser Extensions (1999–)
  - Mozilla XUL (1997–2017)
  - Alternative Browser Distributions (2004–)
  - Userscripts (2005–)
  - Converging on the WebExtensions API (2017–)
  - Manifest V3 (2021–)
  - No/Low-Code Browser Extension Builders (2021–)

Here&#39;s a link to the blog post with my research: https://medium.com/brick-by-brick/a-brief-history-of-browser...Also, if you care about browser extensibility, join the w3 group (it&#39;s free) and watch the GitHub repo!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is their charter: https://github.com/w3c/webextensions/blob/main/charter.mdAnd the twitter announcement from the co-chair: https://twitter.com/xeenon/status/1400862543673921536I&#39;m cautiously optimistic that this will work well, but somewhat concerned that this will cause Manifest V3&#39;s de facto limits on ad blocking and the like to become endemic. It will be interesting to see how they balance &#34;compatibility with popular existing extensions&#34; against their foundational focus on security and privacy."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;Cumulative layout shift is supposed to measure whether your site shifts around while it&#39;s loading, but it&#39;s so strict that even Google Translate fails the test.And so it should be. There&#39;s hardly anything worse than having things shift around after you start reading, scrolling or clicking on something.I think it&#39;s a very good sign if Google&#39;s own sites fail these tests. It means the tests are meaningful."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; It&#39;s causing a fair amount of panic, because 96% of sites fail the test.Good. That sounds like a realistic estimation of the number of slow and bloated websites. What good are nice animations and designs when they destroy the UX?You&#39;ll never see someone gaming in 4k with hardware that can&#39;t render it with more than 15FPS. Yet we see that kind of &#34;tradeoff&#34; every time we browse the web. Users get loading times for the site itself, then processing of JS to redundantly do the browser&#39;s job of arranging the 20 layers of &lt;div&gt;s, then loading animations for the actual contents, and then a couple seconds after that you might get the first thumbnails.And I&#39;m absolutely not surprised Google&#39;s pages fail this test as well; Everything from Google Images to YouTube got increasingly worse with every new design iteration, with both slower loading times as well as an increase in breakage."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Im actually surprised how good YT comes out in this. The page is a dumpster fire:Before Polymer (current YT framework) YT video page weighted somewhere around 50KB (10KB compressed) and was ordinary HTML + 1MB js player (400KB compressed). As soon as HTML part loaded the page was all there.Now its 600KB (100KB compressed) JSON + additional 8MB desktop_polymer.js (1MB compressed) that needs to be compiled/interpreted before it even starts building the page client side and anything starts showing up. 1MB js player is on top of that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Yep.  It is not surprising at all that the term “insulting” appears three times because that’s how it feels for so many reasons.Remember:- They pretend with a straight face like it was somehow impossible to sell software or reach customers before their magical store made it happen.- They pretend like the current “search” feature of the App Store is not a sad reduction of what it used to be (or what it could be if a trillion dollar company put any effort into it at all).- They pretend to have all these problems hosting apps that are somehow solved by fees, while completely ignoring all the free apps that clearly tax that same infrastructure.- They conveniently ignore the absurd amount of money they must be making from scams that are constantly top-grossing to add insult to injury.I could go on but there are entire blogs written about this by now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the core sentiment here is being lost.This isn’t so much a call to action against Apple’s fees.It’s pointing out something that I’ve felt building over the last couple of years out of Apple, which is an attitude of hubris, contempt, and a “taking for granted” of Apple’s developers.The WWDC spiel of how much they value us has become trite and transparent.They do produce some really nice tools and APIs. I can’t knock what they provide developers.But often times the attitude beneath the veneer is a precursor of things to come, and it’s becoming noticeable that Apple’s culture seems to care less about its developers now than before.You might say “sure, but so what? Developers are part of the means to an end of selling stuff”, and you’re not wrong.But one of the things I loved about Apple circa 2009 was their respect for their user. It was palpable and magical, even.Then, learning Cocoa and Interface Builder coming from Eclipse and Java, that same respect seemed to permeate their dev environment as well.That seems lost. Following some of their tech leads on Twitter exposes some rather vitriolic feelings towards people in general.Customers, be they users or devs, deserve respect. Apple used to be great at giving that respect. I fear it’s slipping away culturally, and is worth calling out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At D5 [1], What did Steve &amp; Bill Gate admire in the other?Bill: Steve’s taste,Steve: Microsoft’s ability to partner.Apple is basically repeating a lot of their early mistakes. Some of those lessons Steve took it to heart when he returns to Apple from NeXT.&gt;This isn’t about the 30%, or the 15%,.......It’s about what Apple’s leadership thinks of us and our work.There is also another point Marco didn&#39;t mention. It is not your customers either. Apple has been very clear in all of their communications. The user of iPhone, are Apple&#39;s customers. Even the third party Apps, they are accessing Apple&#39;s customers. And hence the relationship is very much not a partnership. Since Apple claims  ownership on both the Apps and the customers. In the name of privacy and user experience.&gt;but Apple uses their position of power to double-dip.Finally! Someone in the Apple community use the term double-dip! A term Apple has used against Qualcomm and sent a whole PR team to damage their reputation.&gt;But the leaders have already shown us who they really are, what they really think of us, and how little they value our work.Unfortunately Tim Cook isn&#39;t the type of person who understand this. You should probably listen to his testimony to make your own judgement. But after the Epic Vs Apple trial it became very clear why Steve said Tim Cook isn&#39;t a product person. There are quite possibly zero product sensibility within Tim Cook. And I am not sure who is in-charge of the PR now either. Their message are delusional, hypocritical and reminds me a lot of Google in the 00s.   I missed Katie Cotton&#39;s era.[1] (76:30 ) https://on.wsj.com/2zWWqPU"</p>
