But except for a brief period in 2010 where we thought we could kill it, SQL is the one technology that has stayed around.  It might be the only TECHNICAL knowledge I learned in the first year of my career that is still relavent.  You&#39;re probably not making the wrong decision if you decide to build on top of SQL."</p>

I&#39;m a lead on the project, so sharing some quick info below and happy to answer any questions.Steampipe is open source [1] and uses Postgres foreign data wrappers under the hood [2]. We have 84+ plugins to SQL query AWS, GitHub, Slack, HN, etc [3]. Mods (written in HCL) provide dashboards as code and automated security &amp; compliance benchmarks [3]. We&#39;d love your help &amp; feedback!1 - https://github.com/turbot/steampipe

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Steampipe killed my startup.  I couldn&#39;t be happier about it.I started a company six years ago to do exactly this -- make a SQL interface for the AWS API.  Steampipe out-executed us and made a way better product, in part because their technology choices were much smarter than ours.  I shut down the startup as soon as I saw steampipe.I wish them all the best, it&#39;s a great product!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Why do I always get a bad feeling about the motivations behind stuff like this? I want to believe it&#39;s for better privacy and security, but it&#39;s being driven by a corporation or two, and that makes me 100% suspicious. Like, for example, suddenly Edge is no longer respecting local DNS options and my pihole protects one fewer device from the real dangers to privacy. I don&#39;t want to be cynical so often, but this really doesn&#39;t feel like a benevolent move. Yeah, it&#39;s conditional at the moment, but as with Chrome and manifest v3, among many other examples, I&#39;m losing my faith that anything with the potential to increase ad revenue will remain turned off for long."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; the VPN will automatically connect when you’re using public Wi-Fi or browsing unsecured networks and sites lacking a valid HTTP certificate.OK, that&#39;s actually a pretty decent idea. It&#39;s not going to be always-on, but it&#39;s providing security specifically for things like coffeeshops/libraries and for sites that don&#39;t provide their own security. In other words, it&#39;s &#34;backup security&#34;, not rerouting all of your &#34;normal&#34; secure traffic at work/home.This mainly protects sites you visit from having JavaScript injected into them by networks when there aren&#39;t any other protections, and the VPN is run by Cloudflare so it will be performant, so I don&#39;t really see any problems here? Seems like a positive development actually."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the article, this is powered by a partnership with Cloudflare. It&#39;s worth noting that until August 6 of this year, Cloudflare&#39;s WARP VPN would leak your IP address - but only to sites using the Cloudflare network.https://web.archive.org/web/20220609160341/https://developer...And when Cloudflare released their new SOPs for Warp, they did so in a blog post titled &#34;More features, still private&#34; - https://blog.cloudflare.com/geoexit-improving-warp-user-expe... as referenced in https://developers.cloudflare.com/warp-client/known-issues-a...Microsoft&#39;s initial announcement for the feature touted that IP addresses would be masked, and one imagines that they did their diligence with Cloudflare and are enforcing the strong practices that WARP has now rolled out more broadly.But it&#39;s worth noting that you&#39;re routing through a company to whom the words &#34;still private&#34; encompassed leaking client IP address information to Cloudflare&#39;s hosting customers as recently as two months ago."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Google has historically been protective of their front page, why now?Probably for the same reason that Google is shutting down Stadia [1] and cutting staff [2], and the same reason that we see roughly one announcement of layoffs here on Hacker News every week: most people expect that we are going into a recession. For example, see the price of major indexes like the S&amp;P 500 or the NASDAQ and plot it on a 10+ year timescale.What surprises me the most actually is how quickly Google can adapt to the situation. Basically, they have been giving out candy for free when there was lots of money coming and now that they expect less, they quickly put on extra income streams and cut out money losers.[1]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33022768[2]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32927848"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Notably, this is not Google showing random search/display ads.Those look like ads for Google&#39;s own product.I don&#39;t think this is the first time. IIRC, Google used to show an ad for Chrome if you used the search from any other browser."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It was inevitable, you gotta get the infite growth from somewhere. Ane the next move will +1 this and so on, until google becomes less attractive than leaner competition. Because of inertia, legacy and people benefitting from the status quo, they won&#39;t be able to correct course.This is textbook &#34;how empire falls&#34; and why things that seem indestructible eventually dies like anything else.This will be the mile stone people will remember as the first sign of google decline."</p>

Make a YouTube video talking about the pain you went through, all the things you learned that you didn&#39;t get to give to people, and see what kind of hype you can salvage.Or just get it on HN and tell people where they can buy your game?"</p>

Not surprised that most people weren&#39;t confident about Stadia.But it&#39;s also baffling when there were so many running services and standalone products already. Steam Link, Nvidia Geforce Now, Xbox Cloud Gaming, Playstation Remote Play, Parsec etc. It&#39;s not like Google had a brand new open field ahead of them and no idea what to do"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"IMHO: Google is handling a bunch of things, including Stadia, and including GCP, in a very poor way.GCP: copycat of AWS, but with less high margin, higher level services, so have been losing money since the beginning (ask some of Alphabet&#39;s board members, if you can, and watch their eyes rolling). The only thing that could have given them the advantage - not, not Kubernetes, although K was and is a great thing to fund - was a &#34;cloud in a box&#34; product, so companies could install a rack of GCP in their existing Data Centers, and use it. See &#34;The Cloud Wars of 2017&#34;, written by me [0] six years ago.Stadia: you can&#39;t build Stadia without getting into account that the market has one big monopoly (Steam), and a few huge other ones (Xbox, Epic, etc). The strategy has simply been to ignore this simple fact. It&#39;s like Netflix building a streaming service, without a huge investment into content as well. Doomed to fail from the get go.Small rant, no horses in this game on my part; just a pity that two huge opportunities were wasted like this.[0]: https://medium.com/simone-brunozzi/the-cloud-wars-of-2017-ac..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We really just need a group like ConsumerReports, Labdoor, WireCutter or something that actually digs into the quality and claims of devices. Very few people are going to buy 30 competing options as well as a known good control and compare and contrast them in a scientific context, but that&#39;s what&#39;s needed.I remember looking around for a Radon sensor for way too long. An electronic device, a litmus-like strip test, some analog crystal ball -- hell a mail-in lab kit bag of carbon -- but they all seemed inaccurate. The few people that &#34;bought two&#34; always showed heavy variance while the majority that bought and got a number *loved it*. Even buying two that agree often just means the products are consistently and predictably wrong, but most products don&#39;t even check this box ffs.Reviewers that try and apples-to-apples all products by comparing cost, size, advertised features and ergonomics are doing no better than you or I opening up a package and appraising it. For awhile this Google dev was putting up extremely detailed amazon reviews for USBC cables based on their purported features v. reality and it was wonderful, but tucked away and undiscoverable.The world needs multiple parties providing unbiased in-depth reviews, but there&#39;s very little will to pay for even one group to do something like this. Ironically, paying for information in the information age seems almost comical to today&#39;s consumers and while there&#39;s demand for good information, no one&#39;s willing to open their wallets. Labdoor moved from subscription-only memberships to &#34;certified products&#34; and affiliate links because everyone wants to know what&#39;s in their multivitamin, but no one wants to pay for an indepth review. We aren&#39;t cultivating a supply-side that works for us, but against us.The result of this is shilling and fake reviews running wild. I mean hell, consumers will buy a product knowing full well they might get a shoddy knock off and yet it&#39;s $5 less and they can get it tomorrow so they&#39;ll roll the dice. Sadly, we don&#39;t live in a world where people are intimately concerned with quality and accuracy in their purchases.edit: USBC not USB3"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My cheap co2 sensor shows dramatically different readings for my office with the window closed vs open. It is great at reminding me to crack my window open to get more air flow.Its temperature sensor is within a couple degrees of my nest&#39;s remote sensor.My Amazon vo2 sensor can tell if I turned my kitchen fan on to a sufficient level to clear out whatever I am cooking.Lots of sensors don&#39;t need to be precise, they just need to indicate if some action needs to be taken.e.g. If there is a fire, I just need the alarm to go off, I don&#39;t care how hot the fire is."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Relative VOC measurements at least are able to detect a no. 2 in nappies. Great to distinguish if you should go in and change them or would be a distraction from falling to sleep when checking. I bulit a Pi ZeroW that measures on the side of the bed and publishes a curve of the last hour of the values. You can see a pretty salient drop when &#34;it&#34; happens."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"OSM needs some form of gamification adding to it.Google Maps app is great, lets you gain points by adding information &amp; photos &amp; reviews etc. They even send you a free bespoke pair of socks or a badge if you&#39;re active enough. So fun to add photos and then see how many views they get (I posted one of a chippy in Scotland (for Americans that&#39;s Fish &amp; Chip &#39;Thick French Fries&#39; shop) which got over 1.4 million views - mental). The location history feature suggests things  to contribute which helps too.Would be good to have something similar to make contributing fun."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When looking at these then/now renderings, one needs to take into account, that only very little of the actual data is rendered on those maps.The database contains an incredible level of detail which can be used in completely different contexts and I&#39;d say what&#39;s rendered is roughly only 1/10th of the data"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"OpenStreetMap is very very good. In many ways, I prefer it to Apple and Google.But the 2022 version suffers from a number of issues that Google and Apple are both suffering from recently: a lack of focus on who this map is for. Is this map ornamental? Or is it for driving? Walking? Finding tourist locations? What is it for?One of the obvious changes in OSM between 2012 and 2022 is the addition of building footprints at the cost of removing a lot of street names. At this scale, do footprints really help? Am I planning a walk and need to know the street name where I will turn? When you are close to a destination, yes the footprints help one identify the correct building. But not here.Here&#39;s a Google Maps example: if you put Canada&#39;s Yukon Territory into frame, does it show you the major roads? No. Does it show you any roads? No. Even if you select &#34;traffic&#34; it doesn&#39;t get the hint that you care about driving. It just wants to show you a map of geography.And now an Apple Maps example: put California into frame. Freeways and two-lane roads are shown as thin lines that are nearly invisible. Good luck planning a route with this map! Want to go from Point A to B? It can do it! But want to consider side trips or general routing yourself? Nope.There&#39;s still no adequate substitute for a AAA map for driving. I suspect hikers, bikers, and walkers are also poorly served by these non-specialized maps too."</p>

It really sucks when it&#39;s services like AdSense because you&#39;re just screwed forever.I really really wish the internet was more supportive of &#34;early hackers&#34; who want to experiment. I get that there are tons of implications around contract law and child labor here, but there really needs to be an escape hatch if a parent agrees to whatever activity is being done.
