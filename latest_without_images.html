								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Crypto people love to say “it’s the early days.”But it’s not. Bitcoin is 13 years old. At that age, Windows was on &gt;90% of the world’s computers. Java at age 13 had taken over enterprise software and was about to conquer mobile via Android. Cryptos are used by maybe 0.1% of computer users (if we’re very generous about what exactly constitutes usage). Considering the amount of investment they are an expensive failure by any normal metrics like monthly active users.It’s not the early days. Rather these are the last days for VCs to sell you this tired old thing before the novelty wears off, and that’s why they are so frantic about pushing it via Hollywood celebrities and whoever else they can muster with money."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nothing in here that hasn&#39;t been said in the last 10 year. It&#39;s tempting to dismiss it as a bubble. But; most bubbles don&#39;t get 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th... etc. chances. Every time bitcoin crashes people say &#34;this one is different, this time it&#39;s dead for real&#34;, then it bounces back. It&#39;s proving to be far more cockroach like than anyone anticipated.In the more distant future, if bitcoin survives, its utility will just be one thing, it will be regarded as a unit of measuring transaction value independent of any government. It will not be a replacement for any sovereign currency. Just this extra tool out there in the ether of finance. Notions of store of value, blockchain, proof of work etc. will be regarded as implementation details of achieving a global unit of account. Think of it like the SI unit of value, kilogram, meter, bitcoin. It&#39;s still far too illiquid to serve that purpose now; but, once it has at least an order of magnitude larger market cap it may."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the biggest drawbacks for blockchain is that transactions can&#39;t be revoked after the fact (with the only exception being costly forks of the entire ledger), and there&#39;s no additional human oversight (like I&#39;d get when sending a large amount of money through a bank) to protect me.If someone steals my credit card, I have my credit card company to give me some level of protection. They can block transactions if they think it&#39;s stolen, and if I report it as stolen I can claw back money from fraudulent purchases.If I purchase something and don&#39;t get what I paid for, I can contest it with customer service or my credit card company.With crypto, a software flaw used to steal crypto can kill an entire company. They&#39;re largely powerless to stop it once the transaction has gone through.With crypto, a xss attack or a misplaced password can cost me all of my coins.With crypto, I have to triple check the address I&#39;m sending coins to because I can&#39;t undo it.With crypto, I have to spend what&#39;s sometimes a significant amount of money just to complete a transaction, and transactions can take minutes or hours to complete.I think there&#39;s a future in crypto but we&#39;re in the dotcom boom days of it where most of the value is in speculation (and I suppose illegal purchases on the darknet). I&#39;ll wait for crypto 2.0."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t think this is limited to Russian oligarchs, I thought that because of its trust and crown dependencies system, London is a popular place for people to hide this kind of stuff. Russian oligarchs and other unsavory individuals like corrupt leaders in Africa, the Middle East and the developing world all dump their ill gotten gains into the opaque system away from prying eyes. The stuff you can actually see, like mansions in Knightsbridge are probably just the tiniest tip of the iceberg, everything else is held in such opaque ways that nobody even knows who it actually belongs to. It is so blatant that you couldn&#39;t really call it a dirty secret."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"London is known as &#34;The Laundry&#34; in Russia. No one in power has cared for two decades and only care now because it serves their interests to. Maybe they will crack down on it, maybe it will get swept under the rug again if the Russian invasion of Ukraine dies down as an important news story, either way, the root issue of why this was allowed in the first place won&#39;t be addressed and it will continue to occur with nationals of other countries."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am realistically wondering now, what changes does this bring. 
If London won&#39;t be interesting anymore for oligarchs, what will happen with prices of accomodation in center? 
If Switzerland is not a neutral country anymore, where will the money go?There should be prisoners dilemma and therefore some country should emerge to fill this &#34;market need&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The scary thing is that it&#39;s easy to see how something how like this could drive a market boom and bust cycle. I&#39;m imagining a scenario where two iBuyer companies try to outbid each other algorithmically, driving the prices further and further out of reach of people who are looking for a primary home.Tangentially related, I talked to a friend who works on geospatial data for one of the big vacation rental companies, and he was remarking how many homes in many desirable areas are now rentals. It&#39;s not that uncommon to see nearly entire neighborhoods converted to short term rentals now in some areas where they&#39;re still legal. Hearing that really depressed me.We often talk about automation in terms of replacing various types of labor, but I&#39;ve become really interested in automation creating adverse market incentives for smaller market participants because that&#39;s exactly what buying real estate right now feels like.It&#39;s honestly quite scary how I&#39;m in the top 2% of income earners in my generation and yet I could barely afford to buy a small place in a semi-desirable area.   I can easily see myself not being able to compete in algorithmically dominated markets flush with venture cash in the future and I earn more than just about everybody I know today."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recently bought a home. We toured a Zillow home, and I can understand what they were going for and where they failed.We were able to pull up to the driveway, book a tour for that minute, and walk in the front door. It was almost a magical experience compared to the process of finding and going to showings. The listings were clear and thorough. The experience was extremely compelling.The downside: the homes were absurdly overpriced. I bought a home for about 10% less than the last Zillow listing. For less, I got three times the land, 40% more square footage, a better location, updated appliances, new carpets, landscaped back yard, horseshoe driveway, two car garage. Almost zero effort had been put into modernizing the Zillow home and it showed.I suspect if I had come in with a very low offer, they&#39;d have accepted it. But for what?If I was Zillow, I&#39;d have licensed the tech to realtors. I&#39;d definitely be inclined to buy a home through them if they weren&#39;t the ones selling the property directly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was at Zillow for many years and left in 2020. On the tech side the pivot into iBuying was absolutely bonkers. The message from senior leadership was basically: I have no idea what your teams should be working on but it’s definitely not what they are currently working on so stop that and figure something else out.This has nothing directly to do with their market failure but they probably are driven by the same leadership problems."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is very interesting, but I can’t help but feel that a glass bottle with a metal cap (and one of those Dutch condiment spatulas) would be just fine for all these applications and also be more easily and effectively reused and recycled.I re-use jam jars for food storage, drinking glasses, mini herb gardens, etc. and could incorporate bottles, jars, and other glass containers into a variety of needs around the house if they were designed with second and third lives in mind.Add in health effects of microplastics/chemical leaching and glass is again a winner.Transportation costs and breakage are perhaps higher, but maybe that’s a cost we should accept?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"C&#39;s most infamous parsing difficulty is:    A * B;

Is it A multiplied by B, or B declared as a pointer to A? It can&#39;t be resolved without a symbol table. But there&#39;s another way that works very well: it&#39;s a declaration. The reason is simple. The multiply has no purpose, and so nobody would write that. C doesn&#39;t have metaprogramming, so it won&#39;t be generating such code as an edge case (unless using the preprocessor for metaprogramming, in which case you deserve what you get).But there&#39;s a worse problem:    (A) - B

Is it A minus B, or casting negative B to type A? There&#39;s just no way to know without a symbol table. One might think who would write code that has a vacuous set of parentheses around an identifier? It turns out they don&#39;t, but they write macros that parenthesize the arguments, and the preprocessed result has those vacuous parentheses.D resolves both issues with:1. if it parses like a declaration, it&#39;s a declaration2. a cast expression is preceded by the keyword `cast`and D is easy to parse without a symbol table."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; My problem is that C was elevated to a role of prestige and power, its reign so absolute and eternal that it has completely distorted the way we speak to each other. Rust and Swift cannot simply speak their native and comfortable tongues – they must instead wrap themselves in a grotesque simulacra of C’s skin and make their flesh undulate in the same ways it does.Lol at this. Love this eloquent style, and pretty much agree. However, C&#39;s reign is not absolute. Virgil compiles to tiny native binaries and runs in user space on three different platforms without a lick of C code, and runs on Wasm and the JVM to boot. I&#39;ve invested 12+ years of my life to bootstrap it from nothing just to show it can be done and that we can at least have a completely different userspace environment. No C ABI considerations over here. It can be as romantic as just you and the kernel in Virgil land. Heh."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article is hard to parse because it doesn&#39;t present any alternatives that the author considers better.- You have to speak the C ABI to talk to the OS -- yes, if you want an OS to support more than one language, or you want multiple languages within a single process, you need a common ABI of some sort.  What is the alternative that doesn&#39;t involve a common ABI?- C has too many ABIs -- yes, there are a lot of different kinds of hardware, and sometimes multiple software ecosystems evolved in parallel on the same hardware (eg. Windows and Linux).  What is the alternative?- ABI changes are hard to make in a non-breaking way -- yes they are.  It&#39;s fundamentally a hard problem.  You could compile everything from source every time, but the open-source world seems to have decided that there isn&#39;t enough time or CPU power to &#34;live at head&#34; and build from source every time, like Google does: https://abseil.io/about/philosophy#we-recommend-that-you-cho...  (Disclosure: I work at Google).- &#34;You Can’t Actually Parse A C Header&#34; -- this is, IMO, the most actionable objection that the article raises.  You could imagine a subset of C that does away with macros, typedefs, etc. in order to be easier to parse, and in doing so forms a more accessible ABI specification language.  That seems eminently doable.  But parsing is only part of the overall battle: actually implementing the ABI for 176 triples seems like the bigger problem.  Especially when you add the ABI-impacting function attributes mentioned in the tweet.As a C fan, it&#39;s hard to see the language itself blamed for what are (in my view) just fundamentally difficult problems."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A few years back I was in a role where it was my job to maintain a small but non-trivial open source project (~1500 github stars, 5 core contributors). I burned out after about two years in that role. People repeatedly demanding help in the github issues without even providing repro steps.  Hate mail to the project email list from users angry we didn&#39;t implement the feature they want in the latest release. We had people second-guessing all the time if we didn&#39;t ship the things they wanted or they disagreed with the decisions we made. Some people just like to get in touch to let you know your work sucks.The worst was the CEO of a small competitor company repeatedly hassling me over slack DMs and in github issues threads shamelessly trying to get me to prioritize free work that he wanted for his clients. Separately, over a period of several weeks, this same person asked me a ton of support questions and then compiled my answers without edits or attribution into a &#34;white paper&#34; he used as a resource to get people into the marketing funnel for his consulting shop. I came to hate that guy, such an asshole, but I couldn&#39;t totally block him because his company was a member of the open source foundation governing the ecosystem of tools my project was under.Honestly, it was hell. The most stress and irritation I&#39;ve ever had in any job. When I started the job I thought it was a dream getting paid to do open source, but now I consider that an anti-goal for any future role."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Most of the comments here remind me of the famous Neil Gaiman quote, &#34;George R.R. Martin is not your bitch.&#34; [1] But I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the right framing. People buy the first book because they hope there will be a second, even though they haven&#39;t paid for that second book and hence are not entitled to it. People use your open-source project because you said, hey, here&#39;s this exciting new thing, try it out, so they assume you&#39;d also want to listen when it doesn&#39;t quite work as it should. That&#39;s not about a false sense of entitlement or callousness on the part of your users at all. It&#39;s also not about freeloading, because a lot of those pull requests and issues on Github will be coming from people who publish their own open-source software. Instead, it&#39;s about managing expectations, like the post does. Put a big &#34;this project is not maintained&#34; warning on top, and nobody will bother you. Although I do understand that for larger active projects, it can be hard to explain to users exactly where on the spectrum between &#34;don&#39;t bother me&#34; and &#34;I&#39;ll fix your problem yesterday&#34; you are, and the bigger a project gets, the more likely you&#39;ll be to encounter people who enjoy exploiting your free labor.[1] https://journal.neilgaiman.com/2009/05/entitlement-issues.ht..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So much this. I&#39;m glad he put this out there. I&#39;ll start linking to it too.There seems to be a common misconception about open source. When I release software as open source, it does not mean I work for you for free, need to provide you with anything, even need to be nice to you. I may. Or I may not.When I release software under an open source license, then we have a very specific deal. You are entitled to do certain things with the software, for example use it free of charge, or change it, or redistribute it, and I&#39;m entitled to certain things in return, for example you keep attribution, you publish changes that you made under the same license, etc. Nothing more, nothing less. I could be an individual that hacked something in their free time, or I&#39;m a multi-national mega-corp. Does not matter. It just means we have a deal.It&#39;s nice if a community emerges, and if I feel like it, I may participate in it. And accept pull requests or help with troubleshooting or implement new features. But I don&#39;t have to and I don&#39;t have to feel any obligation whatsoever. Anybody who thinks otherwise has misunderstood the concept or is maliciously misusing it.That&#39;s it.This is misunderstood not just by users, but even by creators themselves. They feel pressure, they feel bad if they don&#39;t respond in time, or implement new requested features, or accept pull requests. They shouldn&#39;t. Open source just means I published it once with a very specific deal. I may continue to do so if it makes sense to me, but I can also just stop doing so. I implement features when I have a reason for it, for example I like to have them in the software so I can use them myself, or maybe because I&#39;m a corp that sees a business need. But implementing them for free just because somebody asked for it, that&#39;s just asking for trouble. If you do that regularly, and not mostly because you think it&#39;s fun, but because you want to &#34;support the community&#34; or whatnot, you are taking steps towards burnout, and ultimately are not just hurting yourself but even the larger community, because you are fostering the expectation that that&#39;s what open source devs should do. No, they shouldn&#39;t. That&#39;s not what open source is about.It&#39;s about a specific deal. Nothing more, nothing less."</p>
