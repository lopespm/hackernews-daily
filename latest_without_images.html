								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of my favorite things to do with these neat little games is to build something that plays them for me by just pasting stuff into the browser JS console.https://pastebin.com/aTYuaNVSAt a score of 1,619 the ball is moving so fast it no longer works! I switched to a new tab (hoping that the event loop would be sent to the background/context switch/whatever) and ta-da - it misclicked. High score of 1,637."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great stuff, got 315 on third try. I made a game in the same vein sometime ago: https://vladimirslepnev.itch.io/zigzagOne thing to note about this kind of endless runner games is the scoring system. Everyone uses the system &#34;get as much points as possible in one run, each run starts from zero&#34;. But that forces people to slog through the early parts each time, and also makes them more likely to stop playing after an especially good run. I thought about this for a while, and came up with the idea that a better system would dock points for mistakes. The run would continue, a misclick would just give you a short breather and set you back fifty points or so.I made some prototypes like that and the effect was striking: you stick with one run for a long time, falling into a kind of meditative state, never wanting to stop. Eventually you find an equilibrium where wins and losses balance out, and keep playing there, at the best of your ability. If I ever release an endless runner again, it will use that system."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a great little time waster!Couple of recommendations, in no particular order:1. Keep the ball moving even after you die. Instead of pressing start, the user will just click when the ball is back inside the colored area.
2. You can click anywhere to restart, but you have to click the play button to restart. You should allow the user to just click anywhere to restart.
3. When you fail, show where the ball was.
4. As for collision detection, I think you should err on being lenient and count success if the bounds of the circle overlap, rather than the center or entirely. I think this is also due to the rounded linecaps for the arc potentially not counting as part of the valid area.
5. Show where the next arc will be. This is more of a game design thing. If you do this, quick fade out of the old and fade in on the new would look nice.I understand that this was probably a small little one off project, and that there&#39;s always more you can iterate on, so I just want to say nice job in putting out a fun little time waster!"</p>

Telemetry was first implicated because it&#39;s one of the first services a normal Firefox configuration will connect first, but presumably the bug will trigger with any other connection to such a server. Our current plan is to disable HTTP3 to mitigate until we can locate the exact bug in the networking stack.https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1749908#c21"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There are three problems that colleges need to fix.1) Skilled trades pay better than most bachelor&#39;s degree track jobs. My kids can make more money with a six month apprenticeship than they will with all but a few 4 year degrees. If you can drive a forklift, you can make $45K/yr... which is identical to what an firsty year teacher makes.2) There are better options than college for many. One of my daughters did a six month digital marketing bootcamp. She made $45k year one, and a year later is the director of marketing at her company making over $100k/yr.3) College is way over priced. They claim graduates make 40% over their lifetime vs. non grads. JP Morgan Chase did a study two years ago that shows kids that had a job, any job before age 18 make 35% more than their peers over their lifetime regardless of degree.4) Student loans are a horror that needs to stop. Young people should not be put in debt-bondage. Imagine America&#39;s financial health if we let young people start families and careers debt free."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have 3 college-aged kids and one nearly there. Their universal concern is the cost. It has become prohibitive.Colleges assumed the trend of charging $25k to $50k per year would be sustainable. They were dead wrong, especially given the horrendously predatory loans backed by the government and barred from bankruptcy.If we fix the college financial system, enrollment would likely skyrocket."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is nearly a strictly American problem. Much of the rest of the world has realized that society requires and is capable of supporting advanced education for all -- after all we want humanity to be advancing, right?America is still stuck in this alternate universe where it&#39;s a great privilege to have the opportunity to learn, which is of course true to some extent, but they really put it on a pedestal there.Compared to the rest of the world, I think they over index on attending prestigious out-of-state and thus expensive, regardless of public or private, instead of building a really strong system for locals.I think of my (non-US) classmates, maybe 1-2 per 100 were from a different region or country? I paid a total of $20k over five years which I easily covered with internships/summer jobs. Can you say the same in the US?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’m confused by their obsession with youtube-dl. I don’t really know anyone that pirates music, seems like streaming has really solved that with ad-supported listening. The common cases for using youtube-dl, as I understand, is for archival (mostly non-music), watching videos content out of the browser (also mostly non-music), and derivative works purposes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I use youtube-dl to download Cracking the Cryptic videos. The RIAA does not own those videos. In fact there are quite a few videos on youtube the RIAA doesn&#39;t own."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To me, it sounds like music industry execs are not familiar with the Streisand effect. The first time I became familiar with Youtube-dl, it was during the Github DMCA PR fiasco. The number of stars for Youtube-dl increased sharply as soon as MS reviewed the decision and let them back online."</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29922002">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of my favorite bits from Tim&#39;s videos was during a tour of Firefly Aerospace&#39;s facility when they talk about engine cooling.  They discuss EDM machining small holes into the coolant channels just before the throat, which lets a small amount of cryogenic coolant out to cool the interior.  The funny part is that you can purposefully undersize the holes and they will melt larger until they are big enough to adequately cool the engine.  You basically pre-season the engine with a test-fire and let it choose how much internal cooling it needs.https://youtu.be/ac-V8mO0lWo?t=2203"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This thing I can not comprehend about rocket engines is how the turbopump manages to hold together.A turbine blade in the SSME about the size of your thumb makes 600 horsepower.https://www.enginehistory.org/Rockets/SSME/SSME6.pdf"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Minor nitpick: fluids are not either liquids or gases, this is particularly true for rocket engines where many of the discussed processes (injection, compression, regenerative coolant flow) actually occur at super- or transcritical conditions.Also, I don&#39;t think you can say the faceplate is heat sink-cooled. Remember that just behind it is the propellant manifold, so it&#39;s rather some form of regenerative cooling."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I know that open source and Linux in general don&#39;t need/want another DE, but selfishly... I really want System76 to succeed. They give me the same kind of feeling I had when Apple was kicking butt in the early 2000s. And I think that for them to become a general-audience company, they need to really own more of their software. They have some great ideas, and they&#39;ve already plugin&#39;ed Gnome to within and inch of it&#39;s life; it&#39;s time to move out on their own. And it&#39;s not like a new DE means apps won&#39;t work. DEs are just the window dressing and computer management.What I really wonder about is Wayland support. Is this going to be a brand-new DE that&#39;s X only? That would be a real shame. I know System76 has stuck doggedly to X because they sell so many NVidia cards, but NVidia supports GBM now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know we developers love our languages.But I&#39;m always skeptical when underlying language choice is featured prominently as a selling point for any new project.It tells me, this is a technology-first, users-second enthusiast project.And thus, I&#39;ll be surprised if it tackles the deepest issues users need solved.That doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t cool as a proof of concept for a new or popular language.It just makes me question to what extent it&#39;s going to solve the deepest problems with similar or older projects it is competing against."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Original Nautilus and early GNOME developer here. I am very out of touch with what is current, so excuse some possibly ignorant questions. How is this a Rust-based environment if it is based on GTK? I assume GTK is still essentially the C-based GTK we used with some improvements.Why is this called Rust-based? I’ll do some more research but would like to get some insight from more knowledgeable sources."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a smart implementation. I was worried it would be doing something uncouth like asking for your HN password or scraping some kind of unofficial API, but instead it gives you a token to embed in your public profile - so it&#39;s still scraping your profile page, but that feels like a very low-impact way of building this.Suggestion: on the &#34;Put the token below in your HackerNews Profile&#34; page, rather than polling to see if the token has been added (which is a bit rude) add a button for &#34;I have added this token to my profile&#34; and only check once the user clicks that button."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hey HN,I wanted to be able to make apps that do social login with HN so I hacked it together.It works like you would expect -- generating a code you can put in your profile. For convenience, you can then use either TOTP or Email (if you specify both, it will default to using TOTP) to login thereafter to make things quicker (it can take up to a minute until profiles update).I generally wait about 5 seconds between checks of a profile, hopefully this isn&#39;t too much additional strain (especially since I expect most people to switch to something faster after the first login).[EDIT] Also it&#39;s night time (well morning I guess) where I am so... spinning up some more instances and I&#39;m going to sleep.[EDIT2] My email is plastered all over the site, but please feel free to email me any bug reports![EDIT3] If you&#39;d like to register an app, please check out https://mailing-list.vadosware.io/subscription/form ! Ignore all the other mailing list stuff and get on the &#34;early adopters&#34; list for LoginWithHN! Or just email me in my HN profile, whichever!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Using forums as pseudonymous identity providers is a very powerful idea. It&#39;s essentially community federation. There is of course risk that your IDP chucks your account and you lose access to the other ones, but that&#39;s solvable with a recovery scheme.Lightweight, low assurance credentials probably have the biggest growth future, as if universal high assurance credentials were really that commercially desirable, we&#39;d already have them. These are a kind of affinity credential, which has a lot of optionality."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The speed of light story is a fun conjecture, but given the discrepancy (30cm vs 5.5mm), I don&#39;t think that&#39;s it. Light travels slower in wires but not that much slower, and increased design clocks don&#39;t explain the discrepancy either.I think it&#39;s more likely that this is an artifact of the interconnect design. For example, the interconnect may be designed as a tree, where the path from core 0 to the L2 only visits a branch but the path to core1/2 has to traverse the root of the tree. If each stage adds a clock cycle, there&#39;s your 4 clock cycles: one to go to the root, one back down to the other side, and then the whole thing in the other direction for the reply from L2 with the data.If the interconnect had been a ring bus instead, you&#39;d find that the latency from cores 0 and 2 is the same, but higher for core 1 - assuming no other endpoints in the ring, but that&#39;s obviously not the case, since I/O needs to be on the bus too. It&#39;s possible he got the core numbers wrong in the die shot, and core 0 is the bottom left core. Then if the ring goes clockwise L2 - core 0 - core 1 - core 2 - I/O on the top right - L2, that&#39;s how you end up with core 0 being closer to the L2 in terms of clock cycles than the others, and the observation would be consistent with this design too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was working on the central technology team at EA during the run up to the launch of the Xbox 360 and some of us got early access to help prepare for the new architecture.I was blown away by the amount of technical detail we were getting access to and how clearly explained it was. Much of that was thanks to Bruce Dawson. I remember devouring everything I could find that he&#39;d written and it was a fascinating crash course in CPU architecture for a relatively young software engineer at the time with little hardware background. Thanks Bruce!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I got a copy of the detailed descriptions of the Xbox 360 CPU and I read it through multiple timesThis way of learning is not taught often enough, we learn it in school when learning another language (e.g. repeating words over and over). But in sciences and engineering the repeated reading of the material is not usually encouraged or talked about.It would be interesting to see what the material was, it&#39;s not linked, but it must have been really detailed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is amazing! Seen a lot of work around Rust and JS / JSX / TS / TSX (notably SWC[0] is moving to be a Rust based version of Babel) not so much around CSS.My genunine hope is this will replace PostCSS sooner rather than later. PostCSS isn&#39;t the most performant thing I&#39;ve worked with, and a lot of plugins for PostCSS rely on doing multiple passes at the AST, they can slow down significantly as a resultFor that however, we will need some kind of plugin system. I know the SWC[0] project has had some struggles with this as their current JS API relies on serializing the AST back and forth. I wonder if this forgoes a JS API entirely or if that is something planned for say 1.5?[0]: https://swc.rs/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When a site&#39;s CSS is well written, with a capable web developer knowing, what they are doing, such a tool would not be necessary. People pump out megabytes of JavaScript, but then they worry about a few kilobytes of CSS being saved by compressing it, at the same time making it less readable by minifying it. (We are not yet shipping hundreds of kilobytes of CSS, are we?!)When there is a need for a tool that minifies CSS, then people seriously need to ask themselves, how it can be, that they have that much CSS. How much redundant CSS can you accumulate? Was there no coherent styling idea or strategy, so that every thing on the page needs separate styling?What many forget is, that data is often sent gzip compressed anyway, which naturally takes advantage of repeated parts to compress. Text usually compresses pretty well. Especially something like a description language with many repeating parts. It is great, that Parcel CSS is faster than some other tool. However, for me, these kind of tools are merely treating the symptoms of not doing styling properly. I&#39;m glad, that I got to know the web, when you simply could look at all the source of a page and learn from it, instead of facing a multi megabyte &#34;minified&#34; script and &#34;minified&#34; CSS."</p>

They are great for worker representation - but that&#39;s a double-edged sword. Ideally, unions protects worker&#39;s interests. In practice, they often lead to abuse, stagnation and corruption. I&#39;ve personally witnessed union employees who contributed nothing for years, get perpetually shifted from team to team to team and even promoted because it was too complex and costly to fire them. I&#39;ve seen union stewards padding their own pockets with members dues through lavish &#34;retreats&#34; to five-star resorts.
