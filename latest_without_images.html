								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Congratulations on the launch! I wonder if this kind of business model, where it looks like there is basically &#34;one really rich guy self-funding&#34; for a couple of years, is going to be more common.That is, just looking at the site, my guess is that building everything from the ground up (core banking stack, acquiring the chartered bank, then all the APIs and tech on top of that) must have taken many years and many, many millions of dollars. And kudos, because the first thing that struck out at me is the documentation looks excellent. Overall, it looks like something where the the team had all the luxury to &#34;do things right from the ground floor&#34;, instead of scrambling and making shortcuts before their runway ran out. I just think it would have been very hard to find a VC willing to be patient enough to wait that long with no revenue or customer feedback (&#34;where&#39;s your MVP???&#34;)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Create account numbers that point to a single bank account and create specific permissions and limits for each one.I love that; there are so many places that give a 6% discount for using ACH but I don&#39;t want to give out my bank account details willy-nilly---If you have influence over it, I wouldn&#39;t recommend having https://status.column.com/uptime default to &#34;Sandbox&#34; since I doubt seriously that&#39;s what anyone would care about when going to an uptime page, and can also mislead a reader in a hurry if the Sandbox environment is having woes but Production is finenit: I would guess you meant &#34;sweep&#34; not &#34;sweet&#34; on https://column.com/bank-accounts&gt; We support FBO, sweet, clearing and custom account types — all FDIC insured."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Having worked on this in Skia (and so Chrome, Android) for a good while, I can vouch this is an issue browser/phone developers would have liked to fix a long time ago, but have kept by default for compatibility with old expectations.  A lot (~all) of web/app design was and still is done with this broken interpolation in mind, which then all breaks when math is done in a way that more accurately models light.It’s a bit of a chicken and egg problem that we can really only fix by allowing content to explicitly opt-in to linear working color profiles.  And sadly that’s not going to solve everything either: while a linear profile is good for color interpolation, sRGB encoding is ideal for brightness interpolation.  You’re stuck choosing between ugly red-green interpolation and nice white-black (sRGB) or between nice red-green and ugly white-black (linear).  There are some more complex color spaces that do try to be the best of everything here, but I’m not aware of any browser or OS providing support for working with these perceptual color spaces.A similar problem comes up when trying to manage color gamut on screens and systems that are intentionally blown out to look vivid, vibrant, shiny… looking at you Samsung phones.  Any properly color-managed image there looks incredibly dull compared to the bright defaults you’ve grown accustomed to.  If we take 0xff red to mean “full sRGB red”, that’s much less bright these days than if we just assume it means “as red as the screen will go.”  It’s much like how TVs are (hopefully were?) set in the store in bright shiny mode to induce you to buy them, not set to reproduce colors accurately."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Web color is somehow still a garbage fire.About a decade ago I was hearing that web-safe color was effectively obsolete. Today Firefox chokes on P3 color, and Chrome doesn&#39;t appear to care at all about display color profiles.I recently launched a website that had a fire-engine red background and was expected to have a rotating animation above the fold (https://worldparkinsonsday.com). Even once we got the animation synced perfectly between Chrome and Safari, it turned out that iOS Safari was rendering the video differently. Eventually I gave up and replaced a 128kb mp4 video with a 5mb transparent animated GIF. Shameful.And I had this lil&#39; fellah on my desk smiling at me the whole time

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The gradient mixing example is broken.&#34;Color gradients are supposed to be equally bright around the midpoint&#34;This is false. Nobody mandates this.There is no &#34;correct&#34; way to do it, every one of them is arbitrary (although some do look better than others and the suggested method is better than the default linear interpolation).It is completely analogous to smoothing curve in animation - it&#39;s about what sort of interpolation mechanism you use.If there would be a standard for specific perceptually pleasing gradient, then one could claim &#34;does not follow standard X&#34;.The point of the article is usually abslutely correct, though:
&#34;The correct way to process sRGB data is to convert it to linear RGB values first, then process it, then convert it back to sRGB if required.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It is hard to say one couldn&#39;t see this coming. Of the few features left in Server, the only one I remained interested in was Profile Manager, and that hasn&#39;t worked right for a bit now. I&#39;m fine with an Apple that wants to do hardware and operating systems more than software, but I wish they&#39;d make Profile Manager-like features more available for regular people, not just Education or Business users. It would be infinitely useful to have such features for iPhones of family members who aren&#39;t so good with tech and could use a heavier hand in making sure the device is up to date and findable when lost. But I digress. I&#39;m glad it&#39;s just ending, even if it&#39;s barely a surprise."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked at a company that used the phrase &#34;getting jamf&#39;d&#34; as a verb to describe when the management system broke things on your macbook.E.g., &#34;I&#39;ll be able to test that code change in a bit, I got Jamf&#39;d pretty hard this morning and now my build is broken...&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In the mid 2000s, it looked like there was good hope that Apple would finally make inroads into corporate IT. In addition to their professional software suites (Shake, Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, Aperture, Motion, etc.), they had already released XServe, which was really good by those days&#39; standards, as well as XSan -- these products solved many of the needs of small professional creative groups. Mac OS X server&#39;s abilities to handle small offices&#39; needs seemed like a prelude to larger things.Sadly, those hopes never really panned out. Apple is historically reticent to entering a market they aren&#39;t confident they have a good chance of dominating if they execute well, and their own growing internal use of Linux servers (and maybe other 3rd-party corporate domain/directory services, like Active Directory?) probably persuaded them to scale back their efforts around 2010."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Actually, if you know what you are talking about, this filing actually shows Elon is about 21 billion dollars short. This is because 21 billion dollars of the commitment is coming from him and not from any financial institution. He is a very rich man but almost his entire wealth is tied up in tesla shares which he cannot sell in such large amounts and ownership of spacex which is even harder to sell.If he tries to sell 21 billion dollars worth of tesla shares, the share price will collapse.So no, once again he does not have funding secured. And once again he is trying to bullshit his way around the issue, although this time the bullshitting is a little more sophisticated.It is still possible that he tries to sell a lot of tesla shares to get the cash to buy twitter, but it is unlikely."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Personally, I think Musk is having a bit of a laugh. This will never happen. *Twitter operating income for 12 m/e 31 Dec 2021 was negative. For the q/e 31 Dec 2021 it was $0.167B. Why he thinks Twitter is worth $45b is beyond me. What would Warren Buffett do? Well, he wouldn&#39;t buy Twitter, that&#39;s for sure.* Time will tell, of course. I&#39;ve been wrong before. But the whole thing seems like madness to me."</p>

What follows seems like Elon is &#34;paying&#34; for Twitter with... imaginary money.&#34;A debt commitment letter&#34;&#34;A separate debt commitment letter&#34;&#34;An equity commitment letter&#34;Am I understanding it correctly that effectively $0 is coming out-of-pocket for purchasing Twitter?Why can&#39;t anyone do this?

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;Why is it so expensive?&#34; - commentary from someone who does this for a living at SequentialSmall Volume - each unit is more expensive than a large volume product, you don&#39;t get price breaks on any components or tooling costsDesign focused - Who is the product for? It isn&#39;t for people who want to spend 250$ on a Behringer mixer. It is for people who want something that is high quality and doesn&#39;t break. Reliable. For people that rely on their tools to be creative or appreciate design. You are paying a premium. See Apple for lots of examples. This is also one of the biggest strengths of the company, if you want something cheap you&#39;re looking in the wrong place.Complex - the amount of balance of various components here adds a lot to the design and development costs. Battery is an unusual feature but puts it in a different product category. Balancing that with the audio quality and reliability is not a trivial problem. Add in wireless, audio drivers (not trivial at ALL), Complexity increases development time and adds risk to the long term stability of the product, that is added into the cost.Most of the small features feel like somebody there thought it would be fun and/or easy to put in. It&#39;s a good way to iterate through design ideas, you have to see it in reality. That type of prototyping isn&#39;t easy. Most people don&#39;t use 90% of the features but when you are in a creative industry the 1% that does absolutely LOVES it and uses it in ways you never expected. It&#39;s difficult to balance the amount of development you put into fun things vs. business cases.If you are trying to figure out why you&#39;d pay for this you aren&#39;t their target market. It&#39;s far more interesting (to me) to think about why some people WOULD pay for this and what a market looks like that you are not a part of"</p>

EDIT - you are the world&#39;s second richest man, tied with Bill Gates. Gates has a much higher net worth than you due to Microsoft stock, which is why you are second and he is first.&#34;
2. &#34;YTA. I would never have invested in a company without knowing who was behind it, and there are plenty of other opportunities out there for you to continue gaming the system.&#34;
3. &#34;YTA, but not for the reason you think. The reason the rules apply to you is because you are the one who broke the rules. You can&#39;t change the past and what you did was wrong. At best you can do is disclose your holdings on your next filings which you are doing.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;I think Go is the best programming language by far. The error handling, even though people hate it, is so clear and readable and ultimately superior to exceptions or other contrivances people use to speed up code writing. Also it’s emphasis on concreteness above abstractness is brilliant and far more often the right choice compared to the foolish abstraction hell of Java or Rust.Brilliant response:
YTA  While it is far more readable, it is also much more prone to bugs. The bugs will not be easy to find, because the errors won&#39;t give you much information about where to look. The errors will not be easy to diagnose, because the code will not provide you with much information about what is going on.  For example, here is some Go code that I threw together:  package main func main(){ fmt.Println(&#34;Hello, world!&#34;) }  And then I tried to run it:  $ go run Example.go hello, world! $  And I got:  $ go run Example.go hello, world! hello, world!  And I don&#39;t know what the hell is going on, and I don&#39;t know where to look to figure it out. And this is just one of many examples.  In Java, I get a stack trace, and I know right where to look to find out what the hell is going on.  In Go, I have no idea. I have to go look at the compiler output to see that the compiler got confused and ran my program multiple times in succession, jumped back and forth between"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hopefully this piece gets a lot more views, because this is an issue that pretty much any rational technoligist should get involved with. Here in NC, our state legislature also caved to cableco and telecom pressure to make it nearly impossible for muni broadband to spread. That was after a single city&#39;s service succeeded so spectacularly that the incumbents had visions of Armageddon.That&#39;s because they knew that even in this relatively center-right leaning state, people will know a good deal when they see it: so job 1 was to make sure they never do. So far their efforts at blocking competition have been successful. Except for a few very limited areas where Google Fiber was able to pry its way in, there has been no competition to the incumbents from muni or private parties.At this point our best hope may be that changing demographics and the undeniable drift away from traditional programming will result in their financial collapse, finally allowing communities to serve themselves.The other option is for people to get out and pressure their political reps to make muni or community broadband easier to deploy, maybe even run for office themselves and replace those who have sold out. Broadband access isn&#39;t as important as homelessness or healthcare, but it is important. Maybe it&#39;s a good place to start reversing the crappification of everything many here have lived through their whole lives."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We’ve had gigabit municipal internet here in Chattanooga for 12 years now. It’s better than Comcast in every possible way—speed, price, reliability, customer service, install time, install windows, availability (within the state limited geographical area) etc…There was a question on a local Facebook group the other day from a person who just moved here asking which ISP she should use.The replies were nothing but pages and pages of EPB, EPB, EPB… (EPB is the name of the municipal power company and ISP). Along with glowing reviews about how better their customer service is than Comcast.EPB is so much better, I’d have a really hard time moving somewhere else that didn’t have something similar."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I live in one of the few Canadian cities who were progressive enough to install city-managed fiber in most areas zoned for high-rise buildings.  Actual internet service is provided by ISPs, but they deliberately excluded the large telcos.Similar to the author, I also get 1Gbps symmetric, no outages, no data caps and I pay only $32 (Canadian) a month.  The telcos charge four times as much for the same service (but less reliable) in the residential areas not covered by the city network."</p>
