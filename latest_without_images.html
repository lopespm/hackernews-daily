								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Speaking as one of the original three authors of Google Docs (Writely), but zero involvement in this project (I left Google in 2010): I&#39;m seeing a lot of comments asking how JavaScript-on-Canvas could possibly outperform the highly optimized native code built into the browser engines. It&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve really been involved in browser coding, but having written both Writely and, farther back, several native-app word processing engines, here are some thoughts.Word processors have extremely specific requirements for layout, rendering, and incremental updates. I&#39;ll name just two examples. First, to highlight a text selection in mixed left-to-right / right-to-left text, it&#39;s necessary to obtain extremely specific information regarding text layout; information that the DOM may not be set up to provide. Second, to smoothly update as the user is typing text, it&#39;s often desirable to &#34;cheat&#34; the reflow process and focus on updating just the line of text containing the insertion point. (Obviously browser engines support text selections, but they probably don&#39;t expose the underlying primitives the way a word processor would need. Similarly, they support incremental layout + rendering, but probably not specifically optimized in the precise way a word processor would need.)Modern browser engines are amazing feats of engineering, but the feature set they provide, while enormous, is unlikely to exactly match the exacting requirements of a WYSIWYG word processor. As soon as your requirements differ even slightly from the feature set provided, you start tipping over into complex workarounds which impact performance and are hell on developer productivity and application stability / compatibility.This is loosely analogous to CISC vs. RISC: browsers are amazing &#34;CISCy&#34; engines but if your use case doesn&#39;t precisely fit the expectations of the instruction set designer then you&#39;re better off with something lower-level, like Canvas and WASM. (I don&#39;t know whether Docs uses WASM but it would seem like a good fit for this Canvas project.)Frameworks in general suffer from this problem. If you&#39;ve ever had to fight with an app framework, or orchestration framework, or whatever sort of framework to accomplish something 5% outside of what the framework is set up to support, then you understand the concept.Also, as noted in many comments here, browser engines have to solve a much more general problem than Docs, and thus have extra overhead."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In 2009, I joined Mozilla and started working on the Bespin[1] project, which Ben Galbraith &amp; Dion Almaer had brought to Moz. Bespin was built with a canvas-based renderer. Bespin was way faster than other browser-based code editors at the time.Then the Ajax.org/Cloud9 folks came along with their Ace editor[2], which was DOM-based and still very fast. We ended up merging the projects. edit to add: and switching to DOM renderingRik Arends[3] was one of the Ajax.org folks and he&#39;s been working on a WebGL-based code environment called Makepad[4], which is entirely built in Rust and has its own UI toolkit. He&#39;s complained a lot about how difficult it is to make a performant JS-based editing environment.My point in all of this is just that there are absolutely tradeoffs in performance, accessibility, ease-of-development, internationalization, and likely other aspects. If raw performance is what you&#39;re going for, it&#39;s hard to beat just drawing on a canvas or using WebGL. Google Docs needs to worry about all of that other stuff, too, so I&#39;ll be interested to see how this shapes up.[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Skywriter[2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_(editor)[3]: https://twitter.com/rikarends[4]: https://makepad.dev"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t build extensions or work on much front end web lately but this reads like Google wants more control over their stuff. The web is becoming less open.&gt; By moving away from HTML-based rendering to a canvas-based rendering, some Chrome extensions may not function as intended on docs.google.com and may need to be updated.&gt; If you are building your own integrations with Google Docs, we recommend using Google Workspace Add-ons framework, which uses the supported Workspace APIs and integration points. This will help ensure there will be less work in the future to support periodic UI implementation changes to Docs.This is basically putting an API on top of an API as far as I&#39;m concerned. The web renders markup and executes javascript to produce experience. Putting an API on top and using canvas to render your content creates a more closed system.For those more deep in web technology, I&#39;d like to know if there are reasons to move to canvas for strictly technical merits."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very nice code quality.C gets a hard time and this code base highlights some of the modern features C is missing by its use of perfectly clear workarounds. E.g. The prefix “namespacing” done here works just fine, easy to understand. The go-style visibility approach is growing on me lately and it works well here.C does deserve some of the criticism right enough, e.g. the same macros re-defined in a few places - it’d be nice if c had a better way than its version of macros although its not actually a problem here because the macros aren’t really big enough to have subtle sharp edges.Ahh a beautifully written project, just shows that maybe C is entirely workable in the right hands."</p>

Thanks for sharing your work and your process in the YouTube videos.As someone who comes from a web dev background and who&#39;s completely unfamiliar with developing large projects in C, I&#39;m curious about your setup. What does it look like? In terms of what kind of IDE, OS, interesting tooling, etc. you use on a regular basis to work on this.Also, I&#39;ve seen the first commit goes back to Oct 2017. Did you work on this full time during the whole time / how many full-time months you would say you devoted to this project? Also, if I may ask – what do you do for a living?Thanks again and congrats on the project!"</p>

There&#39;s so much charm and fun and eccentricity that&#39;s lost in a web where full-height responsive image backgrounds and blocky design frameworks are ubiquitous.If this can help people express just a little bit of the wild creativity of things like early 2000&#39;s MySpace layouts or GeoCities pages I&#39;ll be a big fan!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Congrats, it&#39;s really great!A small comment:- Instagram has recently become much more aggressive in not showing anything to logged out users.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The number of comments here that are negative is just staggering to me.These images are within a hair&#39;s breadth of being indistinguishable from reality. It&#39;s an enormous leap. An enormous leap from the previous techniques and an enormous leap towards photorealistic realtime graphics.You don&#39;t want your games to look realistic? Go play pacman or outrun.You want to use path tracing instead? You have no idea how much cheaper this technique is. And on top of that the neural network is also fixing up the unrealistic texture work on all kinds of things in the scene.The first games to use this are going to be from small game studios with less investment in the status quo and they are going to blow the competition out of the water."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am especially impressed by how much more realistic the lighting ends up looking despite the network probably having less information to work with than the engine! Though it ends up turning the lighting very flat. I guess that is an effect of the source images they were using.As others have said, using this directly in the engine (tuned to work with the intended art style etc) could probably produce almost miraculous results, if it can be made to work at a reasonable frame rate.That would also allow the developers to use high-quality rendered images instead of these green-tinted, low-contrast &#34;automotive grade&#34; camera images as source of truth (there are good reasons these images look like that ... but they don&#39;t look pleasant)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Impressive, but I think that photorealism is not necessarily what you would want to strive for in games, as it is not true realism. It emulates the deficiencies of the camera that we perceive it as realistic, because we are trained on thousands of photo images and video footage. I prefer visionrealism instead of photorealism in my games and don&#39;t really find that lens effects like flares, chromatic aberration, and depth of field enhances the experience of realism. It feels like I&#39;m looking through a camera rather than being there myself. For me it breaks immersion instead of enhancing it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was wondering if something like could be done to upload sensor data without a data connection and it looks like that&#39;s exactly what the authors here had in mind!:&gt; Potential use cases&gt; While I was mostly just curious about whether it would be possible, I wouldimagine the most common use case to be uploading sensor readings or any data from IoT devices without a broadband modem, SIM card, data plan or Wifi connectivity.The use case I had in mind is gathering sensor data from boat out in a harbor (away from wifi) that other boats with iPhone-bearing crew pass by frequently. This ESP32 AirTag emulator could send out battery level and bilge pump data any time someone sailed by, without the need for a dedicated modem. Might have to try this out!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As there&#39;s a limit of 16 AirTags per Apple ID, and each AirTag&#39;s keys rotate every 15 minutes, presumably Apple can detect if anyone is abusing the system by sending more than 16 different &#34;messages&#34; per 15 minutes. They can&#39;t detect this when the fake airtags are sending, but can detect it from stored message timestamps when you query.  If they start to see this being abused a lot, they can then block Apple IDs.  To avoid Apple being able to see this, you probably need to either use multiple Apple IDs, or send less than 16 bits per 15 minutes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Does this fall within Apple&#39;s policy of fair use? Would be great if there were an officially supported (paid) API for this, the technology and potential use cases are great. I&#39;m afraid hooking something like this up to my Apple ID will get me banned somehow."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Seems like there is less and less reason for  not using Erlang for distributed coordinated compute broker tasks.I have a stateless java backend servicing REST APIs.
These backends are load-balanced by nginx.Now the time is approaching where I need to introduce some form of global state (that involves global caching, message passing, registering/discovery of known workers, periodic (cron-like tasks), etc).I would much prefer a single tool to add to my backend stack (currently Java + postgres) to cover most of the above needs.With the performance improvement + persistent_term [1] -- in current Erlang, I basically get:- a light weight distributed K/V cache- a ZeroMQ like on-wire messaging system (built into erlang)- discovery/coordination- a distributed compute grid- a way to write my own routines within that compute grid, and have them exposed via Java interface to my existing backend.I do not need &#39;fastest&#39; possible performance or least memory consumption. I just need them to be &#39;reasonable&#39;, &#39;known&#39; and &#39;controllable&#39; (not to exceed some baseline).Erlang is just looking better and better (and I prefer its syntax to Elixir, for some reason.).[1] https://erlang.org/doc/man/persistent_term.html"</p>

Doing that made me realize that typing a character is a very specific and atomic action (compared to writing by hand), as well as an automatic one (once you learn how to touch-type).

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; The biggest technical hurdle is the inability to run external processes on iOS and iPadOS.&gt; Apps on iOS and iPadOS must use Apple’s Javascript interpreter, JavaScriptCore.Both of these really suck because they are policy, not technical, decisions. Even setting aside the arguments of whether JIT code is a security concern (it is not unless your security model is one where codesigning exists to prevent the addition of new native code) that you cannot spawn a new process, nor can you ship another JavaScript interpreter, is really unfortunate.Allowing apps to spawn new processes is easy (I mean, just inherit sandboxing rules and resource limits…) and allows for a lot of new usecases, like robust crash reporting, web servers, privilege separation, and more. That Apple allows this on macOS and even uses it for its own apps on iOS just shows how useful this can be and how little it affects the security model of iOS.Likewise, not allowing other JavaScript interpreters is just…annoying. Regardless of your opinions of JavaScriptCore, this is an unfair limitation on an already slanted playing field. Coupled with the fact that the JavaScriptCore interpreter (which the framework uses for anything you run in-process) is literally designed for low resource consumption instead of than performance makes this even more infuriating."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a different view of this than most in this topic. I am disappointed, though not surprised, that Panic is abandoning yet another of their iOS apps. They’ve done it several times before and while I am grateful they’ve continued to provide some bug fixes, feature work stopped years ago.In my view, the biggest hurdle does not seem to have been technical, but ideological/business. These old school Mac developers like Panic and Omni have had a very difficult time adapting to (or failing to) the iOS/mobile era. 
I know we all hate subscriptions, but continued app development and management requires continued labor so subscriptions seem like the only business option that makes any sense to me. Panic and Omni want paid upgrades but Apple has never, ever even hinted at providing that as an option. The option is subscriptions. Even on desktop Sketch, Adobe, and Microsoft are going with subscriptions. (We’ll see how Affinity does. They charge a lot more for their apps and seem to be in a growth phase so I imagine their sales at the moment are fast enough to make up for the fact that each sale is only a one time source of revenue).Honestly, Panic and Omni and other old school Mac developers really, really need to adapt to the modern era. They’ve had years and it feels like the runway is about to end (see Omni’s recent layoffs.) Wishing for paid upgrades and writing “only AppKit apps are real Mac apps” blog posts isn’t going to change anything."</p>

But then most of what follows, and pretty much everything on the webpage, says that Atlas does this or that, not &#34;will do&#34;.And the trouble with &#34;concepts&#34; is that unlike actual implementations they aren&#39;t much of a guide to what you&#39;re ever actually going to get. It&#39;s easy to think &#34;X would be cool&#34; and say &#34;Atlas does X&#34;, but some Xs are much more realistically implementable than others, and how interesting Atlas actually is depends on which of those Xs are ever actually going to be implemented.But reading the page and watching the video I have literally no idea where the project is on a scale from &#34;we wrote down some things it would be cool to do and rigged up a demo that pretends to do them&#34; to &#34;everything here is already implemented, though there are a few gaps and bugs here and there&#34;."</p>
