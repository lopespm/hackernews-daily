								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A4 is so ubiquitous around me (Europe) that, no matter its merits or not, it&#39;s really a major PITA when you get documents that are not A4.  They don&#39;t line up nicely with the A4 stuff.  They don&#39;t go gently in the A4 folders / sleeves / pockets / ring binders (files) / etc.Typical offenders in my case are medical bills printed on dot-matrix printers.I don&#39;t even know if there&#39;s perforated continuous stationery/form paper with tractor holes that, once you strip the holes, is A4 sized?  I guess it&#39;s really uncommon if it exists for I don&#39;t ever recall seeing any actually used.Now don&#39;t get me wrong: hearing the song of a dot-matrix printer makes me happy (brings back lots of memories as my first printer was a dot-matrix one) and it&#39;s nice that that tech is still in use here and there.  I just wish the dot-matrix printers in Europe would use A4 continuous paper (which may or may not even exist).And don&#39;t get me started on oversized continuous paper that is not perforated: this is the kind of stuff that can trigger obsessive-compulsive disorder!I guess all this rant to say that even in Europe, where A4 is ubiquitous, you still have places using other sizes than A3/A4/A5 etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article sadly misses the root of the An sizes. A0 has an area of 1m^2, setting its dimensions and defining the rest of the sizes. Quite genius!The B sizes start at B0 with a length on the short side of 1m, then follow the same pattern. The C sizes, often used for envelopes, are defined as the geometric mean between the equivalent A and B size.As a child of an architect, when I was a kid my dad would bring old A0 drawings home as paper we could draw and paint on the back of. Loved it.-
Edit: it does mention it, I skimmed it too fast…"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I started to build Leon in late 2017 on my free time. There is no big organization behind Leon AI, just me and more with the community later.At the moment the whole core is being rewritten, many new features are coming up. Please do know that the main strength of Leon is about the core and not the skills yet. Once the official release shipped, with the community we will all focus on building new skills by extending from the core and let Leon makes meaningful things.
Among the upcoming things, new offline STT/TTS solutions will take place.It&#39;s going to take some time to build a respectable personal assistant that respects our privacy, but we are getting there.If you have any question or just wanna chat, feel free to join us on Discord."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is great, because Unreal is a C++ project that&#39;s not so easy to just Rewrite In Rust.It&#39;s also nice it uses bevy&#39;s ECS. It&#39;s made to fit Rust&#39;s type system and borrow checking model, and is highly parallel. It&#39;s really awesome how easy it is to distribute work across cores with it, without risk of heisenbugs thanks to Rust&#39;s data-race-safety guarantees.I know game development sees traditional software best practices as not applicable to them, but then games struggle with showstopping bugs and single-core performance bottlenecks. I hope someone will bet that Rust, despite being stricter and seemingly slower to iterate with, can be a net benefit from lower defect rates. Rust users outside of game dev praise the &#34;if it compiles, it&#39;s usually correct&#34;, and that junior devs can be told not to write unsafe code, so they can&#39;t cause UB and memory corruption."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am always skeptical about these type of projects. Out of the box Unreal Engine supports C++ and Blueprint.The problem with C++ is the slow compile times, and if you make mistakes the engine crashes. In general you produce stuff slower by using  C++.Blueprint is a visual scripting tool, it compiles fast. But it stores code as a binary blob in source control. And I&#39;m personally not a fan of visual scripting, I would prefer scripting by just writing code.So generally I prototype in Blueprint and then rewrite in C++ later on. I would love an intermediate language that has fast compile times and saves as a source file instead of a binary blob.The problem is most of the projects that integrate with another language get abandoned after a while. MonoUE was abandoned, USharp was abandoned, now the newest attempt to integrate UE with C# UnrealCLR looks abandoned. SkookumScript doesn&#39;t support UE5. Haxe support for UE was abandoned.Do I really want to risk writing a ton of code in a language that might not support future engine versions? To be honest, I don&#39;t want to take that risk."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is great, because Unreal is a C++ project that&#39;s not so easy to just Rewrite In Rust.True. Although rewriting Nanite in Rust would be useful. Nanite is a very clever data structure for meshes. It&#39;s brittle, and full of internal relative addresses within the data item, so it&#39;s very vulnerable to buffer overflows. If it becomes widely used outside of UE, it might become something that gets supported in GPU hardware."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is relevant to today&#39;s events because Magnus Carlsen just withdrew from a tournament[1] after yesterday&#39;s loss to a significantly lower rated opponent who had previously been suspended for cheating on chess.com. The tournament organizers have also implemented additional anti-cheating protocols starting today.Whatever comes out of these accusations, the chess world will sure enjoy its new infusion of drama.[1] https://twitter.com/MagnusCarlsen/status/1566848734616555523"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Though I&#39;m not much of a poker player myself, I am friends with many professionals who have found success both online and offline, in games from pot-limit omaha to no-limit hold-em.Cheating in online poker has been around for many years, with varying success by online gaming companies to implement anti-cheat measures in their software. With recent developments in AI, there is renewed discussion about cheating as the best AIs have no trouble beating anything from PLO to NLHE.It was only a matter of time before this started to spread offline, and just a few weeks ago, I heard a story from a friend of a friend who caught a player using a device similar to this during a private game he was hosting. It&#39;s only a matter of time before these sorts of devices continue to spread, and I&#39;m not sure how the world will respond.It would be a huge deal to cheat at events like the World Chess Tournament, but the consequences of getting caught will likely stop at complete disgrace. Cheating at events like the World Series of Poker, with tens of millions of dollars on the line, or even worse, private events with potentially billions of dollars at stake, could lead to a hell of a lot worse."</p>

Reminds me of the hidden shoe computers developed by Claude Shannon and Ed Thorp in 1960 for cheating at roulette.https://nautil.us/claude-shannon-the-las-vegas-cheat-6397J.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I did fairly well in the test (I didn&#39;t remember that you couldn&#39;t shift into the sign bit), but it really helps highlight how stupid the C promotion rules are. In C as soon as I have to do arithmetics with anything but unsigned ints all sorts of alarm bells start going off and I end up casting and recasting everything to make sure it does what I think it does, coupled with heavy testing. Now add floats and doubles into the mix and all bets are off.Rust not having a default &#34;int&#34; type and forcing you to explicitly cast everything is such an improvement. Truly a poster child for &#34;less is more&#34;. Yeah it makes the code more verbose, but at least I don&#39;t have to worry about &#34;lmao you have a signed int overflow in there you absolute nincompoop, this is going to break with -O3 when GCC 16 releases 8 years from now, but only on ARM32 when compiled in Thumb mode!&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These examples do look scary. However, in my 16 years of experience of mostly writing In C, I have never found a single chance that I need to actually use the expressions that I got the answers wrong.Never mix unsigned and signed integer comparison unless you know exactly what you are doing.And never do arithmetic on boundaries definitions like INT_MAX, they are boundaries , why you need to compute a derived value on boundaries?If you do not need arithmetic behavior, do not use signed integer, use unsigned. Because computer does not understand sign, so if you do not need a sign, do not use it.You do not need to be a language committee member to write C , you just need to understand the reason behind its design."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Found a disappointing bug in the test:  (unsigned short)1 &gt; -1 

Correct answer is: implementation-defined.The left operand of &gt; has type unsigned short, before promotion. On C implementations for today&#39;s popular, mainstream machines, short is narrower than int; therefore, whether it is signed or unsigned it goes to int.In that common case, we are doing a 1 &gt; -1 comparison in the int type.However, unsigned short may be exactly as wide as int, in which case it cannot promote to int, because its values do not fit into that type. It promotes to unsigned int in that case.  Both sides will go to unsigned int{*}, and so we are comparing 1 &gt; UINT_MAX which is 0.Maybe the author should name this &#34;GCC integer quiz for 32 bit x86&#34;, and drop the harder choices like &#34;implementation-defined&#34;.---{*} It&#39;s more nuanced here. If we have a signed and unsigned integer operand of the same rank, it could go either way. If the unsigned type has a limited range so that all its vallues are representable in the signed type, then the unsigned type goes to signed. My remark represents only the predominant situation whereby signed and unsigned types of the same rank have overlapping ranges that don&#39;t fit into each other: the unsigned version of a type not only lacks negatives, but has extra positives."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m surprised no-one in the comments has mentioned MailInABox [0].On recommendations here, I switched to it 2 or 3 months ago from Gmail, after Google announced they were going to start charging for Gmail on custom domains.  I&#39;d no previous experience at all with running my own mailservers and had always been put off by how complicated it seemed.Even with a non supported configuration setup [running the mailserver for my domain on a separate VPS from the domain itself] MIAB setup was pretty easy. I had it installed and was up and running in no time. I then spent a couple of days setting up the various DMARC MTA-STS policies etc. [most of that time involved looking up what they were and why I needed them!] and [after testing with an unimportant account] migrating the rest of mine and my family&#39;s and friends&#39; emails across from Gmail. I was able to import half a dozen accounts from Gmail with about 8GB of emails between them, using ImapSync [1]So far [fingers crossed] it&#39;s been almost painless. Giving the lie to the commonly held belief that running your own mailservers needs constant hands-on maintenance. My MIAB setup runs quite happily on a $5/month Linode [I checked the IP was not on any blacklists, before I started] and the whole thing has been pretty much &#39;fire and forget&#39;. MIAB sends me weekly reports on what&#39;s been happening. Software updates are a one-liner in the terminal and I&#39;ve had no trouble whatsoever with Google, Microsoft etc. as regards the mail not getting through.If you&#39;ve always hankered after running your own mailserver but [as I did] thought it was too difficult and required too much &#39;hands on&#39; tinkering, I heartily recommend you give MIAB a go.DISCLAIMER: I run a couple of dozen email addresses on 3 or 4 domains on my MIAB. Probably sending and receiving a few hundred emails a week between them. YMMV if you&#39;re a heavier user than this.[0] https://mailinabox.email/[1] https://imapsync.lamiral.info/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think it’s interesting that so many people see the danger in a  Twitter “mob” effectively running Kiwifarms off the public, visible internet, without recognising that Kiwifarms themselves were a mob, with the precise goal of running people (including the recently targeted streamer) off the public visible internet too. The tactics were different, but the goal is effectively the same.The key differences are Kiwifarms is targeting individuals personally. And that they’re doing it kind of randomly, for the lulz. Whereas their main opponents here are targeting a company/community, and acting in self-defence.I know who I think is more worthy of protection."</p>

After learning about the situation from the last couple threads here and going down the rabbit hole of sources, the future of the internet seems pretty sad... If cloudflare doesn&#39;t reinstate the website after dealing with said immediate danger they claimed was the reason to remove its protection it just shows how hard you can shut someone down by just twitter outrage.If the threat really was so dire, and if there really was something of the sort sure i can see allowing the obvious DDOS in the background go thru and take the website down. But not reinstating it after the time they were claiming to buy by doing it was already bought it means if you scream loud enough on twitter, even while having an obvious army of arsonists behind you, the firefighters will just stop serving said target.Sure, cloudflare is a private company and all that, nobody questions it, but it doesn&#39;t make it any less unsettling."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting to see the comment thread digging into all sorts of criticism of the article (is it 2 kWh / fridge? Or 1.1? Should the author discuss renewable earlier or more seriously?)The main point I got from the article was a helpful reminder that a large part of the world doesn&#39;t have basic things that I take for granted (not just refrigeration, but you might also include air conditioning, transportation, etc). And that if we did want the entire world to live a life that includes things like that, we just don&#39;t have the energy right now.EDIT: I kept thinking about this and it doesn&#39;t stop at just basics. It&#39;s also things like living in a comfortable, well-manufactured home. Being able to buy toys for your kids. Taking airplanes to visit family or to vacation. Enjoying the consumption of meat, or food delicacies. The list goes on as you expand the threshold from basic necessities, to comfort, to luxuries, and you can decide where you want to draw the line."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not really.A lot of poverty is societal poverty (of order, collaboration, help, education, distribution, and so on) and is worse, even all other things (like relative cost of energy to average salary) being equal.You can be a slum-living destitute poor in a country even though you have financial access personally to several times the energy expenditure of someone in another country (or area of same country) with a different lifestyle."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article is exceptional. It may be reductive or even wrong but at least it&#39;s trying to quantify these issues and it uses actual data. Not only does this allow for analysis, it also makes it, in theory, falsifiable.If the article is right and all it takes is around a doubling of the current global energy, at 1.1% population growth and a global annual increase in energy usage of 2.5%, this gives around 50 years before we start producing enough energy to push poverty levels below 1%."</p>
