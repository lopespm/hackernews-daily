								<p class="story__comment_others">"While the result is a big relief, I think it&#39;s not as decisive as I&#39;m noticing some headlines (and commenters) are claiming.One of the big open questions is &#34;are APIs copyrightable?&#34; The court skirted that question, and instead focused on whether it was fair use:&gt; To decide no more than is necessary to resolve this case, the Court assumes for argument’s sake that the copied lines can be copyrighted, and focuses on whether Google’s use of those lines was a “fair use.”That said, this case does establish a precedent that if your copying of an API is primarily for purposes of matching an interface so that developers can reimplement it, you&#39;re in fair use territory:&gt; Google copied these lines not because of their creativity or beauty but because they would allow programmers to bring their skills to a new smartphone computing environment.I&#39;ll count that as a win, on balance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; &#34;Google  copied  approximately  11,500 lines of declaring  code from the API,  which amounts to virtually all the declaring  code needed to call up hundreds  of different tasks.   Those 11,500  lines, however, are only  0.4 percent of the entire  API at issue, which consists  of 2.86 million total lines.  In considering “the amount and substantiality of the portion  used” in  this case, the 11,500 lines of code should be viewed as one small part of the  considerably  greater whole.   As  part of an interface, the copied lines of code are inextricably bound to  other lines of code that  are  accessed by  programmers.   Google copied  these lines not because of their creativity or  beauty  but because they would allow programmers  to bring  their  skills to a new smartphone computing  environment.&#34;Sanity prevailed! This judgment could have had devastating consequences and turned software development into a copyright nightmare."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very sad. I found the perfect smartphone for me - the V20. It almost feels like a smartphone that happened by accident and will never return in its glorious form again. Dont know what else to use if it dies. Already have a spare Screen and its 4th Battery ready to be used.The second screen is just the perfect solution for having an allways on display without a real (and stupid) notch. I love this feature. Also knock to power on is super convenient. Battery is replacable. The Screen is super sharp. Its thin despite its very accessible inner parts. The amp and music quality is absolutely awesome. The camera is awesome as is the sound recording quality. The IR Blaster ist just super convenient. Also the FM-Radio is a very nice addition. The camera-app is just awesome and i have yet not managed to find something simmilar. Also i like the gallery app. And the sound recording app. Its also fast, has enough power still to this day. And the SD-Card Slot combined with the internal memory gives me 640GB Storage. Also Dual SIM is nice.Really it is such an awesome phone that im not sure how this phone happened in the first place. As each Smartphone does at least 2 things stupid or hase some dumb features no one asked for.Its allways the same with me - as soon as i find the absolute perfect hardware - its already legacy and nothing like it is buyable in the future ...The V20 is like the perfect tool. No stupid features only used for sales, no shortcuts, just a very nice package. Two things i would change: Cameras should never stick out and the volume buttons should be on the back like on the G4."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I find most sad about this is that LG appears to be the only manufacturer who makes phones with both wireless charging and a headphone jack. Somehow these features seem to contradict themselfs for other manufacturers. Wireless charging is seen as a premium feature, while headphone jack is seen as a budget feature. I unfortunately have gotten so used to both that I don&#39;t want to give them up. I love my wired headphones and my phone is pretty much always at 80% (Battery limiter) since it always charges when I&#39;m at my desk. Right now I don&#39;t see a reason to upgrade my V30 but when that time comes I hope someone makes a similar phone (my biggest hope is Sony as they at least appear to be interested in headphones, now they just need to add wireless charging)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can only think of a few reasons that LG couldn&#39;t make it, and none of them are enough to sink a brand:* Lack of updates
* Occasionally non-flagship hardware
* That Nexus issue many years agoTheir UI is better than Samsung. They&#39;re less intrusive than samsung. Their flagships are usually pretty good and come at good discounts soon after release.I have an S21 now, and the number of bloatware samsung apps has me wanting to move back to Oneplus or even Apple, maybe. I only bought it because I wanted a flagship high-refresh phone under 6.5&#34;.I&#39;ll miss LG a bit, it isn&#39;t as if we need fewer competitors in the Android space. It&#39;s Chinese brands, Samsung, and Google now pretty much, no?"</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26700319">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The reason why the Economist articles all read the same is that they go through a process called &#34;subbing&#34; or sub-editing by the same small group of editors who own the Economist&#39;s &#34;voice&#34;.I interned at the Economist one summer in college and wrote two articles for it - the published articles bore a small relationship to what I had submitted. The sub-editors seemed to be mostly George Smiley-type Oxford and Cambridge PhD&#39;s of a certain age with an eclectic range of expertises, as far as I recall."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In high school, there were two magazines I’d read regularly: The Atlantic had an absurdly inexpensive subscription price (I think it was $14 for 2 years at the time) and The Economist was...not inexpensive, so I’d just pick up a copy when I was fortunate enough to visit a bookstore that carried it.The Economist was the only magazine in my life I would regularly read cover to cover. Every article revealed something I didn’t know about the world, or about my own country, and the information was dense. Most articles were just a few paragraphs, so I didn’t have time to get bored before I’d move on to the next one."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I respect the writing in the Economist. It&#39;s kept to a high standard and they put their cases well with evidence as the article here highlights. Even the times I don&#39;t agree with their position, I still respect it.I wonder how much it helps that their writers are anonymous and therefore less likely to go on personal flights of fancy or building an argumentative approach. It is perhaps puts the individual writer on the backfoot but makes the quality of the publication higher. Personally I think other sources would do well to consider this - frankly I would rather be a fan of an idea than a writer: the former seems reasonable the latter likely to vere into pointless worship. Plus it&#39;s much easier to switch to new ideas if they&#39;re superceded by better ones in due course."</p>

I was motivated and so our Hydrology professor made me the TA for his Hydraulics class.He would give me questions with no answers to go through in my sections. The questions were damn hard and I would sometimes ask them on Yahoo! answers and this particular guy from India would always come and answer them meticulously and write integrals using unholy script like: int(a,b)Sin x dx and such and I would happily decode them for half an hour before trying to understand the solution.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"“Seem” is the key word here. I’d be fine if they stopped at the scenery, but this quote is just outright misleading and makes it look like a paid hype piece:&gt; “All aircraft have been reviewed with professional pilots who have many hours flying these aircraft or test pilots from the manufacturers to make sure they are controlled exactly like they should.” … In other words, when sim-pilots try to yank-and-bank an A320, they will get the exact same response as if they were flying the real thing.For contrast read some takes by professional pilots, here’s one[0]:&gt; I’ll confess that I don’t know that type of modelling FS2020 is using. But given how it feels, and how it’s the child of FSX, I’m inclined to think it’s using a lookup table. This isn’t necessarily a problem — a good lookup table with many data points could be just as good, if not better than, a blade-element model. Unfortunately, FS2020 doesn’t seem to have a good lookup table. The the linear behaviour unrealistic and the non-linear modelling is terrible.&gt; Maneuvering is laughably easy — and not because the aircraft handles nicely. It’s easy because the aircraft feels like it has no inertia. Yes, the real plane is very maneuverable and responsive, but there’s a “weight” to direction changes which is completely missing. In FS2020, you can instantly pull 60 degree or more turns, and exit them just as quickly. In XP11, there’s a residual tendency to turn that you have to arrest when exiting a maneuver.If you care about how the world looks, get MSFS. If you care about the physics of flying, get X-Plane—it’s an excellent project developed by a smaller company and sold for a fraction of the cost of Microsoft’s product. XP strives to provide the actual fine-grained simulation of flight surface behavior based on weight, shape, etc. (Yes, this means your computer will spend most of its resources simulating rather than painting a pretty picture.)If I had to draw a parallel, X-Plane is more or less the iRacing of flight sims, while MSFS2020 is closer to something like F1 2019.[0] https://medium.com/swlh/microsoft-flight-simulator-2020-no-c...Bias statement: I own a copy of XP11, otherwise not affiliated."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Netflix recorded a worldwide income tax accounting expense of about 13.7% last year ($438M on $3.2B of Net Income). It also paid cash taxes of $292M (cash taxes differ from accounting taxes because of timing issues - just like revenue is not the same as cash-in).A lot of growing companies have US taxes that are quite low because they lose money for a long time while they&#39;re investing in growth. When they finally become profitable, they&#39;re allowed to roll forward those losses (within limits) to offset their profits. That&#39;s where a lot of these &#34;Zero taxes paid&#34; headlines come from.On the other hand there is a legitimate gripe about using IP offshoring to shift profits to low-tax countries and out of the US, using accelerated depreciation to decrease current year profits, allowing tax deductibility of interest and lots and lots of tax deferrals and deductions for property transactions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is crazy how economy is tilted in favour of these big corporations. If you are a worker, it is not uncommon to pay over 40% of tax and if you work on your own small business you can pay even more and have very little left to reinvest. Then you have progressive tax that is preventing you from saving much - if you want to save for a deposit to buy a house, spend time on education and getting a better job, you&#39;ll get hit by much higher tax and it will take ages to save anything. Such taxes are often sold to the public as taxes on the rich, but rich people can easily afford ways around it. 
I&#39;ll vote for any party that will reshuffle the tax system, so that big corporations will have to pay tax just as any other business and tax progression will be removed, so that people will have a chance of levelling up.
They should also add a tax on spending money with offshore cards, dividends and so on so that the rich will pay what they are supposed to pay."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Among the mechanisms Netflix is using to achieve its next-to-nothing tax liability are accelerated depreciation (which appears to have cut the company’s tax expense by $148 million); deductions for stock options for Netflix executives and other employees ($339 million); and research and development tax credits ($113 million).These are straightforward deductions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;By default, PostgreSQL listens on a TCP port 5432.This post seems to outright state that by default postgres is listening to everyone via TCP for connection.This is not true.Unless you edit pg_ident.conf, your postgres install will not listen for connections outside of on localhost. So, while it&#39;s correct to say that it listens to TCP port 5432, there is a very narrow limit to whom it&#39;s listening for. Namely, the same machine.Postgres is pretty secure by default. It doesn&#39;t allow external connections. It also requires a username and password to connect with permissions on the database you&#39;re connecting to.Compare that to something like redis. They at least used to listen for connections external by default and not even have a password to connect. I can imagine it&#39;s still very easy to find all kinds of interesting stuff snooping around on port 6379."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Unfortunately, this sort of air-gapped setup is not something PostgreSQL supports out-of-the-box.Is a reverse tunnel really air gapped?I thought AG meant one had to physically touch the device and transfer using devices without any network capability, such as a flash drive?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I personally secure my postgres instances by putting them in a silod vpc without internet access. I then limit incoming connections to only be allowed from the separate vpc containing the application serverI then use a bastion host when I need to access ssh on the instance. The bastion host remains off and inaccessible except for when I need to perform maintenance.The advantages of this is that there is no &#34;always-open&#34; access to the instance.Not sure why the author does not advocate this."</p>
