								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Having been an interviewer at a FAANG for many years, I can explain some of the logic behind it. I&#39;m not saying this logic is valid, but it&#39;s how we got here, imho.First: we no longer trust the hiring manager alone, because probably they aren&#39;t a strong developer. We instead trust strong developers that are well trained at evaluating good devs. At the same time, we don&#39;t want to thrust a dev onto a hiring manager, so they also need to interview you too and have a say.Second: Is it really fair to have just one or two developers evaluate you? When I first was an interviewer, I liked everybody! I would have hired them all. So getting multiple data points matters. Best to have at least a couple dev interviews.Then there&#39;s the whole problem of needing to evaluate you on multiple dimensions. Can one interview really tell if you&#39;re good problem solving, coding, algorithms/data structures, and any specialization the role has? What about the soft skills aspect? We&#39;re going to need to have at least 3 or 4 interviews to cover all these aspects. These roles pay a huge sum of money, so there&#39;s a lot of worry that someone will be hired who doesn&#39;t really meet the bar, you know?But now we have a bigger problem: if we&#39;re going to invest 4+ people to spend an hour of time with you each, we&#39;d better have some data points that you&#39;re worth that investment. So maybe we need one or two initial interviews ahead of time to weed out any obviously unlikely candidates.After that, it&#39;s every other company going &#34;Oh shit, Amazon does 6 interviews? We should do that too!&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Tech is very cargo cultish, which comes from having a young average age, and a strong survivorship bias in the media. Remember the Google brainteasers? Fizzbuzz? &#34;Culture fit&#34;?Tech companies have the lowest infrastructure costs of any industry, and so they have no place to hang their risk aversive paranoia except on personnel (the safer you are, the more trivial the things you fear).There&#39;s nothing logical about it, but since they have to fear something, it&#39;ll be whatever some douchebag with a following puts in their next &#34;XYZ considered harmful&#34; blog post."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hiring manager here. IMO the current tech hiring norms are gross and not sustainable. It feels like a weird hazing ritual and with the current market, is the single biggest reason you can&#39;t hire. Why on earth would someone burn a weekend on a take-home test for your startup when they have 15 other irons in the fire? At my current employer we got rid of all that ridiculousness. No take home test. No live coding. We&#39;ve gotten the whole process down to a few hours over a few days. I&#39;d like to think it&#39;s a mutually respectful process.I think it&#39;s time we accept that the person we are talking to is who they say they are on their resume. You don&#39;t see accountants balancing books before they get hired. Why should this be any different? If you aren&#39;t who you say you are, its either blatantly obvious in the interview or we&#39;ll find out when you join and we&#39;ll try to correct or part ways. This is like pretty much any other job out there."</p>

I know it&#39;s drastic, but if companies can turn what should be a basic device into an amorphous system that starts serving ads without the end-users consent after purchase, that should constitute a material change to the end product that was not appropriately advertised.This is the exact kind of thing that consumer protection laws should be able to cover."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sadly it&#39;s a logical and inevitable consequence of giving up control over our technology.I think the answer has to be, simply never buy a TV that you wouldn&#39;t be completely satisfied with as a dumb HDMI display. Cos even if it&#39;s not abuse like this, eventually the built in functionality will break, or become too insecure to keep active on your network.In fact it goes for just about any appliance these days: whether it&#39;s your fridge, microwave, dryer, doorbell or anything else, if it doesn&#39;t have a &#34;dumb&#34; offline mode where you are still completely happy with what it does, don&#39;t buy it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’m bothered by the description of the history of “junk” dna. Going by this article dna, researchers labeled it junk just because they couldn’t analyze it well and prioritized the easier 92% and thus didn’t understand it. Calling it junk just seems like trying to compensate for not understanding it like “I don’t understand it but that’s fine because it’s junk anyway”And the scientist quote seems so wrong. if missing almost 10% of something when that ~10% is not like the other 90% then it seems like a very bad assumption to assume that it doesn’t show a lot of important features.The quote: “ You would think that, with 92 percent of the genome completed long ago, another eight percent wouldn’t contribute much“"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Now on to the more important challenge. Making our understanding of the human genome more diverse and less specific to certain geographic areas. This is already having an impact in studies, drug development, etc based on genomics.Investing in organizations such as H3Africa will be important."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"“As it is assumed that there is an even distribution of bugs through all software, it is safe to consider any piece of software to be bug free once a certain number of bugs have been found”Lol genius. Anyone else ever do that thing where you write some good code and it works the first time you test it, but somehow that makes you feel less confident. Other times you write some crap code and it has several immediately found bugs but weirdly you emotionally feel more confident in that code because you “fixed” the bugs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Blockchain can help with this. We can record all defects on the blockchain and have tamper proof evidence of those who consistently fail to adhere to this RFC. It will encourage developers to write bug proof code everywhere. Employers can further encourage developers to stop writing bugs by docking the gas fees from their paycheck. This works doubly so on devs who are blockchain &#34;non-believers&#34; because they desperately will not want to contribute to the heat death of our planet. (Those people clearly don&#39;t get the bigger picture. The colossal waste of energy will obviously be offset by the fact that code throughout the world will no longer have bugs and people will be more efficient.)This seems like it could be the one of the best thing to ever happen to the software industry in decades and has no possible chance of unintended consequences."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Excellent. Now instead of saying &#34;this doesn&#39;t work&#34; I can say &#34;this software is in violation of RFC 9225&#34;."</p>

We all know that it was some mistake by some AI. Even the author knows that.But we also know that the only way to get customer support from YouTube is to get some social media outrage.It&#39;s so common, Google should put on their website: &#34;If you need customer support, please try to create some outrage on social media.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"A video of myself and my kids singing a &gt;100 year old shanty was flagged on YouTube for DMCA.A modern folk art drawing I made of a squid was blocked on Instagram for a content violation. I joked that the AI must be afraid of tentacles. The only explanation that made sense was that it looked vaguely phallic in the way that any of nature&#39;s &#34;bulbed cylinders&#34; do, but even that seemed like a stretch -- I should think they would have flagged an earlier painting of mushrooms.The lesson is to make everything look like a butt in a thong. None of the content moderation anywhere seems to have a problem with butts in thongs. Bulbed cylinders: bad. Smooshed jiggle orbs: good. Just no nipples."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not saying this is what&#39;s happening here, but here&#39;s a playbook I could see behind it:1. Automatic/ML/AI/buzzword filtering that is, in blunt terms, kinda crappy2. Preemptively and diligently correct for any such crappy decisions that would result in PR nightmares or credible lawsuits3. Apply some portion of your effort to reviewing some portion of the cases that appeal. Hope (nudge nudge, wink wink) that those cases that you couldn&#39;t review, because you simply don&#39;t have the resources to review everything in depth, are those of your &#34;enemies.&#34; You&#39;re not suppressing them; you just didn&#39;t have the resources to help them.Result: The system punishes your enemies by design and you and your enemies can just blame the AI and your front line support, which everyone already loves to do. People who are suspicious can be painted as nutjobs, because it&#39;s obviously just the unfortunate but classic case of the little guy against the giant indifferent bureaucracy.Thus any sufficiently influential entity can wield Hanlon&#39;s Razor as a weapon. You don&#39;t event need to plan for this; it is bound to happen. Parts 1. and 2. happening are foregone conclusions. When the opportunity for part 3. arises, I think people in all levels of the organization would quickly and tacitly realize that uneven review is in their best interest, if they don&#39;t just do it automatically out of laziness or tribal thinking."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think it&#39;s interesting how different people view status, like the &#34;Harvard Professor or Homeless guy?&#34; quiz that used to get passed around.I grew up in one of the last WASP strongholds in the US and the more money you had, the smaller the house you lived in (up to a point).  People could afford insanely expensive cars, but would buy tasteful ones instead (excepting kids).Most people wouldn&#39;t be caught dead in a Ralph Lauren polo, but would happily wear a bleach-stained, rumpled Brooks Brothers shirt.  Outside of special occasions, people didn&#39;t dress nice at all - they dressed like they just came back from sailing.Engineering, medicine, and law were not considered high-status.  Well, if you wanted to work a job, I guess they were - but they were considered ordinary.  It was better to own something (but not work), run a non-profit, or have a PhD (in the classics, or whatever).  Most parents told their children &#34;I don&#39;t care what you do - but do something interesting!&#34;.  Being an artist was considered good, too.Fame, and appearing in the media, were about the worst things you could achieve.The biggest status indicator was how well read you were.  It is so deeply ingrained in me, that I still find myself more impressed by well read people than almost anything else, and I haven&#39;t lived there in over a decade.There are a couple of these strongholds remaining, where even the wealthiest people are not allowed to move to because they don&#39;t have the right last name, or can&#39;t trace their lineage to the Mayflower.If you removed these people and put them anywhere else, you&#39;d think of them as low status and strange."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Choose money and you’ll end up working all the time. Choose beauty and you’ll always want to look better. Choose fame and you’ll constantly be seeking attention.This is straight-up paraphrasing David Foster Wallace in This Is Water, just that DFW was talking about these things as de-facto personal religions that we&#39;re usually unconscious of. So the &#34;choose&#34; part isn&#39;t nearly that explicit in his view.The bit in This Is Water:&gt; If you worship money and things, if they are where you tap real meaning in life, then you will never have enough, never feel you have enough. It’s the truth. Worship your body and beauty and sexual allure and you will always feel ugly. And when time and age start showing, you will die a million deaths before they finally plant you... Worship power, you will end up feeling weak and afraid, and you will need ever more power over others to numb you to your own fear. Worship your intellect, being seen as smart, you will end up feeling stupid, a fraud, always on the verge of being found out. But the insidious thing about these forms of worship is not that they’re evil or sinful, it’s that they’re unconscious. They are default settings."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not sure how this will sit with the HN crowd, but a couple of years back I got into menswear, and I derive some pleasure from being the &#34;best dressed guy&#34; at the office.Beyond personal opinions on that particular hobby, I can confirm first hand that living at the intersection of two or more personas (e.g. a programmer that dresses well) brings a peculiar sense of joy. I might no have much status in either of those categories, but bringing both together makes you stand out more."</p>

What the judge has done is send a clear message, that he won&#39;t sentence you on the merits of the case but will sentence you to serve his own agenda. The only message this sends is that justice has failed. It&#39;s always completely transparent who exactly gets made an example of, and who gets off with a slap on the wrist.

Things much worse than this are tweeted every day and this is the one that gets prosecuted. It’s blatantly politically motivated (‘national hero’, British soldier etc) and in terms of awful things people tweet…it’s not actually that bad.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; There is no way for changes in the outside world—such as a new version of a dependency being published—to automatically affect a Go build.&gt; Unlike most other package managers files, Go modules don’t have a separate list of constraints and a lock file pinning specific versions. The version of every dependency contributing to any Go build is fully determined by the go.mod file of the main module.I don&#39;t know if this was intentional on the author&#39;s part, but this reads to me like it&#39;s implying that with package managers that do use lockfiles a new version of a dependency can automatically affect a build.The purpose of a lockfile is to make that false. If you have a valid lockfile, then fetching dependencies is 100% deterministic across machines and the existence of new versions of a package will not affect the build.It is true that most package managers will automatically update a lockfile if it&#39;s incomplete instead of failing with an error. That&#39;s a different behavior from Go where it fails if the go.mod is incomplete. I suspect in practice this UX choice doesn&#39;t make much of a difference. If you&#39;re running CI with an incomplete lockfile, you&#39;ve already gotten yourself into a weird state. It implies you have committed a dependency change without actually testing it, or that you tested it locally and then went out of your way to discard the lockfile changes.Either way, I don&#39;t see what this has to do with lockfiles as a concept. Unless I&#39;m missing something, go.mod files are lockfiles."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Most package managers have lockfiles. Yes, npm&#39;s decision to have both &#34;npm install&#34; and &#34;npm ci&#34;, just so you can confuse and mislead developers, is a bit silly.But Ruby&#39;s Bundler, for example, has been refusing to run your code if your lockfile is inconsistent for as long as I remember.Locking dependencies is, generally, a solved problem across most ecosystems (despite node botching its UX). Go doesn&#39;t get to claim that it&#39;s superior here.But of course, supply chain attacks are still possible with lock files. Because somebody is going to update your dependencies at some point (often for security reasons). And at that point you might be pulling in a malicious dependency which you haven&#39;t carefully vetted (because nobody has time to vet all their dependencies thoroughly nowadays).That&#39;s still an unsolved problem, as far as I know. I don&#39;t think that Go has solved it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The elephant in the room here is NPM, and I think the obvious problem there is the culture. I have a tiny app I&#39;ve been playing with using create-react-app. There are over 800 directories in node_modules. That absolutely dwarfs the number of any other language I&#39;ve used. Even in a medium sized rails app, you likely have some awareness of what every dependency is. It&#39;s just impossible with npm.One thought I&#39;ve had to &#34;reboot&#34; the npm culture is to somehow curate packages that are proven to have minimal and safe dependencies, and projects can shift to using those. I imagine there has to be some sort of manual review to make that happen."</p>
