								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wonder if this is because we&#39;re lonely..?  Just wondering out loud here.E.g. Twitter - feels like many of the &#34;thought leaders&#34; I follow, their &#34;friends&#34; are also on Twitter.  And they tweet/respond so much I often wonder if they&#39;re really ever &#34;building a business&#34;. And are they ever interacting with their real-world friends or family?Or if their lives just consist of a constant refresh of their feed. Even at dinner, I wonder if they&#39;re even present?And I wonder if that&#39;s why podcasts have become so popular - it&#39;s someone talking to you.  Someone having a conversation, albeit one-sided, but usually it&#39;s pretty interesting.For the same lonely reasons, I wonder if this is why public radio has been so popular with long haul truck drivers.  Everyone wants to hear a human voice once in a while.The constant reading, listening and entertaining videos...  The voice in your head generates a discussion, with itself. At least it&#39;s something.We work from home.  It&#39;s quiet.  With no one around. We&#39;re looking for a preoccupation.We&#39;re just desperate for any type of human interaction.&#34;Likes&#34;, hearts, thumbs-up, upvotes, +1, PR merge, etc. 
 - are we just clinging to anything that acknowledges our existence and humanity."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Because we humans have a lot of idle time.We feel like we&#39;re wasting it, and we feel we should instead spend time archiving goals, to better ourselves, to do something more meaningful.  
But that is not how life works. You are just unnecessarily burden yourself with guilt. Thinking you should be doing something else. There are so many things to learn about, so many things to experience, right? We fear on missing out on life, chasing something, but what exactly we don&#39;t really know.But maybe you just don&#39;t need to? Most of us are exactly fine with where we are. Of course you should always strive to improve, but truth is &#34;killing time&#34; is a big part of life. Especially for top of the food chain animals like humans. Watch some livestreams of lions on youtube, what do they do? 99% of the time they just sit under a tree doing absolutely nothing, and I bet they don&#39;t feel guilty about it. People used to walk labyrinths for hours and hours, just to kill time.This whole notion that you need to make the most out of every moment, live life to the fullest, see all the places, chase the uncomfortable! - I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessarily the best advice, the happiest people I&#39;ve met tend to have very simple boring routines."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am addicted to twitter and reddit. Especially reddit. It often takes the place of reading, hobbies, quiet moments, improving my home, talking with my spouse, and playing with my baby.When reddit records a click or an upvote, it thinks it has been a Good Product, and created Engagement. Reddit then takes those feedback loops and tunes the algorithm and feedback loops to create further engagement.But in reality, there&#39;s almost no positive relationship between my engagement with social media and my personal human flourishing. I think these products are mostly poison for my soul."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi! I&#39;m the person who wrote that blog post.
If you have any questions whatsoever, please let me know!English is not my native language and &#34;The solution is trivial&#34; was meant sarcastic. The solution isn&#39;t trivial at all, nor is it complete, because solving the corner cases is complex.I&#39;d also like to mention ahead of time that DirectWrite/Direct2D is very fast at drawing western (Latin) text without coloring (&gt;2000 FPS). In other words, in most situations Casey&#39;s suggestion doesn&#39;t help much, but it does address his termbench issue. At the time we assumed we were using the API incorrectly, after all Direct2D already had everything Casey suggested we should implement and it ran very fast outside of termbench. The new solution is largely identical to regular Direct2D with the only major difference being that ClearType/Grayscale gamma-correction is run on the GPU instead.Casey&#39;s suggestion wasn&#39;t unique to me, as a significant number of other terminals do it exactly that way in OpenGl, something I was quite familiar with already. Originally I credited alacritty in the blog, because that&#39;s how I knew how to do it, but I removed it to keep the article as succinct as possible. Someone kindly offered a HLSL shader on GitHub for us to use, but I didn&#39;t make use of that either."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The idea is that the bidder&#39;s precision signals confidence, and that low confidence signals amenability to negotiation, and that negotiation leads to poorer outcomes for the bidder. The HBS paper they cite on M&amp;A [0] is most interesting, to my view, in the sense that both players in the M&amp;A &#34;game&#34; are presumably quantitative. One would think a social psychology effect would be less so in a game between quants, but their interviews suggest perceived confidence does matter. The precision signals that the bidder is confident pricing and negotiating analytically.The thing I am curious about in [0] is that they report the bid price per share, and not (unless I missed it) the asking price. I don&#39;t know how M&amp;A &#34;works&#34;. If you and I are both estimating the value of a good, if our estimates are close it&#39;s one thing and if they are far apart it&#39;s another. Are rounders losing because their estimates are less accurate, relative their counterparty&#39;s?[0] https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/16-058_27d73983-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another extremely successful tactic I stumbled upon by accident: electing a 3rd party decision maker that the other negotiator can&#39;t communicate with. Without the communication channel, the other negotiator is forced to &#34;sweeten the deal&#34; instead of using conversational skills.I received a job offer while my wife was traveling. The number was right for me and the job/company was right. But I told the hiring manager that I needed to talk it through with my wife first and that I&#39;d need a few days (no context about why I needed the time or which direction I expected it to go).She got home 3 days later. We sat down, talked it through for 10 minutes, and we were ready to accept.In the time between the initial offer and accepting the offer, I received 3 updated offers with increasing compensation. The final offer I accepted was $75k higher than the initial offer.After experiencing that, I&#39;ve noticed companies use this tactic frequently. When you call into a help center, often times the phone operator &#34;will need to talk to their manager&#34; who is authorized to make the actual decision. You aren&#39;t allowed to talk to the manager - all communication goes through the intermediary. I suspect they are aware that this is an effective negotiating tactic."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Surely this has something to do with the anchoring effect:- If you offer £210,000, it&#39;s a signal that you&#39;re looking at increments of £10,000.- If you offer £211,000 it&#39;s a signal that you&#39;re looking at increments of £1,000.- If you offer £211,000.01 then it signals that you&#39;re taking the piss.I&#39;m sure there&#39;s something about confidence and accuracy in there too, but I would expect anchoring effects to be stronger in those contexts."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The sooner we collectively decide that housing shouldn&#39;t be a market, the better. We all need it, and we should figure out mechanisms to make it available to all.Practically that means paying to build and maintain housing stocks, changing tax incentives so developers are incentivized to build more housing and less luxury housing, charging a premium for unused land in desirable areas (parking lots don&#39;t house people), abolish mandatory minimum parking, and upzone neighborhoods (eliminating the &#34;single family home&#34; neighborhoods as a zoning type.)I&#39;m also of the much more radical opinion that we should protect tenants over landlords in nearly every case, that we should protect the rights of people to live where they&#39;ve historically lived (eg, one shouldn&#39;t be &#34;priced out&#34; of the home they&#39;ve lived in for 20 years), and we should offer extensive public housing (built as many geographically distributed small apartment buildings and 5 over 1s, not giant tenements or projects.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Moody&#39;s who quite famously engaged in what should be criminal conspiracy regarding the rating of MBS [1] leading up to 2008 that cost pension funds, mutual funds and investors billions of dollars makes further statements about the housing market.Sorry but I don&#39;t put a lot of stock in what Moody&#39;s says about anything.There&#39;s pretty strong evidence that the rise in house values is structural not speculative. This is essentially the constraint of supply. There are multiple causes of this including:1. The US building very few new homes 2010-2020. There are lots of reasons for this. A big problem is the type of housing being built, particularly in urban center where like NYC where the vast bulk of new housing units are ultra-luxury condos;2. Permissive policies allowing the rich to park money in real estate. This particularly includes foreign nationals from places like China, India and Russia; and3. An increase in people owning multiple properties. These include second homes, vacation homes and short-term rentals (most notably for AirBnB). There&#39;s strong evidence that AirBnB in particular has huge negative impacts on a lot of metropolitan areas.A lot of tempted to blame Blackrock and other instituationl investors as constraining suply. this is completely overblown.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In Keycloak nothing made sense to me until I got myself familiar with OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect.Keycloaks documentation seems vast, but isn&#39;t. There is also no way to search inside their documentation. It&#39;s a pity.A better documentation is contained in the administration web ui itself. There are so many &#34;hints&#34; and tooltips for almost every option there is. It really helped me a lot.Keycloak is good software. It never failed for me. Even upgrading from 7.x.x to 16.x.x somehow just worked.Yes, their docker image is fat, but it&#39;s also very flexible. Now that they are basing Keycloak on Quarkus instead on Wildfly, the docker image should shrink in size.    quay.io/keycloak/keycloak   18.0.0                      a6bd0f949af0   15 hours ago   562MB
    quay.io/keycloak/keycloak   18.0.0-legacy               421e95f49589   46 hours ago   753MB

ok, still big :).Beware: they aren&#39;t using Docker Hub anymore. Newer versions are on Quay only (https://quay.io/repository/keycloak/keycloak).I&#39;m happy with Keycloak. Also nice folks around Keycloak."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My company used Keycloak for a long time (I&#39;m not there any more) and I agree with everyone here, it works great, but it&#39;s hard to understand unless you already know oauth/oidc, and it is a huge binary.While Keycloak is a great out-of-the-box solution, my #1 complaint at the time was how heavyweight it was, which was a burden for development, followed closely by its packaging as a J2EE app and bundling with Wildfly (at the time).This meant we needed to know not only about Keycloak itself, but also about Wildfly&#39;s special quirks, the clustering system (Infinispan??), Java and Docker.Now it&#39;s packaged with Quarkus, which is another dependency to learn about, and to be honest despite the quality of the finished product, all those dependencies have become pretty off-putting.So while I can recommend Keycloak&#39;s functionality, if you&#39;re not already deploying Java apps as part of your job, I suspect it will present a pretty serious administrative burden to deploy into serious production."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We tried using keycloak in a startup where I worked. It needed a loooooooot of memory and was very slow to start. It probably needed some JVM tuning, but we were just deploying as a stateful set (for the postgres). The docker images were also huge.We had to use another FOSS project called Gatekeeper as an authentication software along with keycloak, which got obsoleted and replaced with a different project (lukedo proxy or some such).The community support was also relatively not that active like other FOSS project that we used (for other areas of the stack). Overall, the experience was not so great that we decided to ditch both keycloak and gatekeeper. This was about a couple of years back. Not sure what the current status is.Some other alternatives that we wanted to try were from the Ory project (Kratos etc.) But we just went with some proprietary AUTH solution in our startup."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This sounds like burnout to me. I am in my mid-40s and used to have spells like this, but no more. I needed some kind of large change, back then, to get myself sorted out, but this could be pretty destructive because if I waited too long, the change I&#39;d need wouldn&#39;t really be conducive to staying on whatever project I was on.The key to not having to deal with this problem anymore, for me, was starting to proactively switch things around to break the routine of consecutive work-weeks. One of my tricks was to do some kind of mini-vacation every 6-8 weeks, go somewhere new, leave work behind for 3-4 days. Even smaller things like regular social events can work wonders - anything that breaks the weekly routine.Back when I&#39;d get myself into burnout periods the most effective way to recover enthusiasm was to pick up a new skill, work-related or not. I was in my mid-30s in the late aughts and not entirely sure I wanted to keep coding - so I signed myself up for an 18 month &#34;executive MBA&#34; program to find out if I might want to do something else, and instead came out of that with a whole new outlook on how and why to write code.Then around 5 years later I started writing code on the side, for myself, to gradually improve over the long term, and this can be absolutely therapeutic.Try to switch things around a little bit, do something new, see if that helps?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Your problem is very simple: you are working on bullshit.Across your entire description of your situation you never once mentioned what it is you are actually working on but called out the income you hit and frameworks you are playing with. I humbly submit that your problem is that you have lost the plot.Hate to break it to you chief but the libraries and frameworks and techniques you use to work are not the point. Creating stuff that people want to use is all that matters. Doing it with finesse and craftsmanship is how you go from good to great but if nobody gives a shit you will always feel empty.Switching projects and doing something &#34;harder&#34; isn&#39;t going to fill that void.Build something people want. I promise your drive and all the rest will follow behind once you are making them happy and get hooked on solving their problems and improving their lives.That is what this game is all about."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ll pile on to the burnout suggestion with my own personal solution to how I fixed that problem.I&#39;m early 40s, started coding around 13 or so, so it&#39;s been 30 years of software for me.  About ten years ago after living in the web programming world for a few years I got kind of the same feeling you have.  I missed my forms and windows app development, so I went to another company doing what I remembered enjoying.You can guess what happened next.  I hated it.  I remembered all the things that annoyed me about windows app development, and realized I was just tired of coding every day.  Coding has never been what I like about coding, it&#39;s building things that do things.  I started focusing more on the building side, this time with the team around me, and also just some non coding fun projects like learning auto mechanics, etc.  I drifted into a management role by accident and found a ton of fulfillment in coaching and mentoring.  After a while I started to miss the coding side, so I went into an architecture role where I still got to do coding but it was mostly exploratory POC stuff to decide on new technologies or not.  I took a role after that as a principal engineer, and while these are all mostly just title changes, it gave me enough variety to be exciting again.Today I tell prospective employers that I am someone that drifts between IC and leadership roles.  I believe experience in both helps both.  My drive waxes and wanes but I think that&#39;s totally normal for humans.  I just came to terms with it and stopped worrying about it, and now I&#39;m very satisfied in my career."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Energy densities of various substances and/or reactions is pretty fascinating concept.Some of the most interesting energy analysis I&#39;ve come across (Vaclav Smil and David MacKay especially) describe energy in terms of area:  what are the comparable land areas which would have to be dedicated to specific sources or forms of energy or fuels, and how do those compare?  One of Smil&#39;s descriptions of petroleum wells is &#34;punctiform&#34;, which I love.  A hole in the ground, only about 20 cm in diameter, can provide years to millennia of human energy output, per day.1 litre of oil is equivalent to about 3 days of human energy output (at 3,000 kilocalories/day).1 gallon of oil is eqivalent to about 11 days of human energy.One of the oldest oil wells in production (the First Oil Well of Bahrain) produced 80,000 barrels of oil per day initially.  That&#39;s over 1,000 years of human energy equivalent.By comparison, the yeild of current biomass production is far, far less.  The difference, of course, is that oil is biomass, accumulated, converted, and concentrated over hundreds of millions of years.  We&#39;re consuming it at &gt; 5 million times its rate of formation.  (See Jeffrey S. Dukes, &#34;Burning Buried Sunshine&#34; (2003).)In terms of radioactivity, the net metabolic rate of the Sun&#39;s core is lower than that of a human, measured in energy/mass.  Solar metabolism is closer to that of reptiles, about 1/5 of mamallian metabolic rates.Chemical energy is less productive than the most effective nuclear transitions, but its shear abundance and ease of utilisation tends to weigh in its favour."</p>

Even if you captured that decay energy with perfect efficiency, powering a house would require about 300 quadrillion[6] bananas&gt; [6] Fine, I looked it up this time.I think that&#39;s out by a factor of 1000.Potassium-40 decays 89.28% of the time to calcium-40, releasing 1.31 MeV, and 10.72% of the time to argon-40 releasing 1.46 MeV [1].  That&#39;s .8928*1.31+.1072*1.46 = 1.32608 MeV per decay on average, which is about 2.1246e-13 Joules [2] per decay on average.  15 decays per second is 15*2.1246e-13 ≈ 3.1869e-12 Watts = 3.1869 picowatts per banana.  I think Randall is using 1000 Watts as the average power usage of a house.  1000/3.1869e-12 ≈ 3.1378e14 ≈ 300,000,000,000,000 = 300 trillion bananas.  Maybe he looked it up wrong?Can anyone confirm this?I can&#39;t find the packing density of bananas, but if it was 1000 kg/m^3, a medium banana is ~118 g [3], so 1000/.118 ≈ 8475 bananas / cubic metre, so 300e14/8475 ≈ 3.54e12 cubic metres of bananas.  The New York metro area is about 12000 km^2 = 12e9 m^2 [4], so the depth of the banana pile is on average 3.54e12/12e9 ≈ 295 metres, which is indeed taller than most of the buildings, so that bit seems right.It&#39;s half past midnight here, so I&#39;m well into &#34;Someone is wrong on the internet&#34; [5] territory....[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium-40[2] https://www.unitjuggler.com/convert-energy-from-MeV-to-J.htm...[3] https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/bananas-calories-carbs[4] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_metropolitan_area[5] https://xkcd.com/386/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been using Hasura and TablePlus a lot lately, and actually wished for something that combines them.Hasura is great at understanding relations and making joins feel effortless and TablePlus is so good at making table editing feel as fast as excel.This looks like it&#39;s the thing, with some extra power thrown on top (formulas and nested layouts are nice!).The UI looks drab, but maybe that&#39;s ok? It means the functionality needs to be so strong it doesn&#39;t matter. It also looks super snappy which matters most.Something that Airtable has over relational database GUIs is lightweight enums and arrays of them. Sure you can model all that in SQL, but it&#39;s super useful to have it right inline. I hope this tool can pick up on a pattern like enum tables (like hasura) and provide UI that makes them look like tag list/select fields."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here’s some more information on Ultorg:&gt; Ultorg creates general-purpose software that helps organizations manage their data. Based on a new method for interactive data visualization, our product combines ease-of-use with expressive power to allow end-users to query, display, and edit relational data, without resorting to custom programming. This fills a long-standing gap between spreadsheets and tailor-made database applications. [0]I find it inspiring that it has such readable and space-efficient interface, compared to current trends in many web apps.[0] https://ultorg.com"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Related: I&#39;m enjoying the format of the HYTRADBOI (have you tried rubbing a database on it?) videos. It doesn&#39;t have that live-presentation feel of an in-person conference talk, but as I&#39;m behind a screen anyway I don&#39;t really care about that. Give me the information succinctly, so I can watch it during a coffee break or whatever.The organiser of the conference had an interesting (and likeiwse pleasantly succinct!) post-mortem write up of the event, if anyone is interestedhttps://www.scattered-thoughts.net/writing/hytradboi-2022-po..."</p>
