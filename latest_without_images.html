								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In one of the later posts, the OP writes that the homeless will lose any physical thing after N weeks. So what kind of 2FA would be homeless-proof? I don&#39;t see a solution.Also, fully acknowledging Google and other bigtechs 2FA is far from ideal:The other thing is, we want at the same time Gmail to be unhackable against best hackers and state sponsored adversaries for the billions of users, including high profile dissidents, journalists, and senators who will inevitably have accounts; and at the same time to homeless people who can&#39;t keep any physical thing. It&#39;s kinda difficult to meet those conflicting requirements well at the same time.Maybe the solution should be to have some basic free state-paid email provider for those people. They are not forced to use Gmail specifically (albeit the number of non-sucking and free email providers is probably close to zero)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who uses 2FA extensively and even has 1Password autofill the OTP codes - 2FA is objectively fucking brutal.Half of you in here have never met a non-technical user. These folks should not have 2FA on ever, because they can&#39;t even use the damn thing with it on.Yes, those users run a higher risk and should be notified of that extremely clearly. But 2FA is a garbage solution to the problem and it should always be possible to disable it.I&#39;m going to continue using 2FA happily like most of those in here - but man the lack of empathy is outstanding in here. I feel bad for your users.And fuck Discord for not allowing me to reset my account with my own damn email address when my phone broke that one time. Total morons, through and through. I&#39;d never want to work with anyone so objectively ignorant and unwilling to admit their ass backwards position."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can definitely understand not realizing that you could lose access to your account if you lose your phone number. But once it happens the first time, could you not pick any free email that does not require 2FA, and warn fellow homeless to avoid gmail?I disagree with the idea that because a very, very niche audience is in dire straits that the design decisions should be based on their needs. The forced 2FA system has probably prevented identify theft and financial loss for a very large number of people. I&#39;m saying this as someone who thinks Google is a shady and dangerous entity in general.It&#39;s similar to the idea that hard cases make bad law."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I was in b-school, it was like they were trying to train us to have contempt for employees, especially the jobs where wages were low. They wanted us to treat them as fungible, replaceable cogs in the machine, not unlike this whole stupid pets-vs-cattle debate with servers.I got my degree but left utterly disgusted with management and MBA types. I am of the opinion that business degrees and business school are a toxic influence on most companies and that, with a few exceptions, they would be better served by hiring management types from other parts of the business and giving them some light compliance training instead."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I always wonder what business schools actually teach.I worked at a company where it was decided that the tech support department had a bunch of college drop outs and nobody had a business degree so they had to hire some.   A few MBA guys were hired.   These guys had MBAs straight out of school with no experience outside some internships... and man it showed.Their first job was dealing with managing a schedule for about 25 people who manned the the tech support line 24/7.They just couldn&#39;t wrap their heads around the idea that on the spreadsheet if you schedule someone on Friday until Midnight... starting them at Midnight on Saturday doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense / they would be working 20 hours in a row.It&#39;s was horrible working with these guys.  They embodied the &#34;I&#39;m business guy and I made my decision for business reasons and you should follow them.&#34;Eventually I (worker drone) took over the schedule because what became known as &#34;the MBA team&#34; couldn&#39;t handle it / had no idea how to balance priorities and etc.I&#39;m sure there&#39;s some great schools for business / MBAs but I really wonder what they teach at those schools if just understanding simple hours, math, responding to emails in a timely / professional manner isn&#39;t it.   It was almost like the old FedEx advert: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcoDV0dhWPAPerhaps they should all be required to go manage a McDonalds for a year or something?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I dropped out of a MBA after they had us learning that managers and employees are separate classes of people. It&#39;s just not in my character to ever think like this.I personally believe the best managers are those who have been at the front line and work their way up. They know the business from bottom-up and know how to treat people at each layer.Also got super turned off when everyone just compared where they went to get their MBA at. Those who spent like 200k to go to Wharton and do the same job as me always felt weird. Those same types can get a job just about anywhere with that credential alone but also may reduce wages &amp; profits."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is one of the strengths of a federated system run by people who aren&#39;t looking to profit. Firstly, they care about their users and are more likely to take difficult decisions, like the one Ash has made, for the good of themselves and their users. In doing so everyone involved has time to make an orderly move.Secondly, the service survives. Mastodon didn&#39;t shut down. The Fediverse didn&#39;t close. One beloved instance bows out and whilst it is a loss to many, their network endures as they thank the admin(s) and move on.You think this shows a disadvantage compared to twitter? Let&#39;s talk once twitter shuts down. Because it will. How will your argument hold up when f*c*book finishes dying? We&#39;ll find out soon enough. Or how about when a telecoms/media conglomerate buys out flickr or tumblr and puts a stake through their heart? Oh, that already happened.This is a bittersweet testament to exactly how the Internet should be built: on the foundations of openness, community and decentralisation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thanks for your hard work Ash, and sorry to hear about your loved one.As much as I love the Fediverse, I think the culture leans toward instances that are too big. I think the number of people on each instance should be much closer to 1 than 1000.The problem is self-hosting is too difficult for the average person. But that doesn&#39;t have to be the case. Self-hosting shouldn&#39;t be any more complicated or less secure than installing an app on your phone. You shouldn&#39;t need to understand DNS, TLS, NAT, HTTP, TCP, UDP, etc, etc. Domain names shouldn&#39;t be any more difficult to buy or use than phone numbers. Apps should be sandboxed in KVM/WHPX/HVP-accelerated virtual machines that run on Windows, Mac, and Linux and are secure-by-default. Tunneling out to the public internet should be a quick OAuth flow that lets you connect a given app to a specific subdomain, with TLS certs automatically obtained from Let&#39;s Encrypt and stored locally for end-to-end encryption."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A major note in the Mastodon fediverse brought down by the fact that it&#39;s administered by one person who, despite the fact they are running a social network node, never built up the real world trust connections to find somebody they could share the toil of administration with or tap in when it was time for them to bow out because we are all mortal.The technological problems are not the hard problems in this space. The hard problems are social problems."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Good to see it being in active development. But the one feature I&#39;m waiting for is a network whitelist. For example, it should never connect over my home or office network, but only via anonymous VPN.(Edit: I know you can do this already with firewall rules, or containers, but I don&#39;t trust myself to not make a mistake. Ideally this should be part of the OS. You should be able to right-click somewhere in the window and say &#34;use this network for this app&#34;.)The other feature I&#39;d like to see is sequential downloads, but the developers object out of principle so that is never going to come."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m really excited to see support for torrents v2.
If only because transmission will stop chocking on hybrid torrent files, which should lead to more adoption across the board.I wish transmission supported mutable torrents (BEP46). It would allow completely re-thinking distribution: grab a torrent of your favorite distribution, and have it auto-update to the latest version.Or grab a &#34;super-torrent&#34; that lists isos for all known distributions, select the ones you&#39;re interested in, and let it update... Of course, that can be used for file-sharing repositories too.Maybe transmission is not interactive enough for such a use-case (you&#39;d have to ask the user what they want to do when the torrent mutates, and possibly add simple scripting interfaces for more complex heuristics)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Knowing German I read through the sources. This article is pretty misleading.The [primary source](https://www.watson.de/leben/urlaub%20&amp;%20freizeit/879935671-...) is a slightly clickbait article asking the questions: &#34;Are AirTags allowed in checked luggage?&#34;.They reached out to Lufthanse asking them. They responded: &#34;Luggage trackers are electronic devices so they have to be turned off when the luggage is checked&#34;.It is unclear wether they really understood how AirTags work and that they are not active trackers.There are a bunch of other magazine echoing this response but I have yet to find an official statement by Lufthansa explicitly banning AirTags."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Note that the reason for airport mode is a courtesy to cell-phone carriers.  It&#39;s not any air safety issue.  Rather, 300-500 cell phones all trying to contact the next cell tower, multiple times per minute, would wreak havoc on cell service.https://www.inverse.com/article/51015-cell-phone-use-on-airp...At one point, when both cell phones and laptops were new, there was perhaps a risk to the airplane&#39;s electronics.  Modern cell phones have been steadily tuned to reduce interference with other electronics though - good thing, otherwise you couldn&#39;t use them in a modern home with its dozens of connected devices.  And modern avionics have been shielded to protect them from outside electronic interference - also a good thing, otherwise the next terrorist could simply turn their laptop on.  The ban on electronic transmission is one of those regulations that was a response to technology at a particular point in time but now is largely vestigial.  You can tell because it&#39;s rarely enforced, and yet bad things do not occur just because you forgot to turn your phone to airplane mode."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The cat is out of the bag.There is no way that people are going to stop putting AirTags in their luggage, at least not while airlines are still constantly losing luggage and fighting people on reimbursement."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Circa 2009 or so, my absolute favorite app for the iPod Touch was Patrick Collison&#39;s Offline Wikipedia (yes, that Patrick Collison: https://web.archive.org/web/20100419194443/http://collison.i...). You could download various wikis that had been pre-processed to fit in a very small space - as I recall, the entire English Wikipedia was a mere 2 GB in size. It was simply magical that I could have access to all of Wikipedia anytime, anywhere offline - especially since the iPod Touch could only connect to the Internet via WiFi. It was particularly useful while travelling, since I could load up articles and just read them on the plane.As I recall, there were several clever things that the app did to reduce the size of the dump; many stub/redirect articles were removed, the formatting was pared down to the bare minimum, and it was all compressed quite efficiently to fit in such a small space. Patrick gives more technical detail on an earlier version of the app&#39;s homepage: https://web.archive.org/web/20080523222440/http://collison.i..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"FYI, the internet archive hosts a ZIM archive that has dumps of wikipedia and many other works. https://archive.org/details/zimarchiveI wish it was a little more obvious how to search it, or what all the variations mean, but it looks like a valuable resource.It is worth noting that Kiwix works on multiple OSes and on phones and has a wifi hostspot version (that you might run on an raspberry pi, for example). Internet-in-a-box similarly works as a wifi hostspot for ZOM archives.Lastly, it is worth mentioning that there are tools for creating your own ZIM files; it looks like the most straightforward way is to take a static website and use a utility to convert it into one self-contained file."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It really is remarkable how far cancer treatment has progressed, even in the last few years. I&#39;m one of the unfortunate people who, through a close family encounter with cancer, knows more about this stuff than anyone should have to. The oncologist told my relative that if they had presented with this particular cancer just a decade ago, his recommendation would have been to start hospice care.However, in recent years, a very effective checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy has been developed for the cancer in question. ~2x the success rates of traditional chemo, greatly increased overall survival statistics, and with massively reduced side effects. The results speak for themselves: this drug has granted my relative years of extra life in the worst case, and a path to a deep, long remission in the best case.I think that as the technology develops, by 2040 we&#39;ll be looking back at the present state of the art with the same incredulity that we currently have for, like, bloodletting with leeches in the Middle Ages. I think they&#39;ve been saying this for a long time now, but it&#39;s truer than ever that a real cure for cancer is right around the corner."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here is the only clinical data:
https://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO.2020.38.15_suppl.46...Looks as promising as any other promising cancer therapy in phase I trials!There is a renaissance in cancer drug delivery at present, exemplified by antibody drug conjugates. The tech in the article is very interesting, and a superb bioengineering effort. A caveat is that complex multi-unit therapies don’t have a great track record. They are hard to manufacture reliably, and have a very large optimisation volume, so it’s difficult to increment the development as you only have finite resources for human trials. Contrast this with small molecules where there is a well defined process over various chemical and pharmacokinetic factors, prior to testing in humans. We also lack a good system for developing and trialing ‘platform’ tech like this - the current system is set up for single drugs/combos to be tested and eventually reimbursed in each cancer type separately. If you have a platform for delivering tailored therapies agnostic of cancer type, you will run into many barriers. There is currently only one drug I know of simultaneously approved across multiple cancer types (pembrolizumab in mismatch repair deficient tumours, a rare population). So many challenges ahead of the hype here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It is not a single disease, but rather a result of several errant biological outcomes.  The mortality rates have improved a lot with better treatments, and around 60% of the population will develop some form of the disease in their lifespan.The most disturbing part is most people are unaware they are ill until relatively late stages of the disease.If you live long enough, one will know many good people that go this way. It is a worthy area of research, as it improves the lives of many families. =)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Every now and then I like to read through Wikipedia pages for things I know more than the average person on. It keeps me skeptical of the things I read on there. For people unfamiliar with a subject (students) I think Wikipedia pages are misleading, poorly organized, and sometimes wrong. That doesn&#39;t make Wikipedia useless, but the author&#39;s best advice is to use Wikipedia as a map to other sources of information.I don&#39;t think Wikipedia has a path forwards for fixing the quality of its articles. In my opinion it requires every page being rewritten by an expert with a single voice, as a traditional encyclopedia would have, which is the exact opposite of Wikipedia&#39;s core.

Wikipedia should not be used as a source for academic purposes; the sources being referenced on Wikipedia very well could be though and as such Wikipedia is an incredibly useful tool for surface level research and schools should absolutely be taking this approach to using it.They should not, under any circumstance, have children &#34;Googling&#34; the answer to questions. Most of these kids parents already use that phrase as a keystone of their parental pedagogy and they don&#39;t need that in school, too.Wikipedia is wonderful. They have more money then they will ever need so don&#39;t donate; but, they are great. Everyone should have a copy of Wikipedia locally updated yearly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is jaded and angry, but I think there is another archetype called &#34;the politician.&#34; They play the game extremely well, providing poorly thought out solutions quickly to problems they haven&#39;t dug into the complexity of. They lay operational traps everywhere in their quest to get things done fast (like directly embedding config data in code to avoid fixing the config format). Once they&#39;ve picked the low hanging fruit and left too much complexity to maintain, they hop to another company where they sell themselves on all they accomplished leaving out the absolutely unmaintainable mess they left behind."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Archetypes are useful in how you sell yourself. Don&#39;t forget that it&#39;s not what you are, just how you sell yourself.You can change between these every review cycle, job, career, all you want - no one in management is keeping track of your &#34;archetype&#34;. They are keeping track of your impact.Lastly, you are the &#34;person in the box&#34; once you are senior enough. Take the archetypes, look at your org, and see which they need. Whatever is missing will be the most value to the org. How you see yourself accomplishing that box is the real challenge of executives, not this endless &#34;what color parachute are you&#34; self evaluation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A little meta commentary: I&#39;m seeing a lot of negative takes using the word &#34;they&#34; (so presumably these are from people who either haven&#39;t worked in a staff eng capacity, or have, but in dysfunctional organizations).The intent of this article (as I understand it) was to help people navigate the emerging nebulous role that &#34;staff engineer&#34; was, particularly as it started to become a more mainstream concept a few years ago (whereas prior to it, the dichotomy was largely that senior was &#34;the&#34; terminal IC role and you had to transition to management past that).Many engineers on the upper side of the senior spectrum have clearly been operating above and beyond what is typically considered senior level, but not in the capacity of a typical manager archetype, so this was meant to help people understand how to identify/categorize these people as well as help people understand what kinds of challenges to look at after you&#39;ve become a &#34;full-fledged&#34; senior engineer. Resources are useful, whodathunkit.My advice for those eyeing for a staff+ level would be to avoid making &#34;hot take&#34; categories, everyone can do that and if they&#39;re coming from a position of inexperience w/ the subject matter, there&#39;s a good chance it&#39;s a bad take. Instead, try to derive action items from each of the archetypes, and incorporate those into your work. A good point I heard is that no staff engineer qualifies as a single archetype exclusively; the role is usually a mix of all archetypes, with different people leaning more strongly one way vs another.It&#39;s very easy to make sour comments like &#34;oh staff people just spend all their time in meetings, what good are they for&#34;. It&#39;s quite another to be that staff engineer and have to balance technical depth acquisition, alignment among disparate groups and the multiplexing required to operate at high levels at both. It&#39;s easy to chalk it up to politics, but it&#39;s quite another to be able to visualize power structures as tools, and use them as such to accomplish large scale engineering goals. There are classes of engineering challenges that only really arise at the staff+ engineer level, and engaging with them can be rewarding in their own right."</p>
