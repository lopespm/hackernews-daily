								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"i will say they are right about one thing, small sellers are getting totally run over by design theft and aliexpress resellers. as a buyer, its a huge pain to have to sift through pages of aliexpress merchandise to uncover interesting and original work. make a cool printed design on a game boy shell? quickly stolen, mass produced on aliexpress, then sold by all the boring resellers on etsy. 90% of rpg dice sellers are selling the exact same stuff they got from the exact same bulk deal.one of the biggest problems for me is im never even sure if im buying the original design or a knockoff, which totally sucks.idk if this is just affecting the retro games / dice communities, or if others are also hit. ALSO you can kinda just sell semi-illegal &#34;grey&#34; goods on etsy? TONS of sellers just selling bootleg game boy games and rarely mentioning that in the product description."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the petition:AI-powered bots shut down legitimate seller accounts seemingly at random, while Etsy looks the other way on resellers who undercut authentic makers by peddling sweatshop-produced junk in clear violation of the spirit of the Etsy community.AI lockouts are a huge problem on Amazon, too, not to mention many of the sites and services used by HNers. I&#39;ve said it before and I will say it again:How many more pleas like this will we see on HN? Or, hear from friends, colleagues, and relatives who have been locked out or denied access to an important service, either through no fault of their own or by an innocent action?No warning.No explanation other than &#34;suspicious activity&#34; or &#34;violation of [vaguely worded] policy.&#34;No human to call who can help troubleshoot, other than a tech-savvy friend or relative.No recourse.There needs to be a technology bill of rights, not just for people dealing with Google, Amazon, Apple, and Facebook, but also the myriad other technology operators which can disrupt our lives in an instant with some poorly programmed process or unanticipated edge case."</p>

Rather than making us mad at buyers who leave glowing 4-Star reviews, or making us feel that we can no longer offer letter class shipping on items like cards and stickers, Etsy should leave us to individually do the best we can for each and every customer in each and every situation.[1] https://www.etsy.com/starseller[2] https://www.coworker.org/petitions/cancel-the-fee-increase-w..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Until you experience this simple way of traveling, it may look like an uncomfortable thing to do. My girlfriend has Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and loves traveling this way, where she would often be bedridden at home for days, when traveling she can at least be in a natural park, listening to birds, waking up by a tawny owl, see deer and foxes pass by the car without noticing you. Life becomes simple and you&#39;re so much closer to nature. 
Even with sub zero temperatures and no heating at night, with the right gear this is still very doable. Of course you have to go to places with low population density and be mindful of your surroundings."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Bloody hell, that Winnie the Pooh quote got my eyes watering. I see people in the comments questioning whether the story is real but, regardless of that, I do want to compliment this woman&#39;s style of writing. It&#39;s not overly grim, not saccharine &#34;everything is beautiful&#34;. Very matter of fact, very bittersweet.Cancer is a terrible thing and I hope we beat it one day. I&#39;m glad she at least had the NHS covering her expenses because I cannot imagine how gutting it&#39;d be to deal with the loss of a loved one compounded with debt.May her last days be as devoid of fear as possible."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This seems like a perfectly reasonable way to end a service. The server died, and the effort to bring it back up seems high.This is a reminder to pay for services you depend on. Per the Pinboard founder&#39;s post:&gt; I love free software and could not have built my site without it. But free web services are not like free software. If your free software project suddenly gets popular, you gain resources: testers, developers and people willing to pitch in. If your free website takes off, you lose resources. Your time is spent firefighting and your money all goes to the nice people at Linode.&gt; Like a service? Make them charge you or show you ads. If they won&#39;t do it, clone them and do it yourself. Soon you&#39;ll be the only game in town!https://blog.pinboard.in/2011/12/don_t_be_a_free_user/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This project was killed by invisible complexity. I felt a little sad
reading about it. There are lots of comments talking about the
sustainability of projects with respect to money and burnout, the need
to pay for services etc. I get that and agree. But I also get the
impression that wouldn&#39;t have helped here.When we reach a situation where some unknown person pushes an upstream
update, which causes a cascade of problems that even someone with deep
technical knowledge and daily connection to the project cannot unpick,
that&#39;s a breakdown in modularity/dependency.It&#39;s what we faced in the 1990s and from it evolved package managers,
version control, dependency management and all the good things.I think in 2022 we&#39;re back in a similar situation again.
Virtualisation, containers, cloud services and whatnot have regressed
development reliability.I predict the day when a really major service provider comes out and
says; &#34;Sorry everyone. It&#39;s been 10 days downtime. We&#39;ve put our 1000
top engineers on the problem and nobody knows what&#39;s wrong. We just
can&#39;t fix it.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"He says he had hundreds of users and hosting costs were a problem. This made me curious how this could be. Testing SSL for a few hundred users should pretty much free these days.He said Patreon pledges paid for 25% of hosting. So I looked up his Patreon. Turns out he has 3 (!) patreons, together paying $9 per month.The web is a strange place.Here comes a fun fact I can add: He is doing better than me. I have a website with about 500000 monthly users and 5 (!) patreons. So while he only had 1% paying users, I only have 0.001% :)Did I say the web is a strange place? Will this ever change?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I did some research on this as part of my undergrad in the early 00&#39;sI skimmed the article but it seems to align with the literature back then. The thinking was during our evolution that high volume low frequency sounds would represent a precursor to mortal danger (avalanches, earthquakes, stampedes, thunder, wind) so we were attuned to secreting stress hormones in early response. Unfortunately, much of our urban built-environment is full of (human-made) constant low-frequency sources, although we appear to have adapted to a degree (HVAC systems in buildings, traffic, industrial process plants, airports and air traffic, explosions, concerts).What isn&#39;t mentioned here, that I remember finding particularly concerning, was that while we seem to adapt, it&#39;s over our own time, as children we secrete more cortisol to low frequency noise than when we are adults... maybe some form of long term CBT I don&#39;t know.I have no idea where my old paper is but I remember (and someone with more time might want to check/confirm this) one important study showed cortisol levels of children at schools close to Heathrow compared to out in the UK countryside and how this affected standardised testing. There were limitations, and of course you had to control for a range of factors, socio-economic, teaching staff etc, but there was some measurable negative effect (again no idea if this was repeated/corroborated).The actual research I was doing was into our auditory perception of urban spaces. We took recordings of various urban settings and had participants listen and rate their emotional responses, if it felt &#34;hot&#34; or &#34;cold&#34; (and other adjective pairs), we also had them draw something to represent what they were listening too.Our &#34;findings&#34; were pretty limited for a short undergrad project but it was interesting how we generally appreciate background chatter and live-music and generally fearful and cold from large flat surface reflected sound (empty city plazas)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is one of the things I struggle with the most in life. I feel like most people don&#39;t seem to care about noise pollution and zero care is put into designing living spaces or cities to minimize it. I&#39;ve moved into apartments and nearly cried because I realized that there was some noise pollution that wasn&#39;t apparent when I visited it (e.g. a water boiler that ran constantly at night, road noise during the day, etc) and would have to deal with it for a year.One of the few countries I&#39;ve been to that takes noise pollution seriously is Switzerland. A beautifully peaceful and quiet country."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Compression is a component of general intelligence. A few years ago I was very sceptical of machine learning ever leading to general intelligence. I&#39;ve since changed my mind. There are a lot of parallels to this work and the concept of &#34;embeddings&#34; in machine learning.Intelligence requires the ability to generalize. A prerequisite for generalization is the ability to take something high-dimensional and reduce it to a lower-dimensional representation to allow comparison and grouping of concepts.We&#39;re doing this all the time. Take a pen for example: we&#39;re able to combine information from sight, touch, and sound. Through some mechanism, our brains reduce the multi-sensory information and create a consistent representation that is able to invoke past memories and knowledge about pens.Our brains encode the embeddings in a very different way to deep learning neural networks, but the commonality is that both are able to compress data into a _useful_ representation. Note that as a result of this, the quality of the compression is important. Some forms of compression might be very efficient but they also tangle concepts together, resulting in loss of composability. The ideal compression (from an intelligence point of view) is both information efficient and maximally composable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It all works this way (though a certain female family member would disagree, claiming to remember conversations word-for-word years later).But my memory works this way.  A summary &#34;party at so-and-so&#39;s house, weather was nice, overall vibe was ___&#34;.  The rest is context.  You know what the house/backyard is like, you know the general feel of that time of year, you know the crowd that usually comes, you can easily synthesize details like the smell of the BBQ and the taste of the food... build up a complete &#34;memory&#34; from stuff that could be summarized in a paragraph of text plus generic (not specific to one memory episode) context.I can build up a relatively vivid mental image of my walking route to school (from the bus terminal) over 40 years ago.  Is it accurate?  Who cares.  As long as no detailed record exists to compare it to that would reveal the &#34;lossy compression&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Living in Spain, I love trains and take them over airplane when it&#39;s an option. However, trains are often around twice as expensive as flying for may routes. I know nothing about trains, but intuitively I would expect the opposite, and I really wish it was more affordable, specially high speed rail."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here in Germany, for as long as I can remember, the government praises itself every year for investing as much in rail as never before. I have not noticed the service quality to change for the better over the last 15 years. The ever-rising investments seem to be only enough to keep the status quo of the crumbling infrastructure."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Trains are great for no more than 600km range trips. I live in Spain, and it&#39;s great to get into the train without doing all the procedures you do with a plane. I arrive to the station 10 mins before departure and I never had troubles. With airplanes I need to be there 1 hour before. Then you spend another 30 mins getting into the plane, following the instructions for just only 1h trip. The same trip Barcelona -&gt; Madrid can be done without all the hasle and even faster than in airplanes, in addition, you arrive in the center of the city, much better connected than the airport, where you spend another half an hour to reach the city center.In my experience, airplanes are worth once you talk about trips over 800km. Trips that you cannot do in less than 2 hours of train."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I loved, loved, loved my Pebble Time. It did everything I wanted out of a smart watch, especially eliminating my phone-checking habit, because I was always on top of whether new emails were worth reading, it was a sanity saver during an intense M&amp;A process. Also, it somehow had a super long-lived battery, and it had so much more personality than most electronic devices, with its little 8-bittish animated icons, reminded me of a Gameboy Advance or something. Thanks for making one of my favorite devices of the last decade, Eric."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Pebble had an incredibly clever design for their watch apps.  The watch itself had a limited processor and even more limited RAM but it could hold a few apps and those apps had a lot of capability.Each app had both a on-watch component and an on-phone component and you could install these apps from their own app store and same app worked on both iOS and Android.  They got around both the app install limitations on iOS and the cross-platform compatibility issues by making the on-phone portion run in the platform&#39;s JavaScript engine.You could, for example, create a weather application that fetched the weather from the Internet and displayed it on the watch.  The on-phone app would fetch the weather from the Internet using JavaScript code and then transmit that data to the corresponding C-based watch app.  Watch apps could even have settings that were just HTML pages.I always impressed by the cleverness and simplicity of that design."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;We sold 2 million watches and did over $230m in sales.&#34;So from 0 to 2 million in 4 years?I was just explaining to my child that many &#34;failures&#34; are only failures from a strange but important angle. They might have been profitable at the time they were canceled, but they were perceived by their maker as less profitable than some other potential product. A venture might net $1m/year and be deemed a wild success. Or it might be deemed a failure if the maker thinks they could net $5m/year on a different venture using the same resources."</p>
