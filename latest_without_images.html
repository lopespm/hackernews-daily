								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Posting anonymously for obvious reasons.Unlike others, I actually find this story fairly believable.When I first joined Apple, straight out of college - a good program, top three in the country - I was abused similarly. I joined a team that was on a project behind schedule.Our manager was a brusque, no-nonsense sort of dude. But he clearly had anger problems. On the team were 2 senior engineers, me, and a junior engineer that had just completed his internship and was on a work Visa.As the project got closer to the deadline, and the scope increased, the manager got agitated. In our team meetings, he would start yelling at us. People down the hallways would stare at us with those &#34;looks.&#34; In our 1:1s he told us we might not have a job if our product doesn&#39;t ship on time (we were competing with another internal team to beat them to the punch.)The two senior engineers decided they&#39;d had enough and quit the team. The manager told us to work overtime (no overtime pay, but we had to for fear of our job). He promised us that if we did it that we would get a month of vacation on him, and that he could secure it for us.The product released. After countless nights of overtime we did it. Our manager left, our guarantee of a month of vacation evaporated, and for the next three months, us two junior engineers were left on 24/7 primary/secondary on-call for a critical service. It was a nightmare. Calls at 3 AM, 6 AM, on weekends.Our manager got a promotion and is fairly high up at Apple now.Horrible experience. I left for a new company that pays me nearly double."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I dont quite remember the meeting room names in Mathilda 3 over at the Apple on Mathilda Ave, but if the MA03 (in the screenshot) refers to &#34;Mathilda 3&#34;, then this story is totally believable.I worked at Apple and it was absolutely horrible. I remember sitting on the train and actually thinking about killing myself. Reasons were many, but mostly I just didn&#39;t fit in there, I think.I felt like people there were also a bunch of whiny little bitches to be honest. Always having some problem with a hand or a back or some family problem or whatever which demanded that they take days off. There were a few people whom I felt were probably talking some shit behind my back, but I couldn&#39;t really believe it until I read this story. It was just a horrible horrible place and I can also recognize that thing about having a predecessor, who was apparently a &#34;bad person&#34; and thus had to be terminated.Every other day I would have people telling me how great a place it was and how lucky we were to be working in a place so big while still having that startup feeling. I have worked at startups and I always just imagined to myself that 40 year old &#34;dude&#34; who refuses to grow up. That is Apple..Never again.I got dragged through the whole white boarding experience also for the first time and it was fun enough, but in hindsight, they should just have asked me if I would suck Steve Jobs dick, if he came in that door. The answer to that question alone would have provided them with enough information about whether I would have been a good hire or not.I am 45 and have never every experienced a work place like that. Always had positive feedback and never had any problems with colleagues."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My brief advice to anyone writing such a post: start with the most serious accusation you have, and avoid the temptation to add ancillary grievances, however justified, until you have the reader fully engaged and outraged.The way this post structured now, beginning with fairly unspecific complaints about the hiring process, who invited whom to lunch, etc. makes the author come across as a young high-drama individual even though it ramps up to more serious matters.Remember you only have a couple of paragraphs to set the hook and get the reader on your side in a piece like this. Not even your SO or mom want to read the full wall of text about how you were mistreated, let alone internet strangers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is undeniably a good thing if you put yourself in the shoes of the restaurant.Imagine if someone went around impersonating your business online, leveraging the good name you have built for yourself over the decades. They create ads offering your expert development services, ostensibly competing with your existing website, but with intentionally slashed pricing and a ‘creatively’ misrepresented offering (aka growth hacking). Then they subcontract the job to some crappy outsourcing firm that bungles it, but who cares, they got their cut and you signed the TOS.Now bad reviews are piling up online about the bad experiences people had with your business, your reputation is destroyed, and your business is next.I know it’s not a perfect analogy but try to empathize with the restaurants here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think it would have been much better to outlaw misrepresentation and advertising without prior agreement (ie the pizza place that did not agree to partnership should only pop up in the search results if the user searches for it) and there should be a warning mandated like &#34;Startup Inc is not affiliated with the Moms and Pops Pizza. If you proceed, we will place your order by calling PHONE_NUMBER and pick up your order from ADDRESS&#34;. It should still be legal for the end users to have a service do chores for them including picking up food but only if there is no confusion on the side of the user what is happening here (incl. the fact the pizza may get cold through a no  fault of Moms and Pops Pizza).Edit: oh, the law would also outlaw food picking apps from delivering from Walmart too (&#34;The code defines food facility [...] as an operation that stores, [...] or otherwise provides food [...] at the retail level.&#34;)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There was a post a few months go about a pizza place that started getting customers complaining about their food arriving cold and damaged: except they didn&#39;t offer delivery. They discovered that a popular search engine was offering free delivery. The story ended with them ordering dozens of pizzas from themselves to themselves and making a nice profit."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"KDE on Linux used to have something similar in the late 90s - it allowed you to open a website URL as a directory listing, so you could browse the site&#39;s asset directories and open image files, etc. Think like a client-side generated version of Apache&#39;s index pages, but using your local file manager. It was a plugin to the VFS framework (KIO) the desktop and all the apps use, so it would also work e.g. in Open File dialogs from anywhere within the toolset.I remember using this regularly to mass-download the images embedded into a page - open the page this way by replacing http:// with a pseudo-protocol, copy all, paste, done.KDE always came with a lot of VFS trickery like that. Ripping a music CD into MP3s was similar - you&#39;d open the volume in the file manager and see your tracks along with a virtual folder full of MP3 files. The rip and encoding would happen on the fly, and you could do this e.g. straight from the file attach feature in an instant messenger.Desktop Linux was a lot less friendly to get working smoothly back then compared to now, and feature discovery was by word of mouth more than anything, but it sure felt like living in the future early."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, this is awesome!My OS is heavily scripted and keybound, thanks to 15 years of cumulative incremental fixes and a kick-ass WM.  The one thing that&#39;s frustrated me is the relative black box that my browser represents, and writing a shim between my WM and browser tabs has been on my TODO list for a long, long time (through a couple of aborted attempts due to a combination of Chrome&#39;s at-the-time obsolete documentation and probably-necessary security model).I&#39;m cautiously optimistic that this is going to represent a dramatic step function in ease-of-use of my OS, in the same way that i3 was.EDIT: I should clarify that I did read the author&#39;s note that this is experimental, not secure, etc. I&#39;m mainly just excited about having a jumping-off point to play around with and possibly hack on a little."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a brilliant piece of work. As someone who has thousands of tabs open, I&#39;ve always wanted to &#34;close all tabs with a single command&#34;, or view all the open tabs and mass select them and close, for years. Otherwise, going through them one by one and deleting takes forever. Now somebody make a vim pluggin so I can delete tabs by visual selecting a bunch of them and typing &#34;d&#34;."</p>

You think the world should get behind you and change the corrupt system.My advice is to immediately rebrand as gracefully and effectively as possible and use all that activist energy to effect the transition.They kind of have a point which doesn’t make them right, but they hold all the cards and you will lose this one and regret the wasted bandwidth."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well-written argument for the app reviewers to get bent, especially the highlighted examples of other apps that show the rule is clearly applied inconsistently.Apple&#39;s App Store moderation is embarrassing. They routinely fail to catch harmful junk—I&#39;ve shut down a few top-grossing bogus antivirus apps for Mac, and the publisher of Untitled Goose Game routinely posts screenshots of clones that are trying to make money off confused users.They&#39;ve banned apps like Phone Story and a drone strike tracker for being &#34;objectionable and crude,&#34; yet they don&#39;t apply any content moderation to the Book Store or to Music or TV (or to Safari for that matter). They&#39;ve yet to provide a cogent justification for why they&#39;re inconsistent on this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A fun anecdote from my youth near a US seaboard was that our elementary and middle school buildings were designed by the same person who designed a few prisons around the area.When I bounced around cities later in life, I was surprised at how many of my peers said the same thing as a conversation piece.Maybe they used the same governmental bidding process. &#34;Needed: a building. One food preparation and eating area. Hallways suitable for lining up and proceeding in rows with many small rooms. One yard with sporting facilities.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who&#39;s been to prison and school, lots of comments here sound pretty tone deaf. Prison in the USA is really bad. Yes school is authoritarian, but most popular entertainment on prisons downplays how bad it really gets. Watch some interviews of people who have actually been to prison. Murder and rape is common (I saw it happen), you will get your possessions stolen under the threat of murder/rape, you&#39;ll probably spend 10-30% of your time in solitary confinement for reasons outside your control (torture according to human rights groups: I&#39;ve been there, I&#39;d prefer nonpermanent torture), you have to learn violence and get into fights with people who might be carrying a knife or else get taken advantage of indefinitely, ... It&#39;s bad. And psychologically, you have no freedom whatsoever: no you cannot poop or drink water whenever you want to. You can only poop when your cellie isn&#39;t around (1-2h/day). You will be abused by prison staff (false accusations, physical abuse, food deprivation, ..)The whole thing is an abomination. It serves no useful purpose to society to subject most criminals to prison: it doesn&#39;t serve as a deterrent (based on talking to ~50 prisoners about this), it only radicalizes them further against &#34;the system&#34;, making it easier for them to break further laws.Why don&#39;t we have more outrage against this outdated institution created out of 1600 era values?The amount of human suffering it creates... It&#39;s astounding. Most prisoners would probably rather a super old school punishment like chopping off their arm over the prison sentence they get. And it would be more effective."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In the UK our prisons often look nicer than our (state) schools. Many of our prisons are quite ancient, whereas many of our state schools are 1960s monstrosities.For example:* https://hidden-london.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/geograp... vs https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/James_Ho...* https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article1185483.ece/ALT... vs https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/Cefn_Sae...* https://ukhumanrightsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HM_... vs https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/We..."</p>

These EUV scanners are expensive as hell.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"So, first thing when it comes to big dollar (or in this case Euro) numbers: some of these funds will be loans, not grants. In this case the split will be about 50-50.Second, this is not new money, this is part of recovery funds already allocated in July 2020 for combating the economic recession created by the Coronavirus [1]. These funds were already earmarked for environmental and digital initiatives. This declaration is probably a clarification of how much is given specifically to the digital initiatives.This looks quite smart to me. In the US neither the original CARES act ($1.4 TN) passed in March, nor the new stimulus bill ($0.9 TN) has any funds dedicated to cutting edge industries. There were instead funds for airline companies and cruise lines.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_Generation_EU#Recovery_fu..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Over the past year I&#39;ve slowly started to realize this as well. What changed? Working for a company that is publicly known enough for people on HN (and Reddit) to comment about it. It has been hilarious and scary to read comments from people who don&#39;t work at the company say completely inaccurate things like they are facts.In this case, it&#39;s easy for me to recognize they are wrong. But what about other topics (or companies) I don&#39;t know much about? I have no easy way of recognizing inaccuracies so I default to mostly accepting them. Sadly, you need to be skeptical of almost everything you read even when the person sounds like they know the subject matter."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The real world is usually more dynamic, maleable and workable than the internet has you believe too.If you believed the internet, you would believe you can only ever use the best parts in the perfect configuration for almost everything. Be it metalwork, mountain biking, computing, drones or any other hobby regularly discussed online.The reality is you can make do with in so many different ways that if you can&#39;t afford the best you can still have oodles of fun on cheaper equipment. Half the fun is learning all this &#34;expertise&#34; the internet has on your own.Can&#39;t afford a Bridgeport mill? Buy something cheaper and work around the edge cases. Can&#39;t afford a full suspension bike? Get a hardtail and have tonnes of fun.Someone is always quick to add in the caveats, but guess what, a new rider doesn&#39;t give a shit that he can&#39;t send 8ft drops on his hard tail. There are hours of fun on the bike ahead, none of it sending 8ft drops. The new hobby machinist isn&#39;t bothered that they can&#39;t mill titanium, they are just stoked to be getting started."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author notes by the use of insane he means different, but is it really that unique for a person to post online or are we just seeing a pattern where there is none.Books are written by insane people, on average person does not write a book.Rock climbers are insane people, very few people rock climb so why listen to safety tips the 0.2% of the population who do. They are not normal people from a statical standpoint.On average a person does not do any one spicific thing.Everyone online has contributed to the internet, everyone has written something and everyone has excersised.I&#39;ve seen this brought up before that only 2-3% of redditors contribute, like it&#39;s a bad thing or a unique thing. That number it&#39;s way higher than books, tv, radio any form of convenientional media."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The Chimera section claims:&gt; Pangolins and bats don&#39;t usually cohabitate, making this somewhat unlikely in nature.Horseshoe bats are nocturnal animals that roost in caves during the day but sometimes practice perch feeding at night [1]:&gt; The other strategy is known as perch feeding: Individuals roost on feeding perches and wait for prey to fly past, then fly out to capture it.Pangolins [2] and palm civets [3] are nocturnal and arboreal. The bat viral RNA sequences come from anal swabs of netted animals so they are primarily gastrointestinal infections. All of these animals are found in the Lancang/Mekong [4] catch basin. Bat guano seems like a good vector for the virus.Gain-of-function experiments require two viral isolates that recombine during passage. The lab theory assumes that the RNA sequence of the original viral isolates were never shared. I find this scenario unlikely but I am open to changing my mind based on evidence. SARS-1 is evidence of a very similar zoonotic scenario.Humans that encounter bat guano in this region also seem like a good host for a recombination event.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe_bat#Diet_and_foragin...[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangolin#Behavior[3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_palm_civet#Feeding_and_d...[4] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mekong"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Whenever this topic comes up, the discussion seems to consist largely of _extremely_ strong opinions against the perfectly plausible hypothesis (don&#39;t forget, the evidence of zoonotic origin is equally thin on the ground).My question is, why? What does it matter whether the virus originated from a lab or from a wet market - it isn&#39;t any more dangerous if it came from a lab, nor does knowing the origin really help dealing with this crisis at all.It is certainly interesting to know where it did originate, and that knowledge could inform a debate on the future of (respectively) wet markets and animal husbandry practices, or BSL facilities, but these don&#39;t strike me as particularly emotionally charged topics, and in any case the posts I&#39;m referring to don&#39;t mention these debates...Anybody care to explain why you would respond so strongly to claims of lab origin?"</p>

You really can&#39;t expect any sort of reasonable sensor technologies to detect wide ranges of potentially harmful contaminants in water supplies while you can use mussels, clams, etc. as biological sensors--the modern &#34;canary in a coal mine.&#34;I worked with a research project that was sensing, collecting and analyzing types of mussels in rivers that were used as an indirect measurement of water quality in the river. The assumption is that the mussels can act as a proxy for certain contaminants. In fact, they actually filter a lot of water daily so you can occasionally analyze one as to what sort of contaminants it absorbed as a proxy for whats probably in the water.Meanwhile, water intakes typically only monitor for known and suspected contaminants. They have to rely on other indirect measurements like changes conductivity as a signal to analyze the water and these are noisy and fairly unreliable compositional change detection proxies.Neat stuff."</p>
