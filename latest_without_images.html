								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s interesting to compare this to the WEF future projections: https://www.forbes.com/sites/worldeconomicforum/2016/11/10/s...Especially with regards to this passage::&#34;In 2022 [economic development] will be as finished as it is to-day in England. American wealth will then be either developed or known, and all of it will belong to somebody. There will be no more opportunity in America than there is in England to-day. Those Americans will know that it is practically certain that they will die much in the same position as the ones in which they were born. Those Americans will therefore be less enterprising and much more pleasure loving. They will have rebelled against long hours; the chances are that in 2022 few people will work more than seven hours a day, if as much.The effects of this, which I am sure sounds regrettable to many of my readers, will, in my opinion, be good. It was essential that the American race should be capable of intense labor and intense ambition if it was to develop its vast country. But one result has been haste, overwork, noise, all of which is bad for the nerves. In 2022 America will have made her fortune and will be enjoying it as well as she can.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"   &gt;Similar reforms apply to cooking, a great deal of which will survive among old fashioned people, but a great deal more of which will probably be avoided by the use of synthetic foods.

This is very interesting especially if you think &#34;synthetic foods&#34; not just literally but as take out, processed products and such. I know a lot of young professional people who technically never cook. Like almost never and whatever they have at home is just snacks, if you hungry &gt; order. There are a lot people like these.    &gt;It is conceivable, though not certain, that in 2022 a complete meal may be taken in the shape of four pills. This is not entirely visionary; I am convinced that corned beef hash and pumpkin pie will still exist, but the pill lunch will roll by their side.

Well Soylent do exist so that&#39;s not far fetched either."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Having worked in ML at two different companies now, I think that people interpreting model output as intelligence or understanding says much more about the people than about the model output.We want it to be true, so we squint and connect dots and it&#39;s true.But it isn&#39;t. It&#39;s math and tricks, and if human intelligence is truly nothing more than math and tricks, then what we have today is a tiny, tiny, tiny fraction of the amount of math and tricks in the average human brain, because what we have today isn&#39;t anywhere close."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In the early days I worked at a company that had a natural language chatbot product.  It wasn&#39;t an online thing, but rather part of a larger tool.  You could ask it to do things like &#34;show me the quarterly spreadsheet&#34;, and if it didn&#39;t know what &#34;quarterly spreadsheet&#34; was, it&#39;d ask questions in English and learn what &#34;quarterly&#34; and &#34;spreadsheet&#34; meant.  And it could use that new knowledge to update its questions so if you asked for &#34;spreadsheet&#34;, it would know to ask if you wanted the &#34;quarterly&#34; one, and so on.This was in the long ago, so it wasn&#39;t ML, but a very large state machine written by someone that was no doubt a genius, and also had no coding standards to speak of.  Updating it was a maddening process, and thankfully one I rarely had to think about since I was tasked with GUI stuff.When I was hired, I was told it was a fantastic app, customers loved it, and so on.  Later, when I was talking to support reps one day over lunch, I learned that the number one activity they had to do was log into deployments remotely and remove &#34;knowledge&#34; from the state machine of new swear words the customer had taught the machine out of frustration trying to get it to do something, which caused this feedback loop of the interaction swearing at users.I often feel like we&#39;re not in a better state these days."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is essentially why I think we&#39;re not going to get self-driving. A few years ago we produced something that could do a good job of pretending to drive under a tiny number of circumstances, and people went &#34;OMG it can drive!&#34; and assumed that we just have a few corner cases before the chat bot can have a conversation about anything. The truth is that often these very limited solutions are just that - limited, they aren&#39;t just a linear step on the way to something amazing. Tesla will release self-driving on the same day their cars can hold a conversation with you."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; The laws were drafted, in large part, to help close the gender pay gap.HIRED’s annual recruiting reports found that a significant driver of this were
candidates asking for far lower than other peers. Many times,
companies would then offer that candidate a greater salary, which was still below the bolder or more comfortable peer. The candidate feels like their company is doing them a favor.So, this aspect should illuminate that many people are not aware that their own company is contributing to pay gaps. Any individual may in fact think the opposite, that it must be some other company with the proverbial bigoted shadow men in a board room disenfranchising everyone that doesn&#39;t look like them. When that picture isn&#39;t whats happening or isn&#39;t necessary, when candidates exacerbate this on their own.Could it be that the candidate has experience being turned down when asking higher rates? Perhaps.Could it be that the company doesnt even realize that they arent getting a deal with the candidate, but really just exacerbating pay gaps? That the candidates asking lower may be disproportionately certain genders and ethnicities?New York City is reducing this to anti-discrimination, making the penalties inherit discrimination frameworks without regard to the circumstances leading up to it. I think thats a great remedy, given how opaque and nuanced the reality really has been.We don&#39;t need to tweak candidate behavior or gradually retrain companies to notice gender and race to conditionally adjust, instead just make the salaries apparent for all."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There also a growing list of states that prohibit asking for salary history. Don’t ever give a salary history if asked. Only share if it is going to help in your negotiation. Advise everyone you know who is job seeking to do the same.This is a very dangerous question to ask because it locks in previous pay discrimination based on protected categories."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t get why companies play such games when paying someone. I&#39;ve been interviewing with companies and even after doing well on the on site, they keep trying to skirt the issue of compensation by asking weird questions like &#34;so how do you think you did?&#34; Its like you know that i did well, otherwise you wouldn&#39;t even be talking to me, you are just gauging my confidence level so you know how much i&#39;d be willing to bend when it comes to compensation. I wish they just had standard incoming compensation based on titles or something, its exhausting trying to duke it out with HR when all i want is to be paid fairly and write some code. They aren&#39;t doing anyone a favor to underpay because when when people find out, and they will find out, their work quality will decline if they feel they are being used and they will most likely not care about ditching the company for better compensation."</p>

Since then, I bought a Noodlers Ahab. The company had a quirky sense of humour and with a black ink called &#34;heart of darkness&#34;, who can resist? I bought it primarily because the nib is flexible and you can use it for pseudo Copperplate and Spencerian scripts (which I use for headings). https://www.amazon.in/Noodlers-Ahab-Flex-Nib-Fountain/dp/B00...The mechanical pencil I use is a Pentel Graphgear 1000. It&#39;s easily the Mercedes Benz of mechanical pencils. Pentel is generally good at this but the Gg 1000 takes it to the next level.

It shows the idea of culling large amounts of it and scaling, but still brings back the &#39;personal&#39; feel that the servers are living things with feelings (｡◕‿◕｡).Also, throwJan22&#39;s creeper idea for chaos monkey implementation is fantastic (and I guess not a particuarly hard thing to implement at this point :P )If you could break the fences between the namespaces and just blow open any network policies between them would be great :D"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Reminds me of a Sten I hired many years ago. He requested (and of course got) an hilariously exotic work setup and spent a ridiculous amount of time on its configuration. Right from the start he expressed his unhappiness with seemingly random office
stuff: Every day, sometimes multiple times per day, he would would come to my desk and tell me what was wrong, implying I should fix it right now even though it wasn’t obvious that there was a problem in the first place. He also heavily criticized the code base while the same time wasn’t able to produce anything meaningful. For a couple of weeks we hoped his genius to appear and that we just have to give him more support and time to adjust.Eventually, a group of female coworkers came forward and complained that he would make them feel uneasy.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Between this and Tesla citing climate change as a reason for dropping crypto, this is actually a very interesting shift, and one that might be very bad for crypto.The amount of money people actually donated or spent with crypto has always been minimal. (Wish I had harder numbers to back this up, but you can see second-order effects from e.g. Steam adding Bitcoin support but then taking it away. Or how Bitpay has stagnated heavily, while a purely investment/speculation platform like Coinbase is worth billions.) However, for a long time, the benefit of accepting Bitcoin as payment was the marketing. Accepting crypto signaled that you were a cool company, you could put out a press release and the news media would run articles about how X service is now accepting cryptocurrency for payments.The same thing happened again years later with &#34;blockchain.&#34; Remember Kodakcoin? Remember Long Island Blockchain? Nothing ever really surfaced from these initiatives, but again, it was all about that big marketing hype that came from saying your company was going to use blockchain for... something.Where it gets interesting is... what if crypto becomes anathema? What if accepting crypto or holding crypto starts become so closely associated with directly causing climate change, that no company is going to want to be openly associated with crypto, NFTs, etc due to the negative association?You have one side hyping up Web3 as the next evolution as the web, but if the perception of crypto continues to be that it&#39;s a significant contributor to climate change -- regardless of how true that may be -- we could see a major decline in mainstream support."</p>
