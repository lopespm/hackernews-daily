I can’t blame them as I also don’t want this on my messaging app.I feel like I will just give up and use WhatsApp and assume that I only had privacy pre-internet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are three pre-requisites to escaping the messenger silo treadmill:  1. multi-vendor, open standard protocol for E2EE group messaging
  2. reference open-source clients for web, desktop &amp; mobile
  3. reference open-source server

Wire is contributing to #1 and they have a high-quality iOS (OSS) client and OSS server. Their Android and web clients are less stellar, but exist and can be improved.  The iOS Arm client will likely be enabled on M1 Macs. Wire is free for individual consumers and has a paid offering for enterprise teams (i.e. their business model is neither data nor charity), and they do not mandate sharing your phone number or address book -- only an email address is required.The IETF standard is MLS and it will live alongside TLS, https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/mls/about/.  The team behind Wire founded Skype and contributed to the first patent-free high-def audio codec (OPUS), which in turn enabled WebRTC, the protocol behind most modern video conferencing services.  
Matrix.org provides #2 and #3 and has stated that they will migrate to the IETF MLS standard protocol.Since both Wire and Matrix offer both OSS clients &amp; servers, and there is active multi-vendor development on an open standard protocol for E2EE group messaging, web &amp; mobile developers have multiple options for open-source contribution. Matrix already supports federated servers that can be self-hosted, and they recently supported the FOSDEM online conference with ~30,000 attendees, https://matrix.org/blog/2021/02/15/how-we-hosted-fosdem-2021...&gt; The most unique thing about Matrix is that conversations get replicated across all servers whose users are present in the conversation, so there&#39;s never a single point of control or failure for a conversation (much as git repositories get replicated between all contributors). And so hosting FOSDEM in Matrix meant that everyone already on Matrix (including users bridged to Matrix from IRC, XMPP, Slack, Discord etc) could attend directly - in addition to users signing up for the first time on the FOSDEM server."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In Jan, there was a big outcry, i thought all would move to signal.
I have about 25% of the conversations in signal, but especially for groups, whatsapp is so sticky, that they seem to have broadly failed in signal, and are back to whatsapp.I continue to have individual conversations on signal with most friends, but the idea of being able to leave whatsapp seems to be much tougher than I thought."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been using pass for several years now and I recommend it to my friends, but I usually get weird looks when I say I store my passwords in a git repo (it&#39;s not as bad as it sounds!). Here&#39;s why:- I host my git repo on my desktop computer (through SSH), so it&#39;s not exposed anywhere except if you have SSH access to my computer. (A lot of people seem to think git = GitHub which is not true). So if your git repo is not exposed to the public, you don&#39;t leak any of the site names/usernames you use.- The passwords are GPG encrypted so even if it were leaked that would be okay as long as my secret key remains secure.As far as usability goes, I usually use the -c option to copy/paste my passwords. I used a browser extension for awhile, but I haven&#39;t gotten around to reinstalling since the copy/paste works fine for me. Syncing with my phone and Linux devices works perfectly (since it&#39;s just git).The Windows client seems to be no longer maintained [1], so I would like better support here for my Surface. But this is still okay since I can SSH to my desktop computer from Windows and copy/paste the passwords from there.[1] https://github.com/mbos/Pass4Win#readme"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here are some of the pros of the Pass:* It leaks meta-data. That might sound a con, but in exchange you get the ability to extract a password without decrypting and thus exposing other passwords. There is isolation.* It’s more convenient than a single file password manager. You type ‘’pass -c goo’’ for your Google account, instead of clicking on your password manager, typing password, searching in data base, finding the right entry, copying password or pressing auto complete and closing the database. The combination of mouse and keyboard can make alternative password managers slower.* You don’t need your master password to add a new password (it uses asymmetric encryption).* You can easily program it, eg, write a backup script that grab a password from store.* It uses GPG which means your secret key can be stored on Yubikey, handled by a dedicated agent. Your password is basically a short PIN with max 3 tries. This is unparalleled convenience and security!* It’s secure, because it’s a short bash script that you can check, and delegates encryption to a dedicated well-audited cryptographic tool.* You can encrypt to multiple keys, thus use it similar to LUKS that supports multiple passwords.* GPG is usually widely available, so you can decrypt a password on another system on which you may not admin rights to install your password manager.There might be few cons though. For example, if you store your database on a cloud, say, Dropbox, Dropbox could switch  your Dropbox.com file with google.com file, and you copy and hand over your Google password to Dropbox. But this is hypothetical for most of us! Also, some people don’t like metadata (filenames) leakage, though apparently there are solutions for that.Overall it’s very convenient and functional. I highly recommend it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great tool. For those of you who want to set up `pass` on your Android phone, here are my rough notes on how I did it. Apologies, they are rough:- install Password Store on Android phone- import remote repo using ssh  - in my case, I was able to generate a new ssh key for my Android phone from within the Password Store app

  - I “somehow” sent this to myself and added on my github profile settings (from my laptop)

  - I was able to import my repo and see all my password names!

- still need my GPG key to unlock the password. For this I needed to install OpenKeychain on my android phone- then somehow need to import my GPG key from my laptop to my phone  - followed this to create the key file, knew most already: https://medium.com/@johnnymatthews/import-a-gpg-key-onto-your-phone-7dbadf16fefa 

  - couldn’t find a cable to connect to USB! Turns out if you connect to your phone by bluetooth, in Ubuntu it’s pretty easy to send a file from the Bluetooth settings menu.     Finding the file on my phone was another challenge! Turns out it’s stored in a “pixel 3a &gt; bluetooth” folder in the files browser

  - imported file into OpenKeychain!

I love that using my gpg key still required my passphrase (only in my head!).Don’t forget to delete the gpg key you exported on your laptop and your phone! Security of this? Not sure.And voila! I can now see my `pass`words on my Android phone!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think the issue most developers have with CORS is how late in the dev cycle you encounter it. When everything in localhost/http you don&#39;t see any issues. It only crops up once you deploy to staging/production environments that are actually on the web. Worst case is when it works fine in staging, and only has issues in production and someone else controls the allow list.It usually bites you once, and then you look out for it. But about every web developer I know hits it at some point. There used to be footguns of being able to disable CORS, and devs would provide this as a work around. Thankfully browsers have pretty much disabled these settings without intensive investment."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve always setup HTTPS to an alias domain as the first step in any of my projects. I do it because at an early internship I witnessed a bunch of bugs that only appeared after pushing to “prod.”Nowadays with tools like mkcert it’s trivial to install and maintain a trusted root cert for whatever .test (RFC approved TLD) domain you want to add to /etc/hosts.  (Just be careful which colleagues you allow to install a custom root cert on your device. ;))As a fULlStAck DeVeLoPEr, what annoys me the most are the preflight CORS OPTIONS requests, and the fact they came out of nowhere in the past ~5 years. Most frameworks don’t have a good solution for dealing with those requests out of the box. It’s annoying how web standards change so much so frequently.  I could put my code in a vault and take it out in 2023 and it would probably break due to some obscure update in whatever JS runtime is popular then."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great and clear guide to this thorny topic. However, even this article gets a little confused in its wording at one point:&gt; In such cases, we want our API to set the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header to our website’s URL. That will make sure browsers never send requests to our API from other pages.&gt; If users or other websites try to cram data in our analytics API, the Access-Control-Allow-Origin headers set on the resources of our API won’t let the request to go through.The ACAO header only performs a controlled relaxation of cross-origin restrictions. It is the browser that is ensuring that by default other pages can&#39;t send requests to the API.
Just a nitpick as I feel the rest of the article illustrates this well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"While this looks interesting, I&#39;ll admit I feel like there&#39;s been a bit of drift from their bread and butter over the years since they launched their cloud thing and started pushing hard towards a subscription model. I chose them long ago specifically over options like LastPass because I liked having a rich application without internet dependency and their attention to detail and features there, but it&#39;s been a while since it feels like it got major new improvements vs the site. For example, while macOS and Windows have supported smart cards and security tokens like YubiKeys forever now, and I use them to login, unlock, authorize sudo/SSH, etc every day, 1Password still has no support. There are things that can now only be done through the web interface, like finer grained control over permissions for shared vaults, and some of those are also nastily locked away behind more expensive subscriptions. I think everything should be manageable through the application, without ever visiting the site. Duplicate items across vaults remain completely manually managed, when automating stuff like that is kind of the purpose of a password manager. Etc. Heck, even within their own subscription service I think they&#39;re missing a trick by not having more powerful/flexible organization(including families) and inter-organizational capabilities.I still think 1Password is the best option for most people. I specifically want my non-technical family and friends to use password managers too as long as its necessary, and having some multiperson capability is also key to that. I can&#39;t say though that I feel like the move to subs has been a huge win in terms of development.Granted, I&#39;m a little down on the whole field which colors things a bit. Ultimately underlying my feelings is a touch of bitterness that their entire industry even exists. Passwords and password managers are mostly recreating public key auth really, really badly and it stinks. Passwords and other symmetric tokens by definition should never be shared. A website being hacked should never affect me in the slightest, in the same way that me getting hacked doesn&#39;t somehow suddenly mean attackers now own Debian/Apple/FreeBSD/Microsoft. Everywhere should just have public keys. We&#39;ve had the tech for decades and sufficient crypto speed on client systems since at least AES-NI. What&#39;s been missing has been glue and effort. It&#39;s frustrating every time a hack happens. We shouldn&#39;t have to care! Sigh."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I purchased my first 1Password license when it was version 3, and have faithfully upgraded to every standalone version ever since. These days I’m not so sure I will be upgrading again (and I’m not sure there will be more stand alone versions).The latest version is a mess on Big Sur, with unlock fields obscuring input fields, conflicting with Apples iCloud Keychain, and just not working like I expect it to.Furthermore, stand-alone versions are buried deeper and deeper behind a cloud service subscription that brings me absolutely no value over what i already have, and adds the uncertainty of having to synchronize my most secret secrets to a cloud service.While I can certainly forgive software errors, this has been going on for so long that I’m beginning to suspect it’s either a strangler pattern to get people to switch to the cloud solution, or it’s death by a thousand cuts.In any case, I’ve begun evaluating alternatives. Bitwarden looks promising (though nowhere as polished), is open source, and allows me to synchronize to a service on my LAN.Password-store uses gpg and git that also allows me to synchronize locally (though it leaks website names without the vault extension which is not supported on iOS).Finally I’m evaluating Yubico authenticator for 2FA codes and just using iCloud Keychain for the rest."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This looks interesting. We use 1Password, and I always thought it would be useful to programmatically pull values out and use in our cloud infrastructure.Currently we end up using the secret managers available in AWS or GCP, which seems pretty half baked. In GCP, for example, secrets are stored at a project level. It&#39;s not unusual to have certain secrets that are needed by more than one project, which means they get duplicated. The granularity also prevents me from controlling which secrets are visible to a given user.I&#39;d love to have one centralized source of truth for all infrastructure secrets."</p>
