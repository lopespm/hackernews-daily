								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Robert Sansone, great job!So many young prospective engineers read HN every day.  Let&#39;s find comments that are encouraging or thought provoking or point readers in helpful directions Like @londons_explore did.Bringing the beatdown is bad for everyone. Especially bad for young engineers.  This kid is impressive, straight up impressive.  Let&#39;s encourage him and others like him. HN shouldn&#39;t someone&#39;s supervillain origin story.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqMCYdqaFCQ&amp;t=41s"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is inspiring, and let&#39;s look at why so many of us have the impulse to figure out what the flaw or missing part of the story is.For me, it&#39;s because I hadn&#39;t done something so cool at 17. That makes me think, huh, I wonder if I&#39;m not a &#34;natural born engineer&#34;. I start going through my life story so far and beating myself up for playing too many video games, or not going deep enough on my interests.Then I start thinking about the ways my life is different from his. I start to feel resentment about the opportunities I didn&#39;t have, the resources that weren&#39;t available. What could I have done if things had been different?Next I start to resent how society scores us on things that can contribute to the economy, or things that look particularly cool, and things that we accomplished at a young age.And then I start to imagine the difficulties that this young inventor will have. &#34;Oh yes&#34;, I think, &#34;He&#39;ll find out soon enough what the REAL world is like.&#34;And these thoughts are not who I want to be. But I can reflect and learn something about myself from them. And I can choose to go another way.I can decide that, if a 17 year old kid with the right resources and a crazy idea can make something really cool, then I, as an adult with more experience and resources can make something at least as cool if I want to. And I&#39;m going to. It&#39;s not like my life is over because I&#39;m older than 17.And if this article is making you spiral with insecurity, I hope you make a similar decision. A decision to be inspired instead of intimidated."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Inspiring story all round but this paragraph stood out for me:“I didn&#39;t have a mentor to help me, really, so each time a motor failed, I had to do tons of research and try and troubleshoot what went wrong,” he says. “But eventually on the 15th motor, I was able to get a working prototype.”I imagine most 17 year old would not have kept going 15+ times until they arrived at something which worked."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"A few years ago we played this for a few weeks at the office over Christmas break when things were otherwise slow.  We had maybe a dozen players, and played in Survival mode which I believe is infinite with difficulty ramping up.We split into four teams, with one providing power, one providing ammo, one building defenses, and the rest just running around trying to help out where we needed it the most.There was a ton of potential.  I had to keep adjusting the difficulty as the match went on to keep us alive and then to finish us off when we were running out of time.I&#39;d love a multiplayer coop game like this but with the potential to have fifty or a hundred players.  Right now the office plays CS:GO once a week, with the settings changed to allow max players, but it still caps at thirty.  CS:GO is hard for new employees to get in to so I&#39;d love something where everyone has fun.  We also did TF2 for a while, which was better because the newbies could be medics and still feel like they were contributing, but the hard-core player base loved the challenge of CS:GO."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really like Mindustry.One place where Mindustry is clearly better than factorio is the feel of trying to build things quickly. It&#39;s very satisfying to lay something down fast. A stumble there is that the keyboard combinations are chorded but not overlap-free. So you hit like 1-3 for one thing and 3-1 for another, which means if you change your mind you can&#39;t abort a chord by starting another. Quite frustrating in the moment.Another &#34;so close to greatness&#34; problem is that the campaign doesn&#39;t allow you to trust your friends to run separate parts of the planet. You all have to be on the same map at the same time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It looks like Twitter is using SFSafariViewController for their in-app browser. This is the system-recommended way of creating an in-app browser. It prevents the embedding app (Twitter in this case) from reading website data and injecting JavaScript into the view. You can also break out of the session into Safari pretty trivially by hitting the Safari button in the lower right corner.Apps that implement a custom web browser using WKWebView (e.g. IG) are much worse and can do those nefarious things."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really like the simplicity of this proposal, and how Adrian compares it to X-Frame-Options: DENY which has been in place for a decade now and has solved the problem of clickjacking and unauthorized framing for regular websites.My hunch is that having X-Frame-Options: DENY start applying to native mobile apps wouldn&#39;t be feasible because it would break too much existing stuff that didn&#39;t intend to opt-out of native embedding, but having different syntax (X-Frame-App-Options: DENY for example) would solve this need very effectively.It&#39;s interesting to note that Google have already taken steps in this direction: Google sign-in now detects if it is running in an in-app embedded browser and shows you an error telling you to use the native browser instead: https://developers.googleblog.com/2021/06/upcoming-security-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I used to work in mobile advertising, advertisers and tech vendors were always so desperate for this, because it would let them track users across apps and not just websites, so I’m not super sold on enabling it by default.&gt; Seem familiar? This is framing, merely in app form. But this time, the framed website has no way to framebust.Click the safari button. It opens it in your normal browser. Better behaved apps (shout out to Apollo) will let you set a config that sends off links to safari directly.
The only apps I know of that don’t have this button are Facebook messenger and TikTok, to nobodies surprise, 2 reasonably badly behaved apps. I think Instagram still does as well, but that’s not a surprise.
You can still escape the app context via the sharing menu though, although that is somewhat more involved."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think a few more concrete use cases would help.First, a key limitation that every architect should pay attention.  Redis reaches the limits of what you can do in well-written single-threaded C.  One of those limits is that you really, really, *really* don&#39;t want to go outside of RAM.  Think about what is stored, and be sure not to waste space.  (It is surprisingly easy to leak memory.)Second, another use case.  Replication in Redis is cheap.  If your data is small and latency is a concern (eg happened to me with an adserver), then you can locate read-only Redis replicas everywhere.  The speed of querying off of your local machine is not to be underestimated.And third, it is worth spending time mastering Redis data structures.  For example suppose you have a dynamic leaderboard for an active game.  A Redis sorted set will happily let you instantly display any page of that leaderboard, live, with 10 million players and tens of thousands of updates per second.  There are a lot of features like that which will be just perfect for the right scenario."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;  it was difficult to find images where the entire llama fit within the frameI had the same trouble. In my experiment I wanted to generate a Porco Rosso style seaplane. illustration. Sadly none of the generated pictured had the whole of the airplane in them. The wingtips or the tail always got left off.I found this method to be a reliable workaround: I have downloaded the image I liked the most. Used an image editing software to extend the image in the direction I wanted it to be extended and filled the new area with a solid colour. Cropped a 1024x1024 size rectangle such that it had about 40% generated image, and 60% solid colour. Uploaded the new image and asked DALL-E to infill the solid area while leaving the previously generated area unchanged. Selected from the generated extensions the one I liked the best, downloaded it and merged it with the rest of the picture. Repeated the process as required.You need a generous amount of overlap so the network can figure out which parts is already there and how best to fit the rest. It&#39;s a good idea to look at the image segment you need to be infilled. If you as a human can&#39;t figure out what it is you are seeing, then the machine won&#39;t be able to figure it out either. It will generate something, but it will look out of context once merged.The other trick I found: I wanted to make my picture a canvas print, and thus I needed a higher resolution image. Higher even then what I can reasonably hope with the above extension trick. What I did is that I have upscaled the image (used bigjpg.com, but there might be better solutions out there.) After that I had a big image, but of course there weren&#39;t many small scale details now on it. So I have sliced it up to 1024x1024 rectangles, uploaded the rectangles to DALL-E and asked it to keep the borders intact but redraw the interior of them. This second trick worked particularly well on an area of the picture which shown a city under the airplane. It has added nice small details like windows and doors and roofs with texture without disturbing the overall composition.What I did:"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; [TikTok]&#39;s addiction-based advertising machine is probably close to the theoretical maximum of how many advertisements one can pour down somebody’s throat.Well put. It&#39;s interesting that we pivoted in my adult lifetime from:1. Myspace&#39;s emphasis on sharing things on your own webpage, essentially a hosted blog
2. Facebook&#39;s evolution from &#34;hosted blog&#34; to &#34;friend update aggregator&#34; to &#34;chat client&#34; to &#34;friend update &amp; ad aggregator&#34;
3. Instagram&#39;s callback to simple update sharing (with pictures) and a chronological ad-free news feed
4. Snap&#39;s emphemeral sharing
5. Facebook&#39;s slow agglomeration and bastardization of all of the features that made Instagram and Snap distinct.
6. TikTok&#39;s addictive advertising machine that barely includes any friend connections at all.Initially I was concerned that this would mean the death of real social media, just like the article initially suggests. But I really like the conclusion the article ultimately comes to: we basically don&#39;t have social media right now, we have advertising engines masquerading as social media. Better that Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat show their true colors and become disgusting advertising machines just like TikTok.If we&#39;re lucky, that means a federated, open, mostly-ad-and-suggestion-free open source social media experience can fill the power vacuum for intimate, interpersonal, high-latency communication over the internet. microblog seems promising, but I think even mastodon could provide the experience I&#39;m looking for."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the &#34;social&#34; part of social networks just moved to group chats. All my friends share updates of their family events, kids&#39; stuff etc.. over Whatsapp and Telegram. Strangers gather over topics that interest them and want to talk about it seem to have moved to discord, slack etc.The whole &#34;broadcast yourself to the world&#34; part of social networks just moved to Tiktok, Twitter, Instagram etc.. I think."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"TikTok is winning because it is video first. The more immersive the media, the more profitable the ads. Facebook is having trouble pivoting it&#39;s products to video. Facebook is betting big that the next more-immersive medium after video will be VR. That&#39;s basically the whole story.Notice I didn&#39;t use the word &#34;algorithm&#34; or &#34;social&#34;? These takes are tired and naive, TikTok isn&#39;t addictive in any operationally useful sense of the word, people just like it and use it. You may as well write a blog post saying &#34;TV is addictive and it&#39;s dying because of commercials&#34;. It&#39;s just not an accurate conceptualization if the landscape."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m very confused about what file format(s) Kindle actually supports.* They are dropping support for MOBI from their Send to Kindle website and apps.* They are adding support for ePub in their Send to Kindle website and apps, but apparently they will be converted to Kindle format (MOBI? AZW?) under the hood.* Several sites mention AZW3 as the official Kindle format. Is that the same as MOBI?* It is unclear whether ePub and/or MOBI are natively supported by Kindle.If I connect my Kindle and (1) drag an ePub to its local storage and (2) drag a MOBI to its local storage, will either of them work or not?"</p>
