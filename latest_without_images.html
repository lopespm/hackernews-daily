								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Time is a flat circle, eh?But all kidding aside, web directories should be much more powerful now than in the 90s. Websites have RSS, and directory websites should be able to automatically monitor things like uptime, and leverage RSS to preview a site&#39;s most recent post.I&#39;ve considered maintaining my own directory on my personal website (a one-way webring if you will), but always stopped because the sites I linked to either died, or were acquired and became something very different."</p>

The idea that Google &#34;killed&#34; blogs by killing Google Reader is a meme that is more destructive than Google&#39;s act in itself.There are countless healthy and active blogs that you can read via RSS. There are great RSS reader apps.For us technically-minded folks we need to keep being proactive about helping people read the web via RSS, improving discovery, and continually making RSS a first-class option on sites we build."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As someone who only needs to use Flexbox/Grid every once in a while, this is precisely what I needed.I&#39;ve been struggling with static documentation like the one from Tailwind [1] or MDN [2]. Writing good and intuitive documentation is hard, surely this must have been quite an effort.[1]: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/flex-direction[2]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layou..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love flex, it&#39;s made CSS so easy. One of the things that improved my flex usage was using Penpot to draw my designs before implementing them.They have alignment properties for graphical elements that work like flex&#39;s justify-content and align-items properties so once you design a view in Penpot it becomes almost trivial to translate it into HTML/CSS using flex.It really changed my mindset from working with relative or absolute positioning, blocks, margins, padding, etc... to simply working with flex everywhere. And it&#39;s responsive automatically!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;I like to think of CSS as a collection of layout modes. Each layout mode is an algorithm that can implement or redefine each CSS property. We provide an algorithm with our CSS declarations (key/value pairs), and the algorithm decides how to use them.&#34;Brilliant. The way basic CSS properties are taught often ignores the layout mode. Even MDN does not mention that &#34;width&#34; is a CSS property that is not always respected when &#34;display: flex&#34;. Making this distinction more prominent would reduce the amount of confusion/frustration when certain CSS properties appear to &#34;not work&#34;.[1] https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/width"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Coppicing, Hedge laying, Bocage, drystone walling, wattle-and-daub are all domestic comparable ancient crafts of Europe. The point being that probably only drystone walling is valued in a way comparable to the Japanese version of Coppicing, which really has been transformed into an artform. European coppices are cut close to the rootstock and cut down far younger for use as poles, for wood turning, for hedge laying.Timber framed construction in Europe was nailless (wooden tree nails permitted) but the mortice and tenon joinery of Japan is in another league. Maybe European Gothic cathedral roofs come close, little else would.Japan modernised in the modern era, it&#39;s industrial revolution was comparatively recent and it remained feudal far longer than Europe (Russian serfdom aside)There are probably more continuous family heritage firms in Japan practising some art (brewing, soy sauce, woodwork, coppicing) than anywhere else. Can you name a European family concern doing the same thing continuously since before 1600? I can&#39;t name any Japanese ones but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if there were many. Institutional enterprises like Oxford university press exist since deep time, but in Japan it would be a continuous lineage of printers continuing to use woodblock printing (maybe alongside hot type or photo typesetting)Farming does remain in the family but European farming practices have modernised since forever."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Everyone here is mentioning coppicing, so I suspect there will be some interest in the Low Tech Magazine articles on the subject:https://www.lowtechmagazine.com/coppicing/And since we&#39;re talking about doing cool things with trees, I just wanted to mention that LTM has more interesting articles slightly &#34;adjacent&#34; to this topic, like this one about a half-forgotten technique for growing citrus trees in climates with freezing temperatures:https://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2020/04/fruit-trenches-culti..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wish there was a way to apply this technique to some of the rarer woods that have fantastic uses in production, like teak, rosewood, and grenadilla.If you&#39;re into hardwoods like musical instruments or fine furniture there&#39;s an appreciation you grow for the character of these woods. And a moral quandary with the sourcing of it. It seems impossible to find a sustainable method to source the material. A lot of what we make today will seem impossible in the coming decades.Grenadilla trees in particular are suffering due to over harvesting and poor oversight in the markets where it is sourced. It is prized for woodwind instruments - and the day is coming where it&#39;s only going to be economical to use recycled polymer composites (which have many benefits besides commercial) over true solid wood instruments. If we could sustainably turn these trees into fruit trees harvested over centuries it would be a great service to nature and the industry."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Is there a good explanation of how to train this from scratch with a custom dataset[0]?I&#39;ve been looking around the documentation on Huggingface, but all I could find was either how to train unconditional U-Nets[1], or how to use the pretrained Stable Diffusion model to process image prompts (which I already know how to do). Writing a training loop for CLIP manually wound up with me banging against all sorts of strange roadblocks and missing bits of documentation, and I still don&#39;t have it working. I&#39;m pretty sure I also need some other trainables at some point, too.[0] Specifically, Wikimedia Commons images in the PD-Art-100 category, because the images will be public domain in the US and the labels CC-BY-SA. This would rule out a lot of the complaints people have about living artists&#39; work getting scraped into the machine; and probably satisfy Debian&#39;s ML guidelines.[1] Which actually does work"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am a solo dev working on a creative content creation app to leverage the latest developments in AI.Demoing even the v1 of stable diffusion to the non-technical general users blows them away completely.Now that v2 is here, it’s clear we’re not able to keep pace in developing products to take advantage of it.The general public still is blown away by autosuggest in mobile OS keyboards. Very few really know how far AI tech has evolved.Huge market opportunity for folks wanting to ride the wave here.This is exciting for me personally, since I can keep plugging in newer and better versions of these models into my app and it becomes better.Even some of the tech folks I demo my app to, are simply amazed how I can manage to do this solo."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s nice but could you make it so that the rotation direction can additionally be toggled by holding down shift while clicking? I find it very irritating to always move the mouse to the bottom right corner to select the rotation direction - especially since &#34;every click counts&#34;.Other than that, I first thought that some of the tiles should start with correct orientation but soon realized that would make this puzzle just really easy, because our brains are just excellent at seeing the correct image from just a few correctly oriented tiles I think."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like how well this specific picture works for this puzzle. The coastline lines up perfectly with a square border. The cat&#39;s face is sideways. The two steps are the same color, so the rotation could be in one of two possible positions. It makes it just tricky enough to make the right answer not immediately obvious, but it&#39;s not so hard that there&#39;s any chance for being frustrated. Plus, it&#39;s a kitty."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I can attest to this and took all of my notes on paper in college. However, once I started a real job I realized that this strategy doesn&#39;t scale to all situations. In college, I needed to be able to recall all of the information I had ingested: it was low-write, high-read. In the workplace, there&#39;s much more information, but I&#39;m unlikely to need most of it: it&#39;s high-write, low-read. I need to be able to reference the information, but not necessarily recall it. Taking paper notes became too much of a burden and I moved to a wiki of markdown notes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you&#39;re in charge of other people, it&#39;s worth noting that some very common cognitive problems like ADHD, Dysgraphia, and Dyslexia negate these benefits in some affected people. The cognitive load of making legible marks can become high enough to become the focus, rather than the actual content. Pressuring someone already struggling with working memory to do things like this, is counterproductive, if not demoralizing. Work style advice is great, but make sure you listen if they say it doesn&#39;t work for them rather than getting into the &#34;it worked for me so you must be doing it wrong&#34; mindset."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d be curious if anyone had good advice on how to improve your handwriting ability well into adulthood (I&#39;m 35). My penmanship was so bad in grade school that I attended special education classes to improve it, but it still was and remains horrible. This is a source of insecurity for me and since I&#39;ve always been glued to a keyboard it has been easy to handwave away as &#34;screw this, the world is all typing-based anyhow&#34;.But I have seen evidence before that handwriting notes leads to improved retention, and seeing it here now, I&#39;m wondering if there&#39;s a framework or resource that can help me feel a little bit more confident in my ability to, you know...write words with pen and paper. It&#39;s embarrassing even talking about it, honestly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My wife and I are over 70. We live in the UK.It&#39;s fun to generalise, but not always helpful. No, we don&#39;t watch anything like 6 hours of TV a day. We have our evening meal, like every meal, at a table. We mostly watch one thing a day on streaming, usually well made fiction. We read news on our phones but never watch it on TV because of all the uninformed comment.Maybe we are not typical, but we do exist."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The question is not now much time you spend at a screen, but who is on
the other side of it.Much of the conversation so far concerns time, and the virtues or
vices of how we spend it. Not all pastimes are equal. Knitting a
jumper, taking a hike, or skateboarding are actions one performs on or
in the world. Reading a book is more of an action that the world (the
author especially) performs upon you. It is a different frame. Movies
and video gaming are somewhere in the middle. Some media forms, such
as daytime trash-TV and TiKTok are at the extreme of the
passive/receptive frame. It is a pipeline of affect directly to your
hypothalamus. Any discussion of harms or benefits must be understood
in that light."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While I disliked the tone of the piece, I mostly agree with the sentiment. But this (very bitter) part just made me laugh:&gt; But please, yes, tell me again about young people and screen time and content and moral decay, and how the mobiles they’re engaging with are somehow a greater risk to their character than their own parents and their own grandparents and the family traditions they hold so dear, such as laughing in your face when you suggest shared family mealtimes around a table, a suggestion which might lead to talking to each other, listening to each other, and being present in that shared moment with each other. Tell me all about it.This sounds like something my parents would have said. We ate our meal at a table in a room without screens. Nonetheless, my spouse describes the meals I had with my family when we all lived together as “psychological warfare,” and I can’t disagree. When my parents tried to force us all to come together for anything, we laughed in their faces because we hated being together. If that’s the reaction you get from your children, look inward. And if your spouse won’t help you figure it out, then you have at least a partial answer. To this day I avoid interacting with my family as much as possible because my parents couldn’t keep the household under control. They were arbitrary with their punishments, and untrustworthy as far as confiding them with thoughts and feelings. At best nothing would be done about it. At worst, it would come back to bite you later. I didn’t want to talk to people in my family because the result was guaranteed to be extremely painful. I suspect it was the same with the author’s children and husband. It sounds like she did the right thing by getting out."</p>

The iOS App Store only comes on iOS devices, it comes on all iOS devices, and it is the only way to access a crucial feature of the device. It is, for all meaningful purposes, part of the iPhone in the same way iOS is.It would be a bit like Microsoft saying &#34;explorer.exe? Policy A only covers the OS, and that is clearly not part of Windows! - so therefore you are covered by Policy B&#34;. While Apple may be legally in the right, I strongly believe they are morally in the wrong and have betrayed the trust their users put in them to safeguard their privacy.I believe that a casual user of the iPhone would take a look at Apple&#39;s iPhone privacy policy and expect that to apply to the iOS App Store as well, as for all intents and purposes that is a part of the iPhone."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Not many people want to trust an AI with spending their money or buying an item without seeing a picture or reading reviews.I wonder how much the decline in quality of Amazon&#39;s marketplace has affected other parts of the company&#39;s business including Alexa. I remember a time when, if I wanted to buy something online, I&#39;d just buy off Amazon without shopping around. They almost always had the best price, their shipping was fast, and I trusted the quality of what I received. In that world, I could see myself saying my shopping list out lout to an Echo to make things easier.But in Amazon&#39;s current free-for-all marketplace, I would never do that. Now I typically check traditional big box stores first, and only go with Amazon if I can&#39;t find what I need elsewhere."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Perhaps a silly question, but can somebody describe how they might lose $10 billion on Alexa in one year? I don&#39;t understand the math. That&#39;s enough to pay 33,000 employees $330k a year, or some recombination of such.  I don&#39;t think the real numbers come even remotely close to that.So it presumably has to be hardware costs, but Alexa is software, and they have vertical integration of all servers which presumably would drive voice processing costs to negligible levels as well (and that&#39;s assuming 0 on-device caching/learning ability). And this is all assuming that the gross revenue generated by Alexa is $0, which also certainly isn&#39;t true. So I don&#39;t see where the numbers are coming from?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I use my Alexa all the time, but 99% of it is:Alexa, time!
Alexa, set an alarm for 5 minutes!
Alexa how many minutes left?
Alexa, turn off/on all the lights!That’s basically it.  I wrote some apps for it a long time ago to do custom stuff like read me some Reddit pages, but the SDK changed or something and eventually they just died and it wasn’t obvious to me how to recreate it/not worth the effort.  I really wish there was an easy way to just put python scripts onto the device or something.  The process of going through Amazon is pretty unnecessarily complex and annoying.I know there are ways of doing this stuff with raspberry pi, but also: not really worth the effort.  If I cared that much I’d just make a PWA for my house and give that to my wife and kids."</p>
