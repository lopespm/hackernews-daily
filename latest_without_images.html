								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Terrific story. Personal, authentic, and very relatable. Interest in and an aptitude for computers also saved me. (I even had a job in a computer store.)&gt; I made the cold calculation that as painful as my life was, it was probably better than rolling the dice with the child protection services.Yup. I too decided at age 11, choosing to live with the less bad parent.And shortly thereafter, those decisions were made for me, resulting in the state putting me into foster care. Somehow I avoided the worst; while the 1st family was pretty much what you&#39;d expect, I later lucked into a good family.--I wonder how many of us there are. I&#39;ve known so many runaways, beaten kids, sexually abused kids, kids with broken parents. And that&#39;s just in my wealthy, prosperous city. I can&#39;t imagine how much worse it is every where else.I also marvel that somehow some of us find a way out, while seemingly most others get sucked into the abyss. So much human potential lost due to poor circumstances and stupid luck. It fills me with deep sadness.And I wonder what the difference is. How are some able to escape their fate? If we can identify those success factors, maybe we can maximize chances for success. Could even be small measures, like how we now have suicide prevention hotlines, and resources for victims of human trafficking.--I had many, many people help me over the years. People who had no reason to help, but did nonetheless. I call them my angels. People like a little league coach (who&#39;d drive me to practice), a youth pastor (who mentored me), the foster family that raised me, etc, etc.As society becomes harsher, more coarse, more dog-eat-dog, I worry that other lost kids won&#39;t have their own angels."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I often wonder how I would have made a living and a good life without the internet. I finished high school in 1994 with little career inspiration, landed in a generic business degree that held little interest for me, but it was at that uni campus I discovered the internet in early 95.I immediately found it exciting and grasped how transformative it would be, and quickly got to work learning web development and finding material and communities related to my interests (mostly obscure Australian rock bands). It&#39;s been the platform for my career ever since, and has also enabled me to go deep learning about some unusual health and emotional challenges that had afflicted me since early life, and enabled me to make profound changes to my health and wellbeing, leading to the place I&#39;m at now, with a solid career, great relationship and a wonderful young son.When I think about the person I was and the path I was on when I finished high school, it&#39;s hard to imagine how it would have turned out well had I come of age in a different era.Which is not to say life has been easy or simple; quite the opposite, and the internet has no doubt made life more complicated and challenging in many ways, My life has had several major ups and downs that probably wouldn&#39;t have been as pronounced without the internet. But I still have no doubt at all I&#39;m in a much better place than I&#39;d have been without it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The internet to me was a blessing and a curse. In economic terms, it has granted me lots of opportunities I might have not otherwise had; in social terms, it has taken a big toll, significantly isolating me from the world, which I didn&#39;t admit until very recently. I remember a smart classmate at university who, one day, just stopped attending and sold his computers, saying something like &#34;these little colored lights have turned me into something I don&#39;t like&#34;. Some days I wish I had done the same."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you regularly do command line JSON requests, I&#39;m a big fan of HTTPie. It&#39;s so much easier to use correctly. https://httpie.io/docs/cli/examplesFor example, here&#39;s a JSONy POST request with cURL:curl -s -H &#34;Content-Type: application/json&#34; -X POST https://api.ctl.io/v2/authentication/login --data &#39;{&#34;username&#34;:&#34;YOUR.USERNAME&#34;,&#34;password&#34;:&#34;YOUR.PASSWORD&#34;}&#39;Here&#39;s that same request with HTTPie:http POST https://api.ctl.io/v2/authentication/login username=YOUR.USERNAME password=YOUR.PASSWORD"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The --jp (json part) command line option, described at https://github.com/curl/curl/wiki/JSON, has &#34;anti-pattern&#34; written all over it to me. Why introduce some specific, curl-only wonky-ish version of JSON? Is this any easier to remember than normal JSON? I mean, right now, I use cURL all the time with JSON posts, just doing something like-d &#39;{ &#34;foo&#34;: &#34;bar&#34;, &#34;zed&#34;: &#34;yow&#34; }&#39;The proposed --jp flag seems worse to me in every way.(Note I do like the --json as just syntactic sugar for -H &#34;Accept: application/json&#34; -d &lt;jsonBody&gt;)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This culture of radical openness must be quite refreshing for people inside the company.A lot of companies would never want this sort of thing to be out in the open. But really, why not? I imagine it helps to keep things sensible if you know that a thousand eyes could be trawling over your employee policies. You&#39;re certainly not going to be promoting astroturfing or other undesirable activities.At the same time, you aren&#39;t burdened with deciding what to share. Many (most?) companies tie themselves in knots trying to decide what to share, and end up sharing nothing.Sharing everything means less time spent deciding what to share and more time developing the stuff in the first place."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hey there, I’m a member of the GitLab Community Relations team. My team is responsible for this page. I shared the page today at a DevRel meetup where OP was presenting on Hacker News. I’m grateful he chose to share it with all of you. Thanks, Dan.If there are ways we can improve how we engage with the HN community, myself and our team would love your feedback."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Never submit GitLab content to Hacker News. Submission gets more credibility if a non-GitLab Hacker News community member posts it, we should focus on making our posts interesting instead of on submitting it.I appreciate this policy, it makes it clear that HN is a place to engage with the community, rather than a free advertising channel. Looking at the CEO&#39;s profile, the last time he made a submission about Gitlab was in 2018, so I&#39;d say the policy appears to be followed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am fine with abstinence as a general recommendation, but critical thinking pointed out two issues with the WHF Policy Brief, which I suppose I have read in sufficient depth:1. There is no citation on the sentence, &#34;Recent evidence has found that no level of alcohol consumption is safe for health.&#34; This is really the only line we are interested in.2. There is no comparison on the effects of alcohol on the body by dosage (and frequency), which is, again, what is required from the brief to make that claim.Again, while I don&#39;t necessarily disagree with what&#39;s in the report, and that it is already established that drinking too much is not good for the heart, considering many otherwise toxic substances have a hormetic zone, it is critical that a study like this rules out the its existence for ethanol."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Pijul is a free and open source (GPL2) distributed version control system. Its distinctive feature is to be based on a theory of patches, while still being fast and scalable. This makes it easy to learn and use, without any compromise on power or features."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I downloaded this and tried to follow the documentation [0]. `pijul add` doesn&#39;t accept wildcards, instead returning a pretty unhelpful error message:&gt; λ pijul add *.*&gt; Error: The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect. (o error 123)The documentation for add [1] gives no information on the format, however I put 2 and 2 together and managed to do `pijul add . -r`. The next step is `pijul record` [2] which returns another error:&gt; Error: No identity configured yet. Please use `pijul key` to create oneOk great. I ran `pijul key` [3] (which isn&#39;t documented) which returns 0, with no output. `pijul record` still says the above, so I tried `pijul key --help` which tells me I need to run a _different_ command (`pijul key generate &lt;LOGIN&gt;`) but doens&#39;t tell me what `login` is supposed to be. I ran `pijul key generate &lt;my_email&gt;` which appears to have worked, and then `pijul record`.I actually killed it after an hour and 15 minutes, rather than waiting to see how long it would take. For reference, git add * takes about 3 minutes on the same project. Between the documentation, error messages and performance I can&#39;t see myself taking another go at this for a while.[0] https://pijul.com/manual/getting_started.html[1] https://pijul.com/manual/reference/add.html[2] https://pijul.com/manual/reference/record.html[3] https://pijul.com/manual/reference/key.html"</p>
