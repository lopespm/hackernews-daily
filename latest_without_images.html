He would be overjoyed to see me and give the best hugs whenever we ran into each other. He is this super accomplished person but that was never the conversation. I&#39;ve known him for years and it&#39;s only now that I discover his LetsEncrypt involvement. It speaks volumes to him, he was so focused on everyone around him and filled with love for them, never self-promoting, just loving and being amazing. He would give the best hugs, and few seconds longer than most, and you could hear him smiling while he does so. Thank you Peter"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Reading over the comments I see everyone thinking this is about “free speech.” It is not. It’s about what in the US you’d call “due process” and in all the rest of the world you’d call “rule of law.”Our decision today was that the risk created by the content could not be dealt with in a timely enough matter by the traditional rule of law systems.That’s a failure of the rule of law on two dimensions: we shouldn’t be the ones making that call, and no one else who should was stepping up in spite of being aware of the threat.Encourage you when these issues arise to think of them in the rule of law context, rather than free speech, in order to have a more robust conversation with frameworks that have an appeal and applicability across nearly every nation and government."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Cloudflare can do whatever it wants but I wish they were honest about it.The claim that there has been some “dangerous escalation” in the past 2 weeks is nonsense. If anything the owner has been monitoring the thread more proactively and making sure people follow the law. This is included not allowing the creation of new accounts and reminding everyone that their data will be turned over to the authorities should it be requested.The only thing that picked up steam in the last two weeks is the campaign to drop Cloudflare and the media attention on the situation. That’s why they caved in. It got big enough to reach Bloomberg/wsj/congress. Just be honest about it."</p>

On one hand, yes, this specific site is terrible. But they are trying very hard to not become the arbiters of what is terrible and what isn&#39;t terrible, and I respect them for that.It&#39;s not an easy line to take, and other companies like Google and Facebook have not made that same choice to stay neutral.&gt; Some argue that we should terminate these services to content we find reprehensible so that others can launch attacks to knock it offline.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"To be maybe controversial...I&#39;m still thinking about it, but I do wonder if diverse casting works in European fantasy stories. The problem I have is that it generally pulls me out of the experience/ makes it less immersive. I welcome diverse castings in modern shows (though we don&#39;t need every show to follow a template &#39;diverse&#39; casting). 
A common counter argument is, well you can suspend your disbelief and imagine a dragon, so why is a diverse community in a small village not ok? It just feels less immersive. Yes, I can go along with it - but I&#39;m not sure it works. It feels like the modern world superimposed in a fantasy setting. I&#39;d prefer to be sent to an alien world.It is problematic, as years of discrimination in the real world for women/ethnic minorities were wrong and we should encourage equality in the corporate world. However the entertainment industry I wonder should in some ways be exempt. Maybe. One area where there isnt a discussion on &#39;diversity&#39; is music and also novels. This is because there are tons of tons of novels and music bands to listen to. No one cares if a particular band is &#39;diverse&#39;. 
So I wonder if the only solution out of all of this, is to have more shows - yes, make diverse inclusive European fantasy shows, but also make traditional european fantasy shows too etc. What I think will happen is that in such a scenario most European fantasy fans will choose traditional like shows. Because the story is more immersive and you are brought more into this old world. Maybe. Like I say, I&#39;m still undecided. For modern/futuristic films I find diverse castings just as immersive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t get reviews saying that TRoP, or some other new prestige TV series, is &#34;terrible&#34;, or &#34;a disaster&#34;, based on the first couple of episodes.Some really excellent TV series have taken more than a whole 26-episode season before they find their rhythm and get properly good. ST:TNG is a classic example, but I&#39;m pretty sure you can come up with others. And some people are claiming that a new series totally worthless, not based on the first series, but based on the first episode? Are you kidding me?I mean, is it OK if the first episode of a series is unevenly paced, and contains too much exposition, and clunky &#34;tell, don&#39;t show&#34; dialogue about who the main characters are and what their deal is? No, no it isn&#39;t. We should ask that writers do better, and trust audiences to have the patience to learn who characters are through action over the course of a few episodes.But just because they don&#39;t do those things, is it really worth writing off the next 5 (or however many) seasons of a show, based on one episode? Who does that? What does anyone gain from that?OK, there&#39;s a lot of prestige serialised TV out there now, and you probably can&#39;t watch all of it even if you wanted to, so some culling is probably necessary at some stage. But does anyone really have to write something off quite so soon? You can&#39;t even give it half a season to try and get up to speed?I don&#39;t get it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is not the GPS week counter rollover https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_week_number_rolloverBut instead it is a device-specific rollover. It’s relatively common for GPS receivers to handle the limited week counter by having a baked-in epoch that is more recent than the latest rollover, which gives them a nearly 20 year lifetime after that epoch instead of failing at the GPS rollover."</p>

There are a few select models where a return-to-factory firmware update can help you dodge the problem, but it is probably too late to get something turned around now if this is the first you have heard of it.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Everyone here is so incredibly focused on money as the primary motivator, which I guess given the thread question makes some sense. But I&#39;d like to just put in a little word for money not being everything, and client type / work type actually being a really important part of the equation.HN is a forum where increasingly I see posts every single day about the high level of misery in tech / how can I get out of this rat race / high levels of stress / undervalued / etc etc.I charge £500 a day. It&#39;s not much compared to some of the rates on here, but I work with lovely, interesting clients in the non-profit sector. My clients love what they do and I do good work for them so they love what I do. I have long term, low stress, friendship-like relationships with my clients, not shouty / nasty / high stress ones. I&#39;ve done this work for 12 years, and had to work with maybe a handful of assholes during that time.FWIW I think there is a &#34;lower budget bar&#34; under which demands are insane for the money being offered, and we should all avoid this work unless we actively want to take a race to the bottom. But - I think there is undoubtedly a &#34;higher budget bar&#34; over which the stress level and expectation is made exceedingly high. This (I would imagine; I don&#39;t know, I&#39;ve worked in non profits my whole life) is probably also equated with sector - if you&#39;re in a FinTech environment I would imagine you&#39;re looking at high budgets but also an insane number of highly pressured assholes shouting at you all the time.What am I basically saying? I guess - yes, charge enough (and this is probably more than you think it should be) - but also, look at the bigger picture of your work / sector. Think about happiness, work-life balance, client motivations, etc - and use this to inform what you charge and how you charge for it. That&#39;d be my advice."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Anybody who did PS1 dev back in the day will have had to do some crazy hacking stuff to get performance or memory.  The first project [1] I worked on I had a C version of my graphics engine and animation system, and in parallel I&#39;d have a MIPS assembly version which was super optimised (the C version was effectively a reference).I made the whole engine and animation system fit in 4K so it would fit into the instruction cache of the CPU.  The whole frame update cycle wouldn&#39;t need to touch main memory (for the code).Also, because loading from main memory was slow (4 cycles) and the chip was RISC (1 operation per cycle), you&#39;d need 3 NOPs after the Load-op for the register to be loaded. The C compiler (if I remember right) never really filled those 3 NOPs with useful stuff.  So, I&#39;d do hand written concurrency (in MIPS assembly) by loading other stuff I&#39;d need into those NOPs - this was particularly effective when working with 3 dimensional vectors or 4 dimensional matrices.Trying to keep super-optimised hand-written concurrency in assembly, in my head, was a challenge and not something I&#39;d recommend!  Still, the engine had more throughput than Sony claimed of their machine.  Every bit of performance gained would mean an edge over the other games.Then the game was canned by Eidos.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;once they figure out how to control potentially harmful generationsIs it just me, or does anyone else think that this is an impossible and futile task? I don&#39;t have a solid grasp on what kind of censorship is possible with this technology, but the goal seems to be on par with making sure nobody says anything mean online. People are extremely creative and are going to find the prompts that generate the &#34;harmful&#34; images."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"After generating 5000 images with these tools, I believe the killer app will be the one that gives the artist the most control. I want a view and a scene and be able to manipulate both in real time.Like,View: 50mm film, wide-angleScene: rectangular room with window -&gt; show previewScene: add table -&gt; show previewScene: move table left -&gt; show previewScene: add mug on table -&gt; show previewView: center on mugRight now, there’s little control and it’s a lot of random guessing, “Hmm what happens if I add these two terms?”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"All these harmful this and unsafe that... I don&#39;t get it. What is the goal here? Are they trying to make it resistant to any &#34;vulgar&#34; inputs (I put &#34;vulgar&#34; in quotes because I can 100% see how they may consider strongly political statements as &#34;vulgar&#34; too)? Or prevent it from producing pornography? Or CP? The last one should be fairly straightforward (kid + nudity = get it out), but the first two are very broad limitations. I understand if you want to make it not super racist, but with pornography, I&#39;m not sure it has a point... even more so given the fact that erotic art is very common in the real world and I&#39;m pretty sure this model (and others like it) can&#39;t distinguish between erotic art and pornography (which you can&#39;t blame it for given the legal standard seeming to be &#34;I recognize it when I see it&#34;), meaning it can only ever be used to produce SFW imagery scrubbed of any &#34;risque&#34; factors or themes, because the authors didn&#39;t want to deal with any kind of erotic art due to this impossibility of separating erotic art from pornography.If the point of all of these models is to get to something resembling an artist, then why intentionally kneecap it from the start and prevent it from producing art?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s a reason we don&#39;t just &#34;let the builders build&#34;. We used to do that (certainly to a massively greater extent than we do now), and the result was that although a few of them managed to construct monuments we can all be proud of, most of them built a pile of crap and/or damaged the places they built in and the people they nominally built for. This is true of literal buildings, but it&#39;s also true of a great many other things that we &#34;build&#34;.The author of this delightfully titled but almost content-free piece seems not to consider Chesterton&#39;s Fence at all: before you criticize let alone dismantle regulation, you should be able to demonstrate a sound understanding of why it came to exist in the first place. For bonus points, a rigorous explanation of why the reasoning no longer applies in the current time period is helpful. TFA provided neither."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unspoken and underlying the author&#39;s entire worldview seems to be, &#34;the more new things, the better,&#34; a not uncommon tunnel view in the engineering world. The purpose of regulation, ideally, is to ensure that whatever activity/process is being regulated is worth the cost(s) for the majority of people. Defining those terms and making that decision is precisely the job of regulators, who are ideally accountable to a democratic base. In the worldview where all that matters is &#34;growth,&#34; people suffer. Running water is a huge quality of life win for EVERYONE. If you ask most people what would really help make their lives better, it&#39;s not gonna be colonizing mars, building tunnels under LA, whatever, it&#39;s gonna be access to resources we already have. Healthcare, clean water, clean air...perhaps we should think more about engineering as it can be applied to expanding access, and not so much to &#34;making new things,&#34; which most people don&#39;t need or care at all about."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The same Marc Andreesen who complained that there shouldn&#39;t be housing built near him because it would lower his property prices?How can someone who has read Why Nations Fail miss the point? We don&#39;t build for the same reasons that we didn&#39;t from the year -2000 to the Enlightenment. Because it&#39;s now better and easier in so many cases to just rent seek. Why bother constructing housing when you can just have other people&#39;s labour increase your land values? Why should I increase the supply of residency spots when constraining that supply increases my salary by $100k? Why bother with bold bets when you have net work effect monopolies? It&#39;s not talkers standing in the way of builders, it&#39;s leeches."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A better question might be: Why is the private sector responsible for providing accurate health information? As this article shows, the incentives for people running medical websites and the people reading them are not aligned. I&#39;d say the UK NHS website and symptoms/medications pages hit the nail on the head - https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/. It has no advertising and provides short, easily readable and actionable information on the majority of conditions and the correct way to use and take many different sorts of medication.And crucially - if the information present is not sufficient, clear and obvious UI elements that direct the next best steps to get the help you need, whether that be ringing the non emergency helpline or immediately going to A&amp;E.
