I have a dog and like to read and occasionally complain about politics.&#34;I&#39;d buy this if I saw it, if just for the lulz and nihilistic outlook when it comes to privacy.In fact... if I were a privacy-focused company, I&#39;d 100% do this as a marketing stunt."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A pretty cool piece.Too bad they have to use text to make their point. It would essentially reach zero people due to rules (https://www.facebook.com/business/learn/lessons/how-to-adher...). Then there&#39;s personal attributes (https://m.facebook.com/policies/ads/prohibited_content/perso...). Then ads that do not sell products/services follow murky rules, and talking about Facebook itself is usually prohibited. (edited from: because the rule they&#39;re actually breaking is the &#34;No Text&#34; rule in Facebook ad creatives.)Is there non-symbolic imagery that they could have used to say the same thing?Perhaps they should have retained someone with this kind of creative experience.Looking critically, the most narrow and serious obstacle to advocate for privacy is storytelling."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is both an ad for Signal and an ad for Facebook Ad&#39;s ability to target depending on who is reading it.What I mean is that for your average consumer, they&#39;ll read this and be horrified that Facebook is using the information they voluntarily gave Facebook to make money. But someone who is buying ads will read this same thing, be impressed by just how tightly Facebook can target, and put $10K into an Ad Account to try it out.As to me, I use Facebook, I am willing to see ads within Facebook using the information I share with Facebook but where I draw the line is Facebook &#34;leaking&#34; into my wider web browsing history (either tracking me, or using my non-Facebook browsing to advertise to me on Facebook). Therefore, I use Mozilla&#39;s Facebook Container extension and blacklist Facebook/Instagram&#39;s &#34;Share&#34; tracking buttons.I also access Facebook from a mobile browser rather than app and use Signal instead of Facebook Messager, to limit Facebook&#39;s ability to track my location and other phone meta-data."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Everyone: PLEASE stop making the argument that it&#39;s &#34;too hard&#34; or even &#34;impossible&#34; to implement spending limits.As the article points out: Every other cloud does this! They all have non-production subscription types with hard spending limits.There&#39;s a difference between &#34;unable&#34; and &#34;unwilling&#34;.The people that refuse to understand the difference are the same people that don&#39;t understand that &#34;unsupported&#34; isn&#39;t synonymous with &#34;cannot be made to function&#34;.Don&#39;t be that person.If you have a large account and you&#39;re in regular contact with an AWS sales representative, pressure them into making this happen. Even if you work for Megacorp with a $$$ budget, keep in mind that your future hires need to start somewhere, need to be able to learn on their own, and need to do so safely.Don&#39;t walk down the same path as IBM&#39;s mainframes, where no student anywhere ever has been able to learn on their own, making it a dead-end for corporations who pay billions for this platform.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Random diamond story! As a freshman in college, I took a geology class and our teacher asked all of the women in our class to raise their hand if they would rather have natural or human-made diamonds. Most of the women (over 80%) raised their hands for natural. The reasons they gave all seemed to tie back to branding and natural diamonds being “real.”Then our teacher gave another analogy. He asked if people would rather have natural ice or human-made ice in their water. He broke down that the human-made ice could be frozen in a freezer to a custom size/shape, be a lot cleaner, consistent in how you make it, and chemically no different than H20 than naturally occurring frozen water. As you looked around the lecture hall, you started to see people’s brains unlock. He went on to explain cost efficiencies, ethics, challenges with conflict diamonds, and how you could make a perfect diamond at a fraction of the coast.After a 30 minute lecture, he asked the question again. Surprisingly, the majority of the women still wanted natural diamonds although the number was less than the original amount that raised their hand. That was the point where I realized the strength of diamonds product branding."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good for them. It&#39;s literally the same material, and we can now use scientific and engineering advances to remove the need for people to toil and die underground to get them.Hopefully the process is more environmentally friendly too.They are real diamonds.I find it hi-goddamned-larious that the moment these became viable, the industry switched from &#34;Diamond purity is the be-all and end-all and you must have the clearest, most pure&#34; to &#34;Oh, well of course it&#39;s all about having the right impurities to increase sparkle and character, lab-grown diamonds don&#39;t have character&#34;Just like with sapphires, if we&#39;re not there already I&#39;m sure it won&#39;t be long before exactly the right type and number of impurities or faults can be introduced to mimic any natural diamond."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you want to read about the insanity of manipulation in the diamond industry, this Atlantic article on de Beers from 1982 is a … gem.Of the many shocking moments, one that stood out to me was the way they went after post-war Japan to convert their &#34;backwards&#34; desires to ones of a more &#34;forward-thinking&#34; diamond friendly impulse:&#34;J. Walter Thompson began its campaign by 
 suggesting that diamonds were a visible 
 sign of modern Western values. It created 
 a series of color advertisements in Japanese 
 magazines showing beautiful women displaying 
 their diamond rings. All the women had 
 Western facial features and wore European 
 clothes. Moreover, the women in most of 
 the advertisements were involved in some 
 activity -- such as bicycling, camping, 
 yachting, ocean swimming, or mountain 
 climbing -- that defied Japanese traditions. 
 In the background, there usually stood a 
 Japanese man, also attired in fashionable 
 European clothes. In addition, almost all 
 of the automobiles, sporting equipment, and 
 other artifacts in the picture were conspicuous 
 foreign imports. The message was clear: 
 diamonds represent a sharp break with the 
 Oriental past and a sign of entry into modern life.&#34;&#34;The campaign was remarkably successful. Until 1959, 
 the importation of diamonds had not even been 
 permitted by the postwar Japanese government. When 
 the campaign began, in 1967, not quite 5 percent 
 of engaged Japanese women received a diamond 
 engagement ring. By 1972, the proportion had risen 
 to 27 percent. By 1978, half of all Japanese women 
 who were married wore a diamond; by 1981, some 60 
 percent of Japanese brides wore diamonds. In a 
 mere fourteen years, the 1,500-year Japanese 
 tradition had been radically revised. Diamonds 
 became a staple of the Japanese marriage. Japan 
 became the second largest market, after the United 
 States, for the sale of diamond engagement rings.&#34;https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1982/02/have-yo..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I feel a common issue with such &#34;dead bedroom&#34; discussions is the seeming lack of capacity of some parties (including some prominent toplevel comments here) to understand how deep a need for sex many people have.  To think sex can be replaced with &#34;strong friendships&#34; is laughable to anyone who actually feels a strong desire for sex.The dead bedroom situations I&#39;ve seen with my friends (M-&gt;F equally as well as F-&gt;M) are always the result of one party being incapable of understanding the other&#39;s desire for sex.  This leads them when pressed to try approaches such as, substituting &#34;being nicer&#34; for sex, trying therapy to reduce their partner&#39;s sex drive, or just forgetting about the problem because they are unable to sympathize with it.  Ideas such as initiating sex more often or opening up the relationship either don&#39;t occur to them, are vehemently opposed, or forgotten about.No-one is entitled to sex.  But individuals in a sexually-exclusive relationship are entitled to sympathy, action, and compromise from their partner to bridge severe differences in sexuality, just the same as any other sticking point in a relationship."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really like this post because it exudes nuance. So many problems are boiled down to terse summaries that are barely accurate when examining details.People being hateful and violent are a problem. More of a problem are the conditions that push people in this direction. When presenting the underlying cause, people push back and instead focus on scapegoating or minimizing.This problem occurs in engineering all the time too. We accrue &#34;tech debt&#34; and when it bites us we&#39;re quick to blame incompetence or bad luck. Nobody wants to hear that the problem is because we have to &#34;waste time&#34; working on hardly visible components that don&#39;t change anything except &#34;down the road.&#34;The problem is the same now. We blame &#34;bad apples&#34; and &#34;bad days&#34; instead of blaming our own culture and society and undertaking the effort to improve it. We try to make the world fit our own perspectives instead of critically examining our biases. We outright lie to ourselves, and I&#39;m frankly sick of it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These issues are far more serious than is known and commenters saying “too bad, you don’t deserve to date someone” really don’t understand how ineffective this approach is. You can’t just shame tens of thousands of men into accepting a substandard life.Disclaimer: I am not making any ethical judgments here, just observing.This problem didn’t really exist before for three reasons.One, widespread access to prostitution and its social acceptability. Reading books from earlier centuries, it’s noticeable how common this was and how little anyone seemed to be socially stigmatized by going to a brothel.Two, enforced monogamy. Our current culture is centered on removing restrictions. And as with every market, removing the restrictions on sexual access means the top players get more “resources” while the bottom get none. Monogamy was historically the solution to this.Three, the primary model of marriage being one of love or connection, and not of uniting families, having children, or passing on property. This, combined with our consumeristic society, leads people to always assume that a better option is available. Add easy divorce laws and Tinder, and the incentives for trying to work out any problems (or even get into a relationship in the first place) are nearly nonexistent.It really doesn’t seem like the culture is going to accept enforcing monogamy (2) or restrictions on divorce (3), but it does seem like (1) might be legalized at some point. Personally, that seems something of a dystopian solution to the problem, but that’s just me."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Something that I&#39;ve noticed recently is that in my work life, I&#39;m finding there&#39;s more bureaucracy in what I do, mostly in the name of &#34;efficiency&#34;. When you encounter a problem to solve, there&#39;s often a process already defined that is most efficient (or at least thought to be most efficient), when accomplishing tasks, there&#39;s a pre-defined way of laying out the tasks (i.e. tickets), updating them, reviewing them, and organizationally figuring out what&#39;s best to do next.In my opinion, these processes are an attempt at organizational efficiency. However, the flip side is it reduces personal agency for the worker. There&#39;s little room to diverge or think about what you&#39;re doing. If you diverge, such as taking longer to do something than what was prescribed, or using a different pattern to solve a problem, there is a cost to you within the system. You must explain why, which itself &#34;costs&#34; something. In a sense, you&#39;re punished for doing things differently.That loss of personal agency is absolutely soul-sucking. You feel like a machine, again at the cost of organizational efficiency. Slack is definitely important because it lets people acquire some sense of personal agency again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"And this is why you schedule flights in the morning: there&#39;s so damn little slack in the system that if things go wrong at 10:00 AM at O&#39;Hare, flights for the whole rest of the day are screwed up owing to the cascading delays.At least in the morning the airlines have had the overnight to unsnarl the previous day&#39;s mess because of the reduced revenue traffic overnight and the corresponding slack that accrues as a happy side effect.This is also why things like the healthcare system, transportation network, and postal system shouldn&#39;t be run for maximum utilization/efficiency under normal load: if there isn&#39;t any slack in the system it gets real ugly when things get squirrelly. In cases of localized disturbance, we get by on mutual aid: linemen and bucket trucks from far away respond in the aftermath of e.g. a hurricane or tornado. Likewise, fire departments from all over The greater Boston area responded to the gas explosions in the Merrimack Valley[0] and companies from even further away repositioned trucks to cover the departments that responded directly.When it&#39;s national or global scale event, you&#39;re left leaning on whatever slack was in the system. As we&#39;re all painfully aware, there hasn&#39;t been enough. The public health and healthcare systems have been doing heroic work, but if they weren&#39;t stretched so tight in the name of efficiency beforehand, there&#39;d be less need for the heroic efforts.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrimack_Valley_gas_explosion..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;In the marketplace you’re not expected to be aware, you’re expected to be efficient. Efficiency is a quality of machines. Machines are more efficient than human beings. Because efficiency is required, you become more mechanical. And as you become more mechanical, your awareness disappears. And your awareness is your real being. By efficiency and mechanicalness you may succeed in earning more money, more power, more prestige, more respectability, but you will lose yourself.&#34;— Osho"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really love my Bose headphones and in the past year I&#39;ve used them almost exclusively on my Mac.Started running into problems where because I didn&#39;t have visibility on the battery level they would die on me during focused work or meetingsI know there&#39;s some way to get the voice assistant to tell me the battery level but that&#39;s not as useful as being able to glance in the top-right hand corner and having to move from my keyboard to press some buttons I can&#39;t see on my head is a bit silly?So thanks to this repo (https://github.com/Denton-L/based-connect) and the ability to dump Bluetooth logs from Android to Wireshark I was able to figure out how the official Bose app communicates to the headphones not just to get information but also to send commands such as Connecting/Disconnecting paired devices, changing the noise canceling level and media controlIt wasn&#39;t all easy, there&#39;s not great support for Bluetooth in the JS world and I wanted it to be cross-platform one day so Swift was off the table but it turns out to use the SPP protocol on Macos you have to go through the IOBluetooth APIs - Thanks to Pyobjc I was able to call the native Objective-C api&#39;s from Python and thanks to Pybluez I was able to use an interface that was a complete replica of Python&#39;s built-in socketsWould to head some feedback"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Expected a github repo link but instead it&#39;s closed source and it costs $9 and it apparently doesn&#39;t even allow you to set the noise cancellation level. So it&#39;s $9 for an app that has two buttons that send bluetooth packets and it also reads the battery level in some clearly standard way because Android and iOS both show that natively. There&#39;s probably less than a screen worth of code.edit: looking at the tweet[1] it&#39;s an electron app... An electron mac app for $9. Let that sink in.[1] https://twitter.com/DannyAziz97/status/1389482681608679424"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Will this void my warranty or destroy my beloved headphones?
&gt;
&gt; No!
&gt; Boze.app communicates with your headphones in the exact same way that the official Bose Connect app does.I&#39;m not sure how you can know that the protocol is exactly the same without access to Bose&#39;s technical documentation, and extensive testing on all supported models.Furthermore, it would be Bose that decides what constitutes a violation of their warranty, not you.This seems borderline unethical to me."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"My understanding is that the vast majority of these M&amp;A destroy capital. The reason to own dividend stocks is not because they pay dividends but because they don&#39;t have tons of cash lying around to spend on low value projects or M&amp;A.It would be a lot more insightful to discuss the aquisitions that have a known positive impact. The truth is probably that each company had just a few very important acquisitions (that  should be more closely scrutinized).Our current tax laws make vertical integration or even conglomerates more tax efficient. Greater scrutiny of anti-competitive mergers is needed, but we should also make separate companies just as tax efficient (VAT tax, etc) and otherwise closely examine how we can change economic incentives here."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We’ve been developing Observable Plot for a while now, and I’m thrilled to finally have it out in the public. Feel free to ask me any questions! Or share your plots on Observable and I can make suggestions. ;)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As soon as I saw this, I thought: &#39;how is this different from vega lite&#39;.An answer is here:
https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot-vega-liteIt&#39;ll be very interesting to see this develop.  My initial reaction, as a vega-lite user is I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s worth learning the new API immediately.Having said that, I do find the idea of writing transforms in javascript compelling, and I can see there may be some situations in which this is a very elegant solution.I think the idea of a plotting library allowing transforms is initially a little jarring - feels potentially like poor separation of concerns.  But the more I think about it, the more it seems really logical: a lot of transforms (e.g binning) are done only for plotting purposes, in which case keeping them in the visualisation logic makes complete sense.Looking further ahead (not sure this is possible in Plot yet, but giving its integration with Observable I&#39;m sure it will be), the idea of a reactive model where charts can both react to user interactions, but also be the source of inputs (select a range, drag a bar, draw a distribution freehand) is very exciting.Transforms and signals are both possible in vega/vega lite, but I can definitely see the benefit of them being cleaner and being able to accept arbitrary javascript."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m so excited about this release. I use and like Vega-Lite, and this is openly inspired by that.The ideas embedded in Vega-Lite are such good ideas that having an alternative implementation of them - especially with the pedigree of D3 and Observable behind them - is a big win. I can&#39;t wait to see what happens as Vega-Lite and Observable Plot continue to be inspired by each other in the future."</p>
