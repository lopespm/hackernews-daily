								<p class="story__comment_others">"Plan9 and Inferno are shining examples of not being opened early enough. They could conquer the world, but their licences were not open enough at the critical time, and technically inferior but open Linux ate their lunch, along with the dinner."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t understand how the &#34;everything is a file&#34; could apply for everything in practice. For example, Linux has ioctl(), which in practice are like a side channel. Granted, Linux doesn&#39;t apply this API philosophy too thoroughly.I guess the &#34;everything is a file&#34; might have multiple meanings. For example:(1) Everything is represented by a (file) descriptor(2) Same as (1) and the descriptor has a file-like API (think read(), seek(), write(), etc.)(3) Everything is an &#34;byte addressable blob of bytes&#34;Meaning (1) is OK. But it doesn&#39;t tell nothing about the API the (file) descriptor itself would use. It could be a fixed set (like meaning (2)), or be variable depending on something else (like the (file) descriptor type).Meaning (2) looks like too restrictive and inefficient to me and is the one I really have trouble accepting as a general OS primitive.Meaning (3) surely can&#39;t be used for everything in practice, right? It&#39;s just to generic like &#34;every computer architecture can be emulated by a universal turing machine.&#34; And it also seems too inefficient. But it could be very useful if the blob of bytes had an API like (2) or any other, including having an API depending of the &#34;file type&#34;.Is option (3) that folks are meaning when talking about &#34;everything is/should be a file&#34;?EDIT: formatted the meaning list correctly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not dystopian sounding at all:    Please do not name this individual, at all. Doing so may result in your account being banned by the admins.

    Please do not ask further questions about this, as doing so may result in your account being banned by the admins.

    Please do not discuss this incident on Reddit publicly or privately (e.g. on private subreddits and/or in private messages, chat etc.), as doing so may result in your account being banned by the admins.

I fully understand and agree that the platform is privately owned, etc. etc., but this is getting strange(r) -- and quite normalized."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"HN is also penalising threads that discuss this. This post has 74 upvotes in 27 minutes and 11 comments at time of writing. Ordinarily it would significantly outrank most of the other posts on the front page, but it doesn&#39;t seem to be able to break past #15. Either this is because HN users are flagging it, or because something else is going on. As Reddit is a YC company it&#39;d be really nice to hear an explanation.This exact same thing happened with the previous threadshttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26554697andhttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26556187There are some awful transphobic comments in those threads, but they appeared _after_ the threads had been penalised."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The irony is that I almost certainly would have zero idea who this person was or the existence of this controversy were it not for this crackdown.On one hand I can empathize with people seeing someone they know have negative press about them shared on a site they run and wanting to do something. But I thought the point of professionalism was refraining from this kind of behavior and applying rules consistently even when there is a personal connection. This kind of special-case behavior in favor of people with ties to the site is likely counter productive."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wish there was a solution for those of us who develop web interfaces for embedded products designed to live on LAN, often without any internet access and no well defined domain name.I&#39;m all for HTTPS everywhere but right now for my products it&#39;s either: https with self-signed certificate, which basically makes any modern browser tell its user that they&#39;re in a very imminent danger of violent death should they decide to proceed, or just go with good old HTTP but then you hit all sorts of limitations, and obviously zero security.I wish there was a way to opt into a &#34;TOFU&#34; https mode for these use cases (which is how browser dealt with invalid HTTPS certificates for a long time), although I realize that doing that without compromising the security of the internet at large might be tricky.If somebody has a solution, I&#39;m all ears. As far as I can tell the &#34;solution&#34; employed by many IoT vendors is simply to mandate an internet connection and have you access your own LAN devices through the cloud, which is obviously a privacy nightmare. But it&#39;s HTTPS so your browser will display a very reassuring padlock telling you all is fine!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That makes a lot of sense. HTTPS adoption is now very high[1], and this might push it a little bit further for sites that don&#39;t redirect to HTTPS automatically. I&#39;ve been using Firefox in the experimental HTTPS-only mode, and the web is quite usable without cleartext HTTP.[1] https://transparencyreport.google.com/https/overviewIt&#39;s not a big change from security perspective though. HTTP requests shouldn&#39;t be getting cookies any more, and the redirect isn&#39;t revealing anything new (not until we get DoH + ESNI). You still need HSTS preload to defend against active downgrade attacks.An interesting side effect of the change is that sites won&#39;t have have a working HTTP redirect any more. Inevitably, there will be sites that let their HTTP versions rot and break, which will eventually force all other web clients to default to HTTPS for web-compatibility."</p>

Then we&#39;ll be at just:examplewhich is just one step from the final solution which is that no URLs will be needed because the browser will just open up to Amazon who after final approval of their purchase of Google will at that point own not just the internet but the entire world."</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26549307">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is an example of a common antipattern in software: some piece of software fails to correctly implement something (here, modern HTML autocomplete=&#34;cc-exp-year&#34;), and another piece of software goes through all kinds of contortions to work with incorrect or incomplete implementations with the result that it now behaves undesirably with a third piece of software. Specifically, 1Password has to do complicated guesses of what to fill where because many sites don&#39;t set autocomplete properly, so inevitably it will guess wrongly sometimes.Other examples are problems with lock files and file versioning (because programs tried to roll their own when the operating system didn&#39;t provide them), and the complexity of parsing &#34;HTML soup&#34; and emails with all kinds of bizarre invalid syntaxes.I can&#39;t offer a general solution, but if password managers simply refused to autofill to any field other than the one with the matching standard autocomplete attribute, web developers might start doing the right thing. (Do Safari, Chrome and Edge already do this? Only they have the clout to make it happen.) The user could still fill out a text box lacking the standard autocomplete attribute by right-clicking and manually selecting the correct field. Password managers should also get cheaper because their vendors would not need armies of developers adding workarounds for popular sites.Somehow this kind of nonsense has become culturally acceptable in the software industry. If the car industry worked this way you&#39;d have to take your car back to the dealer once a month to be patched to take account of constantly changing fuel formulations. Standards exist for a reason."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had a similar 1Password moment. I was buying airline tickets; entered my name, my wife’s name, address, declined insurance, declined hotel offer, scroll scroll scroll... Then I let 1Password fill in my payment details, which it did perfectly fine. But... what it ALSO did, on a field now well off the top of the screen, was change my wife’s first name to my full name.I caught this when I got the confirmation email. I called the travel website, and they said since it was within 24 hours I could just cancel the tickets for free, or if I liked I could pay an outrageous fee to the airline to change the name on the ticket.  Unsurprisingly I chose the former.So, nor harm done, but if we’d gotten to the airport and my wife couldn’t come on holiday because I didn’t have a ticket for her... could have gone badly. :P"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve put &#34;temporarily&#34; in the title because the post now says the money has been refunded. The article is worth leaving up because, unlike the typical riler-upper, it touches on a phenomenon which is interesting in its own right. But I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to leave up a title that implies that there&#39;s an uncorrected injustice to get angry about. If anyone has a better solution, we can do that instead."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What&#39;s interesting about acquisitions like this is that the actual value that is being transacted is the userbase and their data, along with the inability for either of those to easily move elsewhere.No one wants to buy the actual chat application itself, because they could build equivalent technology on their own. But users are locked into platforms so heavily and for such long time periods that they themselves give the platform almost the entirety of its value (not to single out Discord, since we all know this is how a lot of acquisitions work in practice). [As an additional caveat, I will add that Discord has definitely built something that its users love, and I don&#39;t want to undermine the absurd amount of UI, feature refinement, and scaling work they&#39;ve done successfully. It isn&#39;t negligible, but it is also not &gt;$10B of software engineering.]I&#39;ve read many discussions where someone says something of the form &#34;I wish I didn&#39;t have to use X, but my friends and family all use it, so I&#39;m forced to&#34;, and I think upon consideration of this statement that there is something deeply wrong with the way network effects and protocols function on our Internet such that this can even be a common scenario. We really do have quite a crisis of non-interoperability that generalizes towards a complete lack of user control, be it software, hardware, data, or anything in between.With that said, if Microsoft does purchase Discord, it might not be as bad as some foretell. While we can point to something like Skype as a failure, we can also point to something like Github, which has been doing very well post-acquisition, and in my opinion hasn&#39;t gotten worse at all. It&#39;s quite possible they wouldn&#39;t want to profit off of Discord individually, but rather use it as another tool to expand their general ecosystem horizontally. On the other hand, they could also do the exact opposite and start harvesting data and maximizing advertisements en masse, lest my post become too optimistic in tone, since this is still HN. Lastly, remember that this is still just a rumor that various news outlets have picked up on and is nowhere near guaranteed.For those looking for alternatives due to this, or just because they&#39;d like to own their own data for once, I think Matrix is likely to be the best general solution in this product space, both with respect to similar app functionality as well as quality constraints (real encryption, decentralization, FOSS, etc)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Introducing Microsoft Teams for Gamers, a new platform that empowers gamers to get the best out of their gaming sessions. Game, meet, chat, call, and collaborate in just one place.Discord Meet Now is now available in Windows 10 taskbar so you can meet with a simple click. No sign ups. No downloads required.Would you like to try Discord in the new Microsoft Edge, &#34;the browser recommended by Microsoft&#34;?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Discord would be crazy to not take this deal. They could go public, but they have no clear monetization path to ever reach that valuation.For Microsoft, however, it holds incredible strategic importance to their Xbox division. If suddenly the #1 gaming voice and text chat on PC is fully cross-compatible with Xbox and Xbox services it puts Sony at a huge ecosystem disadvantage. When added to the context of Microsoft&#39;s acquisition of Bethesda and their shift in strategy to Xbox as a service it makes perfect sense."</p>

If you haven&#39;t heard of them before, they&#39;re simple first-person videos where the filmer walks around some area with a stabilized video camera - no talking, just walking. I&#39;ve really missed traveling and watching video walks while exercising has been a great way to satisfy that travel craving a bit and also trick my brain into experiencing some semblance of normalcy (not sure I could remember what a crowded street feels like otherwise haha).I&#39;m partial to Japan so my favorite channel has been Rambalac [1], and I recently also started watching another channel with the very creative name JAPAN 4K [2]. There are tons of other channels and places too, for example I recently watched a few in Lisbon [3] and Seoul [4] and Copenhagen [5]. They&#39;re very relaxing and fun to watch and going from place to place with no cuts captures the usual tourist experience quite well. If you like traveling you can probably find some that are interesting to you![1] https://www.youtube.com/c/Rambalac/videos[2] https://www.youtube.com/user/keikaikeikaikeikai/videos[3] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXlFDpaQ1ec[4] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqj7l0Xk0Ho[5] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl69sN5PtgM"</p>
