								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; What’s your favorite bug and what caused it?&gt; A: It’s probably boring for me to say, but I just can’t beat the drunken cat bug... That was the one where the cats were showing up dead all over the tavern floor, and it turned out they were ingesting spilled alcohol when they cleaned their paws.I think that bug explains very well just how deeply complex Dwarf Fortress really is. Drinks can be spilled. Some drinks have alcohol. If cats step in something it sticks to their paws. Cats clean their paws, causing them to ingest what&#39;s on them. Enough alcohol will kill a cat. Put together: dead drunken cats."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Making the item system polymorphic was ultimately a mistake, but that was a big one.Q: Why was this was a mistake?A: When you declare a class that’s a kind of item, it locks you into that structure much more tightly than if you just have member elements. It’s nice to be able to use virtual functions and that kind of thing, but the tradeoffs are just too much. I started using a “tool” item in the hierarchy, which started to get various functionality, and can now support anything from a stepladder to a beehive to a mortar (and pestle, separately, ha ha), and it just feels more flexible, and I wish every crafted item in the game were under that umbrella.We do a lot of procedural generation, and if we wanted to, say, generate an item that acts partially like one thing and partially like another, it’s just way harder to do that when you are locked down in a class hierarchy.Preach:https://ericlippert.com/2015/04/27/wizards-and-warriors-part...https://ericlippert.com/2015/04/30/wizards-and-warriors-part...https://ericlippert.com/2015/05/04/wizards-and-warriors-part...https://ericlippert.com/2015/05/07/wizards-and-warriors-part...https://ericlippert.com/2015/05/11/wizards-and-warriors-part...I have certainly committed all of these sins, too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"IMO that&#39;s one of the best ways a single programmer can spend his career. No weird requirements, no deadlines, no nothing, nada. Just one&#39;s passion and a product. Whether it is successful is irrelevant.Kudos Mr. Adams for making the achievement and moves gaming history.Going back to the interview, I found this line (and the logic attached) interesting:&gt;Making the item system polymorphic was ultimately a mistake, but that was a big one.&gt;When you declare a class that’s a kind of item, it locks you into that structure much more tightly than if you just have member elements.I guess when the game becomes moderately complex then ECS or something similar suddenly makes a lot sense."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Facebook seems to be censoring so much because Facebook believes that most people will actually believe whatever bits of misinformation are floating around out there.But is everyone that easily manipulated? More importantly, does everyone actually believe that they can be easily manipulated, or do they just think that everyone else is so easily manipulated, but somehow they&#39;re above the fray?And at what point does the censorship to protect me from manipulation become manipulation itself?Facebook is fighting a losing battle if they think they will survive a battle with their own users. This is way past censoring Alex Jones. You can&#39;t possibly censor every crackpot conspiracy theorist. Actually, we&#39;re probably all crackpot conspiracy theorists in some way. We probably all believe some conspiracy about 9/11 or the NSA or elections or vaccines or masks or aliens or royal families or whatever.The rate of censoring is almost certainly accelerating faster than facebook&#39;s growth, and once you&#39;ve been censored once, you&#39;re likely to radically curb your use of that platform. I can&#39;t imagine that FB doesn&#39;t have stats on how many people keep using FB after they&#39;ve been censored just once.FB only works when you and 99% of your social group are on there.And the network effect works in reverse, too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I actually verified this yesterday on my own FB acount.https://imgur.com/a/5tgkbFLNot sure if it&#39;s still happening, but you can test it if you make the post visible to only you and you wait ~5 minutes for that misinformation message to show up.Even if the fact checker had some kind of point, I don&#39;t know how labeling an authoritative source as &#34;false information&#34; helps anyone understand anything just because part of the information might be outdated.Nevertheless, the level of carelessness upon which this mechanism seems to have been built upon is an embarrassment."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"And this is why Facebook has no business being part of fact checking.While it may look different, this is no different than two folks on the phone getting interrupted by ATT and being told they are incorrect on their assumptions about topic X.Social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter are the carrier, and should be treated as such."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I cut my teeth on Diablo, and played Diablo II for probably fifteen years after its release off and on as a way to stay connected with a friend who loved it similarly. More recently, I have consistently played Starcraft II since its release and enjoy a sense of mastery over that game unparalleled by my experience in any other.I haven&#39;t purchased new Blizzard products since the Hong Kong censorship debacle[1] and quit playing Hearthstone at that time. However I had still played some of my other old favorites, reasoning that I was not providing them further financial support. The recent announcements about their terrible, sexist culture had challenged that notion for me, and I was not sure what to do.This news is the straw that breaks my back. That Activision/Blizzard would double down on their despicable behavior and stance in this way is completely beyond the pale, and I for one will never again fire up those games that I loved so much.Thanks for ruining that for me, Blizzard.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blitzchung_controversy"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Steve Jobs quote on why Xerox failed [1] strikes again. The finance people have taken over Acti-Blizzard and they&#39;ve been coasting for 10+ years on their original franchises. All we have is annual CoD releases and Blizzrad coasting on their old properties where Blizzrd hasn&#39;t had a significant original release in 10+ years.This effort seems like it&#39;s part of the ruthless approach to controlling costs that slowly strangle a company from within.I believe WoW is the #2 property (after CoD) at Acti-Blizzard and it&#39;s clearly changed from one of delivering a game to simply extracting as much money as possible from each customer much like how almost all mobile games do.The state of California&#39;s complaint is bad. I mean really bad. The fact that 3-4 different people from AB all released different statements in the last week should tell you exactly how bad it is. That&#39;s classic panic mode. There should only be one.This latest move tells you the company believes it will blow over and they&#39;re looking to do the minimal required to appease the detractors and get back to business as usual without having to pay people more or pay out a bunch of lawsuits.Honestly, the heads of J Allen Brack and Bobby Kotick in particular should roll over this lawsuit.[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlBjNmXvqIMEDIT: commenters have noted (correctly) that I overlooked Overwatch. This was a significant release but it seems to also have waned in popularity and Overwatch 2 is inextricably going in some weird PVE direction.Other than that you have a poor received Diablo sequel, a series of lackluster to bad WoW expansions, a disastrous Warcraft 3 remaster and complete abandonment of the RTS genre that propelled them to success in the first place.WC3 Reforged (&#34;Refunded&#34;) was significant in that it was not only underwhelming and plagued with problems it made the original game worse with a forced download and loss of functionality.The most significant change however was Blizzard not wanting a repeat of missing the MOBA boat with Dota 2 by adding a condition that all the IP for third-party maps belong to Blizzard, completely killing that ecosystem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Clickbait title for a highly opinonated piece that would never see the light of day in a respectable publication like the Washington Post, WSJ, NYT, Economist, etc. WilmerHale is a well-known top-100 law firm with a long history -- it&#39;s definitely not a &#34;notorious union-busting firm.&#34; I&#39;m flagging this story because it doesn&#39;t belong on the front page of HN, IMHO."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This book was in development while I was working on the core interpreter for the Facebook Horizon visual scripting language. While many things in it are not directly applicable to a VPL, it helped with more robust implementation in at least one area (branching) and overall was a joy to read.

They knowingly and falsely made a claim against the video I recorded, and it got to the point where I had to tell Youtube That I can produce the actual camera and the original footage before they would believe me.

The question is clear, &#34;gimme gimme gimme&#34; is printed to stderr, it&#39;s not expected and we&#39;d like to know why ... but there&#39;s comments like:- &#34;Why does your test script call man where it should fail?&#34;- &#34;why do you need to do a &#39;man -w&#39; every minutes?&#34;I get that there&#39;s a bit of mistrust in some things users report so in some cases we as developers need to be careful to establish the user&#39;s actual intent or whether they&#39;re describing their issue correctly.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"No relation to the link, but does anyone else remember these books?Algebra the Easy Way - https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6781.Algebra_the_Easy_Wa...Trigonometry the Easy Way - https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2077099.Trigonometry_the...Calculus the Easy Way - https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3074478-calculus-the-eas...I read these in 5th grade or so and learned most of middle school and high school math just from those.They&#39;re written as a fantasy novel in which the characters discover the relevant math concepts as part of the story. I know, you&#39;re thinking that&#39;s a silly gimmick and it can&#39;t possibly be any good, but it was actually done quite well. At least until the later parts of Calculus where the situations have to get pretty contrived.Highly recommended, at least for precocious kids who like math and fantasy novels."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Speaking of books about calculus, I like Robert Strichartz&#39;s The Way of Analysis. Robert develops intuition and motivation of key concepts in an amazingly detailed way. He often starts with an intuitive but flawed idea, and then gradually revises the idea to a mature definition or proof. The whole book focuses on &#34;why&#34;: why real numbers are defined that way, why limit uses the delta-epsilon notation, why we need to topology, etc and etc. Reading the book is more like an adventure than following a set path. The author explains his approach eloquently: &#34;Mathematics is more than a collection of theorems, definitions, problems and techniques; it is a way of thought....My goal in writing this book is to communicate the mathematical ideas of the subject to the reader. I have tried to be generous with explanations....I believe that what you learn through a process of struggle is more likely to stick with you than what you learn without effort....Understanding mathematics is a complex process. It involves not only following the details of an argument and verifying its correctness, but seeing the overall strategy of the argument, the role played by every hypothesis, and understanding how different theorems and definitions fit together to create the whole. It is a long-term process; in a sense, you cannot appreciate the significance of the first theorem until you have learned the last theorem.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When learning Calc, I always appreciated anyone who could teach the main points without slipping into formal textbook descriptions and terminology. The more advanced one gets in Math, (eg, your teacher or professor with an advanced Math degree), the more they tend to do it, even of they try not to.I like this text - reminds me of &#34;the complete idiot&#39;s guide to calculus&#34; which I used as a companion to my Calc textbook (Stewart) when learning. Not sure I would have faired as well without it.https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Idiots-Guide-Calculus/dp/002...It gives a great and sometimes humorous understanding, which formed a nice framework when I moved on to Vector Calc, Differential Equations, etc later on. At that point in your math career, you can&#39;t (or shouldn&#39;t try to) rely on mindless algorithms/processes to solve problems like you may have in high school. You&#39;ve got to understand what you&#39;re doing.Ps, I doubt many on HN really needed to hear that, but it may be a useful note for somebody."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a VIM-only dev, spend all my day in a Tmux session, and I use the command-line probably a lot more than average.The single best improvement to my command-line workflow I&#39;ve done in the last few years has been switching shells. First I moved from Bash to ZSH, but about 2 years ago I switched again to Fish.Why I love it:
- history completion searches by default, so I can just type part of a command, hit arrow-up and look through only the relevant results (ZSH also did this, but Fish is better)- tab completions are shown to you in advance (in light gray in front of your cursor)- Basic configuration (which is good enough, honestly) can be done via a web browser. Just run &#34;fish_config&#34;, and it starts a web server, pops open your browser and any changes you make there are saved to your actual config files. No more looking up syntax.- aliases (which are called abbreviations) are actually expanded after typing, so the full command appears in your history. You can also edit the full command before running it, if you need."</p>

The question is can we eliminate the network?Now that computers in a LAN/WAN barely &#39;talk&#39; to each other, and the apps are rarely on the same network as the users&#39; computers, is there enough value in networking the computers relative to the risk of creating a valuable target for attackers?Consider for example what the business case for attackers would look like if their target was an island of one.Of course networks have benefits such as simpler ways for IT or MSPs to manage devices and updates, shared auth structures, directories and policies, etc.  If we look at all those benefits, and consider the alternatives, are they worth the risk of a network in today&#39;s topologies with today&#39;s threat vectors?"</p>
