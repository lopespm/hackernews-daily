								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"  &gt; I try to hide my real name whenever possible, out of an
  &gt; abundance of caution. You can still find it if you search
  &gt; carefully, but in today&#39;s hostile internet I see this kind
  &gt; of soft pseudonymity as my digital personal space, and expect
  &gt; to have it respected.

Without judging whether the goal is good or not, I will gently point out that your current approach doesn&#39;t seem to be effective. A Google search for &#34;BoppreH&#34; turned up several results on the first page with what appears to be your full name, along with other results linking to various emails that have been associated with that name. Results include Github commits, mailing list archives, and third-party code that cited your Github account as &#34;work by $NAME&#34;.As a purely practical matter -- again, not going into whether this is how things should be, merely how they do be -- it is futile to want the internet as a whole to have a concept of privacy, or to respect the concept of a &#34;digital personal space&#34;. If your phone number or other PII has ever been associated with your identity, that association will be in place indefinitely and is probably available on multiple data broker sites.The best way to be anonymous on the internet is to be anonymous, which means posting without any name or identifier at all. If that isn&#39;t practical, then using a non-meaningful pseudonym and not posting anything personally identifiable is recommended."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting how everyone says „But I can google you“ instead of thinking about the issue.Companies are building and selling GPT-3 with 6 billion parameters and one of those „parameters“ seems to be OP‘s username and his „strange“ two word last name.If models grow bigger, they will potentially contain personal information about everyone of us.If you can get yourself removed from search indices, shouldn’t there be a way for AI models, too?Another thought: do we need new licenses (GPL, MIT, etc.) which disallow the use for (for-profit) AI training?"</p>

How might we address this with a GPT3 like model?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article buries its lede, which is about how honey bees get all the attention but are at less risk than wild bees:&gt; And that brings us to the actual problem. The honey bee (Apis mellifera) is only one of about 20 thousand different bee species. The non-honey bees are usually referred to as wild bees, and each location has its native species. According to an estimate from researchers at Cornell University in 2006, wild bees contribute to the pollination of 85 percent of crops in agriculture.&#34;&gt; [...]&gt; But last year the magazine Cell published the results of a study with a global estimate for the situation of wild bees. The authors looked at the numbers of bee species that were collected or observed over time using data publicly available at the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. They found that even though the number of records has been increasing, the number of different species in the records has been sharply decreasing in the past decades.&gt; The decline rates differ between the continents, but the species numbers are dropping steeply everywhere except for Oceania. The researchers say there’s a number of factors in play here, such as the expansion of monocultures, loss of native habitat, pesticides, climate change, and bee trade that also trades around pathogens.&gt; So the problems that wild bees face are similar to those of honey bees, but they have an additional problem which is… honeybees. Honey bees compete with wild bees for food and habitat and they also pass on viruses. Now, a big honey bee colony can deal with viruses by throwing out the infected bees. But this doesn’t work for wild bees because they don’t live in large colonies. And worse, when honey bees and wild bees fight for food they seem to both lose out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"(1) Stop using neonicotinoid pesticides. There are plenty of alternatives for protecting food crops from insect infestations, such as neem oil applied as a foliar spray or a soil soak in response to infestations.  Neonictoninoides are based on the tobacco nicotine molecule structure, but are typically chlorinated and modified to make them more persistent and toxic to insects relative to animals.  There&#39;s a good argument for banning the entire class due to their persistent ecological effects on beneficial native insect populations.https://organic-center.org/research/neonicotinoid-pesticides...(2) Have undisturbed habitat set aside for wild bee populations.  This can be something as simple as maintaining undisturbed hedgerows on the sides of agricultural fields, but in general means maintaining a fair amount of undisturbed native habitat.https://www.planetbee.org/planet-bee-blog//native-bee-series..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I appreciate that she draws the link between monoculture crops, land use, and the health of ecosystems upon which agriculture depends.Organics are important not because GMOs are the enemy but rather because the land use change is inherently bad for all life in that area. GMOs don&#39;t have to lead to monoculture crops that span acres or rampant neonicotinoid insecticides, but they often do, and it&#39;s precisely at that point we can see drastic changes in a biome&#39;s stability and therefore the health of bees among many other pollinators. That&#39;s why we need to be talking about insect numbers at large and not only bees.The study of biodiversity has an extremely difficult time modeling these kinds of changes, and that&#39;s probably why many scientists won&#39;t go to bat against this kind of land use change. A self-respecting scientist won&#39;t say that converting croplands to monocultures ready for insecticide use lead to biodiversity die-off because it&#39;s hard to actually track the fluctuations between species. It takes so much time to collect data to analyze before we even get an inkling of the interplay. We understand so little about the microscale interactions and how it fits into our larger understanding of agriculture and land development.For those who think this is all overblown and alarmist, go sit on the grass -- if you can find a patch -- and stare at a spot until it comes alive. Things are moving around and teeming with a multitude of species of plants and insects. The reality you see escapes unnoticed until you stop to think about the ecological systems that underpin our fragile existence. Our health depends on a functional biosphere. If we cannot figure out how to share the earth with its other inhabitants, what the fuck are we doing going to Mars?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;The main difference between what Ridley views this all in terms of and what I view it all in terms of is as follows. To me, the replicants (or androids, if you will) are deplorable because [inaudible] they are cold, they are selfish, they are heartless, they are completely self-centered, they have no empathy, they don&#39;t care about what happens to other creatures, and to me this is essentially a less-than-human entity for that reason. Now, Ridley said that he regarded them as supermen who couldn&#39;t fly. He said they are smarter than humans, they are stronger than humans, and they have faster reflexes than humans. Well, then I said &#39;well, gee Ridley, I mean, holy smokes, uh, golly,&#39; and that was about all I could think of to say, you know. That&#39;s rather a great divergence, you see: we&#39;ve gone from somebody who is a simulation of the authentic human to somebody who is literally superior to the authentic human. So we&#39;ve now flipped all the cards on the table, you see, when we do that: in other words, all the cards that were up are now down and all the ones that were down are now up. And I was at a loss at that point, you know, to respond, I mean. I said, &#39;okay, now the theme of the book is that Rick Deckard is dehumanized in his job of tracking down the replicants and killing them, that in other words he winds up essentially like they are.&#39; And Ridley said that he regarded that as an intellectual idea and he was not interested in making an esoteric film.&#34;-- Philip K. Dick, interview with Paul M. Sammon (https://invidious.snopyta.org/watch?v=3d7XMnmPgUk starting at 19:10)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hated that movie the first to I saw it.  I was bored with it.Now I love it.  I really enjoy how much time they spend establishing the atmosphere and characters.    It all feels very real and has depth.I loath the speedy sci fi that tries to touch on atmosphere and then hurries along with their paper characters and so on.  So much sci fi I encounter now feels little more than a long trailer with no idea how to end."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Tech writer here.The absolute, invariable first rule in tech writing is to know your audience.Understand not just their technical problems but take the time to empathize with why they have these problems in the first place.Tech writing isn&#39;t about documenting, it&#39;s about finding the best way to explain something to people so they can solve their problems.Oh, and use an editor (the human kind, not the digital kind.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lots of great advice here. One piece of advice I got from my publisher when authoring a technical book was to first break down what I was going write into headings and subheadings, and if possible, into sub-subheadings. Then review that to see if your flow is coherent and whether there are sections that are missing, or could be extracted into another text.Personally, my process after this is to express my thoughts in bullet points, followed by inserting any placeholders and captions for any graphics (e.g. charts or diagrams), and then finally I start rewriting my bullet points into proper sentences, expanding my examples, and adding any interstitial text necessary to make things flow.Also, I see some comments on keeping things short and to the point. In general, I agree with this, but depending on the medium, sometimes it doesn’t hurt to inject a bit of personality into your writing. Technical writing can be dry at times, and this can deter engagement. Try to use concrete examples whenever possible or refer to other supporting texts."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If anyone is interested, after firefox send shutdown, i wrote https://www.relaysecret.com, its footprint is extremely small (1 lambda function that does all signing for s3 upload/download, simple frontend code that does encryption in browser using web crypto api with no 3rd party Js, no 3rd party css, no tracking. Anchor tag is used for additional random key material (so it wont leave ya browser and files will always be encrypted regardless).You can roll your own too with the terraform code in it. It costs me barely anything (never go over free tier limit) to run it because files never live more than 10 days (there is a catchall lifecycle rule on the bucket) and when users select durations, i also put them in bucket prefix that has lifecycle rule place on objects under them for that duration. Note that we can&#39;t rely on lifecycle rule all the time so i also make sure when lambda is called to access the object, it checks the time-stamp, the duration and if it is meant to expire and not yet cleaned up by s3 - lambda function deletes it.I learnt a ton of cool things about s3 after this neat little project and really dig the API, the lifecycle rule, signing url etc...Ps: for these type of tool, you should definitely mitm it to see if plaintext file or password ever leave the browser... Relaysecret does leave one item unencrypted and that is the file name. You can change it upon upload but i like to leave it there so people know what they are downloading. I have simple idea of encrypting that with just the anchor key but haven&#39;t gotten around to put that in yet."</p>

Last I heard, Firefox Send was shut down due to malware/etc moderation issues.https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/what-happened-firefox-s...&gt; Firefox Send has been discontinued as of September 17th, 2020. You will no longer be able to upload or receive files. We’d like to thank all of you who tried Firefox Send.&gt; We started Firefox Send as a way for you to share files safely and easily from any browser. Unfortunately, some abusive users were beginning to use Firefox Send to ship malware and conduct phishing attacks. When this problem was reported, we stopped the service.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Even if Google was an absolute saint without a trillion-dollar ad business, there&#39;s still a problem of &#34;bug-compatibility&#34;.Without a second browser engine to test pages in, it&#39;s really hard to know what is a bug and what is intentional. Devs don&#39;t know all the specs by heart. They write whatever happens to work for them, but sometimes they accidentally depend on obscure edge cases in the implementation that were never meant to exist.In the long term it&#39;s paralysing for the engine maintainers, because any change in implementation could be changing some subtle behavior that breaks some pages. W3C requires two independent implementations, so that they&#39;ll share intentional behaviors, but hopefully their bugs will differ.The single-engine Web will be as fun to maintain as Windows: Windows 11 Explorer has a shiny new context menu with an option to reopen it as an older, uglier context menu, because Microsoft couldn&#39;t touch a line of code of the old context menu without breaking apps."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The chromium-only web is not google’s fault. It is a symptom of a body of web standards that has grown wild to the point of being all but unimplementable.Building a browser for the modern standards-based web is effectively impossible, because it costs too much, takes too long, and requires a standing army to keep up with.We are at an impasse. The standards cannot be deprecated because they are used all over the web, and because they are used all over the web a new browser maker has little choice except forking chromium or firefox. Even microsoft couldn’t afford to keep adding all the standards to their browser engine. Normally the solution for a messy overgrown implementation is a grand reboot. But we can’t do a grand reboot of the web because we cannot get rid of the legacy. The only viable strategy I see to have real browser engine diversity without giving up on compatibility is moving as much of the standards implementation as possible into JS modules, so new browser makers can start with a small engine that loads the publicly hosted  standards modules."</p>

It pretty much comes down to &#34;if Apple were forced to open their platform, they would spend money improving Safari, and user&#39;s wouldn&#39;t switch because Apple has a gorillian dollars&#34;. The author seems to ignore that Google also has a gorillian dollars, plus the added inertia of Chromium itself, plus the pervasive network of Search and YouTube that would shove ads for Chrome down the throats of users. Money alone, even billions, cannot create a competitive browser engine. Microsoft tried. I&#39;m not sure that, if you actually cared about browser diversity, that forcing Apple to open up iOS and then hoping they don&#39;t mismanage Safari trying to compete with Chrome is a losing bet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To me, I felt this take was so disconnected from my reality as a user that I didn&#39;t even know where to start.Looking at the author bio, I can see he&#39;s very invested in the Blink project so it&#39;s difficult to shake the feeling that by arguing for &#34;browser diversity&#34;, he&#39;s simply pushing for increased Blink dominance.If one truly wanted to get more diversity in the Browser space, the number one objective should be getting Google to divest from the Chrome project. This would finally create space for other players to come in and have real influence over the future of the web.As it is today, everything Web-related gravitates around what Google wants. Apple is not playing ball, and so Google is getting the community to push regulators to intervene and make them kneel.Well, that&#39;s my view at least, maybe I&#39;m too cynical."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It’s not just WebKit. Devs can’t extent WebKit very much. Orion is trying but they’ve barely gotten anything done on the iOS extension side. There are limitations on what you can do by linking into the iOS web browser API, it seems.I recently switched to Mac with  great success. So I decided to try out the iPhone. I hadn’t used one for years and I was sick of Android.I’m still no great fan of Android. And so many little things are better on iOS.However, the SINGLE BIGGEST THING is absolutely broken. Browsing on iOS is unusable if you’re used to uBlock Origin. I can run that on Fennec/Firefox. I cannot do so on iOS. I was hoping the content blockers and extensions might come close. They do not in any way.I don’t even REALLY like FF and I don’t like Android but those are the options if I want browsing that doesn’t suck.Or maybe I’m missing something and someone can enlighten me before I return the iPhone."</p>
