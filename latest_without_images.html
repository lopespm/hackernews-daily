But what about plain old, honest to God payment? Couldn&#39;t they just put a paragraph of text on the site, &#34;Hey folks, I&#39;m worried about hosting costs, if you find this page useful, please [Donate]&#34;, with a button redirecting to Paypal or Stripe or whatever, collect the money and declare it as donations on the IRS form? Why try all these convoluted schemes, instead of giving a straightforward way for people to tip?They had 50 million views. If 0.01% of these visitors left a dollar, the author would&#39;ve still come up way ahead over all the crazy schemes, even post-tax."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; These reports aren’t just limited to the products you recommend — if someone buys anything within a 24 hour period of clicking your link, you can see, and you get commission.Anyone else find this a pretty gross violation of privacy on Amazon’s part? Why should your unrelated purchases be disclosed to affiliates just because you clicked an affiliate link for whatever reason? Let’s say the affiliate website use accounts or know the identities of users through another channel, and track outbound clicks. With few enough clicks, they can exactly correlate your unrelated purchases with you, if I understand this correctly. In fact it seems you can easily prank unsuspecting acquaintances this way.To be clear, I have no problem with affiliates getting commission on random stuff.Edit: I can also see why the data could be valuable to marketers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great article - funny &amp; interesting :)Question about &#34;Ads/advertisements&#34; (I&#39;m totally clueless about how they work):Does anybody have a link pointing to some kind of overview from the point of view of a website owner?   (e.g. list of different providers, amounts paid by views/clicks, which informations are/can be exchanged with them to provide for example an ad in the same context of what the website is showing, etc...?)Personally as a user, I would not be against ads if they would be normal ones like in a newspaper/magazine, but many show full-fledged small&amp;big animations =&gt; I get angry when I see my CPU usage at 100%/my fan spinning up/my battery depleting while reading on such a page, which is the main if not the only reason why I block them (I might even be interested in them, but they screw up my PC/notebook) =&gt; as a website owner do you have control on what kind of ads you want to show (technically speaking - like &#34;animated&#34; vs. &#34;static&#34;, with how many fps, etc...)?"</p>

Our whole team used to play what-if games about replacing the thing while massive code dumps came in from vendors, making the task ever larger.Zach, if you&#39;re reading this, HUGE kudos to holding the line in replacing that, and double kudos for doing it in a verifiable, sane language!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is great news. Hopefully it fixes a lot of the jank that I&#39;ve always experienced with Android Bluetooth. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever had a smooth experience - even with a supposedly flagship device (Pixel 4a!) I&#39;ve encountered all of the following problems:* Devices getting stuck at max volume (thankfully not headphones)* Devices getting stuck at really low volumes* Devices randomly switching between absolute volume and relative volume (not really sure how to describe this, but sometimes changing the volume on the phone changes the volume on the receiver, and sometimes it changes the mix volume on the phone only (like an aux output would behave) and keeps the volume on the receiver)* Needing to enable Developer Settings to change the Bluetooth protocol version and other wacky stuff that I just shouldn&#39;t have to do [0]* Headphones cutting in and out when exercising, like the phone can&#39;t figure out it needs to stay in the higher of two radio power profiles that it&#39;s switching between, as the receiving antenna on my workout band moves 2-3 inches away from the phone and back again[0]: https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/8hbcuu/the_100...Bluetooth has been awful on Android for a long time. I&#39;ve never not had to futz with it to get it to work. I hope this is a move toward making it as seamless as it should be.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This was, what, 2012? Asana IPO&#39;d last year and still wasn&#39;t profitable[0]. In fact, they were bleeding vast amounts of cash and went public with the statement:We do not expect to become profitable in the near future, may never achieve profitability, and have incurred substantial net operating losses, or NOLs, during our history.This is the price of cheap money. VC-backed competitors can simply outspend a bootstrapped company on customer acquisition, marketing, development and hiring, and cash out without the company ever actually making a profit.In the current environment, a bootstrapped company should ideally be:
(a) niche (and therefore outside the traditional VC market crosshairs)
(b) profitable from day one.A to-do list doesn&#39;t fit that mould at all, which this guy found out the hard way.[0] https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-20-228462/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It doesn’t sound like he was on the bootstrapping koolaid as much as he thinks he was. Dude just vc’d his own company.So his first conclusion doesn’t fit. You can’t play the vc game, get out vc’d, then conclude that bootstrapped can’t compete. Well I guess you can, but you shouldn’t!It’s entirely possible there were enough people who liked Flow and didn’t need mobile and native apps for Flow to have been the Basecamp of his dreams. We/he don’t know because he didn’t try for it.Edit: looks like he’s a vc now. Can’t help but wonder if instead of horribly misinterpreting his own story, he’s intentionally misrepresenting the conclusion. Frighten bootstrappers in to getting in touch to sell or take on funding."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For fast iteration with pipes, using only basic unix tools, and arguably less risky to fat-fingering, I write it in a file, and use watch -n1.

      local msg=${1:-plog}
      tee &gt;(sed -e &#34;s/^/[$msg] /&#34; | cat 1&gt;&amp;2 )

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; March 2021, Apple reportedly agrees to preinstall Russian softwareWait, this regulation is a result of an antitrust case against Google and Apple started by Yandex, as both were using their platforms against their direct competitor. The same thing that many people want to see in EU and US. Clearly it doesn&#39;t belong to the list and the author did zero research on this, but included anyway because it fits the bad guy narrative they are trying to push.What&#39;s even funnier is that Apple threatened to withdraw from the russian market rather than having to do this, so the question is who&#39;s the real bad guy here (how about &#34;a tech giant threatens an unimportant country to be able to bully domestic competitors&#34;?). I guess everybody is horrible in this story, because the government had to compromise and omit the requirement to be able to uninstall this software, and they also included many companies who were large enough to be able to lobby their interests, because obviously they didn&#39;t want to make a single company special. Now Samsung reportedly has a backdoor deal with Yandex to install their software as system on Samsung phones, so it&#39;s being shoved down customers&#39; throats. Nice."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s easy to pick on Apple, when you don&#39;t know the history of these political issues. Not picking on Red Hat, but because I know this from the first hand it was 18 years ago that they removed the Taiwanese flag from KDE3 control center: https://redhat-list.redhat.narkive.com/b3p8HQaa/bug-70235Apple is not a government, it&#39;s a business. They&#39;ll either have to obey the local laws or they&#39;ll lose business.While we are here, checkout how Google Maps handles these issues: https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/02/14/google-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"With the App Store, Apple’s really brought this problem upon themselves whether they agree with what they are told to do or not. Any sort of centralized distribution mechanism is always going to be the first thing an authoritarian government targets when trying to take down content they don’t like. On iPhone it’s even worse because the App Store is not only a centralized distribution mechanism but the only distribution mechanism. If you want something gone, you can just force Apple and that’s that for iPhone."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"When you first become eligible for Medicare you get a special &#39;Introduction to Medicare&#39; appointment with your doctor.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"For non-US folks who need a translation here -In the US, we have a nationwide public healthcare system called “Medicare”. You generally only qualify for Medicare once you’re 65 except in special circumstances. Many of our citizens can’t afford to be diagnosed with cancer at an earlier age, as it will increase their non-Medicare private insurance premiums^, result in denied coverage for unrelated issues, and potentially send them into bankruptcy if treated. So they wait until they turn 65, and only then bring in pre-existing conditions for diagnosis and treatment, confident that they can no longer be bankrupted by doing so.^ Insurance premiums average $300-$700 USD per month per person nationwide, when not available through full-time employment or (65+) Medicare. ~75.000.000 US citizens age 18-64 are employed full-time, which compels their employers to subsidize their monthly health insurance costs; the remaining ~127.000.000 citizens are not employed full-time and thus do not qualify for mandatory employer-provided insurance.EDIT - Military veterans, poor people, and so on often have access to additional free public health systems other than Medicare, offered either nationwide or by member states of our union or by non-governmental organizations; degree of subsidy and quality of coverage varies wildly among them.# The above estimates were constructed using napkin math and the below links.“Average Monthly Benchmark Plan Premiums for a 27-Year-Old in Plan Year 2020 in Healthcare.gov States” https://www.investopedia.com/how-much-does-health-insurance-...&#34;Population estimates&#34;: https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US&#34;The U.S. labor force&#34;: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_force_in_the_United_Stat..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This seems rather user-hostile. The downvote count is useful for identifying videos that aren&#39;t what they claim to be.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Title is misleading. YouTube is testing removing the ability for viewers to see the dislikes. Video owners can still see the dislikes.I am skeptical about this design change fixing the stated concern, which is creator &#34;well-being&#34;. If good faith creators can still see the dislike count, they will still feel miserable. Anyway, if you are putting yourself out there, other people taking a dump on you is part of the deal, because other people... you know, exist. If creator well-being is a concern, Google should focus on preventing or minimising actual harassment campaigns instead of these minimal design changes.The design change also assumes that all creators are good faith actors whose well-being ought to be managed, which is impossibly idealistic. If there is a way for bad faith actors to benefit at the cost of good faith actors, they will exploit that, and the good faith actors will lose ground over the long term.It also ignores that dislikes can be given for many reasons, hiding valuable screening information from the viewer. It should not be up to Google to hide this info and finesse their recommendation engine behind the scenes to serve relevant videos. Google would optimize for views, not the content in the video."</p>

The omnipotence of the Mossad and NSA etc is limited too, and their interest in things is also limited.Basically the attack vector from them is polluting the Tor nodes (so that they control enough of them to understand information), timing attacks on onion services to figure out locations of people accessing the hidden services solely within in Tor, as well as undeclared exploits, and feeding local law enforcement around the globe the information about you.But 9 out of 10 things you could possibly even do are not things that would have them bother with you, although it is accurate that over time you begin to have a problem if you are really trying to stay both private and anonymous and are doing criminal violations (distinct from civil violations).
