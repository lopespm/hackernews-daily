								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Even better, if you&#39;ve been bamboozled onto an annual Teams plan, you get a weird single 30-day window at your renewal period to change your license/seat count downward without penalty. Otherwise, you&#39;re just perpetually on the hook for the full number of licenses contracted.And the Twitter thread that shows someone&#39;s chat experience with canceling is the exact sort of 25 minutes in support agent hell it appears to be.It&#39;s complete madness."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For anyone stuck in this dark pattern here is a trick I&#39;ve used in the past:Adobe won&#39;t let you cancel without paying the remainder of your subscription fee however you can switch to a different plan. As soon as you switch you&#39;ll have the ability to cancel your &#34;new&#34; plan within 14 days. If you cancel after 14 days they&#39;ll charge you the early termination fee."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just yesterday, on a local streaming platform that has a series that I want to watch I was offered &#34;7 days free&#34;. Great, I can watch the accumulated episodes and if I still feel like watching the new ones that come weekly I can keep the subscription, right?Nope, the &#34;7 days free&#34; wasn&#39;t a a trail but 7 extra days when you purchase a full year subscription. I was considering to get a monthly subscription to try it out but since they tried to trick me into a yearly one I simply decide to Torrent the crap out of their content. Sorry not sorry.That&#39;s one of the things that&#39;s great about Apple&#39;s iAP and Apple being the handler of transactions. There&#39;s no tricks, it&#39;s standart on every app: If there&#39;s a trail period you get the trail and if not you directly start paying.  Also no tricks in the cancelation process, it&#39;s all in one place so you can review and cancel easily. You can also change plans right from the same screen. If somehow you manage to purchase something you don&#39;t want, get refunded easily.I really hope that if Apple is forced into allowing 3rd party payments, we end up getting a standardised interface like the one we have currently on Apple&#39;s platforms but with an option to choose the alternative payment method(in the same screen but a different card or account kind of thing, like choosing a card in Apple Pay)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t really understand why anyone who claims to be a proponent of a free market economy has an issue with a private corporation deciding what type of content they want to broadcast.JR sold his catalog of intellectual property (podcast episodes) of his own free will and was paid very well for it: about $100M from what I can gather. What Spotify chooses to do with it is completely up to them, even if they bought it with the express intention of &#34;burning&#34; it all, i.e. never broadcasting it, that would still not be censorship. That would be nothing but exercising their intellectual property rights, that they paid for, just like buying the rights to a song that you hate to stop that specific recording from ever being played again is within your right, or even negotiating with the artist to never play it again.He signed a &#34;multi-year&#34; exclusive deal (the details are fuzzy, for obvious reasons) which means he sold his trademark and time for money, which is how the market works.Exactly what he sold (NDA, limitations on his speech in his free time etc.) we&#39;ll probably never know, but whoever calls this &#34;censorship&#34; needs a reality check. There exists plenty of proper censorship in the world if you look for it, and this isn&#39;t it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think I speak for the majority of people here.Before the Spotify deal, you would just see couple of Joe Rogan clips on YouTube and you have sat through maybe 3-4 entire podcasts. You don&#39;t care much about MMA or you don&#39;t think comedians are that important/hypeworthy as the JRE fandom would claim.After the Spotify deal you just slowly stopped even seeing the clips because for some reason you just don&#39;t care to search for them and YouTube stopped recommending new clips.You would hear about some hot takes about Joe Rogan vs something but you just don&#39;t find it worthwhile to investigate or frankly having an opinion about them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is bigger than Spotify.Rogan was a proactive person conducting open research into the world around him. When proactive people investigate things and share their findings, it now only takes a few to dislike the findings, fuss, and have the findings removed.To those that support this, I have 4 questions:1. Is disincentivising sharing knowledge really good for the world?2. Is it reasonable to expect 100% of inquiries be 100% accurate on the very first attempt?3. Is it efficient for society to repeat the same research many times since previous investigations are scrubbed from public record?4. Is it healthy for public discourse to be made less diverse and only concern &#39;safe&#39; topics?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"While this bill is strongly opposed by the Internet Society, ACLU, CDT, and EFF, the critiques I&#39;ve read don&#39;t get much into the real &#34;why&#34; behind this legislation continuing to be pushed so forcefully. The pretext is, of course, &#34;protect the children&#34; and more generally law-and-order with a bonus side-helping of &#34;stop those awful social media giants.&#34; While these justifications are (hopefully) obvious misdirection to most, I&#39;d like to see more mainstream discussion about who this bill benefits and why. The legislation &#39;coincidentally&#39; achieves exactly the agenda proposed by the &#34;surveillance state&#34; (ie CIA, NSA, FBI, DHS, law enforcement lobby, state prosecutors, etc). While it doesn&#39;t specifically prohibit public access to encryption, it seeks to create nearly the same effect by making it legally risky for large social media and platform companies to offer end-to-end encryption as a default to law-abiding citizens. It&#39;s no accident that almost every version of the bill creates this exposure to essentially bottomless legal liability for platforms offering secure communications.Frankly, this scares the crap out of me. These people seem incapable of understanding the existential threat to free society and democracy posed by limiting everyone&#39;s ability to communicate private thoughts. While not explicitly outlawing untappable communications, it&#39;s much easier to identify who is choosing to use end-to-end encryption when it&#39;s not the typical default. This will ultimately put all of us who care about secure communications under default suspicion, whether our interest in private comms is a moral ideal, political principle or simply proper technical architecture and data hygiene. In today&#39;s multi-national environment of nation-state, criminal and privateer (NSO etc) threat actors, insecure communications over Internet infrastructure should only be seen as an ill-advised risky behavior or a technical bug."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wow, I thought I would resurrect my HN account for this.I wrote this article a little over a decade ago, when I was still in college, and I knew almost nothing about the world. (I still don&#39;t, but I didn&#39;t then, either) It&#39;s fun to see that it still resonates with people despite the naivety and the slight sense of &#34;I am headed for success&#34; that makes it hard for me to re-read.My initial reflection on the article was that I had fallen off the &#34;do things, tell people&#34; wagon a little bit, having let go of my twitter account and with it much of the easiest path to doing things and telling people. I still work in tech but I haven&#39;t created anything I&#39;m particularly excited about in a good while, so I felt that I was failing my own ideal.Then, of course, I remembered that I hiked all of Ireland&#39;s long-distance trails (https://toughsoles.ie) and have a reasonably successful, if niche, youtube channel (https://youtube.com/toughsoles). Funny that my mindset, especially regarding this article, is so tech-focused that I automatically discount something I&#39;ve been doing for five years.All that said, I&#39;m starting to look for new opportunities in the larger-than-startup space. Shoot me an email at carl@flax.ie and let&#39;s chat."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is actually very good advice from personal experience.The best career results (promotions) I have seen came from people who built a prototype of some sort then evangelized it, even if it wasn’t necessarily a complete product, often just a good prototype.First example: This guy took the Intel Edison and built a pretty cool project and brought it to our maker faire events. He ended up in conversation with the CEO of some company and ended up landing a $500K exec job. Just from building a skateboard hack and trying to tell people about it.Second: I knew a guy who built this neat prototype of a compute service and then did a keynote talk at a Meetup. It didn’t really work as a product but the website was convincing. It was enough to “get bought” by a major tech co and land him a CTO job.Another time I saw a guy leave a FAANG and build a compelling IoT type project in three months. Again, he ended up with a CTO level job after a few months.My take away is if you want an executive job, build something somewhat cool, even as a prototype, and go try to sell it for real. Even if you don’t raise any money or make it work as a business it is often way better than submitting resumes.There is something much more powerful about creating something that generates a lot of engagement and conversation, even if it is only half baked but looks decent and your storytelling is compelling.This isn’t interviewing it’s auditioning."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Alexa… what is &#34;survivorship bias&#34;?Implicit in this argument is that you need to build the right thing and talk to the right people.I&#39;ve been to industry events where I&#39;ve seen people give &#34;career limiting&#34; presentations on something awful they&#39;ve built. And I&#39;ve seen great people stuck in a corner with the worst kind of industry fraudster.Sure, you&#39;ve got to kiss a lot of frogs to meet your prince. But you also have to remmeber that you might end up kissing a poisonous one in the meantime."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"LinkedIn probably has a net benefit for your career by keeping up to date and checking the messages once a week, but I cannot get over the awkwardness of seeing total BS stories and thousands of replies saying &#34;YES! AMEN!&#34;.&#34;I was running late to an interview this morning but stopped to help a man who fell off of his bike and fixed it up for him. Afterwards I bought him a coffee and talked about life. He mentioned how he had to go to work but was touched by meeting me, he said we had a real connection. I go to the interview and guess what! The man was my interviewer! He immediately offered me a job at 1.5m a year plus bonuses and is fast tracking me to become a regional director. Remember to be a nice human #Hashtag #Human #WEAREPEOPLE #ConnectWithMe&#34;It&#39;s just a giant circle jerk."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I never understood why I always got so depressed reading LinkedIn, until I read The Gervais Principle by Venkatesh Rao. And then I saw that LinkedIn consists almost entirely of clueless people talking to other clueless people, and exclusively in posturetalk (these are Rao’s terms - “clueless” means something specific). And if you haven’t read The Gervais Principle, I highly recommend it, although it may bum you out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Maybe it&#39;s me. Maybe I&#39;m just getting old and tired. Maybe I&#39;m just sick of the constant trolling, yelling and generally lots of people trying to out-asshole one another on so, so much of the internet. But I don&#39;t mind LinkedIn. I find the cynicism on display here very sad. Sure, there are plenty of narcissists and vapid people posting on LinkedIn. So? At least they&#39;re posting &#34;inspirational&#34; stuff, and you know what - even if its BS - if the net emotional effect on other people is generally positive - well wtf is wrong with that? The right kind of BS can be inspirational and drive good behaviours (just as the wrong kind can drive terrible behaviours) - I offer as evidence every religion ever.For me, I use LinkedIn as my work memory. I&#39;ve been working since 1987 and have had gigs at so many companies, and worked with so many good people over that time that it&#39;s literally impossible for me to remember my own resume (let alone names and faces). It&#39;s how I stay in touch with the people who move around and may be the one to help me get my next gig.A lot of people on HN often go on about freedom of speech, but it just seems to me that where people are happy to defend asshole&#39;s speech, no matter how terrible, the kind of saccharine, do-gooder, positivity found on LinkedIn gets torn to shreds. Live and let live. If it&#39;s not your cup of tea, please feel free to develop and use an alternative. I&#39;d love to see it. Unless its full of people being total assholes. Then I&#39;ll stick with LinkedIn. And HN."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a recovering perfectionist who has read their fair share of Brene Brown, Steven Pressfield, Seth Godin, Tony Robbins, Anne Lamott, and many more.The best metaphors I&#39;ve read is in Bird by Bird. The author describes two different scenarios.The first is that perfection &amp; progress is much like driving late at night with headlights. You will only be able to see as far as your headlights allow. You might be going through a canyon, on a straight and narrow highway, or going the wrong way. But all you know for certain is what is in front of you.The second is that you have to frame your perfectionism around something. That could be your loved ones, your dreams in life, whatever. If it&#39;s always framed around your past achievements, you&#39;re comparing to the past and not to the future version of what could be. Getting clear on why you&#39;re doing it is very important.I truly believe you can devoid yourself of perfectionism. I&#39;ve gone from being afraid to publish work to the public, to only publishing in the public and shaping my work based on the imperfections being pointed out in my shitty first attempts.Your first attempt will be shitty. Your second attempt will be less shitty. Do this for long enough and you&#39;ll start to get a feel for proficiency and what others see as &#34;perfection&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Mental health issues too often remain untreated among high-achievers who are able to maintain a surface appearance of holding it together.  It&#39;s a good trend that nowadays we feel able to talk more openly about struggles like this.I see myself in this article but for me, the word that was the key to find resources to get better was the broader acronym RNT, &#34;Repetitive negative thoughts&#34;.  Perfectionism themes are one common type of thought for me, but I also have several other categories that don&#39;t fit in that frame.  Two resources I found particularly useful:* https://www.amazon.com/Negative-Thoughts-Workbook-Repetitive... &#34;The Negative Thoughts Workbook&#34; A practical self-help book with chapters to work through each common category of negative thought* https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2672052/ &#34;Constructive and Unconstructive Repetitive Thought&#34; A survey in the clinical literature which I found particularly helpful for identifying the subset of negative thoughts which has been actually helping me.  This helped me ease up on the majority of unhelpful thoughts with greater confidence that I&#39;m still preserving the small subset of my thought pattern which has helped me succeed."</p>

I find myself on this orange site multiple times a day largely for some of the reasons outlined.&gt; She dwells in puddles for fear of the oceanwoah. Beautiful line. Great writing can really make the content more impactful. I find myself regularly absorbed in the minutia of a technology used in a project. I tell myself it&#39;s because I find the subject fascinating and knowing it deeply will make the solution (and me) better (which is partly true), but I often have that thought niggling in the back of my mind, &#34;Am I spending too long on this detail because I&#39;m avoiding tackling the bigger problem because I&#39;m worried I might fail?&#34;.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Seems pretty awful to suggest that the government-managed &#39;no-fly&#39; list should be used for anything after watching how poorly it was used and abused as a security measure. But considering the airlines look to the government to solve their financial problems, it&#39;s no surprise they would look to the government to solve their passenger problems as well. I assume begging for government intervention has become an airline CEO reflex, at this point.Bureaucracy, security theater, and airline/airport ineptitude has turned flying into a painful, regrettable process. Add shrinking seat space and airport and airplane booze to the mix and you&#39;ve got a recipe for stress, discomfort, and short tempers.I suspect booze is actually the primary culprit. I&#39;ve flown a few hundred flights in my time and only witnessed two, rather tame, incidents that caused people to be kicked off flights or caused in-air arguments. In one case the culprit was very drunk. The other case the culprit was very hung over."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this is probably a good idea, but not as an extension of the current no-fly list, which is opaque and lacking accountability.The &#34;disruptive passenger&#34; no-fly list should have clear criteria for why people are put on it and for how long, and a clear process for challenging being incorrectly placed on the list.  Ideally this would be a bit better than having airlines collaborate amongst themselves to create their own no-fly list which can&#39;t be legally challenged because they&#39;re private organizations that can mostly do what they want.  On the other hand, being blacklisted by private companies would in some ways be less creepy/authoritarian than the no-fly lists as they exist now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What is with some of the responses in this thread! I understand some cases are not so clear, but if you do something as blatant as punch a flight attendant in the face I think that’s grounds to be put on such a list. There should be a policy so that after a period (or going through some program) you could then be removed from the list though..It actually blew my mind when I heard that you could assault someone on a plane and not be instantly banned"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Author here.HVM is the ultimate conclusion to years of optimal evaluation research. I&#39;ve been a great enthusiast of optimal runtimes. Until now, though, my most efficient implementation had barely passed 50 million rewrites per second. It did beat GHC in cases where optimality helped, like λ-encoded arithmetic, but in more real-world scenarios, it was still far behind. Thanks to a recent memory layout breakthrough, though, we managed to reach a peak performance of 2.5 billion rewrites per second, on the same machine. That&#39;s a ridiculous 50x improvement.That is enough for it to enjoy roughly the same performance of GHC in normal programs, and even outperform it when automatic parallelism kicks in, if that counts! Of course, there are still cases where it will perform worse (by 2x at most usually, and some weird quadratic cases that should be fixed [see issues]), but remember it is a 1-month prototype versus the largest lazy functional compiler in the market. I&#39;m confident HVM&#39;s current design is able to scale and become the fastest functional runtime in the world, because I believe the optimal algorithm is inherently superior.I&#39;m looking for partners! Check the notes at the end of the repository&#39;s README if you want to get involved."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This looks pretty awesome, and holds much promise for the future.
Optimal beta reduction has always seemed like something of theoretical interest only, but Victor has been working many years on making it more practical, which deserves a lot of respect.&gt; HVM files look like untyped Haskell.Why not make it look exactly like Haskell?
So that every valid Haskell program is automatically a valid Hvm program,
while the reverse need not hold due to hvm being untyped.Instead the syntax looks like a mix of Haskell and Lisp, with parentheses around application, and prefix operators. I prefer the cleaner Haskell syntax.Some of the speedup examples look somewhat artificial:The exponential speedup is on 2^n compositions of the identity function,
which has no practical use. It would be nice to show such a speedup on a nontrivial function.The arithmetical example uses a binary representation, but strangely uses unary implementation of operators, with addition implemented as repeated increment, and multiplication as repeated addition. Why not use binary implementation of operators? Does that not show a good speedup?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Story time! Back around 2008 when we were developing the first version of AWS CloudWatch (which was then code-named &#34;Granite&#34;) we had two problems to solve:1. What should the API for PutMetricData look like?2. Where should we store that data?(you know, minor issues)At the time, we decided that #1 was more critical than #2 (and of course #2 depends deeply on the answer to #1), and that the best way to solve it would be to do some learning-by-prototyping - stand up an internal version of CloudWatch to dogfood with some other Amazon services and be able to go to prospective internal customers with a &#34;working&#34; service that they could kick the tires on, not just some API docs and paper prototypes. So I quickly hacked up an implementation of &#34;GraniteDataStore&#34; called &#34;InMemoryDataStore&#34;, which would store every PutMetricData request in a HashMap and nowhere else.When I sent the code out for peer review, my reviewer was aghast at the idea that we would stand up a service that would knowingly store different copies of the data on every server, and lose it all on process restart. I responded by renaming InMemoryDataStore to FakeInMemoryDataStore, but that wasn&#39;t enough. Finally, we settled on a name of (if memory serves) FakeFakeFakeDataStoreThatLosesAllYourData and that was enough to get my merge approved."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;DO_NOT_USE_OR_YOU_WILL_BE_FIRED&#34; is a running joke at Facebook, used when soft-deprecating a field or method where you can&#39;t immediately get rid of all users. Sometimes it migrates into open source products.It&#39;s iconic enough that Facebook HQ has a conference room by that name."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; A recent improvement was in version 1.17, which passes function arguments and results in registers instead of on the stack. This was a significant improvement for GoAWK’s old tree-walking interpreter, where I saw a 38% increase in speed on one microbenchmark, and a 17% average speedup across all microbenchmarksI find that surprising that Go did not use registers for its (internal) calling convention until 1.17. And I also find it surprising that they only expected a 5% boost from it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;&gt; I’m looking forward to someone improving the performance of Go’s regexp package, which is quite slow.Hah, this reminds me how over several years ago, I rewrote one of my homework from Go to Python, since Go version was so terribly slow because of regex. I really hoped it was better in 2021."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been using go services for my backends for years and I&#39;ve totally fallen in love. I&#39;m always amazed whenever I write something for like an hour, then compile it and it just works. It usually never does."</p>
