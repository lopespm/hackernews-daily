								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One tip I picked up a while back is to be aware of the number of `it`s and other pronouns used. I realized that when my explanation were getting lengthy, I was tempted to avoid duplication by referring to previously mentioned nouns as `it`s, `they`s etc. This practice led to some very confusing sentences, where each `it` meant a different thing.My explanations got noticeably clearer once I started replacing the pronouns with whatever they would refer to instead. Sometimes I also add an additional noun (&#34;this practice&#34;) to make the pronoun clearer.I still overuse pronouns sometimes, but when I want to be extra sure my point gets across, I&#39;m trying to limit them as much as I can."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of this is caused by The Curse of Knowledge:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledgeThat cognitive blind spot causes people to unwittingly write confusing explanations in all domains of life.It&#39;s frequently ironic when somebody writes a sentence following the rhetorical template:  &#34;Not really sure what the confusion is with &lt;X&gt;.   It&#39;s really simple. [blah blah blah...]  And that&#39;s it.&#34;Whether it&#39;s attempting to explain &#34;monads are like a burrito&#34;, or neural networks, Git, or how Federal Reserve works, people unintentionally write circular definitions.E.g.  &#34;Not sure what the issue is... Git is just a DAG directed-acyclic-graph.&#34; &lt;-- yes, in the mind of the author, that explanation is 100% self-explanatory!The only way to avoid the issue is to test your tutorials and explanations on a variety of readers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My long-standing annoyance with software documentation is when people don&#39;t see that tutorials and reference are different things. They may have tutorials as the only documentation available (ahem Ansible cough), or reference as the only documentation. But in fact, the use-cases for those two are different, so effectively they have different audiences. I don&#39;t want to learn a language from a dictionary, and I don&#39;t want to wade through the tutorials when looking for one particular concept."</p>

The parental notification system is just a frontend action (one of many, like link previews and such). What does that have to do with iMessage&#39;s encryption?I can see an argument about a shift away from privacy (though it only pertains to minors under 13 receiving sexually explicit images). But I think it&#39;s misleading to say that it relates to iMessage&#39;s encryption in any way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"With all the news of CSAM going to be scanned on iPhones, which people are even going to keep such content on iPhones anymore? The news of this has been so prominent in the media, people not even in tech have heard about it plenty. If you are a Person of Interest that consumes/distributes such content and are a tad aware of the news, you aren&#39;t going to use iPhones/iCloud storage anymore."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; As we’ve explained in Deeplinks blog posts, Apple’s planned phone-scanning system opens the door to broader abuses. It decreases privacy for all iCloud photo users, and the parental notification system is a shift away from strong end-to-end encryption. It will tempt liberal democratic regimes to increase surveillance, and likely bring even great pressures from regimes that already have online censorship ensconced in law.What’s clear is the potential for future abuse mandated by various gov (though that could easily be the same even without all these CSAM measures.. not a new threat). However, the other things are erroneously lumped in with it. It only weakens privacy for iCloud photos if you have CP or photos in a CP database, and it doesn’t prevent E2E with texting… it just gives an additional parental control in addition to the many numerous parental controls (with them kids have no privacy already), and is totally unrelated to the CSAM effort.I admire the EFF in many ways, but I wish they’d be more exact here given their access to expert knowledge."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Like a family, eh? So let us see who from my office turns up and does my daily groceries, takes care of my kids and cleans my house if/when I am suffering from a sickness - doesn&#39;t even have to be a prolonged case, a few weeks would do. God forbid if it is prolonged - if the law of the land permits, the head of our &#34;family&#34; (a.k.a my boss) would, in varying levels of directness/corporate-speak, let me know what an &#34;incredibly difficult decision&#34; it has been to &#34;part ways&#34; before kicking me out of the firm. You know who are the people I can most expect to be actually there for me? My actual family.I know that all the families are not same and there are instances where one finds colleagues who go to great lengths to support each other while the dysfunctional family actually weighs things down. But that is not the norm (atleast not in the culture I am from). So if people of a firm use terms like &#34;family&#34;, they better back it up. Otherwise, just shut up and give each other the space that grown-ups deserve."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I work at a big corporate and we use a national workplace survey that asks if you have a best friend at the office. It’s one of the measures or organization health.I see the survey  results across a pretty big portion of the organization so I understand my answer is one of the lonely few. I always answer ‘no’ because I really don’t have a best friend at work.A best friend is someone you like, enjoy loads of spending time with and maybe most importantly can trust with just about anything. It happens that I don’t really have true friends at work but I have people I care for and would be there for if they needed. That doesn’t make us friends, it makes us decent people.I try to keep a healthy level of separation between work life and home life. I don’t want to know office gossip because I want to be able to continue looking at my colleagues as professionals. I also want the diversification that should I ever leave the company my whole life won’t be blown up because it was attached to the company."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The workplace described in the article absolutely sounds like a hostile environment. The asker’s bosses are using “family” as an excuse to justify working longer hours. Families don’t do that.That said: Personally, I do want my coworkers and I to be something akin to a family. If I’m going to spend around a third of my life working, I want to do it with a group of people I like and care about."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Though it&#39;s been much lambasted by investors, I think it&#39;s inevitable that the US will begin down the same path China has recently with their tech companies.It&#39;s pretty easy to see that FAANG-esque companies are totally dominant at this point, and have many pseudo-monopolistic elements about them.Beyond specific names, there is a vast difference in both the scale, and the &#34;ecosystem&#34; or &#34;platform&#34; nature in modern software that effectively invalidates the applicability of anti-trust law as it is written.Going even further, many laws protecting private companies likely will change in the coming years to account for different paradigm that software brings. Sometimes difference in scale is also difference in nature.If you look into the aims of a lot of China&#39;s recent regulations, they are actually setup to create a competitive market, rather than have a few tech companies become dominant. Competition is ultimately good for the public, as it leads to lower costs to the consumer, and more incentive to innovate (once entrenched).I don&#39;t suggest we go to the
same extremes, but it&#39;s inevitable we&#39;ll start heading down that path, whether it be the next few years, or decades."</p>

That&#39;s no hypothetical: WeChat, the popular Chinese messaging app, already uses content matching to identify dissident material. India enacted rules this year that could require pre-screening content critical of government policy. Russia recently fined Google, Facebook and Twitter for not removing pro-democracy protest materials.This sums up the concern.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One wonders about the hubris of the folks who approved this part of Prop 22:    After the effective date of this chapter,
    the Legislature may amend this chapter by a statute
    passed in each house of the Legislature by rollcall
    vote entered into the journal, seven-eighths of the
    membership concurring, provided that the statute is
    consistent with, and furthers the purpose of, this
    chapter. 

Prop 22 was intended to be almost impossible to overturn, requiring a higher bar for amendment than even the state constitution, and only permitting the legislature to amend it if the amendment was &#34;consistent with&#34; Prop 22.Regardless of one&#39;s opinion about Prop 22 and AB5, this provision was undemocratic at its core because it deprived future citizens and their representatives of their ability to modify the law."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It took me a few seconds to learn there are two kinds of ballot initiatives in CA.  They can have the force of statutes or constitutional amendments.  Prop 22 was written to be a statute, so of course it couldn&#39;t override the state constitution.  Whoever wrote it made a huge mistake.&#34;Citizens of California may initiate legislation as either a state statute or a constitutional amendment. In California, citizens also have the power to repeal legislation via veto referendum. The California State Legislature may also place measures on the ballot as legislatively referred constitutional amendments or legislatively referred state statutes. Referred amendments require a 2/3 vote of each chamber.&#34; [1]From the article: &#34;it limits the power of a future Legislature to define app-based drivers as workers subject to workers’ compensation law.&#34; That makes the entire ballot measure unenforceable, Roesch said.[1] https://ballotpedia.org/Laws_governing_the_initiative_proces..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Second, there’s the matter of how extensively Robux (Roblox’s in-app currency) are used to navigate the creator economy. Roblox creators are paid first by receiving a cut of Robux that comes from the sale, which they can use to purchase other Roblox experiences, in-game assets, cosmetics, etc. That means once a developer enters the Robux economy, their money is all spent inside the Roblox system until they’re able to withdraw it.
...
But to withdraw it, they need to have raked in roughly $1,000 worth of Robux.This part seems pretty indefensible. Like yeah to a  certain extent all online content platforms have a gate like this, but I&#39;ve never heard of one that high. YouTube e will pay you as soon as you make something like $20 iirc. And the fact that they pay you in their gated currency which they then allow you to spend but only within their system seems like am obvious self-serving money grab."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I read the article but have not watched the video so I may be missing some context.It really depends on how you define “exploiting”. It doesn’t seem like you _need_ to buy the ads. A kid could make a game on any platform and would encounter similar barriers.Would it be better if the kid played Call of Duty rather than creating something? Even if the chance to profit is low does the kid get something else out of Roblox?To my knowledge kids aren’t dropping out of high school with hopes of being a Roblox millionaire. They may dream about it but I don’t think they act on it. I dreamed about being a pro eSports gamer in high school and I’d argue my time was much worse spent doing that."</p>
