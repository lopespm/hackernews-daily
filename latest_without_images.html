								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think we (in the EU) will soon realise the bizarre consequences of these regulations. European startups will not be able to use standard SaaS or PaaS tools (like AWS, Azure, Mailchimp, PayPal etc) if they are based in the US (like most of them are). No cloud services, no Office 365 or Google Workspace.It will take forever to build up a similar ecosystem in Europe and I think most successful European entrepreneurs will just end up starting companies in the US instead.There must be some reasonable middle ground before we fragment and destroy the entire Internet. Why not start by making a general exception for temporary storage of less sensitive data like IP-addresses for  efficiently and cost effectively delivering a web service.If there is one thing they could start looking in to it would be handling of personal information by governmental organisations. I work a little bit with a few municipalities, and the number of documents with deeply personal information that are just emailed around over unencrypted email is shocking."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of this seems to be coming due to US regulations that compel US registered companies to hand over data from subsidiaries in Europe markets if asked by US intelligence and law enforcement agencies.With these various data locality regulations, i wonder if a standard operating approach could be to split tech companies into 3 legal entities, a technology licensing company, a US registered operations company and a Europe registered operations company and hand the shares in all three companies to the current shareholders. This would insulate the Europe entity."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hmm, no JVM or .NET support ... seems problematic for any widescale adoption at this point. Are there fundamental reasons why this is problematic or just not got around to it?(And, is it likely to be possible to build it against standard interfaces like JDBC - or is it too different?)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ll add to the positivity: this is the first time I’ve ever found a “we can do better than SQL” compelling. It’s easy to understand what it’s doing with a variety of known quantities. It solves a difficult problem elegantly. It has 100% overlap with the goals I want it to have. It’s designed to be usable with minimal fuss. It does really a good job of portraying itself as magic (it will be awesome to use) without portraying itself as magic (it explains itself in terms of already knowable tools and how it leverages their strength).I do have a couple minor quibbles:- Serializable transactions are expensive, and that deserves to be an explicit caveat. Not everyone knows this, and it’s an important thing to put up front.- Some of the language in this post are in CAP theorem territory but neglect to directly address that. I’d like to see how client usage compares with direct Postgres usage (idiomatic for each insofar as such a beast exists) in a Call Me Maybe. I know that’s a lot to ask in a 1.0 announcement four years in the making, but I hope it’s a priority to get this in front of Aphyr.Edit: oh and I definitely look forward to this being further distinguished from an ORM, because even though I can see the blue and black dress my mind keeps switching it back to gold and white."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m so happy for you guys, I&#39;m wishing you great success.
Since the first first version of uvloop I&#39;ve been excited about MagicStack and I couldn&#39;t be more excited about EdgeDB since it has the same magical minds behind.Here&#39;s what I think makes EdgeDB special: it&#39;s a DB that replaces the tediousness of ORMs with a better core that can be cross-language / cross-platform.
I&#39;ve implemented tons of APIs, first REST, then GraphQL all of them on top of ORMs (Django, Peewee, SQLAlchemy, Mongoose and more). When prototyping was great, but scaling them became quite challenging, specially if you want to have a performant outcome when retrieving data.EdgeQL is an incredible useful abstraction that will prove itself in a few years.
Long life EdgeQL. Keep up the good work!"</p>

How many of you have actively worked to create systems and technology to invade the screens and speakers of users who wanted nothing of the sort?

								<p class="story__comment_others">"As the underlying Twitter thread points out[1], there&#39;s a significant confounding factor here: the sample is from 2019 but might have been processed in 2020, at which point the Chinese government&#39;s (public) timeline for COVID&#39;s spread admits of the possibility of contamination.I don&#39;t think that completely deflates the evidence here. But as a layperson, I would like to understand the probability of happening to find COVID in an Antarctic soil sample in 2019 versus the probability that someone accidentally contaminated the sample with early samples in early 2020. Put another way: my (lay) intuition doesn&#39;t understand why there would be COVID in Antarctic soil, whereas it does understand how contamination might happen in a lab that was actively processing samples of COVID.[1]: https://twitter.com/jbloom_lab/status/1491297806115807233"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; If it was sequenced in early 2020, it may have been contaminated from experiments carried out by researchers trying to learn more about the emerging virus.That seems like--by far--the most probable explanation.I&#39;m not even sure if it would need to have been researchers studying Covid--it could just   have been that the technician handling the samples was infected and contaminated the samples accidentally, or that the equipment had previously been used with samples unknowingly contaminated with Covid.In fact, that could have been the case even if it was sequenced in December 2019, since Covid was already spreading in the population at that time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What&#39;s incredibly frustrating about the knocks on JavaScript is that it&#39;s not a shortcoming of the language that creates the problems hinted here, but the poorly-considered engineering choices of the popular frameworks.After building my own framework [1] last year, I realized just how disconnected JavaScript developers—yes, the &#34;big boys&#34; are especially off in CS la-la land—were from web development fundamentals. HTTP distilled down to its absolute essence is brilliant, but for some reason gets absolutely ignored in the JS world. When you couple that with websockets for incremental updates (similar to what Chris McCord is doing in Phoenix), it&#39;s insanely powerful. It can be reasonably lightweight, too, if you&#39;re only shipping the JS you need to render the page.That rendering some HTML, CSS, and interactive JS in a browser has been turned into what it has is staggering. Though, not surprising, when you realize a lot of the momentum in JavaScript the last decade or so was perpetuated by venture capital (and the inevitable fast and cheap nature of that world) being pumped into inexperienced teams.[1] https://github.com/cheatcode/joystick"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m surprised this wasn&#39;t about WASM.Either way, I&#39;m receptive to the &#34;LiveView&#34; model, but until such a time a server can deliver both HTML and server driven native UI for mobile interchangeably, I prefer the RPC approach.I don&#39;t want to develop:1. Both an API for mobile and LiveView for web.OR2. Create my own server driven UI paradigm for mobile.I find maintaining one architectural pattern simpler. I do want to support users with the best technology fit, but I don&#39;t see why I have to make this tradeoff. The platform holders are (and always have been) jerking us around.I want to see a LiveView that can deliver both HTML and equivalent native UI markup. This is needed to sell the vision end to end - the world is not just web.I feel like this would enable a more sensible choice:Offline (first)? Use RPC with sync.Online-only? Use the LiveView paradigm and it&#39;ll work with native or web."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Around 15 years ago I needed to build an internal app for my company that would aggregate and display a lot of data. Our backends were all in Java and I had sour taste for JavaScript from a previous project so I looked around for an AJAX framework that would allow me to avoid writing any JavaScript. Lo and Behold there were actually 2 viable ones on the market: Google GWT and Echo2. I played with both of them and Echo2 blew me away. It looked and acted better than anything else on the market at the time. Rich widgets, translucency, works in (almost) any browser, etc. I rolled an app with it. The mechanism of operation was pretty similar to LiveView except WebSockets didn&#39;t exist at the time so it worked by having a super thin JavaScript client that polled the web server on the regular basis. So yeah, a bit chatty but for intranet app I didn&#39;t care much. Everything worked and felt like it was a Java Swing app but in a browser. The app became popular and we started writing extensions to it and adding modules. Then inevitable customization came. &#34;Can we create a widget that does X?&#34; &#34;Ughh let me take a look.&#34;. This is when my nightmare began. Writing a new widget for this thing required putting together some utterly nightmarish JavaScript code and then compiling it together with equally nightmarish piece of Java code. If you had any custom stylesheet you basically were screwed. So roughly 2 years down the road from starting the project I started rewriting it in pure JavaScript and ExtJS (now called Sencha), which was one of the first few juggernaut frameworks for writing SPAs circa 2007-2008. That&#39;s why when things like Blazor and LiveView roll around I get flashbacks akin to post traumatic stress disorder."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;The text content in the third box is longer than the available space, so rather than maintaining the aspect ratio, the element expands vertically to fit the content... If we set an explicit height instead, the element doesn’t expand, but instead we get overflow&#34;Why? Why would you have different default behaviours if you have one of the dimensions set but not the other? Why would you not have this specified in another property, the overflow property perhaps? Oh look, lets define a new property and call it aspect ratio, and then lets ensure it doesn&#39;t maintain an element&#39;s aspect ratio if you have content that is going to overflow if you specify a width. This is what drives me mad about css, it&#39;s gotchas all the way down."</p>

I mean look how well Microsoft Word (native) works compared to Microsoft Teams (some JS hodgepodge). And not just the day by day use, but also stuff like AppleScript support. Especially highlighted by the stand still we used to have on mobile computer CPU&#39;s until recently. Everything just got slower and slower."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; If the page size is too small, rows won’t fit inside the page and if it’s too large there is risk of write failure because hardware generally can only guarantee atomicity for a fixed size blocks which can vary disk to disk (usually ranges from 512 bytes to 4096 bytes).Pretty sure the 8KB page size is not about atomicity. It&#39;s true old storage mostly promised 512B atomicity (AFAIK it depends on operation, but that&#39;s irrelevant here) and we rely on that in some places. But even if it was 4KB, it&#39;s still be just half of 8kB pages. So an 8KB page might still get torn, and we can&#39;t rely on that.The simple truth is that this is a compromise - smaller pages benefit OLTP, larger pages benefit OLAP. And 8kB is somewhere in the middle. That&#39;s all.You can get better performance from e.g. 4KB pages, especially if that aligns with filesystem / SSD pages, etc."</p>
