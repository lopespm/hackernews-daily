								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I found that much of the underlying cause is those mass reporting regex denial of services as being high severity bugs.So many people are reporting these in tons of different projects: https://github.com/search?q=regex+denial+of+service&amp;type=iss...Anyhow it is just annoying and they broke NPM Audit based on these reports.It is good to fix all possible bugs, but many of these are not anywhere close to the level of bad that the reports are making them to be.But maybe this is needed to just get rid of these issues in genera?  So a wave of regex vulnerability reports and then we build this type of checking into prettier or similar and we do not have these in the future?EDIT: It appears there as a project that found 100s of CVE reported Regex vulnerabilities in npm projects -- this is maybe one of the sources of mass reports.  See the bottom of this resume: https://yetingli.github.io"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Honestly, this hit me.I&#39;m not a react developer, I was experimenting with it for a new project. I finished the tic-tac-toe tutorial, then tried to throw bootstrap on top to build from there. It told me there was 97 vulnerabilities (85 moderate, 12 high)...I just deleted the directory and went back to vanilla JS. This is a fun side project, I don&#39;t need that.My tweet about it: https://twitter.com/preinheimer/status/1402785757962592256"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Let&#39;s talk about solutions.
I&#39;m late to the conversation here, responded on Twitter and went to sleep.There&#39;s a push to address the npm audit situation. It&#39;s an initiative under the OpenJS Foundation.
I kinda started the whole conversation by implementing a tool that makes it acceptable instead of ditching npm audit.It&#39;s called npm-audit-resolver and I&#39;ve written about it here 
https://dev.to/naugtur/do-you-need-help-with-your-npm-audit-...Also check out the collab space and the tool itself

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Oh wow, that&#39;s from 8 years ago. And then it got leaked outside of Google 3 years ago it seems -- this article [1] provides a ton more context.Just for context, and before people start accusing Google of hypocrisy or anything -- these slides never represented an official (or unofficial) Google position or anything. They&#39;re not PR. They&#39;re just a single employee&#39;s opinion in slideshow form, an opinion he was trying to build support for internally.Whether you think it made any kind of impact is a fun thought question though.[1] https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/10/17333574/google-android-p..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In the 8 years that have elapsed since this pitch was made at Google, one conclusion is absolutely crystal clear:  the industry has as little self-regulatory control over its use of such dark patterns as the public has over avoiding them.Regulation, taxation, and where necessary, criminalisation, are obvious and necessary.I&#39;ll note that for once, the patterns are not entirely synonymous with massive tech monopolies, though it is the monopolists who have the greatest resources and capability to tune their attention-diverting practices to the absolute maximum degree.The naivete Tristan reveals here is rather charming, however."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For other readers: this seems to be an internal google presentation made public to tell engineers to respect users&#39; attention.I guess as a user of the website it didn&#39;t respect my attention enough to make me want to click through the whole thing. I dropped out after twenty or so clicks, having read less and less stuff after a few slides."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Oh dear. After reading the notes in the study itself about the scale this was done at, scaling up might be an issue:&gt; A typical H₂O₂ synthesis reaction was carried out using 120 mg of 1% AuPd/TiO₂ [...] The reactor system was then pressurized, typically to 10 bar. The reactor was then cooled by a water bath to 2 °C. When the reactor had reached the required pressure and the flow through the system had stabilized, the solvent (H²O, HPLC grade), typically at a flow of 0.2 ml min¯¹, was introduced into the system.Oh hey, 0.2 mL/min of water. In Virginia, the lowest flow cutoff for waterworks is 0.5 MGD (or 5000 people), the border between Class 3 and Class 4. That flow rate is 6.5 million times that done in the tests here. The large water treatment plant I worked at is another 400 times that, and there are plants that would be another 5 or 6 times that. So the necessary scaling factor is going to be measured in the billions.So what about those reagants? This uses about 0.6 mg of gold to process 0.2 mL/min of water (if I&#39;m reading the notation of 1% AuPd/TiO₂ correctly). Scale that to our small plant, and that&#39;s about $225,000 of gold and $350,000 of palladium. Go to the scale I worked at, and that&#39;s $190 million of catalyst in terms of raw metal worth alone. That&#39;s comparable to the cost of a regular treatment plant of that scale--just on the catalyst. This assumes that there&#39;s a neat linear scaling, which I doubt is going to be the case (square-cube law!)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Anytime you read things like 100,000,000 times more effective - you should be asking, what was the numerator or denominator in this. Or are they just describing some tiny part of the system.For example, normally you need to filter, do settling for sediment etc - how did they solve all this?Given the orders of magnitude involved here a 5 MGD plant could produce 500 trillion gallons per day of &#34;commercial approach&#34; water cleaning. The water handling issues alone in doing 500 trillion GPD seem large. Am I missing something?"</p>

It&#39;s not all about privacy or data security.&#34;In addition to the clear privacy issues caused by surveillance-based advertising, it is also detrimental to the business landscape.&#34;&#34;In the surveillance-based advertising model, a few actors can obtain competitive advantages by collecting data from across websites and services and dominant platform actors can abuse their positions by giving preference to their own services.&#34;In many senses, Google &amp; FB have achieved what net neutrality  wanted to prevent ISPs from doing. In the developing world, FB has actually achieved it. If AOL had succeeded, we would have ended up approximately here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think there&#39;s a simpler way to achieve this. Force companies who leak personal data to pay reasonable damages to all the individuals involved, on the scale of 10-100 dollars, depending on how much personal info has been leaked.That would make businesses very quickly reassess how much data they need to keep, and how careful they need to be with it, without requiring any really radical legislation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Psilocybin&#39;s effect can be amazing, but there were moments when I took truffles in Amsterdam that almost made me commit suicide. The sane part -- whatever was left of it -- recognized it and found an immediate way to stop it. So what actually happened is that I locked myself up in an empty room and cried (I couldn&#39;t harm myself there, because I didn&#39;t know how to get out until I sobered up a bit).After one hour of crying I started noticing the magical effects of &#34;we&#39;re all connected&#34; etc. So after the bad part of my trip, the amazing things came. I don&#39;t mind that I cried, but I do mind that I was acting on a suicidal tendency that I never experienced sober.I think I overdosed on it, being quite an inexperienced user. Because the first time I took half a dose, that was an amazing experience and it allowed me to reconnect to true child-like wonder (measured in units of whatever the smart shops in Amsterdam sell).N = 1, I know.All I&#39;m saying is: be careful, have a trip sitter and a good set and setting. Don&#39;t go all out simply because you see a few positive papers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The site is ~~wrong~~ somewhat correct about how big reddits homepage is.~~It seems to not run any scripts when testing, so 1.5MB is the basic JS + CSS.~~In reality, it&#39;s much, much worse. (On a desktop)Even with an adblocker, reddit.com downloaded 18MB in the first 10 seconds. That would put that cost at over $1.I stopped after that because it seemed to be just continuously downloading... something.I know Reddit is quite media driven these days, but it seems to be unnecessary prefetching a lotEdit: Looks like I was testing the desktop version,   
see jefftk&#39;s reply.However, it doesn&#39;t help reddit&#39;s case that much. After looking into what it&#39;s actually downloading in my &#34;desktop&#34; test, there are lots of huge PNG images (1000x1000 +) that seem to be displayed as tiny thumbnails.And for an infinitely scrolling page, it prefetches all the images in the feed at full resolution.If I turn off my adblocker, I get an autoplaying amazon ad (~5MB).Additionally, it starts auto-playing a livestreams which is just below the fold."</p>

And this is literally the first offering I looked at, the second provider I looked at offers 12 GB for 15.99 EUR which brings the number down to 0.0022 EUR.I would take those numbers with a large grain of salt at the very least."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s my personal belief that these massive R&amp;D space telescope programs are nearing their end. Computational approaches among multiple sensors, combined with good &#39;ol factory mass manufacturing powered by low-cost reusable launch technology allows for the money spent on one-shot programs like this to be spent and allocated in radical different ways.Instead of building one huge short life-span spacecraft, why not launch hundreds or thousands of lower cost, less capable birds incrementally? You can start with a small &#34;first light&#34; capable instrument with a dozen or so spacecraft, then over time and more launches put up more and more capability and decommission failed or low capability pieces.Use some computational methods to combine the sensor collection from dozens, hundreds, or thousands of these kinds of  spacecraft and you could end up with planet sized instruments pretty efficiently.By eliminating lots of the hard engineering for the massive instruments (like serviceability, difficult to make massive mirrors, etc) you can build even better instruments that are generational and relatively inexpensive.You get a more flexible funding story as well, e.g. fund at maintenance levels during difficult economic times and fund at larger amounts during boom times with matching launch schedules.Tasking the fleet could be more dynamic as well, with different researchers able to reserve different percentages of a huge fleet for their specific experiments and needs -- e.g. reserve a hundred spacecraft for a long dwell &#34;deep field&#34; type observation, or reserve thousands for planetary imaging in a nearby solar system.I know there are naysayers about this who think it&#39;s improbable. I urge those to think about the Starlink fleet, which went from zero birds in the air in 2015 to over 1500 spacecraft today. Now instead of radio antenna, what if they had imaging sensors and were turned to face out? SpaceX certainly didn&#39;t spend anywhere near what JWST ran as a program to reach this point and the development time has been a fraction so far."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On a related note, I highly, highly recommend watching this well-made documentary on JWST, released around 3 and a half years ago -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLD9LKq0u9EThis documentary was produced by Northrop Grumman Corporation -- the builders of JWST under a NASA contract."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If the JWST survives launch but has a subsequent mechanical problem that prevents it deploying properly (and it’s the kind of problem that would have been fixable on Hubble, using a shuttle mission) would it be feasible to mount a robotic rescue mission to chase it down and remote-hands it back to life? For less than the cost of just launching another JWST?"</p>
