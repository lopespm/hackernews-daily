								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;The service will, eventually, be available as a paid option...&#34;How my viewpoint has shifted over the years. 10-20 years ago this would have instantly turned me off, but now this is the most exciting line in the entire thing to me. As long as we all expect free, we can&#39;t expect privacy.@Brave team, who I rather expect will be reading this, I can&#39;t believe that Cliqz doing tracking on me to improve its results for free will be in my interests if it&#39;s free. But if I&#39;m a paying customer, you might be able to convince me that you&#39;re doing some semi-invasive tracking but not actually selling it to anyone, because it wouldn&#39;t be worth losing me as a customer.I&#39;m actually excited about the idea of a search engine that I pay for. Been waiting for DDG to do it but last I knew there&#39;s still no option there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In my understanding what Cliqz did, at least in the beginning, was to buy clickstream data and then build an index on top of that. So in a sense they just scraped Googles&#39; search index, as almost all users rely on Google for finding stuff on the web. The clickstream data gives you both the search query and the website(s) users visit after searching, so it&#39;s pretty easy to build a search index from that, at least for popular searches (it might be more difficult for the long tail of search queries).A lot of the clickstream data you can buy comes from browser extensions btw, and often gets collected without users knowing about it (looking at you, &#34;Web of Trust&#34;). I think their reliance on such data was the reason Cliqz acquired Ghostery, which also collects a copious amount of &#34;anonymous&#34; data from its users. On one hand it&#39;s a neat idea since you&#39;re basically standing on Googles&#39; shoulders, on the other hand it&#39;s at least questionable for a &#34;privacy-first&#34; company as the generation of the search index is based on personal data mined from (often unwitting) users.That said I don&#39;t know how their system evolved, so maybe today they have another way to build their index."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Brave has a long way to go to build real trust. Too many reckless stuff: hijacking links, suspicious url-rewriting, crypto-token stunts, forgetting to communicate with users about serious privacy leaks with their faulty TOR window... also it looks like they care about privacy only in their PR brochures."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Killing TurboTax&#34; is essentially a meme until we meaningfully simplify the tax code.There is no software development team on earth who could catch up with the full capabilities of TurboTax without some sort of fundamental shift in the business. I really hate to say this as someone who makes a living out of it, but dealing with the current amount of complexity in the tax code with a piece of software that a non-expert could use is virtually impossible.For the happy path (i.e. single individual, no dependents, no investments, no retirement, rents home), you could certainly build an application that handles these scenarios. The moment you factor in individuals who are bringing stock sales, multiple investment properties, ownerships/K1s and other complex scenarios to bear, its a different hellscape altogether.Also don&#39;t forget that most states have their own independent tax codes as well, which further complicate matters. There&#39;s difficulty multipliers all over this problem domain, and you can be certain that the lobbyists employed by Intuit, et. al. are encouraging this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Sunde understands the value of propaganda, so it&#39;s fairly obvious he expected this outcome. He wanted to highlight the undemocratic and corrupt nature of one of the most critical parts of our global infrastructure, and he did it.Ironically, this was a better proof of transparency than what most &#34;problematic&#34; people would subject themselves to. If any vanilla oligarch wanted to be in those circles, he would just pay some squeaky-clean individual to be his stooge, and then make it known, after registration, who the real power is. Sunde could have configured himself as a freelance consultant to his friends, and he would not have appeared on any radar. This would have made his business work, but it would not have advanced the perennial conversation about ICANN&#39;s original sins, which have become more and more untolerable with the years.ICANN were pretty stupid to just veto his admission. That&#39;s not how you deal with institutional critics. They could have simply brought him in, then informally and formally vetoed anything he wanted to do. They have experience with people who tried to blow up things &#34;from inside&#34; in the past, so clearly they&#39;ve developed countermeasures ready for that scenario. Or they could have given him something, enough to behold him, so he&#39;d have an incentive to stay in the tent and piss outside rather than the other way around.This attitude proved Sunde is fundamentally right on the subject matter, like him or not as a person."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">" &gt; They basically admitted that they don’t like me. They’ve banned me for nothing else than my political views. This is typical discrimination. Considering I have no one to appeal to except them, it’s concerning, since they control the actual fucking center of the internet.Next-level deplatforming. From a non-profit. That essential controls the internet. Yay."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Over the phone, ICANN explained that the matter was discussed internally. This unnamed group of people concluded that the organization is ‘not comfortable’ doing business with him.It&#39;s the height of arrogance that they didn&#39;t even feel the need to come up with any better excuse, just this.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We&#39;re all complaining about how js is a bad language, tooling is a mess, and how the web is fundamentally built for documents and makes it hard to create app-like experiences. Now, Google comes and creates a whole new UI toolkit from scratch, couples it with a very beautiful SDK and component framework and offers a far better programming language than js could ever be but we&#39;re still nagging. I was also pretty disappointed with the demo at flutterfolio.com that is supposed to show how great Flutter 2.0 for the web is. It&#39;s not that good but it&#39;s gonna get there eventually, given the hype around wasm and &lt;canvas&gt; technologies. Not to mention that Flutter is already better and easier to use than the existing native tools for both Android and iOS. I believe Flutter is an extremely ambitious project and I appreciate that Google is really trying to give an answer to the problem of cross-platform UI development."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Google Pay switched to Flutter a few months ago for their flagship mobile app, and they already achieved major gains in productivity and quality. By unifying the codebase, the team removed feature disparity between platforms and eliminated over half a million lines of code.from pay.google.com&gt; Starting April 5, you won&#39;t be able to use pay.google.com to send and receive money from other people. To send and receive money, use the new Google Pay app."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m currently 5 months into developing a mobile app for a startup with flutter and my experience so far is very underwhelming.Flutter as a framework is not the worst but far from best, it&#39;s very OO while trying to use reacts vdom model which just wants to be functional.The biggest limitation of the platform is Dart - it&#39;s a horrible language that should have died once TS and ES6 became mature enough. And I&#39;ve used dart back when it was supposed to be a JS killer shipped with browsers, used dartium to build a MVP for an app using Angular Dart durgin the betas.Back then Dart was miles ahead in terms of tooling and JS the language didn&#39;t even have async/await - so I was singing it&#39;s praises. But the language stagnated and it&#39;s fundamentals with a nominal type system and a closed object model make the language so inflexible and full of boilerplate it&#39;s incredible. It&#39;s very much like Java (the language, without the powerful ecosystem) and people prefer Kotlin for frontend for a reason. C# is similar but they figured out that they need to build a lot of things in to the language to reduce the boilerplate so they are adding stuff like Records and pattern matching.If you look at state management patterns in flutter there&#39;s probably 5-10 competing approaches all lacking in their own way and all severely hampered by how unexpressive dart is. Or how you deal with serialisation/immutability/etc."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Loving the progression here. Tomorrow, someone’s going to reduce the boot times of macOS by 90% by the same principle.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Blog author here!  Thanks to HN for warning me about sscanf at exactly the right time – within a day of me trying to load some ASCII STLs and noticing it was slow...Linked deep in the Twitter replies [1], there&#39;s an open glibc issue about this, dating back to 2014:https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=17577C doesn&#39;t have any requirements on the complexity of sscanf, so it might not be a bug per se, but it&#39;s certainly... a pitfall.[1] https://twitter.com/impraxical/status/1367194430835425283"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a bigger potential problem with the *scanf() functions than performance. They are inherently unsafe for reading numeric input.For example, if you do something like this:    int n;
    sscanf(&#34;9999999999999999999999999&#34;, &#34;%d&#34;, &amp;n);

the behavior is undefined. As the C standard says:&gt; ... the result of the conversion is placed in the object pointed to by the first argument following the format argument that has not already received a conversion result. If this object does not have an appropriate type, or if the result of the conversion cannot be represented in the object, the behavior is undefined.You can control the appropriate type by writing the call directly, but you can&#39;t guarantee that the result can be represented unless you have control over the input.Remember that in C &#34;undefined behavior&#34; doesn&#39;t mean that your program will fail, or will crash, or will tell you there was a problem. It means that a conforming implementation can do literally anything. In the worst case, it will do what what you expect until it fails at the most inconvenient possible moment.Now most implementations will probably do something sane, like setting a floating-point object to infinity or an integer object to some arbitrary value, but the language doesn&#39;t guarantee anything.If you want to write safe code, you can extract a substring that represents a number and pass it to one of the strto*() functions, which do have well defined behavior on overflow. (But I couldn&#39;t tell you exactly what that behavior is without looking it up.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember a small story, decades ago, about a company/univeristy which was left holding the bag when the government cancelled their contract. They were constructing a lens system to go into a satellite which could purportedly read the issue date on a dime lying on the sidewalk. It was something like $15M. The implication was that the government had found something even better, and gone with that instead. If Google is publicly giving up on a particular, unpopular technology to buy some PR, I strongly suspect that they&#39;ve already figured out something which will work &#34;better&#34; behind the scenes.There&#39;s a lot of confusion over what this story is actually saying, and, given the obscurity with which Google deals with it&#39;s tech, I don&#39;t think this is going to get cleared up, leaving room for a lot of speculation. But one thing is absolutely certain: There&#39;s no possible way that Google is going to make a change to their biggest money maker that would make them LESS money. Maybe that just means that they consider their duopoly enough of a barrier that advertisers will be forced to accept less-targeted marketing, but I doubt it..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like the phrase “tracking individual people” is how Google is going to keep tracking you as well as they did before.With the announcement of federated learning of cohorts [0], it allows Google to use their massive amount of information they have on you already, as well as their dominance in AI to cut out the easy way of tracking people, and make it harder for anyone else to personalize ads.Don’t get me wrong it’s a good thing that we are removing third-party cookies, but the idea that Google is confident they can track you without them makes me worried for the future of advertising. This move is undoubtedly going to cement google as the best ad tracking company for some time into the future.[0]: https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/24/google-extremely-confident-a..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I hope this gives rise to another, smaller viable party outside of Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. Perhaps I&#39;m jaded, perhaps hopelessly biased - but I can only see this as a net negative.Okta&#39;s open source packages receive a pitiful amount of attention (for example: https://github.com/okta/okta-oidc-js/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%...) with forks almost becoming a requirement. Auth0 by contrast has been &#34;on the ball&#34; for a long time with their offerings. Okta&#39;s interfaces have been disjointed and inconsistent, confusing to users on a scale only surpassed by Jira, while Auth0&#39;s have always been pleasant to use from a user and developer perspective.From a personnel perspective, the two companies couldn&#39;t be more different, with Auth0 embracing a remote-first-class culture with creative interview processes, and Okta (pre-covid) being very much the opposite. I interviewed with both, and the process at Auth0 had me walk away with respect, while contrasted with Okta that left me reminded that tech hiring is broken.I&#39;ll hold my breath for a short time that Auth0 is allowed to operate independently. Sadly I feel it&#39;ll be inevitable that they&#39;re eventually swallowed up by the mothership."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hate this. We moved from Okta a few years ago after we were basically received almost no actual real support for a bunch of issues, even though we were paying a premium cost. Nobody cares about issues on their Github, the kicker was a when we received a support response as suddenly something was no longer working after an update, we got help in the form of &#34;We have no plans to address this anytime soon.&#34; when asking for an ETA.We ended up switching to Auth0, after we had a few calls with them. We shaved a decent amount off our costs with Auth0&#39;s Enterprise plan, and their webtask based rules worked. While the migration sucked for a bit, in the end we were much happier."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; and integrated over timeI&#39;m reading too much into this sentence fragment and it fills me with fear.I smell breaking domain changes in the future.  They can&#39;t allow the .auth0.com tenants to operate as-is forever, which means existing tenants will get grandfathered in and eventually forced off the .auth0.com domain onto okta&#39;s domains.I smell messy login sites in the future. I like Auth0&#39;s implementation of their Universal Login page, which didn&#39;t require JavaScript.  In the quest for &#39;one single brand identity&#39; someone will force a migration to Okta&#39;s login implementation instead.That will come with changing client IDs, client secrets, M2Ms and everything else needed in their setup.I might as well create a Jira ticket for this now."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been trying out the latest master builds of pipewire recently and have been pretty impressed with it:* My bluetooth headset can now use the HFP profile with the mSBC codec (16 kHz sample rate) instead of the terrible CVSD codec (8 kHz sample rate) with the basic HSP profile.* Higher quality A2DP stereo codecs, like LDAC, also work.* AVDTP 1.3 delay reporting works (!!) to delay the video for perfect A/V sync.* DMA-BUF based screen recording works with OBS + obs-xdg-portal + pipewire (for 60fps game capture).For my use cases, the only things still missing are automatic switching between A2DP and HFP bluetooth profiles and support for AVRCP absolute volume (so that the OS changes the headset&#39;s hardware volume instead of having a separate software volume)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; including the raw Linux ALSA sound API, which typically allows only one application to access the sound card.If the raw in that sentence is not meant as a special qualifier and this is meant as a statement about ALSA in general, this is wrong. I recently read up on this to confirm my memory was right when reading a similar statement. In fact, ALSA had just a very short period where typically only one application accessed the sound card. After that, dmix was enabled by default. Supporting multiple applications was actually the big advantage of ALSA compared to OSS, which at the time really did support only one application per soundcard (without hardware mixing, which broke away at that time). I&#39;m not sure why this seems to be remembered so wrongly?&gt; Speaking of transitions, Fedora 8&#39;s own switch to PulseAudio in late 2007 was not a smooth one. Longtime Linux users still remember having the daemon branded as the software that will break your audio.This wasn&#39;t just a Fedora problem. Ubuntu when making the switch also broke Audio on countless of systems. I was active as supporter in a Ubuntu support forum at that time and we got flooded with help requests. My very own system did not work with Pulseaudio when I tried to switch, that was years later. I still use only ALSA because of that experience. At that time Pulseaudio was garbage, it should never have been used then. It only got acceptable later - but still has bugs and issues.That said, PipeWire has a better vibe than Pulseaudio did. It intends to replace a system that never worked flawlessly, seems to focus on compatibility, and the apparent endorsement from the JACK-developers also does not hurt. User reports I have seen so far have been positive, though I&#39;m not deep into support forums anymore. Maybe this can at least replace Pulseaudio, that would be a win. I&#39;m cautiously optimistic about this one."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just tried it on NixOS, had no idea it was so fleshed out already! Thought it&#39;d be full of bugs but was pleasantly surprised, it just worked. No issues with compatibility, extremely low latency and has JACK and PulseAudio shims, so everything works out of the box, including pro audio stuff like Reaper and Ardour. And thanks to the JACK shim I can patch around the outputs with qjackctl. This is compared to JACK, which I never managed to properly combine with PulseAudio."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We recently tried to build a relatively simple PowerApps application - under the assumption it would save time over pumping out a React boilerplate form.  Never again.We wanted it to be able to integrate with our backend which lives outside the MS ecosystem.  No problem we thought - that&#39;s what custom connectors are for.  Except they don&#39;t work with any of the automated form generation functionality.  So we pretty much have to build the form entirely manually.Low code becomes high code all of a sudden - except it&#39;s worse than just coding and learning a new framework.  You can&#39;t just input your code anywhere you want, or import your dependencies, etc... You have to hunt around in a zillion different (laggy as all hell) interfaces to find the right location where that code can live.  Or maybe it&#39;s not code - but a toggle somewhere... OMG... kill me.Good luck if you are trying to learn the lower level aspects... since all the tutorials, blogs, youtube videos - all assume that your data all lives in Sharepoint or some other MS resource - and that your connector actually works as advertised.If you can code - and your stack doesn&#39;t already entirely consist of the MS ecosystem.  Just roll your own."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just read the overview document (docs/overview.md in that repo), and I have to say I&#39;m blown away.Excel is one of the world&#39;s most popular programming environments, because it has such a low barrier to entry, but it&#39;s limited: the input is always a grid of numbers, and the output is always a grid of numbers, which limits how useful it can be to people outside number-crunching professions.Visual Basic (especially the original, pre-.NET incarnation) let you create Real Windows Apps with all the inputs and outputs that entails (images, copy/paste, files, sliders, textboxes, databases) and let you use a fairly simple and forgiving language to wire them together... but the barrier-to-entry was still a lot higher than Excel, even if it was lower than C++, or even Visual Basic.NET.This PowerApps thing seems like an elegant middle-ground between the two - rich inputs and outputs (images, sliders, text-boxes, databases), with a simple, predictable language to wire them together. The inputs and outputs aren&#39;t quite as rich as Visual Basic, but the shift from native apps to web apps has changed people&#39;s expectations since the days of VB6, so that&#39;s probably an advantage."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the overview document:&gt; Microsoft Power Fx is the low-code language that will be used across the Microsoft Power Platform.The emphasized part above is all you need to know to understand that Microsoft Power Fx is NOT a low-code general purpose programming language, as is mistakenly stated in the README document. It might be general purpose in the Power Apps context, but it&#39;s a moot point from the larger perspective. Generally, Microsoft Power Platform and, thus, its subset Power Apps, present a much stronger lock-in risk than Azure and some other products and services."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Also wanted to share my overall positive experience with Clickhouse.UPSIDES* started a 3-node cluster using the official Docker images super quickly* ingested billions of rows super fast* great compression (of course, depends on your data&#39;s characteristics)* features like https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/engines/table-engines/merget... are amazing to see* ODBC support.  I initially said &#34;Who uses that??&#34;, but we used it to connect PostgreSQL and so we can keep the non-timeseries data in PostgreSQL but still access PostgreSQL tables in Clickhouse (!)* you can go the other way too: read Clickhouse from PostgreSQL (see https://github.com/Percona-Lab/clickhousedb_fdw, although we didn&#39;t try this)* PRs welcome, and quickly reviewed. (We improved the ODBC UUID support)* code quality is pretty high.DOWNSIDES* limited JOIN capabilities, which is expected from a timeseries-oriented database like Clickhouse.  It&#39;s almost impossible to implement JOINs at this kind of scale.  The philosophy is &#34;If it won&#39;t be fast as scale, we don&#39;t support it&#34;* not-quite-standard SQL syntax, but they&#39;ve been improving it* limited DELETE support, which is also expected from this kind of database, but rarely used in the kinds of environments that CH usually runs in (how often do people delete data from ElasticSearch?)It&#39;s really an impressive piece of engineering.  Hats off to the Yandex crew."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think it&#39;s an unfair comparison, notably because:1) Clickhouse is rigid-schema + append-only - you can&#39;t simply dump semi-structured data (csv/json/documents) into it and worry about schema (index definition) + querying later.  The only clickhouse integration I&#39;ve seen up close had a lot of &#34;json&#34; blobs in it as a workaround, which cannot be queried with the same ease as in ES.2) Clickhouse scalability is not as simple/documented as elasticsearch.  You can set up a 200-node ES cluster with a relatively simple helm config or readily-available cloudformation recipe.3) Elastic is more than elasticsearch - kibana and the &#34;on top of elasticsearch&#34; featureset is pretty substantial.4) Every language/platform under the sun (except powerbi... god damnit) has native + mature client drivers for elasticsearch, and you can fall back to bog-standard http calls for querying if you need/want.  ClickHouse supports some very elementary SQL primitives (&#34;ANSI&#34;) and even those have some gotchas and are far from drop-in.In this manner, I think that clickhouse is better compared as a self-hosted alternative to Aurora and other cloud-native scalable SQL databases, and less a replacement for elasticsearch.  If you&#39;re using Elasticsearch for OLAP, you&#39;re probably better to ETL the semi-structured/raw data out of ES that you specifically wan to a more suitable database which is meant for that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; SQL is a perfect language for analytics.Slightly off topic, but I strongly agree with this statement and wonder why the languages used for a lot of data science work (R, Python) don&#39;t have such a strong focus on SQL.It might just be my brain, but SQL makes so much logical sense as a query language and, with small variances, is used to directly query so many databases.In R, why learn the data.tables (OK, speed) or dplyr paradigms, when SQL can be easily applied directly to dataframes? There are libraries to support this like sqldf[1], tidyquery[2] and duckdf[3] (author). And I&#39;m sure the situation is similar in Python.This is not a post against great libraries like data.table and dplyr, which I do use from time to time. It&#39;s more of a question about why SQL is not more popular as the query language de jour for data science.[1] https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sqldf/index.html[2] https://github.com/ianmcook/tidyquery[3] https://github.com/phillc73/duckdf"</p>
