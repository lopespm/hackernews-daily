								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I know this topic is important in substance and the thing I&#39;m about to say is an aesthetic issue, but as an American watching this unfold I have admired the Brits for the sense of heart that still seems to be present in their politics.I&#39;m referring to the parliamentary sessions in which, even though they&#39;re savagely roasting each other, they&#39;re doing in a way that feels somehow good-hearted and doesn&#39;t lay bare the naked resentment and hatred that seems to be all we have left in the USA.Also, less amusing but still inspiring, has been articulate criticism from politicians and pundits who seem to actually care about the thing they&#39;re talking about; on this side of the Atlantic, it&#39;s easy to get the sense that anyone in front of a camera has a pile of talking points on a set of index cards in their lap that they pull out to memorize during commercial breaks.Charles Walker, giving an impromptu interview, seems to care about a thing:

								<p class="story__comment_others">"What happens next will be interesting.At this point, a general election would be the obviously correct solution. It&#39;s clear that the conservative party don&#39;t have a platform and can&#39;t agree major policy points amongst themselves.However that would require conservative MPs to vote for it, which is the turkeys voting for Christmas so unlikely to happen, so I&#39;d expect we&#39;ll have to wait till 2024 for that election.The best likely outcome is that a set of senior people in the party agree a policy platform and try to steady things for now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This might sound crazy... but if the UK is already de facto ruled by financial markets, in the sense that the PM has to step down if the markets don&#39;t like what they&#39;re doing, maybe it&#39;s time to try prediction market-based governance for real?What would&#39;ve happened if instead of simply announcing the proposal, Truss had described the proposal and the government had sponsored a conditional prediction market on the economic effects?She could&#39;ve run prediction markets for dozens of proposals, and selected a policy that was popular with both the markets and the public.(Lest this idea be seen as overly capitalist: there&#39;s no reason not to run a prediction market for &#34;degree to which this policy will reduce inequality&#34;, and incorporate the result into decisionmaking as well.  Imagine the irony: a bunch of rich hedge funds trying to figure out the best way to reduce inequality!)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a great trick and with practice you don&#39;t even need a watch, heck you don&#39;t even need an object to cast a shadow.The sun is over there, a shadow would be that way, it&#39;s about 5 o&#39;clock. That must be north!What I&#39;ve always thought of as witchcraft is this.Jab a stick in the ground, mark the end of the shadow. Come back some time later say 15-30mins. Mark the new end of the shadow.Draw a line between marks and that is an east-west line!In the Northern hemisphere the stick is south of that line, in the southern hemisphere it&#39;s North!What!!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From some of the comments, I’m not sure people fully get this. It’s basically doing a geometric construction of the sun’s path across the sky, using the distance between the hour hand and the 12 on the watch face as one of the input angles in the calculation. That’s quick (important because you have to repeat it while you’re marching) and easy to remember (also important because you might need it in a situation without access to Wikipedia). Under the assumption that the sun rises at 06:00 in the exact East and sets at 18:00 in the exact West, the construction is almost perfect. Of course, that’s never exactly true in real life, but still a lot more accurate than “well I know the sun is roughly South”."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love this trick. You can also do this using your hands if you know roughly what time it is.For example, if it&#39;s sunny out, place your arm in your shadow, parallel to the ground. Keep it there. This arm represents the current time (say, 10 O&#39;clock).
Look at your shadow and point your other arm out, parallel to the ground, and adjust it until the arm&#39;s shadow points at &#34;12 O&#39;clock&#34; relative to your first arm (in your shadow).
Clap your hands together, and you&#39;re pointing north!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Of course Google isn&#39;t going to look at the code. Most Google App Store apps are not open source, so why would that be a workflow at all?You have to evaluate those same deliverables that are downloaded to the user.To be able to infer properties of the build application from the source code review, it has to be shown that the two correspond; the shipped, built version comes from the code that was reviewed.Poring over someone&#39;s source code is a fool&#39;s errand. You will never catch everything; people find 25 year old bugs in code that have evaded all previous pairs of eyes.Google&#39;s approach here is poor though; they created these API&#39;s and permission model and now have to backpedal on it randomly.If you want untrusted applications to have access to Contacts, it should be done with abstract tokens that do not reveal any contact details. Each contact is represented by an object handle that provides every imaginable operation you might want to do to, with or by-means-of a contact.It&#39;s possible to design a system whereby some contact properties (e.g. mobilePhoneNumber) are accessible, but the result of the access is an abstract object that doesn&#39;t actually reveal the content, only represents its existence.  The user interface could be priviled so that, say, a text field widget can be given one of these opaque objects, and then display the actual phone number. The only way to get at it would be to have permission to take a screenshot, and then OCR it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I kinda sorta see google’s side. 
There are just too many shady operators out there who will swear blind they’re completely honest, and maybe they are, but they also employed a third party to write code or maybe just imported a 3rd party lib (i am in no way saying this is the case)As to, why don’t they look at the code? bugger that being standard practise, i’m not handing over my code to google or apple.Even if they did, how to check final the uploaded binary?I’m not doubting the article, but the mobile app world is flooded with shady operators at all levels, and i don’t really buy the real paranoid arguments here"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not familiar with mobile app review process, would any change in code require a re-review/re-submit? If Google approved it as-is, could the developers add a few lines as an &#34;update&#34; and skip over the full review process?Seems like the ruling is being made on what can be done with the current permissions, rather than what is being done. If that&#39;s the case, I sympathize with the devs but I think I support the position Google is taking there.Off-topic comment: I use NoScript, and the entire text of the article renders for a half second before disappearing and for some inexplicable reason requiring JS to be enabled. If you can render it for that half second, why hide it? Why force me to use JS when you just proved that you can render it without?"</p>

				<div class="story__comments">
					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33263603">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We have been using KillBill for many years for our SaaS product.While it is very nice to own our data, we have had a huge lot of issues with it too.Beware that this is an &#34;industrial&#34; tool, meaning that it is very complex, written in Java, with a lot of quirks and sharp edges. The core team also seems to mainly  work on some closed-source version of it, for some not-very-clear-what big corp(s). They let you know sometimes that there exists a more feature-full closed-source version when asking questions in the support google group or on github issues, but it&#39;s not very transparent.If you are a startup with a small team or small budget and no real Java development skills, you&#39;ll probably want to be careful in considering to use it: many custom things you&#39;ll want to do will require contracting with one of their partners because it&#39;s too complicated to do yourself, and support will be limited, and debugging issues will be hugely complicated if you are not used to that tech stack...Just this week, we have had a major issue with it: after doing an `apt upgrade`, docker was updated and restarted. It restarted KillBill&#39;s docker images fine but KillBill itself restarted only the Stripe plugin, not the Avatax one, for an unknown reason. So the tool happily generated invoices and payments for a few hours without any taxes (!), until we noticed and started the plugin manually from the interface. This is the kind of issues we regularly have to deal with, and while the tool does a good job most of the time, it is mindblowingly annoying sometimes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Does Kill Bill support taxes?&gt; Kill Bill does not support taxes. Instead, we partner with Avalara to outsource tax compliance. Our AvaTax connector provides real-time and on-demand calculationsto prevent overcharging or undercharging tax.I expected as much. Handling taxes internationally is a major PITA and it changes all the time as politicians get new ideas how to make things even more complicated. I&#39;m pretty sure that many SaaS companies are unknowingly not compliant with all the rules."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Met with this team probably 8 years ago for consideration on a (at the time) large subscription product. Didn&#39;t go with it because of issues in the organization I was working with,  but KillBill folks were good people, impressive, good product. Glad to see them still around."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is &#34;only&#34; two of the seven modules included in the desktop version, but even just one would be a breakthrough on the iPad.The full DaVinci Resolve is nuts: it covers a complete, Hollywood-level workflow of DAM, editing, grading, sound, and VFX (with probably the most generous freemium model in existence, by a good margin). The iPad version covers one of the two edit workflows (the one more tailored to broadcast than film) and color grading, which will cover quite a few use cases without anything else. I can especially see this being used by serious YouTubers and independent content creators.I wonder if the asset management module is planned, as that would seem to be the next-most broadly useful module."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is incredible on so many fronts. 5-10 years ago, I would choose my computer based on it&#39;s potential to edit video. A decade ago, most laptops couldn&#39;t handle the load of uncompressed video. 5 years ago, having iMovie on your Ipad allowed us to make sub &lt;5 minute videos of low-res/processed files. Now we have an intersection of 1. an Ipad is powerful enough to handle this type of data processing and 2. BMD has found ways of dealing with the huge file sizes and rendering / editing in real time. Unreal. I imagined this would come some day but not today."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the things that makes this a big deal is an iPad is often the most color accurate highest quality display anyone has."</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33274988">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’ve long held this opinion but I consistently get drowned out.DevOps has different meaning depending on who you’re talking to, even some definitions that appear similar are different in nuanced but important ways.All “devops” as a job title has done has muddy responsibilities and given many folks the wrong impression of what an operations discipline should be.There is also a lot of rewriting of history that gets thrown in, similar to how when people talk about cloud then the only alternative is to start making CPUs by hand and begin building your own nuclear reactors. It’s the idea of what came before, not the reality, that people seem to be defensive of.It’s honestly exhausting to discuss.So instead I became CTO so I can solve this mess properly, I don’t hire devops, I hire infra engineers, build engineers, release engineers and: backend engineers.Roles so simple that you already have a clue what they do, which is sort of the point of job titles."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have bewilderingly tried to discern why software development continues to grow more and more complex.It wasn’t always like this. There was a time when we talked about languages and OSes and libraries as if they made a difference on how much you could get done with as little people and cognitive load as possible (the claims were very much overrated, but the point was we acted like it mattered).And then it started ballooning. It seems to me that much of that coincides with a lot of new money being dumped into the economy, and software moving past the necessary-evil-so-how-do-I-drive-down-my-costs and on to the gold rush of you must have a web app for your service that rivals a video game in complexity and visual finesse. It seems to me that as long as their is so much free money sloshing around venture capital funding, that it was inevitable that the process of making software would complexify to soak up the extra cash. After all, you can only add so many levels and varieties of managers to add value. After that comes the variegation in roles of software development.That’s my working theory anyway."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This echoes the philosophy of Google Site Reliability Engineering, which (this is key) is an engineering discipline.The job of DevOps is not to close tickets. That&#39;d be like driving a car by shouting directions at someone lying on the floorboards holding a wrench to the steering pinion.The job of DevOps is to build a steering wheel (and ideally, teach SWEs how to drive... at least enough that they understand what a &#34;road&#34; is and why it&#39;s a pleasant experience for everyone if you stay on it. If the road doesn&#39;t go where they need to be, then it&#39;s time to file a ticket, but that ticket had better be &#34;Build a new road,&#34; not &#34;Offroad this one car to the cabin in the woods and call it a job well done&#34;).The raw hardware of an enterprise deployment is so flexible it solves nobody&#39;s problem. DevOps is in the business of writing the operating system for a mega-computer physically represented by hundreds to possibly millions of heterogeneous computers. It&#39;s a process of continuous growth to make that work."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"He goes into detail:&gt; It’s the “after careful review” line that has me riled up tbh. I can understand why an automated system suspended it. Don’t lie to me!-- https://twitter.com/benthompson/status/1583063313948499969And yeah, I have to agree. I absolutely hate it when providers (shipping companies are great at this) tell me obvious lies. Hey, I can handle issues and problems. What I can’t handle are lies."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Using the web and it&#39;s services really feels more and more like tedious work which is simply not worth it anymore. I don&#39;t want to sound like some old grunt (not even 30 yet), but every modern service uses some kind of automatic banning system and everything you invested can be gone in seconds.To spice things up, all these services also stopped providing any kind of support regarding these kind of problems. Ever tried to get into contact with anybody about a banned account?Just some weeks ago Discord decided to ban my 6 year old account out of nowhere. I didn&#39;t used Discord for 4 weeks, since I was on vacation. Also I am pretty sure, that it wasn&#39;t hacked, because I used MFA and no other account was affected.I tried to contact the support, but only got a template response, that they don&#39;t talk about reasons and my account data will also be deleted in 14 days. I tried to contact them again, but they simply blocked my mail after that.I didn&#39;t do any suspicious on discord ever. So I really had no clue why this happened. While talking with friends and coworker I&#39;ve heard similar stories. And everybody of us changed their hardware multiple times beforehand (for example to test a specific component or for overclocking). Gotta love automatic banning systems..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I worked for a large grocery store chain between 2004 and 2010, there the AI had already taken over. Though we didn&#39;t call it an AI, just &#39;the system&#39;.The system was able to procure goods with stunning accuracy. Sometimes it even surprised us. For example: we&#39;d receive a much higher number of BBQ meat than typical, only to realise it was going to be amazing weather the coming days.The system was also making schedules for the re-stocking team with the same accuracy. It knew what it ordered, the exact time the truck was due to arrive, at which time the personnel was available (not at school, for example), etc. The system told us when to show up, and when we had to be finished.The system was even able to pinpoint cashiers that were stealing money from the register, by correlating cash count of the individual registers to the schedule (which the AI also created). It would then &#39;isolate&#39; the suspected employee to a single register and order a cash count (which was done by hand) at the end of the day.Basically the only reason why there still was a manager was for responsibility and babysitting (most employees were teens that did dumb stuff). And the occasional Karen who wanted to talk to a manager.I remember being being thoroughly impressed with the efficiency of the software back then. In some ways it must have influenced my career path (I now work in automating businesses). I left in 2010, I can only imagine how much more advanced this system has become since."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this article fundamentally misunderstands the core function of middle management. You can boil it down to 2 key tasks (on the front lines of a very large organization).a) Interpreting: either top-&gt;down by explaining and enforcing corporate policy on hourly workers or bottom-&gt;up by ensuring workers enter data to be reported on correctlyb) &#34;Encouraging&#34;: an employee calls in sick, again. Neither firing them or giving them the day off every time are desirable. The managers role is to &#34;encourage&#34; the performance and attendance (in one way or another)Neither of these are low hanging fruit for automation or even middle hanging fruit for automation.edit: I would also add that the comment &#34;Union formation across the retail landscape will force corporations to reduce management head count&#34; is backwards. From a management perspective, if labor gets rowdy you need more overseers to keep them in line. More union activity = more management headcount"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of an argument I got into at a bar with someone who claimed robots would inevitably replace bartenders. I took the view that bartenders would be the last occupation to be replaced by robots because if the goal was to minimize the cost to consume alcohol people wouldn&#39;t be coming to bars in the first place.There&#39;s a misconception that jobs with higher pay and more prestige will be the last to be replaced by robots. In many cases I think the opposite is true and in this case I think upper management will be replaced by robots before middle management."</p>
