								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Damn, I was afraid this was going to be someone stealing my genius idea. Gladly it was just tangential to that idea.Idea: Train an ai to construct entire threads based on the input of the title and link. There should be plenty of training material, and frankly I think it would be hilariously similar to the real threads.When new submissions are added to HN, the system will fetch the title and link, and predict the entire thread. You can view the thread on something like hnpredicted.com/?id=33680661 . When the real thread has had no new comment added for five days, it is reintegrated into the system further training the model.Possibly, the model could be trained on the actual content of the link. But I suspect just using the short title might be better. Larger concentration on the actual material there, websites contain lots of text which is useless.Now that I&#39;ve posted the idea, feel free to steal it ofcourse. It&#39;s documented that I came up with it anyway. :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Our diagnosis is that individual developers do not pay for tools.I know this first hand, building a developer tool startup and failing to reach any level of revenue. In the end, the tech was bought out by a larger company to recover a fraction of our VC investment.The challenge is that when you&#39;re building software for developers, they already know how it must work.It&#39;s like trying to sell magic tricks to magicians. Sell magic to regular people, and you&#39;ll see some significant revenue.I&#39;ve used Kite before. It was ok. But I am a SWE. It&#39;s entirely possible that Kite would have seen major adoption if the push was towards non-technical folks trying to get their feet wet in software. Eg: Data scientists or business.The reason why BI tools sell so well at the moment is that you have tons of C-level execs that like the appeal of a business-optimizing tool requiring little to none of any actual software development.Let that be a lesson to everyone. You can&#39;t blow away developers. They&#39;re just too damn ~~smart~~ well-informed.Edit: Another anecdote: A buddy of mine built a bespoke OCR and document indexing/search tool. He has ~60 paying clients (almost exclusively law-firms and banks) that primarily work with printed pages on paper. No Saas. No free tier. The client data resides on an on-premise Windows box, avoiding issues with sensitive data in the cloud etc.He&#39;s a solo dev with support contracts and nets something like $1000/month from each client.For your average lawyer/paralegal, the ability to locate and reference a single page from thousands of pages in under a second is magic. So they pay for it wholeheartedly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Our diagnosis is that individual developers do not pay for tools. Their manager might, but engineering managers only want to pay for discrete new capabilities, i.e. making their developers 18% faster when writing code did not resonate strongly enough.&#34;I never used Kite, but I&#39;ve tried Github Copilot twice, and found it marginal at best (and distracting at worst - which is why I turned it off both times). If Kite was similar, the reason I&#39;m not paying is that coder AIs are not providing any value.Developers are somewhat reluctant to pay for tools but I think you can get them to pay for things that are worth it. I&#39;ve been paying for code editors for years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think if they open sourced Kite from the start rather than as they call it quits that they could&#39;ve had a ton of free development done on their products by interested developers.  Developers not paying for tools is simply not true.  Developers do pay for good tools.  Sublime text is one such tool many devs pay for and it&#39;s quite profitable and completely built and operated by a two person team."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I built a lighting system for &lt;hotel chain you&#39;ve heard of&gt; to save energy by turning off hallway lights when not in use. The environmental aspect was great and saved hundreds of thousands in electricity. Someone eventually realized that the mesh network I built to connect all the lights together and report usage statistics could also be used to track employees moving throughout the building and catch them taking unauthorized breaks in the stairwell, so that&#39;s its main purpose now.I&#39;m a lot more paranoid about privacy these days."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I was at Akamai about 5 years ago, I was involved in building the system for making their CDN compliant in China. There were two main features, and they were activated on all servers running inside mainland china (not HK, macau or Taiwan)1. Logs of the CDN were sent in real time to the ministry of technology -- there was about a 15 minute delay if I remember correctly, and they could impose fines if they were delayed. The log included the url visited, the IP address of the visitor, and a few other things. Perhaps the user agent? I forget.2. The ministry of technology had a special API to block URLs on the CDN. Basically, they provided a list of URLs that would return a 451, and of course those logs also went to the government.No other country had this kind of access at the time, but it was considered critical for the business to continue to operate in China. As I understand it, these are required to comply with chinese government regulations, and other CDNs like Cloudflare and Cloudfront have also built similar capabilities. Perhaps jgrahamc can comment on what cloudflare did?I feel quite guilty about being involved with that project, but the business was set on building it, so I did what I could to limit the blast radius. I would not be surprised if someone got arrested or was killed because of it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked in an Ad-tech start-up in Berlin run by two of the most evil f*kers I&#39;ve ever encountered. I built out their principal ad auction algorithm and a lot of the back-end to support it, and all they did with it was target vulnerable groups of people at particular times of the week when they thought they were at their lowest ebb.One meeting in particular really stands out still, a social media giant that everyone knows was in town meeting the founders to sell additional personalization data. Before that meeting, I thought things the start-up were doing were a bit sketchy, maybe borderline unethical. During the meeting itself, it was more like sitting around a table with Dr. Evil and a few henchmen. They were actively, unambiguously picking vulnerable groups for ad re-targeting. And that&#39;s not even the worst of it, the meeting wraps up and one of the founders says &#34;OK guys, let&#39;s go get some beers and bring some girls&#34;. Then this despicable excuse for a man promptly walked out into the office, points at a few female employees and says &#34;You, you and you, come with us now&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is so cool! Interesting you can use normal mouthpieces.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"You can overcome the RPi scarcity by migrating the code to the Teensy platform, which aside being cheaper and less power hungry than the 2,3,4 RPi, is a lot cheaper and more easily available. Not an easy task since there&#39;s no Linux under the hood, but there are some excellent audio/midi libraries to help. They already built commercial-level synthesizers with it. By combining the breath sensor data with other pressure sensors you could end up with a very expressive instrument.https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/index.htmlhttps://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_Audio.htmlhttps://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_MIDI.htmlhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2674LdYW5I"</p>

					<h3><a href="https://devenv.sh/">Devenv.sh: Fast and reproducible developer environments using Nix</a></h3>

					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33655542">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi all, I&#39;m the author of https://devenv.sh, https://cachix.org and https://nix.dev.I&#39;ve been part of the Nix community for more than 10 years and in the last 4 years focused on making it documented, simple and accessible for any developer.After building Cachix (where you can store any software binaries with a few steps) we realized that there needs to be an intuitive interface for crafting developer environments.I&#39;m really looking forward what you build on top of devenv. We&#39;re only beginning to explore the area of what&#39;s possible, so please give as much feedback as you have."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"this, devbox, and others seem to be alternatives to `nix-env shell` or the flake-based `nix develop`. spurred i think by a desire for better UX. these are excellent for any project off-the-ground enough that you’ve run `git init` or created a repo.the adjacent area i’m struggling with is the “i want to write a tiny program to verify some conjecture, and i’ll probably throw it away an hour from now”. think codegolf competitions, if you can’t relate.the environments i create for these follow similar patterns. it’s either python with numpy, pandas and plotly, or it’s Rust with clap and serde, say. i’d love a tool where i can just `cd /tmp/my-hourlong-project` and then `devenv python` to get a python shell that’ll have everything i often use (and probably more).hearing from people who use these tools, nobody has told me that any of these can do this — except that since they crawl up the fs tree looking for their env definition maybe i could just stash some definitions at the fs root and get globally-invokable environments that way. seems hacky though: i’d hope for a method that’s more officially supported."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a long tail of issues that continue to plague Nix. Sometimes, not even the fault of the Nix project itself.Case in point for my current employer&#39;s Python shop - everyone runs PyCharm. Well, JetBrains doesn&#39;t really support Nix-based environments. See e.g. https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/PY-42461 . So basically something like this would be DOA. Is this something that someone like @domenkozar can fix? @grhmc ? I don&#39;t know."</p>

					<h3><a href="http://annas-blog.org/putting-5,998,794-books-on-ipfs.html">Putting Z-Library on IPFS</a></h3>

					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33675224">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This post really starts to show the right direction:Z-Library - &#34;the desktop app&#34;,
with built in Tor (for seeders safety), IPFS (for p2p distribution), IPNS (to download updated indexes), with local search engine (no SPOF &amp; convenience), optional at-rest file encryption, and some random pining algorithm to let users donate 1-10GB of local disk space to host random chunks of the library.It needs to be dead easy to let anyone use and contribute."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Considering the goals of IPFS, I’m surprised it has trouble at this scale. I mean, it’s supposed to be “interplanetary” but this data would fit on two hard drives. The post talks about performance problems with advertising “hundreds” of content IDs. Is it a design problem or just an early implementation problem?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m fairly sure this isn&#39;t really safe or really reliable.To my knowledge, IPFS isn&#39;t really private, in that both the nodes hosting content can be easily known, and the users requesting content can be monitored. This is bad news for something law enforcement has already taken a serious interest in.IPFS also requires &#34;pinning&#34;, which means that unless other people decide to dedicate a few TB to this out of their own initiative, what we have currently is a single machine providing data through an obscure mechanism. If this machine is taken down, the content goes with it.The amount of people that have 31 TB worth of spare storage, care about this particular issue, and are willing to get into legal trouble for it (or at least anger their ISP/host) is probably not terribly large. The work could be split up, but then there needs to be some sort of coordination to somehow divide up hosting the archive among a group of volunteers."</p>

					<h3><a href="https://trevorklee.substack.com/p/things-ive-noticed-while-visiting">Things I&#39;ve noticed while visiting the ICU</a></h3>
				</div>
				<div class="story__comments">
					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33661482">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a nurse and I find the 7th point on the post especially relevant. I will add a disclaimer that I never worked in the ICU so I can&#39;t speak for what happens in that type of unit.There is a serious issue with the flow of information in healthcare, (or at least in the U.S, I never worked elsewhere to know if it&#39;s any different). But If you find something during your shift which will be important to know later on, it will certainly be lost as soon as you are off for a few days, or even as soon as a new nurse comes on. To think of a somewhat crude example, if you find out that it is much easier to obtain a blood sample from the veins on the left arm of a patients vs the right, many nurses will still stick the right arm countless times hoping to get something.And you can leave a chart note about things like that or speak about it during report, but for the most part few people will think &#34;hm, I wonder what everybody else had to deal with.&#34; They are probably too busy handling a thousand different things happening all at once. And, even if that is not the case, from what I observed it&#39;s simply not part of how things are done. And very often patients will get (justifiably) angry, saying &#34;I&#39;ve been complaining of x thing for days!&#34; or some version of that. I think it would be much better for both patients and healthcare staff alike if there was a greater emphasis placed on focusing on the series of successes and failures that happen over the course of someone&#39;s care, not just seeing it as a single shift or a single problem happening in some isolated point in time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I noticed a lot of the same things when my dad was in the ICU.  Some additional thoughts:1. &#34;Almost every patient has delusions and nightmares&#34; I personally felt &#34;off&#34; when visiting my father.  The sounds, smells, lights and constant buzz of activity all contributed to a feeling of being in a surreal dreamworld.   Lack of sleep contributes.  I can&#39;t imagine what my father experiencing.2. Food was HORRIBLE.  One meal was a low quality hamburger on a plain, white bread bun with a slice of &#34;american cheese&#34;, fries, iceberg lettuce salad with a couple of slices of cucumber and a single slice of tomato, a container of apple sauce and glass of milk.  Lots of salad dressing and ketchup.   They wouldn&#39;t let us bring better food into the ICU and my dad didn&#39;t want to &#34;make waves&#34;.3. Family is critical.  My father got better care because I, or my brother, was there to act on his behalf.  Having obnoxious family members is worse than having none from what I saw."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; There’s no sense of a scientific method, reasoning from first principles, or even reasoning from similar cases though. It’s all shooting in the dark, and most of the time I felt like I could have done just as good a job on these longterm issues...This articulates very well what I&#39;ve usually felt when dealing with doctors. It&#39;s like the story of a programmer finding that his code outputs 5 when it should be 4, and then adding...    if(return_value == 5):
        return_value = 4

...to fix it, and being satisfied. What I want is something like in the television show House. The main character is unhinged and anti-social and takes extreme risks, but at least he demonstrates curiosity to really figure out and understand the root of what&#39;s going on. To be fair, I don&#39;t actually think that doctors lack curiosity or are incapable of doing this, the medical system as it&#39;s set up just doesn&#39;t allow it. For chronic issues, I&#39;ve usually figured them out for myself, as a layperson, by persistently keeping track of things, searching the web, reading, and experimenting over months and years."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Being accommodative of small minorities seems to be a kind, and thoughtful thing to do.However having large majorities(95%+ of the population) make concessions in order to accommodate a small group imposes a cost (however small) born by many to the benefit of a few. My questions is how do you decide where to make that trade off? What’s the cost benefit analysis? At some point where do people say the cost of accommodating this 1/100k/1m people by another 300m+ people is not a worthwhile use of societal resources?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I saw this article posted earlier and was going to comment but thought “you know what, this is obviously not HN material, I’ll just flag it”. 12 hours later, loads of upvotes and hundreds of comments. Fine.HN news is discussion about technology, start ups, and creating stupid moral panics to stir up hatred against groups you want to oppress.In this case I actually have first hand experience of this topic, my wife is currently pregnant. Not once have I seen any price of advice or information that in any way has been less useful because of inclusive language. This whole article is attacking a problem - using inclusive language - that only exists if you hate the people being included and don’t want them included. Which apart from being obviously morally repugnant is also something that seems like an odd discussion to have on a tech website. I guess we’re interested in ethics in game journalism again…"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article’s main point is that AI technology has economic  potential. It goes about this by parodying common arguments against whether such AI can develop into goal-driven beings.One example of such criticism is this five year old piece: https://www.wired.com/2017/04/the-myth-of-a-superhuman-ai/ Few are skeptical about AI technologies’ economic impact. In that sense, the article misses the ball slightly, but it’s so funny that I don’t mind.To state my point in the vein of the article: The bulldozer did change our economy. It does most, if not all, of its productive work in cooperation with a human. Turning a bulldozer on and letting it run by itself is usually a waste, and may be dangerous."</p>
