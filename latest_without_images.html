								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is one of those medical revolutions that I am waiting dearly for.Facilities that are not hospitals(to avoid the risk of  occupying medical devices that sick people need) built to _regulary_ check up otherwise healthy people for preventive care.Heck, I have so many alerts defined on my monitoring setup for servers to watch for signals of failure before they get too big. But, my own body is not observed until something bad needs treatment. Why can’t we observe ourselves medically and analyze that record for early signs of trouble before it becomes serious?!All the advancement in technology in recent years, this ought to happen sooner than later."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"0.5% false positive rate is actually quite high. I don&#39;t have the numbers, but I&#39;d be surprised if more than 1% of the people that would receive such a screening actually already have cancer, which would mean that it produces about as many false positives as false negatives.Picture a population of a million people, all receiving the test. 1% of them have cancer (unknown to them) - half of those people get a negative screening result and half get a positive one (51% successful identification), and 0.5% of the full population get a negative screening result. Those numbers are roughly equal.That doesn&#39;t make it useless by any means, but it&#39;s not nearly as &#39;specific&#39; as it sounds on paper."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those interested in reading the actual paper, this appears to be it (open access too):https://www.annalsofoncology.org/article/S0923-7534(21)02046...I’ve only skimmed it, but seen quite a few limitations, notably those with “non-malignant conditions at enrolment” (it would be nice to know more what that means), previous cancer or recent corticosteroids use were excluded. Additionally, it’s a case controlled trial which don’t always translate to screening tools (as mentioned in their own discussion).The problem with screening is that you are doing something on healthy patients, so particularly for rare cancers even a small risk of a false positive is significant. In this case it’s 99.5%. So if you test 1,000,000 people, 5000 (*correction from 500) people will come up positive. This is great for common diseases, but if it’s rare and only 1 in a million has it then you have got 5000 false positive for every 1 positive.I think this will likely be a useful test (if it translates well to a wider screening population), but it’s not as good as it first seems."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Many years ago I added the feature to xbox.com to allow you to easily cancel your Xbox Live Gold subscription. We built a UX that was ideal for consumers - a couple of clicks, no &#34;Here&#39;s what you&#39;ll be missing...&#34; screens. It was awesome.Before this feature was released you had to call Xbox support to cancel.Once word spread that you could do it on the web, huge numbers of customers, that had been stuck paying for an Xbox Live Gold subscription they weren&#39;t using, began cancelling.So our PM got a call from a VP. We were instructed to remove it from the site immediately. We fantasized about telling the VP to stick it and quitting en masse, but we knew it wouldn&#39;t change anything. We&#39;d just be replaced by someone that would.So we complied, but we all lost a little bit of our faith in Xbox that day."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Related PSA: many customer support chat integrations on websites today give the rep a real-time view of all input changes before you actually send anything.Think twice before pasting unknown clipboard contents, typing while angry, etc. Best, explicitly copy your finalized reply from another app and paste it into the chat.(I confirmed that first hand when a support person replied to specifics of my message while I was editing the phrasing.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was doing my taxes on taxact a year or two ago, when I noticed a small lag every time I switched fields.  Every time I went to the next field, a network request was being made to some third party analytics thing with the data I entered.Somewhere, in the back of my mind I know that all data I enter online is inevitably being hovered up and used for god knows what, but when you&#39;re suddenly made aware of it, it&#39;s really unnerving.Something about this makes me want to have a &#39;falling down&#39; moment.  Let me get this straight, not only is our tax system so complex and error prone i have to pay money to a third party to figure out how much I should be paying to our government, but the software company I pay then turns around and sells my data?  The government does nothing to remedy this?  It really goes to show who our government serves, and it sure as hell isn&#39;t &#39;the people&#39;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have worked in team with some kernel developers at Samsung, years ago, so let me put some perspective for those who do not understand the dynamics.In some companies, the amount of patents or Linux kernel patches you get accepted is direct measure of your success.As you know, whatever you measure becomes a target -- these guys feel very pressed to get ANY kernel commits accepted, no matter how small, irrelevant or nonsensical. Because in the very end almost nobody sees the amount of value that a company creates for Linux users. What everybody is looking at is that &#34;Company X is nth on the list of biggest kernel contributors&#34;.So &#34;KPI grabbing&#34; is meant to mean the practice of not caring for the value or quality of your contributions but rather for the count of the commits or LoC you can get accepted.This is damaging to Linux kernel developer community because it just creates work for maintainers without creating much or any value at all.These maintainers are absolutely critical resource for the project and their number and availability translates directly to how much stuff can actually be done. So no wonder people are irked by it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The year is 2050 and your dingy old toaster has finally given up it&#39;s last crumbs. You hop onto Amazon in hopes of finding a suitable replacement as there&#39;s no longer any box stores you can travel to. Dumb appliances have been phased out and newer internet connected appliances have taken over. It&#39;s better for the consumer they claim.Not wanting an overtly fancy contraption you pick a no frills unit that includes a touch screen along the side. A few hours later it arrives. Setting it up was almost as easy as your old one. Plug it in, enter your wi-fi password, and a credit card to start your free pro trial of the monthly subscription service that tweets at you when the toast is done. It says you can cancel at anytime but it requires a 5 day waiting period. It also requires access to your contacts.Tired and just wanting your toast you agree. You insert two slices of white bread and press the big red GO button on the touch screen. An electrical motor whines from inside the toaster at it begins to retract the toast into itself. There&#39;s a few seconds of silence as the toaster slowly heat ups. While awkwardly standing there you notice the touch screen flickers and begins to display a buffering icon. An ad for I Can&#39;t Believe it&#39;s Not Butter begins to play. To make matters worse you can&#39;t even ignore it by looking away due to a small tinny sounding speaker playing the company&#39;s jingle.This is your new morning routine.Welcome to the future."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I do not blame cooler screen for selling this technology to anyone. But I want everyone to consider how much it takes to bring about a technology like this to a grocery store.If this is any of the big chain groceries, the manager doesn&#39;t even have the authority to put a sticker on the glass door. This was vetted by hundreds of people and none of them thought... glass?Business class tickets were purchased, hotels were booked, months of back and forth, daily meetings. Hundreds of thousands were spent on pilot programs like this one. Still no one thought... glass?In my opinion, it&#39;s a silly idea. But I applaud the person who had this silly idea, built a company around it, got deals with screens, door, glass, and cameras manufacturing companies, and then convinced a grocery chain to buy this for their store.I would really, really love to have been in that sales pitch meeting.Edit: What bothers me the most about this, is that it will actually work. Any surface where eyes may fall on, will be replaced with an ad."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Everyone here who’s worked for some moderately large corporation knows exactly why this was done: it’s a flashy pet project for some “labs” team in an otherwise boring retailer and maybe they’ll recoup some of the cost in ads, minus whatever they lose for it being an awful idea. Some charismatic product manager sold it to execs as “being the future of connected retail” or some other BS. In a few months they’ll be removed because it’s a stupid idea.When the company that made these was analyzing their market, I have no doubt they were targeting this exact scenario knowing that even the stupidest products have a place to make a boring brick and mortar retailer think they’re doing technology."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve built robots. I&#39;ve built greenhouses. I like software and the occasional bit of farming. Thirs looks cute and fun, and I hope they iterate, but it&#39;s not really solving the right problems, and introduces its own.1 - there are no straight lines on a farm. Maybe in a hydro setup built on concrete slab, in which case, why robot?2 - needs a way to cover more ground. If it&#39;s not able to travel linearly indefinitely in one direction along a bed, there&#39;s no way to scale.3 - grit. Precision CnC mechanisms and dirt do not mix. You can&#39;t keep farm things clean (unless hydro, and even then, things get wet and caked with fertilizer salt)Ditch the linear ways for something like bike tires. There&#39;s an open source solar farm robot which rolls around weeding (can&#39;t find at the moment, maybe was a video). Not limited by a box. They need robust mechanisms which can stand up to farm abuse and are easy to service, grease, and replace (unless you hermetically seal the components, which is harder than it sounds).Weeds are actually pretty easy to manage.If someone wants to make an impact in the farm tech space, come up with a cheaper alternative for scooping and dumping dirt. A ride-on tractor can be had used for $500-800. But as soon as you start talking loaders, it&#39;s $2-3000 used, and tens of thousands for new. Also the smallest tend to be a 4 foot wide bucket and a few hundred pounds lift. I want something half or a quarter of that. Able to scoop 50 lbs of dirt, repeatedly, and dig holes/trenches. That would have a massive impact in agrarian communities around the world."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oh hey this is my industry (robots in agriculture).I don&#39;t like this. It feels way too &#34;Juicero&#34; to me. Too cute, to inconsequential. It feels likely one would spend more time on building and maintaining this thing than work it actually saves and a significant amount the benefit of having a garden is working it with you hands and watching that work grow in fruition.Bots in the farm though, they are the real deal. Reducing herbicide use by 80% or more, allowing the use of non-GMO crop while maintaining strong weed control and healthy crop, treating and optimizing every individual plant in a field, all things that will happen in the next 10 years due to robotics in the farm."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know cnc and farming, and I really don&#39;t see this product surviving. I can&#39;t find a shovel that lasts more than a few months on my small farm, I don&#39;t know how a big 3d printer is going to cut it in anything like real agricultural conditions. I would love to be wrong though, garden robots would be great, especially if they had lasers for slugs. Actually, forget the rest of the robot, all I really want is a slug laser."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I published my first Steam game on Linux as well as Windows and MacOS, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll do it again because for a single person developer (as indie as it gets) the time spent supporting Linux doesn&#39;t pay off. Within days of publishing my game I had support request emails that said &#34;so I&#39;m on this specific Red Hat version, with this oddball graphics driver and three monitors and full-screen doesn&#39;t work with your game properly&#34;. As I only officially supported Ubuntu I couldn&#39;t really help each exotic (to me) setup that came into my email inbox, and there was more than a few. Which I still think is a shame.But that was five years ago. I&#39;m pretty sure Photon supports my Windows builds on Linux better than I was ever able to do with the native executables, and at least there&#39;s that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At a Steam Dev Days event I hit up a dev from a popular flight sim that ran on Win/Mac/Linux and asked him to rank the support costs for different platforms. I was surprised by his answer. He said:Mac users were effectively the most expensive because his team was (then) spending a lot of time porting their graphics code to Metal.Linux users were the least expensive because they tended to be sophisticated users who were accustomed to solving their own problems. He cited a particular customer who he said had a solid track record of finding graphical glitches in the game, then opening bugs against Intel GPU drivers and getting them fixed.Windows users were somewhere in between.Of course we didn&#39;t discuss the opportunity cost of supporting Linux (financially probably not worth it), I&#39;m not sure how much his view was a function of (maybe) not having to personally answer support requests, or whether his experience could be generalized beyond his particular customer demographic, but I learned quite a bit from his response.==========If I ever ship my own game I hope to support Linux not because I think it&#39;s the right financial move, but because I think offering cross-platform compatibility is just part of being a good digital citizen. A lot of us lived through a time where Windows was about the only game in town, and I don&#39;t want to ever go back there. (Plus there&#39;s a selfish element: I develop on Linux, so I want to play on Linux!)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I shipped a tiny game on Steam developed entirely in GNU/Linux with Windows/MacOS/Linux builds all produced from within GNU/Linux without virtualization of other OSes.MINGW covered the Windows build, clang/osxcross for the MacOS build, and plain old gcc for Linux.  It&#39;s all oldschool autotools+pkg-config dances for the cross-compilation.  Plain C and SDL2+OpenGL under the hood, no engine.It&#39;s nice being able to do it all from my preferred GNU/Linux environment, and I was able to at least smoke test the windows builds successfully via WINE.  The main shortcoming currently is there&#39;s no MacOS WINE-equivalent that&#39;s mature enough to run a graphical GPU-accelerated video game AFAIK."</p>

People who post on marketplaces like Flippa or MicroAcquire or SideProjectors (there&#39;re dozens of them) have either:1. Realized the time it takes to maintain is not worth the revenues/profits2. Realized the income is not sustainable and are trying to cash out at the end of a great run3. Realized that some folks are willing to pay very high multiples and will list their projects at prices most (but not all) people will balk at.If you&#39;re really interested in taking over a project that&#39;s profitable, network with people, do cold emailing, and find opportunities to take over projects that the owners are simply not interested in any more.In other words, look for the elderly couple who is ready to move on from owning their profitable, outdated shop."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My hair started graying pretty much as soon as I graduated from college. It makes a lot of sense now. Around the same time, I:- bought a house (in 2007, yeesh)- got married- started my first job (which at the time felt like drinking out of a fire hose)Shortly after, my wife and I went through the stress of trying and failing to get pregnant. Then infertility treatments for several months. Then my wife had surgery. Infertility treatments no longer an option, we turned to adoption. 6 weeks later (seriously), we brought home our first child.After that, it was like kids fell into our laps every couple of years. After the second child, I struggled with a pretty severe addiction that nearly claimed my marriage. Since then we&#39;ve adopted two more. We now have kids aged 12, 9, 6 and 4.Has it been all stress all the time? Not at all. I feel incredibly blessed to be living this life. But the hair (mostly on the sides) hasn&#39;t gone back to its normal color either, so I guess either it&#39;s genetic or there&#39;s an undercurrent of stress I&#39;ve just become accustomed to.Edit: formatting"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Maybe it was a coincidence but at my last job I was so insanely stressed and burnt out. My manager was terrible, treated me like an idiot, and my ideas were stifled day in and day out.I woke up one day and seemingly overnight my beard had a grey patch - almost white, in fact. It fell out in the week after.Almost a year and a half later, after leaving that job, I took the pandemic to really focus on my stress levels and be happier (I am). The grey patch is starting to fade away and some color is beginning to return. Certainly not the stark white that was there before, and definitely not grey either.Idk if I believe it, maybe something else was happening. But it sure seemed stress related at the time.EDIT: I&#39;m &lt; 30 and my family doesn&#39;t have a history of grey hair - quite the opposite. Forgot to mention this"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Stress is terrible.Work overloaded me and caused so much stress that I had stress-induced alopecia. My beard fell out in patches, and I had random patches of hair fall out on the back of my head, almost like perfect circles. Besides that, I couldn&#39;t really enjoy myself anymore, and I would often spend my non-work time vegetating.Then there&#39;s the teeth grinding and all the damage that comes with that.The hair came back, but the damage done to my teeth is not reversible.These are just the physical damages, the damages to mental health are either still on the mend or scarred."</p>
