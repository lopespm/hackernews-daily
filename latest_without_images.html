								<p class="story__comment_others">"A great Twitter thread with many articles/resources if you want a critical lens at the global logistics supply chain.https://twitter.com/CharmaineSChua/status/137586855212986368...I found this article on the impact on super-sized ships on logistical infrastructure useful and fascinating. It describes how the creation of ships too big to fit in the Panama canal (post-PANAMAX ships) was received by 1) Panamanians 2) East Coast / Gulf Coast ports 3) West Coast ports. The Panamanians spent billions expanding their channel to bring port fees and promote attendant value-add services. Ports across the East and Gulf coasts overinvested in trying to make their port the preferred one for these new ships. Clearly, not every port can recoup investments in higher cranes and deeper harbors. There was an irrational optimism on the East Coast, as they sought to take business away from West Coast transhippers (dock in Southern California and ship to the east by train.) In response, the West Coast logistics industry sought and received a series of infrastructure improvements to make transshipment from their ports viable. So, just a few shipping companies are able to increase the size of their ships (for economies of scale) and end up having a major impact on billions of investment dollars in more than a dozen cities. Policy makers in the US aren&#39;t able to pick just a few cities to focus investment in. How can you tell a city that they aren&#39;t going to get those jobs? Perhaps the US should set a maximum ship size to prevent this wastage of resources; but one could argue the efficiencies for consumers could be worth it.https://www.ijurr.org/article/fungible-space-competition-and...The size of these ships keeps increasing at an astonishing rate. See the chart in this excellent talk: https://youtu.be/gdkvAXcZD7U?t=892Moreover, the hydrodynamic effects of these large ships in relatively shallow and narrow canals is underappreciated. We&#39;re liable to see more such incidents as ships get bigger and bigger.https://www.ft.com/content/171c92ec-0a44-4dc5-acab-81ee2620d..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Nice to see! How do they plan to monetize? I either became blind or missed it somehow. The article does say how they DON&#39;T plan on monetize:    &#34;Rest assured that Deno will remain MIT licensed. For Deno to grow and be maximally useful, it must remain permissively free. We don’t believe the “open core” business model is right for a programming platform like Deno.&#34;

There are some hints though:    &#34;If you watch our conference talks, you will find we&#39;ve been hinting at commercial applications of this infrastructure for years. We are bullish about the technology stack we&#39;ve built and intend to pursue those commercial applications ourselves. Our business will build on the open source project, not attempt to monetize it directly.&#34;

Does anyone have some insight into those? I haven&#39;t watch any Deno talk (maybe one actually?) so it feel a bit strange to make people watch technical talks to find hints of the monetization strategy.PS, if I was a rich investor I&#39;d throw money at this project even as a donation, so no complain at all, but I&#39;m very curious on the monetization plan."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Happy to see Deno get some financial backing!I&#39;ve been building my new multiplayer games website [1] with Deno over the last 4 months and apart from some minor growing pains, it&#39;s been a joy to use.The lack of unnecessary package management, and the TypeScript-by-default approach makes Web dev much nicer. We&#39;re also using TypeScript on the client-side, relying on VSCode for error reporting. We use sucrase to strip the types just as we&#39;re serving the script files, so that there is no extra build time, it feels like TypeScript is Web-native and we can share typed code with the server.[1] Not yet launched but we ran a preview past weekend with hundreds of players over WebSockets: https://twitter.com/MasterOfTheGrid/status/13757583007179735... - https://sparks.land"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I find most exciting here is:&gt; Our infrastructure makes it possible to... create custom runtimes for different applications [like] Cloudflare Worker-style Serverless FunctionsFascinated to see what happens here. The serverless / edge compute paradigm fits Javascript hand-in-glove philosophically, but until now it&#39;s always felt quite clunky to me. When I&#39;ve tried it out, I&#39;ve always been left thinking &#34;but this would just be so much easier with a server&#34;.Reading this has made it click for me why that is. A new paradigm needs a new set of tools native to that paradigm.The entire server-side JS ecosystem is currently structured around Node, a fundamentally stateful-server paradigm. You can try to abstract over it, but only so far. It&#39;s not the serverless paradigm that&#39;s clunky, per se, it&#39;s that the tools right now were built for another way of doing things.As a concrete example - Deno has an import system based on URLs, rather than on-disk node_modules. I thought that was a cool feature for convenience, less overhead, more open and sharable packages, etc. But now I realise the full intent of it. It&#39;s much more than all that, it&#39;s a fundamental shift in the paradigm: no implied dependency on stateful disk in the runtime itself."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a believer and someone who attends church regularly, this is sad but not unexpected. From my own personal experience - if the church cannot answer questions clearly, their members will look for answers somewhere else. A lot of churches unfortunately are so elementary in their teaching or turn to &#34;feel good preaching&#34; (see Elevation Church). The longterm effect is that a person ends up being tired of getting the same &#34;baby food&#34; and they look to other places. The churches where theology is solid (and clear) tend to be stronger in number and in regular attendance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"“Because here&#39;s something else that&#39;s weird but true: in the day-to day trenches of adult life, there is actually no such thing as atheism. There is no such thing as not worshipping. Everybody worships. The only choice we get is what to worship. And the compelling reason for maybe choosing some sort of god or spiritual-type thing to worship—be it JC or Allah, be it YHWH or the Wiccan Mother Goddess, or the Four Noble Truths, or some inviolable set of ethical principles—is that pretty much anything else you worship will eat you alive. If you worship money and things, if they are where you tap real meaning in life, then you will never have enough, never feel you have enough. It&#39;s the truth. Worship your body and beauty and sexual allure and you will always feel ugly. And when time and age start showing, you will die a million deaths before they finally grieve you. On one level, we all know this stuff already. It&#39;s been codified as myths, proverbs, clichés, epigrams, parables; the skeleton of every great story. The whole trick is keeping the truth up front in daily consciousness.”David Foster Wallace"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Zerodium[0], the magic string searched for in the fake user agent, is a zero-day acquisition platform, in case anyone else is wondering. The third parameter to `zend_eval_string` in the commit [1] is the &#34;filename&#34; [2] of the executed code, which is probably used for stack traces. Which is quite a strange choice, because seeing that in the logs would probably ring alarm bells immediately. Overall, this commit seems strange in its structure IMO - not in a &#34;good&#34; covert way, but in a &#34;why does it not try to hide better&#34; way.EDIT: According to zerodiums charts, this would have been a payout of up to 250k$. However, I&#39;m not quite sure what the attackers plan on cashing out on that would have been, given that the exploit would have quite obviously referenced zerodium and therefore would make the submitter the primary suspect of being the author. Maybe some APT used this &#34;simple&#34; format to disguise the actual power? But then again, it would be in their interest for the exploit to actually go through.[0] https://www.zerodium.com/[1] https://github.com/php/php-src/commit/c730aa26bd52829a49f2ad...[2] https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=78224 (only mention I found with a documented use of the parameter)[3] https://zerodium.com/program.html"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think it&#39;s a common sentiment here, 
but I&#39;m turning into a more extreme anti-advertising zealot every day.Even the large ad networks show paid content that violates what I would consider widespread ethical norms - presenting everything from hyperbolic claims to straight fraud to people with little repercussion. I&#39;m reminded of a poignant example in television, where episodes of Jeopardy! are intertwined with their shilling quackery like Prevagen to an audience using the fear of aging. Perhaps I&#39;m growing increasingly blind to any positive impacts of the discipline, but ethically I find it hard to separate the fraudsters from the engineers that enable them.I guess advertising is saving me a lot of money in the end by cultivating this hatred, and though I can&#39;t change the world this screed was therapeutic."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the reasons I have used Ubiquiti over the last few years is their product quality over other networking hardware. The inclusion of ads leads me to revisit those assumptions before my next purchase.Ads, even if self-promotion, are a bellwether for a company being desperate or greedy, neither of which bodes well for their long-term product quality, usually because it indicates sales people are making the decisions. They also often lead to a slippery slope of increasing user data collection"</p>

I posted on a thread where someone else was seeing the same problem, where a number of people gaslit me and blamed me for the problem.I still have no idea if they&#39;ve fixed their band steering.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So, I don&#39;t have time to read the entire paper, but I thought it would be interesting to share my experience from the other side. I lead the engineering for a company that does the &#34;data work&#34;, we gather terabytes of data, mostly photography and lidar, every day.So far it&#39;s been a crappy industry to be in, it seems the only way to make money is to provide the entire value chain, and this is the business model we&#39;re pivoting to.Just a bunch of photography and lidar scans isn&#39;t worth much to anyone, and it&#39;s very costly to establish a quality data stream. We had enormous capex on sensor gear, training personnel, running the operations. All this to save a couple bucks on sending an inspector physically to the site.If you do the entire value chain, you gather the data, you process it into information, and then you turn that information into actionable reports. So that means that besides running our operations, we&#39;re also doing the modeling work, and we&#39;re providing the industry specific expertise for the actual inspection. So our customers pay for knowing what is broken, where it&#39;s broken, and what the impact of that defect is.In the end, I believe we&#39;ll be very successful, but it will be because our investors were willing to take us all the way, where many other companies have simply given up on the concept."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Real story. I worked on nudity detection for mobile realtime video chat app with on-device deep learning model. (It was successful.) Should be easy: label some data, start from a good network pretrained on ImageNet (we used SqueezeNet), fine tune. The problem was that ImageNet is photos, not video frames, and distribution of video frames from mobile video is somewhat different. Incredibly large proportion of frames are either blank (camera is blocked) or ceiling (camera is misdirected). We ended up adding lots of data for blank and ceiling explicitly labeled as blank and ceiling. It became an excellent ceiling detector, detecting ceilings it never have seen before.Is there a mobile video frames dataset for labeling ceilings? Why not? I can&#39;t believe I am the only one who experienced this. Why is not a ceiling dataset worthy of, say, CVPR? It will improve mobile video on-device deep learning more than most of CVPR papers. This is a serious problem.Edit: I understand why niche datasets remain in industry and not academia. Public datasets are better if they are of general interest. But ceiling dataset is of general interest to anyone who wants to process video frames originating from blocked or misdirected camera aka smartphones, and it&#39;s hard to imagine topics of more general interest once you have obvious things like face."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yes, this is extremely common and extremely frustrating.Companies, governments, individuals come to me all the time asking how to &#34;Do AI&#34; without knowing anything about their product, data provenance, testing plans, state observability etc...Sure, you can do a toy problem with some interesting vision or NLP framework and some off the shelf data that isn&#39;t ready for production or anything serious. Who cares? That doesn&#39;t do anything novel, it doesn&#39;t actually change your product function.Chomsky said the most important thing to do as a young person is to follow the phrase &#34;Know Thyself.&#34;People who want to do AI need to &#34;Know Thy-data and product architecture&#34; first.I did a talk last year on exactly this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jK-SBu1iiHo"</p>
