No to mention that my work or hobbies don&#39;t often interface with 3D modeling.So I have been thinking about what makes this project so special. I think it&#39;s the fact that the community owns it. So you don&#39;t have to ask for permission to do anything.

I remember the days when time between significant releases was measured in years, not months. The progress they&#39;ve made in recent years — particularly since Epic Games gave them a $1.2 million Epic MegaGrant — has been impressive, and encouraging to watch.Thank you to all who fund Blender, and thank you especially to the people who make it.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There is a Frankfurt-based toy store owner who has been very vocal on Youtube about the quality and value problems in recent Lego sets. Lego has sued him multiple times but Streisand effect set in and he has gained a large audience.If anybody who understands German langauge is up for some great irony from a charismatic toy professional on this topic, you should have a look.WARNING: You will waste some hours on this..  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9OKWm_x2RI&amp;t=1504s"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I saw a term in the comments: AFOL. I had to look it up: Adult Fan Of Legos.I loved legos as a kid and would spend hours building stuff. Now the kits seem more like models to be assembled and put on display and not touched rather than “a paint brush of blocks” where I can use my imagination. It lost my interest. My attention is now on software where I feel I can build anything. I liken it to my lego experience as a child.I don’t necessarily think there’s a right or wrong thing here. It’s interesting to note how our mind changes as we age and grow older. The ”do anything” mentality get displaced with something else. This would make for an interesting PhD topic. :)I found another quote from a related article that captured this feeling.    “It’s like a blast to the past, straight to our childhoods,” said Deason, 40, who lives in Connellsville, Pa. “It took me by surprise, but it makes sense: Life is so structured. But with Lego, you can do anything.”

    Deason has a few million Lego pieces, which she organizes by type and color. The Star Wars and Architecture sets, she says, are the most popular among adults, who almost always look for the instruction manuals.

    “The younger kids come in and it’s all about their imaginations — playing pretend, building zombie towns,” she said. “But at some point that gets lost. The adults seem to value the final finished project. That’s where they get their satisfaction.”"</p>

That they have fans that can catch this issue and explain it so well is another testament to the standards they&#39;ve maintained.Can we call &#34;lego instructions&#34; an example of software design? I think we must. Programs designed to run on meat CPUs of unknown specs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The majority of YouTube traffic comes from mobile devices (this can be observed in Google Ads for any video campaign), which is losing market share because of Tictoc.Google will do whatever it takes to monetize every inch of their investment. By turning off dislikes, users will be forced to engage with additional content.This is also visible on the other side of the spectrum - Google is pushing heavily integrated campaign products (e.g. Performance Max Campaigns), which include non-performing channels as display and video (in comparison to search), which can&#39;t be turned off.At this point they can, as they are a monopoly, but I hope they will get burned, as they are introducing more and more dark patterns, which result in lower than poor user experience.My take on this - AdBlock relentlessly, support creators directly. Switch platforms eventually - there&#39;s choice out there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hacker News has a similar problem with comments:  net_votes = up_votes - down_votes

You need at least two of the above variables to get an idea of both the direction and magnitude of the voting. Hacker News provides only one: net_votes. YouTube used to provide up_votes and down_votes, effectively providing all three. Now YouTube has reduced its information to up_votes, so they&#39;re now down to one variable in the equation, as Hacker News has been all along.The difference between 102+/100- votes and 2+/0- votes is large, but invisible on this site. I think it would be better for HN to go to where YouTube was, giving us an idea of both the net vote and the level of activity. Like up/down or up/total or net/total."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Likes and dislikes are a horrible way to judge a video, ime.  I don&#39;t know who liked or disliked a video or for what reasons.  A like by someone may be a good reason for me to watch the video where a like by someone else might be an excellent reason not to watch it.  Similar for dislikes.  Of the two, I guess I prefer likes.  People who dislike videos are usually upset about something specific, often things I don&#39;t really care much about.  People who like something generally actually like it, as far as I&#39;ve seen.When I&#39;m considering whether I might like to watch a video, I do the unthinkable and just give it a go for a few minutes if it looks like it might be interesting or entertaining.  I don&#39;t really need aggregated opinions from random people on the internet to help me make my decision on whether I like it or not.  I couldn&#39;t, for example, tell you if I&#39;m currently seeing dislikes on videos even though I&#39;ve watched a fair few of them recently."</p>

Google how to fix something and their docs are missing, outdated, and often in broken english.The screen itself is big but slow to refresh and in most modes leaves traces of the previous pages. They have a manual button to full refresh the page, but a user shouldn’t have to do that.It’s not a certified android device so you have to jump through a bunch of somewhat insecure hoops to get the play store installed and log in.Privacy: There privacy statement basically says “lol we promise to be private k?” So I want to run this thing through wireshark to see how true that is.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I enjoyed Sam Newman&#39;s take on this capability [1]&gt; Great to see AWS providing direct data coupling as a service. /s&gt; This service allows you to directly map a GraphQL endpoint to a database table. It’s like putting getters and setters on an object and claiming your encapsulating private variables. The end result is coupling between GraphQL clients and the underlying datasource.&gt; Information hiding is a key concept in independent change. Can I change the provider (of the GraphQL) endpoint independent of the clients? Directly exposing internal data structure makes this very difficult.And [2]:&gt; So a few people have asked why I have this snarky response. What is my problem with this service? Well, to be clear, it’s not an issue with GraphQL, it’s an issue with direct coupling with underlying datasources #thread&gt; The service as advertised makes it simple to map a GraphQL definition against a database. Now, what’s the problem with this? Well, the devil here is in the detail. But fundamentally it comes down to how important information hiding is to you.&gt; ... see the thread for more ...[1] https://twitter.com/samnewman/status/1346541251617828877

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For those unfamiliar with ITA Matrix, it was for a long time the go-to flight search tool for the most dedicated flight hackers, points hackers, etc.It was built by ITA Software [1][2] in the early-mid 2000s (the earliest mention I can find of it is in 2004 [3]) to test and showcase the capabilities of their flight search platform. I once heard that ITA and other consumer-facing flight search companies had tested that kind of UI with ordinary users, but found that not enough people understood or liked it enough for them to justify making it a mainstream interface.Hipmunk, a YC-backed flight search site that launched in 2010, was heavily influenced by the ITA Matrix UI, after co-founder Adam Goldstein had found Matrix to be the best way for him to find flights when travelling around the world for college debating competitions. And while Hipmunk did a good job of being more consumer-friendly and popular than Matrix had been, sadly they didn&#39;t gain enough traction to make it as a standalone company, and after being acquired by SAP/Concur, it was shut down last year.It&#39;s an interesting, and perhaps depressing case of a product design concept being far superior to what&#39;s available in the mainstream for a certain class of user, but cannot gain enough mainstream acceptance to be a viable business or even a well-supported service for those who love it. And far more than most other product categories, flight search has huge infrastructure costs, so it&#39;s very difficult to economically sustain niche products (from grim personal experience of being part of a team trying to build a novel flight search product ourselves).In this case it&#39;s just lucky that Google owns the infrastructure and has enough enthusiasm internally to keep it going to some extent.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITA_Software[2] https://xconomy.com/boston/2008/12/17/ita-software-the-trave...[3] https://www.fodors.com/community/europe/customs-question-sea..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"ITA Matrix is still my go-to for booking flights:https://matrix.itasoftware.com/Playing with this version, it&#39;s a little easier to use, but I don&#39;t see any functionality not in the regular version. Still, if it means Google is investing in Matrix, that&#39;s a good thing. I always worry at some point it will be killed."</p>

Based on hardware costs (significant) and power costs (insignificant) you’re looking at a hardware ROI at about 6 months from the $.65 per hour price. AWS has an estimated 60% gross profit margin, so from there it’s probably possible to estimate some other interesting things about their costs, utilization rate and 
depreciation schedule.Edit: Sorry, my napkin math assumed a unstated utilization rate of 40 hours per week, but that’s not a great assumption due to the 24 hour minimum. Still, some proportion of machines will be idle, though 75% idle seems like a bad guess."</p>
