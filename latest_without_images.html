								<p class="story__comment_others">"Proof of Stake is already how our current financial system works. The people with the most money make the decisions. Proof-of-Work is provably resistant to this, as evidenced by the 2017 blocksize debate where almost every large miner and bitcoin company wanted to change the protocol and it was fought off through grassroots efforts. A PoS currency will be controlled by a cabal of US financial institutions, and indirectly by the US regulatory system. Be careful what you wish for."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A good friend of mine at Google is the technical lead of this project (he has a Phd Princeton, and was a professor before joining Google).I&#39;ve tried it in person and it was truly amazing.  They used some very fancy tech when I saw the demo, so I&#39;m thrilled it is finally being announced and possibly shared with a larger audience.Explanation of why it is amazing:  It totally fools your perception. No glasses or goggles--but rather an 8k display with special glass that allows your different eyes to see different pixels (a light field).They also optimize the sound, and the rest, so as all the testimonials point out, you actually feel like the person is in front of you.It also works for the &#34;cube&#34; around them, so if they hold up some object, it also feels like that is in front of you.Amazing..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On a related note, I wanted to share my amazing experience with a similar but lo-fi tech.My mom and dad for the past 2-3 years have mostly lived in two separate countries (due to work reasons) and I could tell they miss each other quite a bit.I got both of them an Echo Show 10&#34; device each and set it up for them. I don&#39;t think I can explain how our lives have changed for the better, just based on this simple piece of tech.The Echo Show is now pretty much constantly on video call for 14-16 hours a day in the living room of both houses and it has become an extension of the one another; a window into the other house. The audio and mics are good enough that at times you genuinely forget the other person is not in the same room. This has truly helped them, especially during Covid times.It&#39;s actually good enough that my parents have their morning tea together practically almost the same way they used to when they were physically together. They&#39;ve told me multiple times &#34;I don&#39;t know how we could&#39;ve lived without this Alexa thing&#34;.If Google can eventually get the prices down to reasonable levels, I really think people would be shocked at how fast this thing becomes part of our daily lives."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is cool as hell, but I have to say I feel like we&#39;re solving top-level problems when most consumers don&#39;t even seem to be getting solutions to the most basic pain-points.For me, the problem with video-calling isn&#39;t the image-quality.  It&#39;s all the much more mundane technological problems - high latency, lag-spikes caused by bad ISPs, failed noise-cancellation for people who don&#39;t use headsets for audio, bad wifi routers cutting out, etc.First thing I did when I realized we were going to be WFH long-term was buy myself a $100 gaming headset.  Next thing I did was get all my home computer stations wired with Cat 6.That stuff is far more fundamental and far less interesting than 3D telepresence, but it&#39;s the real unsexy problem that so many people are suffering through this pandemic.Even simple things like latency make simple, natural reactions agonizing.  Talkcover and crosstalk is incessent and I&#39;ve developed a filthy habit of just talking over people because otherwise it&#39;s a solid 20 seconds of &#34;you go no you go&#34; caused by awful latency.  I&#39;ve had to defuse angry reactions by co-workers who feel they&#39;re being interrupted by other co-workers and explain to them that the latency makes interruptions feel worse than they are.I&#39;ve tried to push friends to join me on my private Mumble server where the latency is near-nil and the call-quality is excellent, but there&#39;s always one person who doesn&#39;t have a working headset and wants to just use a laptop or tablet mic with no feedback-cancelling that destroys the conversation through echos (plus Mumble&#39;s auth system is needlessly bewildering).Then with video, problems are similar but less impactful - cheap cameras, poor lighting, compression artifacts, poor sync with the audio, etc.  And it&#39;s infuriating because every person has a wonderfully powerful camera in their pocket right now - and there&#39;s software to connect them but it&#39;s just too tricky for most people.Good on Google for taking an interest in the subject, but I feel like they&#39;re decorating the apex of the technological pyramid while most people are pushing stones around at the bottom."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The article talks about Core Web Vitals in passing. That&#39;s the major change here. Two posts from May 2020 talk about them more- https://blog.chromium.org/2020/05/introducing-web-vitals-ess... introduces these metrics, what they mean and how to measure them.- https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2020/05/evaluating... talks about how the search engine experience will change&gt; The change for non-AMP content to become eligible to appear in the mobile Top Stories feature in Search will also roll out in May 2021. Any page that meets the Google News content policies will be eligible and we will prioritize pages with great page experience, whether implemented using AMP or any other web technology, as we rank the results.&gt; In addition to the timing updates described above, we plan to test a visual indicator that highlights pages in search results that have great page experience.Seems like a positive change. It will mean extra work as developers improve the performance of their sites. But having clear metrics to improve will make that work tractable. Also, advocating for that work to senior management will be easier when it&#39;s so clearly tied to SEO.The upshot is that ordinary users will experience a more performant web. Not overnight but over a few years, like the shift to HTTPS and supporting mobile web versions. Both of those changes were driven in part by the desire for better ranking on Google."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This won&#39;t really do anything for availability or reducing scalper pricing. Miners are a sizeable proportion of sales but far from the majority. Gamers will be able to buy more of these GPUs but less of the non-LHR or AMD GPU&#39;s. GPU prices won&#39;t actually change.The real reason Nvidia is doing this is that when mining profitability inevitably drops, either because of a crypto price crash or Ethereum moving to Proof of Stake, the miners will flood the used market and ruin Nvidia&#39;s profits for a few quarters. Nvidia is trying to get miners to buy mining-only cards, because those can&#39;t be sold to gamers down the line. They&#39;d rather mining cards become e-waste in a few years than get resold.People think Nvidia is doing this to try to help them get better prices now, but really Nvidia is trying to extract more money from gamers in the long term."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Does this behavior anger anyone else on a deep level? I get that its hard to buy GPUs right now, but this seems like such an attack on general purpose computing.Hardware manufactures already segment features between consumer and busness grade parts that the silicon itself is capable of, such as virtualization, but restricting what algorithms one can run is a whole new level.I am pretty sure my next GPU is going to be AMD due to this behavior by Nvidia."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When OpenAI trained their Dota model to beat people 1v1 mid SF, they had a contest at The International (the big yearly dota tournament, RIP) like &#34;can you beat OpenAI&#39;s new bot?&#34; and had a big bucket of prizes for anyone that could.By the end of the night, the bucket was empty. People learned to cheese the bot by running &#34;out of bounds&#34;, so to speak -- normally in a 1v1, you&#39;re supposed to stay close to your opponent, since they&#39;ll be getting stronger if you leave. But the bot didn&#39;t know how to deal with it when you snuck behind it (normally an insane maneuver, almost guaranteed to cost you the game in normal play) and prevented his army (called &#34;creeps&#34;) from running to the middle lane. (All you have to do is go wave your hand at them, and they mindlessly chase you.)People did that over and over, and your own army would eventually overwhelm the bot and win. :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"An astonishing insert:&gt;A good example of human exploitation of the engine&#39;s failings is GM Hikaru Nakamura&#39;s defeat of Rybka in the following three-minute blitz game from the Internet Chess Club. Nakamura cleverly locks the position so that progress is impossible for Rybka, then he offers two exchange sacrifices to the engine. With the position locked, the engine&#39;s rooks have no value, but the engine thinks it has a winning material advantage. With a draw by the 50-move rule approaching, the engine sacrifices a pawn to avoid a draw, but this proves a huge mistake as Nakamura is then able to win the game, an incredible achievement!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When watching the WC games, I&#39;ve seen it happen that a move wasn&#39;t considered as a top move by the engine, but once played the engine realizes it&#39;s actually crushing. Something about the heuristics used to prune the vast search space can make it miss sacrifices or seemingly sub-optimal moves that temporarily weakens the perceived position but has a huge payoff in the end. But humans find them. Of course, given enough time and depth the engine will eventually circle back and try the move. But it has no intuition.Also, an engine without an endgame tablebase can be pretty stupid. There are certain rules one can deduct when there are few pieces left, but a min/max engine will search forever, not knowing the patterns."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I worked with a number of brilliant people at Bell Labs through the 1980s/1990s. The most comfortably competent among them, the most productive among them, were also the least abrasive. They were also the most self deprecating.Not just one or two, but the majority of them. To the point that the aggressive geniuses stood out. And I worked for/with two abrasive ones as well, so I know the difference.The same was true for the two startups I worked at after that, and Qualcomm, and now the third startup where I work.The really productive geniuses in each situation were easy to work with, I think largely, because of their confidence in their own grasp of the subject at hand. They had nothing to prove, they knew that, and it showed. The difficult people were never stupid, far from it, but they felt like they needed to defend everything they did, every decision they made, and that made working with them less productive.With the gentle geniuses, if you thought you came up with something that was an improvement on what was being done, they would look at it honestly, and if it was not better, they would calmly explain why, and if it was better, they would acknowledge it right out and discuss how to merge that into the current work.The &#39;less gentle&#39; ones would take pride in pointing out the flaws in your idea if you were wrong, and if you were right, would fight you over whether it had any real value at all, then would stiff arm you as far as getting it accepted as a change."</p>

Sure. But the folks who truly stand out in my mind are a level higher. They&#39;re the ones at the top of their game, who know how to demand &amp; command excellence, without being jerks about it.I&#39;m reminded of this episode of &#34;The Chef Show&#34; where Jon Favreau compliments Roy Choi behind his back. He tells Bill Burr that he had followed Roy around for a full day, going to all his restaurants and food trucks, and not once did Roy raise his voice to his staff. It&#39;s pretty cool to see how much admiration one artist/leader has for the other, not because of their technical skills but because they choose to be kind.I don&#39;t think we need to settle for being &#34;fierce nerds&#34;."</p>

People like him contribute more than other people, it&#39;s alright to to be fierce, can&#39;t speak the &#34;truth,&#34; etc.Whenever there is dichotomous thinking, cognition has moved away from clarity. If it were me, I&#39;d be asking myself, What is being defended? (This kind of question can be a multi-decade inquiry.)Although most of us are easily baited into self-justification or self-promotion, I think going down that path it is ultimately a distraction from doing real work and knowing who you are."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is really interesting. Prior to this, Firefox&#39;s isolation model was much weaker than Chrome&#39;s due to only having a pool of 8 content processes.

This seems much less resource intensive than Chrome&#39;s model while still delivering similar security properties.[1] https://hacks.mozilla.org/2021/05/introducing-firefox-new-si..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When Chrome was new and shiny, I used it for a time. Then, the first time I found myself needing to kill Chrome because it was completely locked up, I found myself staring at a wall of chrome processes in the task list, not knowing which one I needed to kill. At the time, I thought the idea of a separate process for each tab was silly. Though, with Firefox moving towards this model, I guess the engineers at Google were prescient in the correctness of that tradeoff.I do use a lot of tabs, so I fear I&#39;m going to find myself facing the same problem I faced with Chrome: a site misbehaves and locks things up, crap, which process do I kill? A way of tracking which tab maps to which process would be nice, so the next time I trip over a badly-coded page, I don&#39;t have to kill everything just to get my browser to respond again. Lazyweb question to y&#39;all: is there a feature in Chrome or Firefox that can do this (mapping tab/page -&gt; process), or have I just stumbled upon a side-project idea?"</p>
