								<p class="story__comment_others">"The professor gets exactly what they want here, no?&#34;We experimented on the linux kernel team to see what would happen. Our non-double-blind test of 1 FOSS maintenance group has produced the following result: We get banned and our entire university gets dragged through the muck 100% of the time&#34;.That&#39;ll be a fun paper to write, no doubt.Additional context:* One of the committers of these faulty patches, Aditya Pakki, writes a reply taking offense at the &#39;slander&#39; and indicating that the commit was in good faith[1].Greg KH then immediately calls bullshit on this, and then proceeds to ban the entire university from making commits [2].The thread then gets down to business and starts coordinating revert patches for everything committed by University of Minnesota email addresses.As was noted, this obviously has a bunch of collateral damage, but such drastic measures seem like a balanced response, considering that this university decided to _experiment_ on the kernel team and then lie about it when confronted (presumably, that lie is simply continuing their experiment of &#39;what would someone intentionally trying to add malicious code to the kernel do&#39;)?* Abhi Shelat also chimes in with links to UMN&#39;s Institutional Review Board along with documentation on the UMN policies for ethical review. [3][1]: Message has since been deleted, so I&#39;m going by the content of it as quoted in Greg KH&#39;s followup, see footnote 2[2]: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-nfs/YH%2FfM%2FTsbmcZzwnX@kroah...[3]: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-nfs/3B9A54F7-6A61-4A34-9EAC-95..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some clarifications since they are unclear in the original report.- Aditya Pakki (the author who sent the new round of seemingly bogus patches) is not involved in the S&amp;P 2021 research. This means Aditya is likely to have nothing to do with the prior round of patching attempts that led to the S&amp;P 2021 paper.- According to the authors&#39; clarification [1], the S&amp;P 2021 paper did not introduce any bugs into Linux kernel. The three attempts did not even become Git commits.Greg has all reasons to be unhappy since they were unknowingly experimented on and used as lab rats. However, the round of patches that triggered his anger *are very likely* to have nothing to do with the three intentionally incorrect patch attempts leading to the paper. Many people on HN do not seem to know this.[1] https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~kjlu/papers/clarifications-hc...."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wow, that video made my day. This bit is key:&gt; &#34;For example, by including a specially formatted but otherwise innocuous file in an app on a device that is then scanned by Cellebrite, it’s possible to execute code that modifies not just the Cellebrite report being created in that scan, but also all previous and future generated Cellebrite reports from all previously scanned devices and all future scanned devices in any arbitrary way (inserting or removing text, email, photos, contacts, files, or any other data), with no detectable timestamp changes or checksum failures. This could even be done at random, and would seriously call the data integrity of Cellebrite’s reports into question.&#34;They&#39;ve may have just got a lot evidence collected using Cellebrite from phones with (or without) Signal installed on them thrown out of court.I don&#39;t recall the details, but there was an absolute unsubstantiated speculative and surely fictional rumor of at least one entirely theoretical zero-day non-gif formatted image file that exploited a similar class of vulnerability in what was probably not a market leading tool used tangentially for the same purposes, floating around well over a decade ago as well.I for one am very glad that these hypothetical issues have almost surely been fixed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is truly a hacker’s retort.It attacks Cellebrite&#39;s ability to operate by casting doubt on the reports generated by the product that their customers may wish to use in court.It places them in legal peril from Apple, and removes any cover Apple would have to not take legal action. (I assume someone at Apple knew they were shipping their DLLs?)It makes a thinly-veiled threat that any random Signal user&#39;s data may actively attempt to exploit their software in the future and demonstrates that it&#39;s trivial to do so.edited to add a bonus one:Publish some data about what they are doing to help create a roadmap for any other app that doesn&#39;t want their data to be scanned."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Cellebrite doesn&#39;t even have a bug bounty programme or contact to report their bugs.Last year I&#39;ve managed to gain partial access to one of their systems and it took me weeks emailing their internal email addresses to finally fix the bug. They were total ass about it.Now I&#39;ve got complete access to their entire database and I don&#39;t know what do. Can HN advise?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a great statement, they confirm they&#39;re aware of the issue, they acknowledge the concerns and they set out their intention to gather the full facts whilst suspending the operation of the research in the meantime. They also acknowledge the systematic way the need to deal with this.I hope their follow up is as thorough but I want to applaud this, it&#39;s a good approach."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I found these statements by the associate department head interesting: 
https://twitter.com/lorenterveen/status/1384955467051454466&gt; I do work in Social Computing, and this situation is directly analogous to a number of incidents on Wikipedia quite awhile ago that led to that community and researchers reaching an understanding on research methods that are and are not acceptable.and https://twitter.com/lorenterveen/status/1384966202301337603&gt; Yes! This was an IRB &#39;failure&#39;. Again, in my area of Social Computing, it&#39;s been clear for awhile that IRBs often do not understand the issues and the potential risks/harms of doing research in online communities / social media.An interesting question is IMHO who people actually tried to contact in the first round of this getting publicity (and I guess how many did so at all), and if leadership should thus have been aware earlier that there was controversy worth looking into."</p>

By only banning the &#34;US government&#34; in the &#34;purchase&#34; of the data, it doesn&#39;t prevent acquiring the same data from another governmental body (Canada buys the data and shares with US Intelligence community, suddenly &amp; mysteriously trade relations with Canada improve).So many loopholes, the bill becomes &#39;feel good&#39; legislation instead of effective legislation."</p>

I have seen so many places where comments are enabled but even good comments are not replied to, especially when the post is from 5 years ago.Also, trying to ensure the correct quality of comments is time-consuming. If someone asks &#34;Why would I use C#?&#34;, it might seem low quality and won&#39;t be published but what if someone asks &#34;You are using C# but Go would make a lot of this easier&#34;, it might warrant publishing and even a reply but how many people really want to start a long discussion with a stranger about the merits of different languages?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Neat! I checked out your source code, and if there&#39;s one comment I have, it&#39;s the way you query for comments. Currently, response times are around 300-400 ms for just 79 bytes of data. That&#39;s likely because you recursively fetch nested comments from a serverless function, which potentially has to make multiple network request to talk to the database. Coincidentally, a past Disqus employee has a great write up on the faster solution (recursive CTE): https://cra.mr/2010/05/30/scaling-threaded-comments-on-djang...Regardless, great work! Choosing Svelte to hit that 4.7kb mark is super sweet!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t like ORMs, but Prisma is one of the better ones. It avoids a lot of shortcomings of popular ORMs. I hope they find a way to make it work as a company. I&#39;ve been following them over the years from the beginning of their journey through various pivots.To use an ORM effectively you must learn both the API of the ORM and SQL. It does not absolve you from learning SQL, which I think was one of the unstated attractions to junior developers. Then you have to map between the API of the ORM and how it translates that to SQL under the hood. Then you have to understand how it handles caching and sessions and how that all works under the hood. This has been the source of so much complexity and so many bugs over the years that I no longer think the benefits are worth the cost. As always, there are exceptions and caveats, but I now believe it&#39;s better to use SQL directly than to use an ORM. In general there is too much complexity in all the layers of abstraction in software development these days, and I think the industry is strangely blind to the consequences of this. Complexity is death to software, and it should not be taken on lightly. The entire craft of a software engineer boils down to eliminating complexity and simplifying problems, the better you can do that, the more productive an engineer you will be.[1][1] https://github.com/sqljoy/sqljoy/blob/master/docs/pages/orm...."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I LOVE Prisma. I’ve used Django, SQLAlchemy, Sequelize,  Knex, and TypeORM in the past. all had rough edges that continually frustrated me or didn’t provide the functionality i needed.Prisma is different. It’s absolutely got rough edges, but the extremely strong type safety makes Sequelize look like a joke. The query engine itself, written in rust, combines and optimizes queries inside every tick of the event loop so GraphQL N+1 issues are a thing of the past.Also, the team and community behind it are amazing! I never thought having an active dev community behind an ORM would be important, but as the author of Sequelize-Typescript was forced to abandon it late last year and the author of TypeORM was also pretty much absent, Prisma was a breath of fresh air. I REALLY hope they can find a way to build a sustainable business out of it. Support packages, feature development contracts, something to keep them financially incentivized to keep making it better.Happy to answer any questions about my experience using it if anyone has any."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some people are quoting the recent Tesla safety report [1] as evidence that Autopilot is on average much safer than a human driver. This is a classic case of the Simpson&#39;s Paradox [2].On the first look it seems that Autopilot is 4x safer than driving without any safety features (1 accident every 4.19 million miles vs 0.978 million miles). However, the data used to compute the stats is different in two important ways:1. Autopilot cannot be always activated. This means that is some particularly difficult situations, the driver needs to drive himself. These are more dangerous situations in general.2. If a driver disengages Autopilot to avoid an accident and engages it again straight away on a 10 miles drive, then you will have 9.99 miles driven on Autopilot without accident. The statistic misses the cases where the human driver intervened to avoid an accident.This means that we are comparing the same measure (accidents) on different datasets and therefore in different conditions. This is dangerous, because it may lead us to wrong and often opposite conclusions (see Simpson&#39;s Paradox [2]).I&#39;m not saying that Autopilot isn&#39;t safer than a human driver, given that the driver is at the steering wheel and alert, but that this data doesn&#39;t lead to that conclusion. If the driver is not sitting at the driver seat, then it is certainly much more dangerous.[1] https://www.tesla.com/VehicleSafetyReport
[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Authorities tried to contact Tesla for advice on putting out the fire; it’s not clear whether they received any response.This will become a massive issue in the years to come unless we find a way not only to drastically reduce the number of crashes but also massively improve reliability.High voltage battery fires are probably the worst kind of fire a regular emergency responder would have to deal with, between the hard to put out fire and the risk of electric shock. It also causes some massive damage to the surroundings (the actual road surface, surrounding cars, or any garage unfortunate to house the car at that time).Today very few emergency responders are even trained to properly deal with such a fire, and it&#39;s a topic really lagging behind everywhere compared to the rate EVs are popping up on the streets."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"“They just get too used to it. That tends to be more of an issue. It’s not a lack of understanding of what Autopilot can do. It’s [drivers] thinking they know more about Autopilot than they do.”Hmm, that seems like a rather stark contradiction.Elon I think has some character flaws and when people are dying it&#39;s not the time to be defensive. I&#39;m one of the least naturally empathetic people I know and yet I wouldn&#39;t be talking about anything other than condolences.Finally he can&#39;t continue to defend the term &#39;autopilot&#39; - in Public Communications, you&#39;re talking the masses, the lowest common denominator, and the &#39;laziest mode&#39; of even high functioning people - you gotta use words that will shape outcomes. &#39;Autopilot&#39; is just a bad choice - he needs to change it."</p>
