								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"While depression can certainly be caused by chemical imbalance and not because of how your unconscious mind impacts/limits your experience of life, I took the approach that exploring my subconscious through therapy was the way to get out.For me it worked very well and I think the journey is an amazing one to go on. Building from the ground up and understanding all the foundations within. I always wonder about treatments which don&#39;t have this benefit, although the results in terms of lifestyle change sound extremely positive.One of the hardest parts of therapy is diagnosis of what to work on. Even though an issue will be &#34;presenting&#34; itself clearly, it can often be a bit of a decoy. For example, a lack of self-esteem is often a useful derivative of an unconscious fear of upsetting others. Low self-esteem =&gt; avoid situations/behaviours that upset others.During therapy I found dreams, when analysed outside of the &#34;conventional&#34; Freudian/Jungian frameworks provided a simple and accurate method of reaching the root diagnosis (the fear of upsetting others vs. the decoy issue of low self-esteem).I got a bit obsessed by the topic and wrote a paper on it which can be downloaded here: https://psyarxiv.com/k6trzAnd was discussed on HN here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19143590"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"“I don’t procrastinate anymore,” he added. “I’m sleeping better. I completely quit alcohol. I’m walking my dog and playing the guitar again, for nothing more than the sheer joy of it.”  Most importantly, he said, “I’m remaining positive and being respectful of others. These are big changes in my life.”Serious question: are these typical signs of depression?  Now I&#39;m wondering if I have depression."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; “The treatment, known as Stanford accelerated intelligent neuromodulation therapy (SAINT) or simply Stanford neuromodulation therapy, is an intensive, individualized form of transcranial magnetic stimulation. In the study, remission typically occurred within days and lasted months. The only side effects were temporary fatigue and headaches.”&gt; “Twenty-nine people with treatment-resistant depression participated in the study: About half received SAINT, and the rest underwent a placebo procedure that mimicked the real treatment. After five days of treatment, 78.6% of the participants in the treatment group were no longer depressed, according to several standard methods of evaluation. “It’s quite a dramatic effect, and it’s quite sustained,” said Alan Schatzberg, MD, the Kenneth T. Norris, Jr. Professor in Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, who was a co-author of the study.”Makes me wonder what percentage of the placebo group improved?&gt; The transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration requires six weeks of once-daily sessions. Only about half of patients who undergo the treatment improve, and only about a third experience remission from depression."</p>

You literally cannot pay for it. If you do, it becomes something else.This is really the crux. Everyone is mad there’s no money in writing free/os software, but if there was money it wouldn’t be free/os software. It would just be like what we do at our day jobs.You can write the code someone else wants and get paid for it (aka a day job). You also have the option to write the code YOU want to write, but in this case you’ll need to figure out a plan for making money on your own."</p>

And that a better way to frame the cultural argument is &#34;XYZ is my responsibility to society.&#34;I don’t know if it’s the book he’s talking about, but Simone Weil makes this argument in the beginning of The Need for Roots[+]—that the correct way to think about our relationship to society isn’t “rights” (someone else’s problem) but obligations (our problem).[+] https://antilogicalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/need-r..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Those of us who have been shooting large digital cameras for the past decade and are some times sad that our photos often come out unsharp in poor light compared to smartphones can at least take some joy in this “no free lunch” demonstration.If this is due to stabilization and not some background blur face detection then it’s probably not something you can (or would want to) disable. Taking a telephoto shot with a tiny sensor in something other than great light (even a heavy overcast is often not enough) will require a lot of software processing. I’m
not sure exactly what happened here but I’m pretty sure everyone asking for “unmodified raw photos” to be produced don’t understand what they are asking for. Those “unmodified” photos would be unusable in most cases outside very bright conditions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I sometimes hang out on mountainbike forums.A user posts that despite a new chain and setting up their rear derailleur according to instructions gear-changes are clunky or the chain skips when applying power on the pedals.The usual reply from the forum members is then to send a photo of the cassette since excessive wear there leads to these problems.This used to clearly show that the user needed to replace their worn cassette too.Lately these photos of cassettes can look all mangled. Like ML tried to “enhance” mountains or the back of an alligator or some other structure from nature on to the cassette.This has to be a problem in all sorts of technical trouble-shooting."</p>

Of course it most of the time makes the images look better, and cameras are a big selling point on a phone.But I don&#39;t like how my photos of people suddenly have a filter applied to the faces, how a picture of leaves during fall have vibrance exaggerated, how the sky looks clearer than it really did."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In my 1980s version of Empire, all the global variables were kept contiguously in one source file. To save/restore the game, it just took the address of the first one, the address of the last one, and blitted it to a disk file, and blitted it back.Very fast &amp; easy.Of course, it broke when COMDATs were introduced.I did a similar thing with my text editor. The colors were configurable. The usual way was to have a configuration file, which the editor would read upon startup. But floppy disk systems were unbearably slow. So what I did was take the address of the configuration data in the data segment. I&#39;d work backwards to where those bytes were in the EXE file, and patch the EXE file. This worked great!Until the advent of virus scanners, which broke that. Virus scanners hated self-modifying EXE files."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminded me of the old days working in Windows 3.1 and my first professional project was to write a SOCKS client that could be loaded up and intercept all calls to Winsock&#39;s connect() function.  It needed to do this without modifying the other programs and it had to happen at the DLL level and not the VxD layer where our IP stack ran.Turns out there was an undocumented Windows API function along the lines of &#34;AliasCsToDsRegister&#34; or something like that - I&#39;ve tried to find a reference to it but I can&#39;t find it.  It allowed me write into the code segment (the CS was global and read only - as it was shared among all processes)  and replace the first few bytes of the connect function call with a jump to my code which would then put it back, make the call to the socks server, do some other magic, put my jump hook back in and the return to the caller.  Good times!Kind of surprised I remember this and more so that it actually worked."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember doing exactly this to get code injection working on GNU/Linux systems!  I made a library injection library in college for some coursework, which involved copying a C function into a code cave on a remote process and getting the remote process to execute it and return.  It only works because its so bare-bones, it doesn&#39;t use try/catch and calls to other functions are possible because the function pointers are passed in through the registers and the compiled code is small enough to fit in a single page.An example function I memcpy and run:https://github.com/skimmilk/liblibinject/blob/master/src/lib..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We&#39;ve been using SQLite in production as our exclusive means for getting bytes to/from disk for going on 6 years now. To this day, not one production incident can be attributed to our choice of database or how we use it.We aren&#39;t using SQLite exactly as intended either. We have databases in the 100-1000 gigabyte range that are concurrently utilized by potentially hundreds or thousands of simultaneous users. Performance is hardly a concern when you have reasonable hardware (NVMe/SSD) and utilize appropriate configuration (PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL).In our testing, our usage of SQLite vastly outperformed an identical schema on top of SQL Server. It is my understanding that something about not having to take a network hop and being able to directly invoke the database methods makes a huge difference. Are you able to execute queries and reliably receive results within microseconds with your current database setup?Sure, there is no way we are going to be able to distribute/cluster our product by way of our database provider alone, but this is a constraint we decided was worth it, especially considering all of the other reduction in complexity you get with single machine business systems. I am aware of things like DQLite/RQLite/et.al., but we simply don&#39;t have a business case that demands that level of resilience (and complexity) yet.Some other tricks we employ - We do not use 1 gigantic SQLite database for the entire product. It&#39;s more like a collection of microservices that live inside 1 executable with each owning an independent SQLite database copy. So, we would have databases like Users.db, UserSessions.db, Settings.db, etc. We don&#39;t have any use cases that would require us to write some complex reporting query across multiple databases."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I believe SQLite is about to explode in usage into areas it’s not been used before.SQL.js[0] and the incredible “Absurd SQL”[1] are making it possible to build PWAs and hybrid mobile apps with a local SQL db. Absurd SQL uses IndexedDB as a block store fs for SQLite so you don’t have to load the whole db into memory and get atomic writes.Also I recently discovered the Session Extension[2] which would potentially enable offline distributed updates with eventual consistency!I can imagine building a SAAS app where each customer has a “workspace” each as a single SQLite db, and a hybrid/PWA app which either uses a local copy of the SQLite db synced with the session extension or uses a serveless backend (like CloudFlare workers) where a lightweight function performs the db operations. I haven’t yet found a nice way to run SQLite on CloudFlare workers, it need some sort of block storage, but it can’t be far off.0: https://sql.js.org/1: https://github.com/jlongster/absurd-sql2: https://www.sqlite.org/sessionintro.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve always thought it interesting that there was a time when large(ish) websites were hosted using servers that would struggle to outperform a modern smart toaster or wristwatch, and yet modern web applications tend to demand a dramatic distributed architecture. I like the examples in this article showing what a single modern server can do when you&#39;re not scaling to Google&#39;s level.As an aside, what about distributed derivatives of sqlite, like rqlite, as a response to the criticism that sqlite requires your database server to also be your web server. Could something like rqlite also provide a way for an sqlite database to grow into a distributed cluster at a later point?https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite"</p>

					<h3><a href="https://www.duskborn.com/posts/2021-aoc-zig/">A Review of the Zig Programming Language (Using Advent of Code 2021)</a></h3>
				</div>
				<div class="story__comments">
					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29702607">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Computer language inventors are torn between a voice whispering “use the language Luke” and and a more gravelly “let your feelings for the compiler grow, embrace the syntax side.”I did a two-day sprint through Zig a month ago and really really liked it. It has some quirks that I would have done differently, but overall I think it’s pretty cool. I just need a good small scale project to try it out on now.My favorite example of the “use the language” ethos is the way Zig does generics. I have hated generics/templates in every language I use them in. They are the gordian knot of confusion that most languages in pursuit of some sort of unified type theory impale themselves on (yes, I’m mashing metaphors here). But Zig just uses its own self to define user types and generics come along for free. It resonates (with me at least) as a realization of what Gilda Bracha has shared about how to reify generics.[1] https://gbracha.blogspot.com/2018/10/reified-generics-search..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Initializing arrays is weird in Zig. Lets say you want to have a 0 initialized array, you declare it like [_]u8{0} * 4 which means I want an array, of type u8, that is initialized to 0 and is 4 elements long. You get used to the syntax, but it’s not intuitive.Alternatively:  var some_array = std.mem.zeroes([4]u8);

Though as mentioned later in the article the standard library documentation is not very good, making this not as obvious as it could be.&gt; Everything in Zig is const x = blah;, so why are functions not const bar = function() {};?Good question, there&#39;s an accepted proposal to fix this: https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1717&gt; The builtin compiler macros (that start with @) are a bit confusing. Some of them have a leading uppercase, others a lowercase, and I never did work out any pattern to them.In idiomatic zig, anything that returns a type is uppercased as though it were itself a type. Since only a few builtins return types, the vast majority of builtins will start with a lowercase letter. I think it is only `@Type`, `@TypeOf`, `@This`, and `@Frame` that don&#39;t."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I also did AoC 2021 in Zig: https://github.com/avorobey/adventofcode-2021One thing the OP didn&#39;t mention that I really liked was runtime checks on array/slice access and integer under/overflow. Because dealing with heap allocation is a bit of a hassle, I was incentivized to use static buffers a lot. I quickly figured out that I didn&#39;t have to worry about their sizes much, because if they&#39;re overrun by the unexpectedly large input or other behavior in my algorithms, I get a nice runtime error with the right line indicated, rather than corrupt memory or a crash. Same thing about choosing which integer type to use: it&#39;s not a problem if I made the wrong choice, I&#39;ll get a nice error message and fix easily. This made for a lot of peace of mind during coding. Obviously in a real production system I&#39;d be more careful and use dynamic sizes appropriately, but for one-off programs like these it was excellent.Overall, I really enjoyed using Zig while starting out at AoC problem 1 with zero knowledge of the language. To my mind, it&#39;s &#34;C with as much convenience as could be wrung out of it w/o betraying the low-level core behavior&#34;. That is, no code execution hidden behind constructors or overloads, no garbage collection, straight imperative code, but with so much done right (type system, generics, errors, optionals, slices) that it feels much more pleasant and uncomparably safer than C.(you can still get a segmentation fault, and I did a few times - by erroneously holding on to pointers inside a container while it resized. Still, uncomparably safer)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a neat idea - and not without precedent.Installing each package into it&#39;s own directory, and maintaining symlinks into that directory structure, was an approach explored for large system installations in the 90s and 00s.NIST depot, Xheir, CMU, and Nix all did this in varying ways. The advantage of this approach was that packages could be installed once on an NFS, scoped by version/configuration, and mounted into the filesystem of every work station on a campus. The workstations then just needed to maintain references to the files on the NFS for their particular software configurations. There is also some interesting exploration of composable configuration templates that allow workstations to inherit and extend a particular configuration (i.e. the physics department might have a base template).Nix is easily the most successful in this space. It even uses something similar to the NFS approach! It can maintain a remote cache of observed configurations to pull from instead of redoing work.Reading these LISA papers is a lot of fun. If you work in system administration (i.e. maintaining an Artifactory instance for your company) and have a day to spare - I&#39;d very much recommend reading them, starting with the Nix paper!To get you started:Nix - https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa-04/nix-safe-and-polic...Depot Lite - https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa-viii/depot-lite-mecha..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is actually a neat idea, and I am saying that as the archetypical, grumpy &#34;I like my sys the way it is, thank you very much!&#34; - kinda guy.A lot of the directory structure of POSIX systems is completely obsolete in the 21st century. The difference between sbin and bin? Historical, for the most part, and irrelevant in the age of rescue systems.One question that is nagging at my mind with this: What if two programs require the same lib, how is this resolved?Because, when I install progA, the lib is symlinked into the index, so when I now install progB, the lib is installed again if I understood correctly. Storage is irrelevant, the pkg manager sees there is a symlink, so it stays in place, all is well.But now I remove progA, so what happens? progB is still present, still requires the lib, it is also still installed, but now the symlink, which refered to /Programs/progA/libs/thelib.so is broken. How is this situation handled?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Here&#39;s the problem with non-deterministic conversations: everyone has an opinion (fair enough), and is willing to state it with the authority of a highly experienced subject matter expert.In deterministic conversations, a naive opinion stated with a lot of authority would be shut down quite quickly (eg: many areas in programming where you can quickly prove something to be right or wrong). You can&#39;t do that in politics, business, and many other areas. As a result, we have about 8 billion politicians and business experts.The author is making the assumption that listing a salary is connected to being a progressive business. A bunch of other people take this a step further and state how not listing the salary is a part of some conspiracy (in YC&#39;s case, apparently this is an attempt to lower the payroll costs of their portfolio companies).The reality is that even the most transparent companies out there (eg: Gitlab) do not disclose individual salaries. No, it has nothing to do with some secret plan to underpay anyone or certain groups. It&#39;s simply a fact that people become incredibly irrational when it comes to compensation, and the minute you lay it out in the open, you open up a huge surface area for conflict. Last year we learned that encouraging political activism at work has a similar dynamic, and many companies have made that a no go zone as well. It&#39;s not because they are racist or don&#39;t care - it&#39;s because it takes a tiny minority of people to get the entire business derailed, and it&#39;s hard enough to keep that from happening in the best of times; once you add a catalyst like salaries or politics, it&#39;s like adding fuel to the fire.But rather than ask ourselves why the leaders at Gitlab and millions of others companies have made the decisions they did, it&#39;s a lot easier to just make assumptions - &#34;it must be coming from a bad place, so let me brainstorm what some of those bad places could be.&#34;I&#39;ll take it a step further - Colorado State Senator Jessie Danielson would make you believe it&#39;s more likely that millions of companies are &#34;bad actors&#34; than that she just doesn&#39;t have the relevant experience in business to predict which way her bill was going to work out. Now that she&#39;s cost so many of her constituents lucrative remote jobs, it&#39;s too late to admit Mea Culpa, and instead it&#39;s everyone else&#39;s fault. If she was held a bit more accountable, the next time someone tries to bridge the gender pay gap they will hopefully spend some time interviewing and learning from people who have the relevant experience in hiring."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It really still isn&#39;t the norm anywhere to list compensation and I suspect that Y Combinator has the same problems of disparate compensation based on when people joined as any other company. Heck, we are all switching jobs constantly because the new guy got more than we did, despite being the same level and having more experience at the company.Plenty of companies decided to stop hiring from Colorado rather than post compensation in the job postings.If I had to guess, I suspect it provides no competitive advantage to list compensation except if you pay top tier.As an anecdote from a friend, the wage differences can be substantial. The friend just recently got a new job and the senior who mentored him in onboarding also got promoted a level too. That senior was talking about how they finally reached six figures (Canada has much lower pay than the USA, so this isn&#39;t crazy). My friend made six figures starting, with 3-5 fewer years of experience and just about two years overall.There are a lot of absurdly underpaid people out there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I tried to start a trend a few months ago on the month Who&#39;s hiring posts to get posters to put the compensation.  I automatically upvote any post with compensation, but few have it.I even posted about it once and got a ton of upvotes but then the mods buried my post.I would love to see more job posts with compensation in fairness to people who aren&#39;t good at negotiating, but it just isn&#39;t the norm these days."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article says that users will never get 64-bit time_t on 32-bit systems on glibc.However, glibc documentation (https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Feature-T...) says:&gt; If _TIME_BITS is undefined, the bit size of time_t is architecture dependent. Currently it defaults to 64 bits on most architectures. Although it defaults to 32 bits on some traditional architectures (i686, ARM), this is planned to change and applications should not rely on this.So it sounds like glibc plans to change the default, just like musl has done."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is there a way to play with a gamepad controller?This is the coolest web game I&#39;ve ever seen. So fast and smooth even on my ancient laptop.I didn&#39;t know you could do this in a browser. Now I want to see a Subspace remake to complete my 90&#39;s nostalgia trip."</p>
