								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"During a centralisation of public school local servers to a data centre, I created a consolidated library enquiry system. It served over 2,000 libraries, had 330 million titles, and had about a million users. It was efficient enough to run off my laptop, if need be.AFAIK it was one of the top five biggest library systems in the world at the time.I was asked to add some features that would have been too difficult in the old distributed system. Things like reading competitions, recommended reading lists by age, etc…I watched the effect of these changes — which took me mere days of effort to implement — and the combined result was that students read about a million additional books they would not have otherwise.I’ve had a far greater effect on the literacy of our state than any educator by orders of magnitude and hardly anyone in the department of education even knows my name!This was the project that made realise how huge the effort-to-effect ratio that can be when computers are involved…"</p>

(Sold to Gasboy)Wrote a fine tuner to allow communication between satellites (precursor to TDRSS days).  Still used to this day.Failover of IP in ATM switches (VVRP, PXE, secondary DHCP, secondary DNS, secondary LDAP, secondary NFS). While not invented here, it is still used today as this is a Common setup to this day.Printer drivers for big, big high-speed Xerox printers on BSD. Still used to this day by big, big high-speed printers.Also, early IDS products (pre-Snort) at line-speed.  Sold to Netscreen.Easy zero-setup of DSL modem before some BellCore decided to complicate things (thus exploding their field deployment budgets; Southwestern Bell/Qwest enjoyed our profitable zero-setup). Sold to Siemens.1Gps IDS/IPS before selling it to 3Com/Hewlett-Packard Packard.Now, I&#39;m dabbling in a few startups (JavaScript HIDS, Silent Connections, replacing the systemd-temp).Impact?  It is more about personal pride but its impacts are still being felt today."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I used to grow my own in Australia, as a hobby, patience is the hardest part really. 5-7 years after planting seems to be needed.At one stage I was the northern most producer of truffles (very few produced actually but I only had 40 trees and didn&#39;t really look after them to the utmost detail) in the southern hemisphere, then a guy 150km further north, and in soil that was near total sand, got some to grow. This was totally unexpected.It seems the conditions required are not quite so special as thought, and some totally unsuited conditions (as previously thought) might be good due to reduced competition from other fungi.The action of inoculating trees is simple as well, get a ripe couple of real truffles, blender them up and pour it over the small saplings in pots, if the mycorrhizal sets in you can see it as white bits on the roots. (I think you need two, but not even sure on that).A wide range of trees will work, oak, hazel, cork to name a few. There is a preferred pH range for the soil, as would be expected for all fungi pH has a strong role to play.There has been a lot of secrecy enshrouding the whole game for a long time.I refer only to Tuber melanosporum in the above, I am not sure anyone has been able to get the white truffles growing out of the wild, there will be some special condition or symbiosis with an animal or something that is needed, but not understood yet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Maybe 5 years ago I was hanging out with a buddy and we took an angle grinder to an empty propane tank. When we were finished, we smelled uniquely awful. It turns out that added to propane is a tiny amount of the odourant Ethyl Mercaptan. Now when you’re using propane you get just enough of a whiff of it to remind you that you’re using propane, but if you get a smell of the inside of an empty propane tank? Well, something about the liquid propane residue that remains, some miracle of science and chemistry, creates a density of Ethyl Mercaptan that is shocking. Room-fillingly shocking. Clothes throwing away shocking. Many showers worth of shocking.A couple years ago I had my first “truffle” experience with some truffle cheese and was like cutting back into that propane tank. Not the same in scale, but certainly in type. Tremendously similar smells. Since then I’ve been sad and thought I just managed to ruin truffles for myself. This article has given me hope."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m French and I live in France. Here, most of our truffles are real truffle.We do get some Tuber aestivum as well, but that&#39;s alright because they&#39;re displayed as &#34;truffe d&#39;été&#34;. No harm done.As the article said, the &#34;truffle flavour&#34; has nothing to do with the real stuff, and outside of France, Italy and Spain, you probably won&#39;t get them on the market. You might be lucky in some restaurants all over Europe. But everywhere else it&#39;s propably not the &#34;real&#34; black truffle. Especially, if they put some in ketchup..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"2038 is going to be an interesting year that’s for sure. I’m big into Final Fantasy VII modding/speedrunning and while reverse engineering the game I stumbled upon some code that actually checks if the current date is before 2038. If it’s not it refuses to run. I have no idea why they put this kind of check in the game&#39;s code, I tried to remove it but the game actually still didn’t start so there is probably some issue that prevents it from working when the date overflows.I can only imagine that a lot of other legacy software will have similar issues when we reach year 2038."</p>

Possible, but unlikely. A virus wants to spread, not limit its opportunities to do so.After investigating, I was able to determine that the system clock somehow had gotten set past 2038 and this was sufficient to destroy network connectivity. As soon as it was corrected, everything was fine again.Not the first time I have run into a clock issue breaking software.We are lucky 2038 is still 16 years away and not next month."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Learning how to speak chicken is not becoming a chicken. That&#39;s a frequent misconception that borders cultural appropriation. Chickens aren&#39;t just about a few bock-bock and cockle-doodle-doos. They have a rich set of physical expressions as well (flap flaps, head kicks, grating the soil, etc) and a vibrant culture that is transmitted between generations. Their philosophy on death and their capacity to always see life on the sunny-side is both unique and deep, the fruit of seeing their children being picked for food on a daily basis. This should be celebrated. The article completely missed the point on that aspect.Pretending you became a chicken because you&#39;re now performing a few chicken-like sounds is plain wrong, an insult to the poultry community."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; rainbow palette for use in my data visualisations.Indeed for her kind of data the rainbow palette works okay. But if you have to visualize more complex / denser data, beware of the pitfalls of the rainbow color palette. It is not always the best choice.IBM did research back in the 90s on perceptually-based colormaps and how to best represent various types of data within the color dimensions of luminescence, saturation and hue [1]. For example, they found that,(1) Hue was not a good dimension for encoding magnitude information, i.e. rainbow color maps are bad.(2) The mechanisms in human vision responsible for high spatial frequency information processing are luminance channels. If the data to be represented have high spatial frequency, use a color map which has a strong luminance variation across the data range.(3) For interval and ratio data, both luminance- and saturation-varying color maps should produce the effect of having equal steps in data value correspond to equal perceptual steps, but the first will be most effective for high spatial frequency data variations and the second will be most effective for low spatial frequency variations.===[1] the original link got removed from IBMs website.

Furthermore, our journey to democracy has not been smooth - the last 10 years were marred by massive corruption.Through all of this, our constitutional rights to freedom of expression, and freedom of press, has stayed sound.  We have had multiple instances where journalists reported on some nefarious action and were intimidated or even legally threatened by authorities.  However, our courts have, for the most part, sided with our freedom of expression and press rights.  The South African government has had quite a couple of punches on the nose in our courts ;-).I have read most of the comments in this thread.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a software engineer who works on genomics. I see a lot of negativity in this thread, which mirrors my experience: in most places, you&#39;ll be paid like a researcher with the respect of a lab assistant – unless you have a PhD and a postdoc.That said, it&#39;s possible find work that&#39;s respected and pays well. Most of that kind of work is happening in the context of startups or freelancing. My favorite example of this is Robert Edgar: he&#39;s a freelance computational biologist with over 100k citations who has made a living for the past 20 years by selling licenses to his bioinformatics software (https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RzVMRc0AAAAJ).To find those kinds of jobs, I&#39;d try YC&#39;s Work at a Startup, Flagship Pioneering&#39;s portfolio companies, and emailing founders of companies that have a bioinformatics component (my email is in my profile!).I think the issues with the field are because it&#39;s a new and growing space. We do need better tooling, respect for engineering, and established best practices, but that seems to have been the case in the past for other domains that moved from research to industry – including software engineering itself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Usually, scientific oriented companies or organizations have little regard for software as a domain, craft, etc. It’s just a thing that gets in the way, despite being vital. It’s almost just a utility to them rather than a differentiator and active component of the advanced work going on.For example, the Broad Institute is super interesting, but having applied there several times, they are esoteric, to say the least, in their hiring. They pay well below market, and their process is opaque and slow and sometimes downright non-communicative. They are also not really open to remote work, so you gotta move there and commute to the heart of Cambridge. Budgets are set by folks maybe a couple years out of a PhD program, who will also make technical decisions in terms of the software design (the latter an assumption given my experience in similar places).These organizations are also pretty traditional in their selection of stacks. Good luck trying to use a functional-first  language, aside from maybe Scala (usually lots of Java stacks), and be prepared to write lots of Python, the only language that exists to many scientists. I once saw a Python signature (function name and arguments) spill over 10-20 lines, in a file over 10,000 lines long. They had given up on another software stack because “it wasn’t working for them”.This is all painting with broad strokes, of course. But I think scientific organizations that would embrace software as a major component of their technological and scientific development would do well. There’s a lot of opportunity."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve worked on genomics, at the Broad. Can confirm there is a ton of toxicity. There&#39;s also a lot of smart and great people, if you can find a team specifically dedicated to software I would recommend it. Also the pay is good...for a non-profit.More broadly...shortages like this aren&#39;t because SWEs just love ad-tracking and hate health improvements. People need to be willing to pay for these services (case in point; the jobs link for AWS has 3 links which appear unrelated to genomics, for Microsoft there are 2 for interns, and for Google its empty).There are a lot of opportunities in biotech for SWEs, and many firms (though not all) really do respect the power of software. Worth looking around if you&#39;re interested in the area."</p>

Basically any software released in the 90ies should run easily on the watch.
