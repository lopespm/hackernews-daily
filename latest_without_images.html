								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From a previous discussion:One very interesting piece of tech coming from podman, is toolbox (https://github.com/containers/toolbox). Basically throwaway (or keeparound) rootless containers with their own root directory but shared HOME. Install hundreds of dev-dependencies to build this one piece of software? Yeah, not gonna install those packages permanently. Spin up a toolbox, build it, install it in my home/.local.You have root in the container without having root in the host system. That takes care of a lot of issues as well.I basically no longer have development packages installed and run some applications with lots of dependencies out of toolboxes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Podman is a great Docker alternative. That&#39;s why I already included it alongside Docker in https://deploymentfromscratch.com/. It fits nicely in the world of systemd services where Podman let&#39;s you run the container just as you would run the containerized service directly. I hope the future will be bright and maybe we won&#39;t need Docker the runtime anymore."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been a bit disillusioned with podman recently for breakage reasons. The cgroups v2 migration for example have caused a lot of pods to break and require recreation and the error message for debugging this problems are not reported well. The docs are also not missing any detail that would help debug this kind of problems.The underlying runtime leaks through, but it feels like the podman docs don&#39;t want to document that, but they also don&#39;t point to anywhere where it is documented. So you end googling this issue, find people in the issue tracker having their issues closed because it&#39;s a problem with the runtime and then try to map the error you&#39;re seeing in podman to the other projects to google to see if there&#39;s any reported information."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some background info on mammograms (x-rays of the breast). For whatever reason breast cancer is highly political in the US. As a result there are federal laws regarding communication of results and scheduling follow-up exams that apply to mammograms only and no other radilody or other medical test. To comply with these laws radiologists set up a uniform grading system with highly specific jargon. As a result the formatting and language used in mammogram reads by radiologist will be much more consistent than, say, a chest x-ray screening for lung cancer. This makes mammograms the ideal studies to be tackled by AI"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This type of evaluation (both the meta-evaluation and the underlying studies themselves) are the exact sort things AI enthusiasts should want researchers to do. It cuts through the hype, and gives everyone a clear assessment of where the technology currently stands.Clearly there is room for improvement. Maybe this study will also spur the development of new types of systems which augment human/radiologist decision-making."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This implies that there were a couple of AI systems that actually beat a radiologist, which I take as extremely promising for the field of AI radiology.Like any domain in applied AI, there will be a lot of approaches that miss the mark, or are simply stepping stones to better approaches. There are thousands and thousands of papers on language modeling, but we only needed one superior approach (GPT) to change the game entirely.The search through any cutting edge problem space is messy and full of failure, and that&#39;s fine. You only need one breakthrough."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I feel like what hurts this the most is lack of brand recognition - half of the people in the comments are asking why they should trust them and rightfully so. When you look at the individual components, like Nextcloud, you know that the company behind that project is interested in making it work. You know that Nextcloud, GitLab and others make money through their enterprise offerings and probably aren&#39;t too interested in selling their users&#39; data or finding other alternative ways of monetizing their platforms.When a seemingly random company pops up and just rehosts a number of these FOSS platforms, you tend to be skeptical of their motivations or offerings, seeing as they make bold claims about otherwise insignificant platforms, especially given how often you hear untrue statements about privacy nowadays and even moreso if you don&#39;t know or care about their history: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDesktop.orgPersonally, i applaud their efforts and attempts at popularizing these tools and platforms (as someone who self hosts OpenProject, Nextcloud, GitLab, Rocket.Chat and many other pieces of software that i use myself), however i fail to see where their target audience lies: the majority of people who don&#39;t care about their privacy will simply stick to the larger cloud offerings of Google or Microsoft office components and something like GitHub for their code, whereas the more privacy conscious folk are more likely to self host software or will need lots of time to build trust with them.I do hope that they have a sustainable existence and a net positive impact on the industry, though!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My own very minor gripe is with the maps component.Because it uses OpenStreetMap as a map source it doesn&#39;t show any settlements larger 250,000 for my area because those settlements call themselves &#34;towns&#34; and not &#34;cities&#34;.When you zoom out all you see is a blank space with no labels for quite a large area of the screen.Meanwhile very small settlements (&lt; 20K people) are shown at max zoom just because they happen to have the right kind of church building, which in the UK means they can call themselves &#34;cities&#34;.I&#39;ve raised this issue with OpenStreetMaps support for many years and they just either say it&#39;s something to be fixed by client libraries or it&#39;s not important.They could be right I guess.  However, Goople maps, Apple maps and Microsoft maps handle this correctly and that&#39;s what OpenDesktop explicitly say they are trying to replace here."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m surprised it&#39;s not made more clear in the article, but it&#39;s important to note that as well as being an ISP, Sky are a more traditional subscription TV provider. They have the exclusive rights for most of the Premier League TV on their channels (paying ~ $1.65bn a year for the these rights[0]) - it&#39;s probably the main pull to their , so it&#39;s very much in their interest to fight off piracy of it.[0] https://www.sky.com/help/articles/sky-channel-changes"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When the Caldor fire (now 210  thousand acres, 328 mi^2!) was smoking up Placerville, the downtown Home Depot had, at the main entrance, a big stack of 20x24x1-inch #9 furnace filters, box fans, and rolls of tape, with one all constructed sitting on top, running, black with trapped smoke.Kudos to HD for not jacking up prices.It is best to make them with a four inch thick filter, which HD does not stock, and higher than a #9, likewise, bought online. You can stack a #8 in front of a #17, to make the ~$100 #17 last longer, and stack two box fans (one intake, one exhaust) to get more suction. Maybe stack #8/fan/#17/fan, to keep the fans clean.But the single one-inch #9 filter cleared the smoke from my whole house in no time flat! Don&#39;t let &#34;best&#34; stop you from doing &#34;good&#34;.An advantage you have from high airflow is that particles that make it through the filter once are likely to get trapped the next time around, or the 20th. Atomizing some water ought to make filters momentarily stickier, until it dries.Fan blades getting dusty can cut airflow in half! (Same on laptop cooling fans; use a vacuum cleaner on your laptop air path.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Heres my set up:- 20 inch box fan- 20x20x4 MERV12 filter. The 4-inch pleating is key here, to reduce the air resistance on the box fan.- 1 inch dust pre-filter. This is course, low air resistance, and is for increasing the life of the more expensive MERV12/HEPA filter (so it doesn&#39;t get clogged with easy to filter dust).- Both filters are on the intake side of the box fan. This means you don&#39;t need a bungee cord because the intake has negative pressure, the filters just &#34;stick&#34;. It also means you keep your box fan flowing with only cleaned air.Heres a pic of my setup: https://imgur.com/a/O4I6UdxAnd here&#39;s a graph this morning from my air quality sensor, after turning on the fan/filter: https://imgur.com/a/c5GMNcCThe peak at ~30ug/m^3 PM2.5 is approximately 100 AQI. The fan was on the other side of my 900 sqft house from the sensor."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Last year when the west coast was blanketed in smoke, I setup a box fan with a HEPA filter. It probably helped, but we also found that the fan&#39;s motor was working really hard. The cord&#39;s connection point to the fan started melting (unbeknownst to us), causing the fan to intermittently cut out. I only noticed the problem when, long after the forest fires were gone, we noticed a strong smell of melted plastic coming from the fan itself.All in all, probably a good tradeoff to clean our air during the dangerous smoke levels, but there&#39;s the risk of burning out the motor.Be careful out there."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I once had tea with some bedouins in Jordan’s Wadi Rum around 2015 or so and these pictures could have been of that tea. The tent looked the same.They were really nice people who just stopped some travelers for tea and a chat. They weren’t selling anything and wouldn’t take any gives or thank yous. Frequently when traveling you’ll get some fake hospitality experiences that end up just “gift shopping” but this experience was neat to me as they seemed just interested in travelers.I wonder how frequently they do that as the road wasn’t super busy, but also wasn’t abandoned. We maybe spent half an hour and no else came by."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Intereseting way of milking goats:https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ZaZgfe2Gyk0/XqHI23JcnqI/AAAAAAAAW...The animals are in a line bunched up close and alternating facing so that one animal has its head on the shoulders of the two animals next to itself and looking towards their rear.I haven&#39;t seen that before. More peculiar is that I can&#39;t see them eating anything. Normally when animals are milked, it&#39;s lunch (or dinner) time. They line up in front of their troughs and they&#39;re milked while they eat. Typically there&#39;s some kind of divider or railing to keep them more or less still also. Otherwise you need to have really well disciplined and calm animals or you&#39;ll get lots of hooves in milk pots and so on.It&#39;s also very interesting to see how they dried their cheeses on top of their tents. These look like small, lactic cheeses. If they had a good source of salt they would probably be very high on salt both to help preserve and sanitise them and also to replenish the salt lost by the people to the heat of the desert. Anyway that must have been really strong cheese: sun-dried, very salty, goat&#39;s milk cheese. Yum."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These photos are of stunning quality. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve seen any 19th century photos that come close, even with retouching and postprocessing. But also the lighting is incredible. Like it looks more like something associated with a more modern (ie post-WWII) technique.I didn&#39;t see any mention of the provenance of these photos. Anyone know?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My main technique from my engineering undergrad days was extremely effective and yet very simple and easy to describe and/or implement. It is:1. Attend the lectures and take good notes. Don&#39;t write things down that are obvious or that you already know.2. Before any exam, go back over the dozens of pages of notes and condense them down to 3 or 4 pages, omitting details that will be brought to mind by the things you are writing down.3. Go back over the 3 to 4 pages, condensing them down to a single page, compactly written.4. Go back over the single page, condensing it down to a single notecard.The act of condensing requires you to internalize the knowledge enough to know what you have memorized and what you must still note down. And the act of repeatedly writing down the hard parts commits those to memory too.By the end, the notecard has a handful of difficult to remember formulas and a bunch of keywords that prompt your memory to recall the salient details. In the US at that time, a single notecard was often allowed during exams, so the final work product was also that card.(My recall 20 years later is excellent, so this is not cramming.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"1. attend every lecture without fail2. take legible notes by hand on everything that goes on the chalkboard3. do all the homework, and do it on time4. make sure you understand how to get the solution to every homework problem5. review notes and all homework problems as prep for the examI found this meant reliably getting at least a B in the courses at Caltech. Getting an A required considerably more work.My high school technique of not bothering to do much of anything and still getting an A took a year and a half of abject failure at Caltech before I wised up. Fortunately, Caltech&#39;s freshman year was pass/fail, evidently they were familiar with people like me :-)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a former middle school teacher, I found that the evidence-based techniques that the author mentioned, such as &#34;spacing&#34; and &#34;retrieval&#34;, were underutilized in classrooms due to teachers not knowing about them, as well as how tedious it can be to implement them. I founded a nonprofit called Podsie (https://www.podsie.org) to help with this problem, and we created a free tool that&#39;s essentially like &#34;Anki for classrooms&#34; so that teachers can help their students study more effectively in their classes."</p>

The cost of violations is priced in. Companies actually misbehave and simply accept a potential fine as a business expense.&gt; The company is also understood to feel that the fine is out of step with previous GDPR related fines.It just sucks for our shareholders if the fine is higher than we expected.&gt; Sources close to the company, which is owned by Facebook, said rather than making its policy shorter and less complicated, the decision would mean it would have to add even more information to its already long and complicated privacy policy.The lies, incredible. Just don’t collect data, then your privacy statement is very very simple. Only complicated agreements require complicated 5,000 word privacy declarations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One important thing to note is that the DPC (Irish DPA) did not want to fine WhatsApp and only did so after being forced by other DPAs through the arbitration process.You can consult the EDPB decision on that matter here: https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/binding-...EDIT: Max Schrems&#39; reaction (NOYB):&gt;&#34;We welcome the first decision by the Irish regulator. However, the DPC gets about ten thousand complaints per year since 2018 and this is the first major fine. The DPC also proposed an initial € 50 million fine and was forced by the other European data protection authorities to move towards € 225 million, which is still only 0.08% of the turnover of the Facebook Group. The GDPR foresees fines of up to 4% of the turnover.
