								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think Steve has a well earned reputation for being decent and trustworthy.I can understand the desire here for more details so that others can come to a firmer conclusion but try to put yourself in Steve&#39;s shoes. It is very hard to publicly criticize some of the behavior of a group you are a member of without burning bridges or deeply harming relationships. At the same time, saying nothing publicly is read as tacit approval.I interpret the article as a giving Amazon credit for why people like Rust, and Steve&#39;s response as a public disagreement saying that such credit is unwarranted and gives Amazon more power than it should have over Rust&#39;s future direction."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The facts are pretty thin here, but this seems to be the core tweet:
https://twitter.com/steveklabnik/status/1437441118745071617To summarize:* Amazon has too much administrative influence* Amazon has marginalized the core team* also un-stated dirty tricks by AmazonI think rust is great, and I love with the rust community has accomplished, and I wouldn&#39;t want to see Amazon break that. But from this thread I don&#39;t know enough to raise objections. It sounds like a Rust foundation governance issue, the sort of thing that comes up from time-to-time on most big successful projects.[edited to fix formatting]"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is there more context here that&#39;s missing from the tweet thread?&gt; And now they want to actually take Amazon&#39;s principles and claim that they&#39;re Rust&#39;s.These just... literally... aren&#39;t Amazon&#39;s principles. At all. &#34;The practice of coming up with pithy statements to guide decision-making&#34; is the Amazon part.&gt; they&#39;ve also taken steps to marginalize the core team. and some other dirty shit I won&#39;t say rn.This sounds like the real concern, and it sounds really concerning, and I hope people come out to speak publicly and candidly about it. But it doesn&#39;t seem sensible to pretend that the making a list of adjectives is itself malign."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Huh, never thought I’d see XCheck in a news article. I used to work at Facebook and spotted abuse of this system by bad actors and partly fixed it. It’s still not perfect but it’s better than it used to be.I think I might have agreed with the author of this article before working in Integrity for a few years. But with time I learned that any system that’s meant to work for millions of users will have some edge cases that need to be papered over. Especially when it’s not a system owned and operated by a handful of people. Here’s an example - as far as I know it’s not possible for Mark Zuckerberg to log in to Facebook on a new device. The system that prevents malicious log in attempts sees so many attempts on his account that it disallows any attempt now. There’s no plans to fix it for him specifically because it works reasonably well for hundreds of millions of other users whose accounts are safeguarded from being compromised. His inconvenience is an edge case.With XCheck specifically what would happen is that some team working closely on a specific problem in integrity might find a sub population of users being wrongly persecuted by systems built by other teams located in other time zones. They would use XCheck as a means to prevent these users from being penalised by the other systems. It worked reasonably well, but there’s always room for improvement.I can confirm some of what the article says though. The process for adding shields wasn’t policed internally very well in the past. Like I mentioned, this was being exploited by abusive accounts - if an account was able to verify its identity it would get a “Shielded-ID-Verified” tag applied to it. ID verification was considered to be a strong signal of authenticity. So teams that weren’t related to applying the tag would see the tag and assume the account was authentic. And as I investigated this more I realised no one really “owned” the tag or policed who could apply it and under what circumstances. I closed this particular loop hole.In later years the XCheck system started being actively maintained by a dedicated team that cared. They looked into problems like these and made it better."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Strong opsec that the supporting documents are actual photos of a computer screen from the visible moire (or somehow altered to look that way).After numerous leaks, Facebook&#39;s internal security team became very good at identifying leakers. The person responsible for this 2016 post was identified within hours and terminated the next day: https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/blakemontgomery/mark-zu.... The leaker was easily identified by the names of friends liking the post (that and part of their name was visible).Facebook-issued laptops are filled with spyware, monitoring everything down to the system call level, and practically every access to internal systems is logged at a fine level. The only way to exfiltrate data with plausible deniability would be to photograph the screen with an individually owned device. The fact that you searched for the internal wiki page and viewed it are nothing, but that you shortly invoked the keyboard shortcut for a screen capture, then inserted a USB drive, and copied a file (&#34;Screen shot ____.png&#34; even!) to it (all logged) ... congratulations, you&#39;re caught."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The new Windows 11 defaults manager is amazingly user hostile. [1] Microsoft decided it&#39;s a great idea to make non technical users manually adjust 15 different file and protocol associations in order to change the default browser.Microsoft&#39;s statement on this: we are implementing customer feedback to customize and control defaults at a more granular level, eliminating app categories and elevating all apps to the forefront of the defaults experience.More granular control is nice and all, but I don&#39;t buy for a second that it couldn&#39;t be behind some &#34;advanced&#34; button. I think the most probable explanation for removing the app categories is a calculated move to steer people towards Microsoft products which have access to backdoor internal functions to change all of these automatically.I do remember how bad things were back in Windows XP days when every random toolbar would change all the associations. I don&#39;t wish for that experience to come back for non technical users either. Microsoft could perhaps look into allowing digitally signed apps to change the associations automatically (a single summarizing OS confirmation prompt might be wise), and non-signed apps would have to instruct users to manually change things.--[1] https://www.theverge.com/22630319/microsoft-windows-11-defau..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The amount of dark design patterns around getting edge as the default browser is sickening.  Opera was flagged as PUA by many AVs for simply changing the default browser after asking users post-install if they wanted to use that browser as their default - just as edge does (and before Firefox copied that same mechanism here).  Now every post-windows update screen (which takes place before you even log in...) comes with a full-page nag screen asking you to &#34;Use Microsoft recommended browser settings&#34; [1]...  This is on the heels of a screen that says &#34;Let&#39;s make Windows even better - this shouldn&#39;t affect what you&#39;ve already set up&#34; [2].  Even more disappointing is not that they&#39;re doing this but that nobody is taking these platforms to court over it in a meaningful way.[1] https://www.windowslatest.com/2020/11/15/windows-10-is-now-n...[2] https://www.windowslatest.com/2020/06/07/windows-10-full-scr..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As I was reading this article I kept thinking to myself &#34;Microsoft is going to boot Firefox from Windows&#34; before realizing that MS doesn&#39;t have that sort of power (compared to say Apple).It&#39;s really interesting how MS will approach this. Unlike Apple, MS doesn&#39;t have direct control over which apps go on the operating system, they aren&#39;t even in a position like Google where their app store is the dominant platform for getting apps.This will be interesting, interesting to see how MS responds. Will they give in and let users easily set their default browser or will this turn into a cat and mouse game.Lastly I think what MS is doing with the default browser is foolish. Did they learn nothing from the antitrust cases of the 2000&#39;s"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a Greek myself I never really thought much about this word. Yes, it is not common but I thought I understood this. After reading the linked article I am not so sure anymore and I am not really sure how I would translate it.I cannot translate it to English in a single word but the way I understand it would be &#34;what is needed, no more, no less&#34; (which is also mentioned in the article).I found two greek sources that seem to agree with me [1], [2]. Especially in the first it gives also as synonym the word &#34;daily&#34;. However it also mentions that in the biblical context although it is widespread understood as &#34;necessary&#34; the correct interpretation (of the whole phrase) is rather &#34;give us today the bread of tomorrow&#34;.So, as a conclusion, I guess even as a Greek I am as much confused as all these scholars that try to translate it![1] https://el.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%B5%CF%80%CE%B9%CE%BF%CF%8...

The main part translates to “day” and this word refers to what you need to live for a day. It’s also used in prayers which asks God to provide us with what we need to live for the day.This word instantly reminded me of that but I don’t know if they are conceptually related or not."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This kinda feels like one of those acquisitions where all the special sauce that makes the acquired company a great company is the exact opposite in the acquiring company.That is, from all I&#39;ve heard, Mailchimp is a great company to work at, and the founders definitely had the &#34;scrappyness&#34; that let them become so successful without VC funding, and their customers really like them too.Intuit, on the other hand, is basically the poster child for &#34;regulatory capture&#34; company. Also, since employees don&#39;t have equity (though I&#39;m assuming they&#39;ll get fat bonuses for this), it&#39;s bound to cause some level of strife in the company."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Basically Mailchimp did nothing to enrich the Atlanta startup community with a bunch of people making nice exits via stocks etc.. Instead it is another example of the Atlanta startup sharecropping model. A few years ago a reporter for the Atlanta Business Chronicle referred to Atlanta as the Bangalore of the South. Up until a few years ago, salaries didn&#39;t really compete with other locations and most companies that were opening up engineering offices in ATL did it as a cost cutting measure (IE: Bose, Pandora/Sirius etc..) COVID has opened up opportunities for developers living in Atlanta to have other options that are more lucrative.Mailchimp had run it&#39;s course. It was a marketing play, and e-mail marketing has become a commodity business. Atlanta is, at it&#39;s heart, a marketing town. But even there, that can only take a marketing company so far."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here are some numbers I dug up:Mailchimp has ~13MM users and 800k paying customers. In 2019 they had revenues of $700MM. In 2020 they had EBITDA of ~$300MM.They are fully bootstrapped and have taken on zero outside funding."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Something to note about the 90s-era is that the &#34;death ball&#34; of cheap units was *aggressively* mitigated in almost all strategy games.* Civilization 1, 2, and 3 had &#34;stacks&#34;, but if you kill one unit in the stack, you kill ALL units in the stack. As such, &#34;death balls&#34; were incredibly fragile, one well placed attack kills the whole stack.* Command and Conquer has infantry, which get rolled over and instant-killed by tanks. The overall &#34;death ball&#34; of tanks can eventually reach endgame proportions of death, but the cheapest units are fully ineffective at death-balling.* Starcraft had a 12-unit selection cap. It required a lot of clicks (on purpose) to create a death ball, so only the highest levels of players (with high APM) could attack-move with a whole army effectively."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very cool.I think so many of the best games evolve randomly and unexpectedly while top down control from developers has stifled game play.Not against developers protecting their IP. Do what you gotta do to make money.But I enjoy seeing open source games giving players the ability to edit and improve game systems.I think back to how many times Nintendo has shut down Super Smash Melee edits, how many hours of skill have been lost every time Riot made a change to League of Legends nobody enjoyed, how much World of Warcraft has essentially stagnated.You want something like chess where the rules don&#39;t change drastically every couple months if you want to build a competitive scene. Something stable so strategies and a stable metagame can occur."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This mentions something that has always irked me, YouTube trying to be informative about who the music is licensed by. For one, it&#39;s completely useless on classical piano music because the Content ID algo finds similarity in a dozen different recordings. But even when there is one canonical recording, such as Rick Astley&#39;s Never Gonna Give You Up, I&#39;m informed that the music is licensed by:(on behalf of Sony BMG Music UK); UMPI, Kobalt Music Publishing, LatinAutor, Warner Chappell, BMI - Broadcast Music Inc., UNIAO BRASILEIRA DE EDITORAS DE MUSICA - UBEM, LatinAutor - UMPG, SOLAR Music Rights Management, AMRA, UMPG Publishing, CMRRA, LatinAutorPerf, LatinAutor - Warner Chappell, and 15 Music Rights SocietiesWhat is happening here? Does YouTube have legal arrangements with all of these bodies to make sure they get their penny per kiloview?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Presumably this will encourage the creator of the 1914 work to create new works."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Here’s what triggered this: The ceremony includes bits of a recording (of tenor John McCormack singing “Funiculi, Funicula”) made in the year 1914.
The Corporate Takedown&gt; YouTube’s takedown algorithm claims that the following corporations all own the copyright to that audio recording that was MADE IN THE YEAR 1914: “SME, INgrooves (on behalf of Emerald); Wise Music Group, BMG Rights Management (US), LLC, UMPG Publishing, PEDL, Kobalt Music Publishing, Warner Chappell, Sony ATV Publishing, and 1 Music Rights Societies”So what&#39;s going on here?  Did some record company reissue the song later on CD, so YouTube is treating it like it was released at a later date than it was?https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain_in_the_United_St...:&gt; All works first published or released before January 1, 1926, have lost their copyright protection, effective January 1, 2021.Google probably should compile a list of public domain recordings to act as a blacklist for YouTube copyright claims.
