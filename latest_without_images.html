								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Looks like it uses system webviews instead of bundling a copy of Chromium? This to me seems like the real headlining feature, but strangely I had to dig pretty deep to find it: https://tauri.studio/en/docs/getting-started/technical-detai...I kind of wonder why it took this long for someone to try this approach. It just makes a whole lot more sense on the surface.Interesting thing I just thought about: since users don&#39;t get to choose their system webview, I wonder if this has the potential to broaden browser diversity a little bit?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This kind of makes me think... is there room for a much more stripped down version of Chromium that is suitable for lower memory footprint? Or is this impossible?It looks like Tauri uses system webviews, which use a lot less memory, but the burden is then on the developer to make sure that they build essentially 3 (maybe more) UI&#39;s on platforms that might change under their feet. That&#39;s why the Electron approach is simpler - it trades of performance for uniformity of experience across the major platforms.But I&#39;m wondering if it really has to be this way. Do modern browsers really need 2G of RAM in order to send and receive messages in a chat box (looking at you, Slack)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the desktop seriously needs a production, RAM and developer friendly breakthrough that isn&#39;t Electron.Tauri may be it, but the desktop SO needs this moment, I don&#39;t want to see 50 years on and Electron is still being used."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A more common scenario I see is that people start with a monolith that ends up inheriting all the conceptual debt that accumulates as a project evolves. All this debt builds up a great desire for change in the maintaining team.A champion will rise with a clean architecture and design in microservice form that addresses all high visibility pain points, attributing forecasted benefits to the perceived strengths of microservices. The team buys into the pitch and looks forwards to a happily-ever-after ending.The reality though is that the team now has multiple problems, which include:- Addressing conceptual debt that hasn&#39;t gone away.
- Discovering and migrating what the legacy system got right, which is often not documented and not obvious.
- Dealing with the overheads of microservices that were not advertised and not prominent at a proof-of-concept scale.
- Ensuring business continuity while this piece of work goes on.I would propose alternative is to fix your monolith first. If the team can&#39;t rewrite their ball of mud as a new monolith, then what are the chances of successfully rewriting and changing architecture?Once there is a good, well functioning monolith, shift a subset of responsibility that can be delegated to a dedicated team - the key point is to respect Conway&#39;s law - and either create a microservice from it or build a new independent monolith service, which aligns more to service oriented architecture than microservices."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hahaha. I have been saying the same for years but have either been punished by my managers or mercilessly downvoted on HN.Somehow mentioning that microservices might not be perfect solution in every case triggers a lot of people.I have actually helped save at least one project in a huge bank which got rolled from 140 services into one. The team got also scaled down to third of its size but was able to work on this monolithic application way more efficiently. Also reliability, which was huge issue before the change, improved dramatically.When I joined, I have observed 6 consecutive failed deployments. Each took entire week to prepare and entire weekend to execute (with something like 40 people on bridge call).When I left I have observed 50 consecutive successful deployments, each requiring 1h to prepare (basically meeting to discuss and approve the change) and 2h of a single engineer to prepare and execute using automation.Most projects absolutely don&#39;t need microservices.Breaking anything apart brings inefficiencies of having to manage multiple things. Your people now spend time managing applications rather than writing actual business logic. You have to have really mature process to bring those inefficiencies down.If you want to &#34;do microservices&#34; you have to precisely know what kind of benefits you are after. Because the benefits better be higher than the costs or you are just sabotaging your project.There are actually ways to manage huge monolithic application that don&#39;t require each team to have their own repository, ci/cd, binary, etc.How do you think things like Excel or PhotoShop have been developed? It is certainly too large for a single team to handle."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem with creating a dichotomy between &#34;monolith&#34; and &#34;microservices&#34; is that... well... it doesn&#39;t make any sense. You describe your &#34;microservices&#34; and I&#39;ll explain how it&#39;s really just a monolith.&#34;So let me get this straight, you have a Billing package and an Ordering package. How are these organized again?&#34;-&gt; &#34;We have a distributed system.&#34;&#34;So you you compile them together and deploy them horizontally across many machines? Like a distributed monolith?&#34;-&gt; &#34;No we use microservices. The two packages are compiled and deployed separately so there is no code dependencies between them.&#34;&#34;Okay. So if I understand this right, you develop each package separately but they both access the same database?&#34;-&gt; &#34;No no no no! Microservices are not just about code dependency management, they are also about data ownership. Each package is developed and deployed separately and also manages it own database.&#34;&#34;Ah, so you have two monoliths?&#34;-&gt; &#34;...&#34;You see the problem is that the above terms are too broad to describe anything meaningful about a system. And usually &#34;monolith&#34; is used to described the dependencies between code whereas &#34;microservices&#34; is used to describe dependencies about data. It turns out there is a lot of overlap.Design and implement your systems according to your use-case and stop worrying about how to label them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m so disappointed in this. Whatsapp is a functional tool. It was successful since it worked.Facebook has entirely failed to utilise it - to allow external systems to connect in so that businesses can do business on there. The voice calls are also a disaster.They&#39;ve now come along to start messing with the privacy to start selling ads.  It is insane that they&#39;re able to make such a mess of this. Is there a word for anti-innovation?Considering that they&#39;re linking Facebook ad platform with the chats, and they&#39;re forcing this upon everyone, why isn&#39;t this covered by the monopoly laws? Most of us paid some money for the app."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s absurd this article doesn&#39;t try to describe what the changes actually are. The privacy policy change doesn&#39;t functionally change anything about what data is collected or shared with Facebook. Metadata collection for ad targeting has been allowed by the privacy policy since 2016."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Honestly, as an engineer, looking at the way FAANG are becoming middle-men in just about every part of human life, I would rather ban all social media and more generally mass communication software outright than try and regulate it. It feels to me like it&#39;s gotten to the point where this type of software is doing more harm than good.I know that the software itself is not the issue, the tech has potential to do good, but as humans we are just better off without it, if you ask me.PS. Not looking to argue. Just wanted to vent."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I keep warning small time (ie most) FB page owners who advertise on FB to be very very careful as they are being subjected to a beefed up version of the psychological manipulation that regular users face as they, not the regular users, are the main customers.Facebooks corporate incentive is to get you to FEEL like your getting good value out of advertising on Facebook and to get you addicted to doing it.Not to actually deliver results.So don&#39;t trust any metric they show you, because even if its not a total fabrication it&#39;s still presented in a way to deceive you to think its better than it is.Always monitor your ROI and always calculate it using your truly end goal (sales, or in the case of civil society some sort engagement off Facebook that&#39;s tightly bound to you mission). Likes, shares, comments and reach should NEVER be the goal. Even if FBs interface is trying to convince you otherwise."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It took time, and many thousands of dollars, before I realized that the vast majority of “likes” my pages received as a result of paid campaigns on FB were from accounts which were clearly not real people.A simple look enough of their profiles revealed that, like would he expected from any fly by night CPA network, FB was using bots, or at least straw man accounts run by low-cost staff, to like and view content which FB was paid to advertise.Worse, I found that the clickthrough metrics reported by them to off-FB destinations I advertised NEVER was anywhere close to what was reported on the destination, including when tracked by Google Analytics.In short: like-fraud, click-fraud, and more.I cannot be the only person to notice these things. I assume it persists because most people, self included, simply complain and move on once we notice the “game” but don’t sue."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When Uber discovered that 80% of their ads where (allegedly fake, please don&#39;t sue me), it was a big issue, everyone was talking about it and case is in court.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some context: Daniel is the primary maintainer of curl (the ubiquitous utility and library for HTTP requests) [1]His name often shows up in the licensing disclosures/attributions of applications that include curl.The general opaqueness of modern software leads people to latch onto him and his email for all manner of things, and for non developers to attribute to him all sorts of bad motives (&#34;You hacked me!&#34;).This is especially unfortunate as Daniel has been such a genuinely positive and helpful face to a popular open source project. I feel awful that his generosity gets repaid with this kind of crap.1 - https://github.com/sponsors/bagder"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m sorry to hear that.  libCurl is great and my life is better for it.It&#39;s really best to not reply to the mentally ill people (and you can be pretty sure anyone sending something like the first is at least temporarily mentally ill).It can sometimes be extremely tempting, I know-- especially when they&#39;ve managed to say something almost perfectly constructed for pithy comeback.  But it will not help you and it will not help them. If it does anything it will just encourage the behavior.If it is any consolation lots of other people receive nasty kookmail messages -- I know first hand, in addition to the ones I get directly some of the kooks like to send massive carbon copy blasts-- as a result I have a bunch of very strange mail rules, like discarding any email that copies both a whitehouse.gov email address and Jeff Bezos, or another if both George Soros and Noam Chomsky are copied."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When making changes to a block of code or block of text, I frequently just comment out the code and rewrite it anew. I might copy-paste existing code (just to avoid stupid transcription errors). If its too large to see both what I&#39;m writing, and the old code, at the same time, I just use two windows on the same file.This is relevant to writing fiction or non-fiction as well.For example, I didn&#39;t like this, so I commented out:&gt;though his companions jogged just behind him, he would have barely seen them at all had he look. They ran, with their heads down, attentive only to their feet slapping the muddy earth, tracking the path they followed, their breath ragged.and wrote this, using the commented-out text as a reference:The fog was now so dense that he could see nothing ahead of him. He ran with his head down, breath ragged, attentive only to his feet slapping the muddy earth, tracking their path. His companions followed close behind."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sad to see so much judgement in this thread from developers who can&#39;t fathom why others would need this. &#34;Sounds like trial an error.&#34; &#34;Develop a better memory.&#34;Programming is not black and white, there is no right or wrong way to do it. OP discovered a problem they had and wrote a solution for it, believing that others might need to solve the same problem. Clearly they were correct based on plenty of others chiming in with their own anecdotes, or tools they&#39;ve discovered that help alleviate the same issue in other ways.If you&#39;ve never had to UNDO/REDO a block of code to revisit a previous state before moving forward again, kudos.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My experience doing perf optimizations in real world systems with many many people writing code to the same app is a lot of inefficiencies happen due to over fetching data, inefficiencies caused by naively using the ORM without understanding the underlying cost of the query, and lack of actual profiling to find where the actual bottlenecks are (usually people writing dumb code without realizing it&#39;s expensive).Sure, the framework matters at very large scale and the benefits from optimizing the framework become large when you&#39;re doing millions of requests a second over many thousands of servers because it can help reduce baseline cost of running the service.But I agree with the author&#39;s main point which seems to be that framework performance is pretty meaningless when comparing frameworks if you&#39;re just starting on a new project. Focus on making a product people wanna actually use first. If you&#39;re lucky enough to get to scale you can work about optimizing it then."</p>

I try to make sure each endpoint makes only a couple of queries. Each query may have multiple CTEs, but it&#39;s still only a single round-trip. That also makes you think about what to prefetch or not, maybe I want to also get the data to return if the request is OK and avoid another query.[0] https://github.com/nackjicholson/aiosql

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Really interested to see what this does to Deliveroo. I live in central London on a pretty busy street and it&#39;s really wild how many Deliveroo drivers there are. In front of most of the popular takeaway restaurants there are 3-5 drivers waiting at any given time. The increase in delivery and decrease in normal foot traffic during the pandemic has made this really stick out.Deliveroo already totally robs these restaurants. Even for a click and collect order where I get the food myself Deliveroo takes ~20-30%. I assume this will cause Deliveroo to either increase fees or reduce service which may inspire more restuarants to hire their own delivery people again.Overall I think this is a good thing, especially now. These gig workers have been absolutely essential to society over the past year. People have been able to safely shelter in their home while these guys (it&#39;s mostly guys) go out and take all the risks. Let&#39;s pay them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The court made very specific arguments:1. Uber set the fare which meant that they dictated how much drivers could earn
2. Uber set the contract terms and drivers had no say in them
3. Request for rides is constrained by Uber who can penalise drivers if they reject too many rides
4. Uber monitors a driver&#39;s service through the star rating and has the capacity to terminate the relationship if after repeated warnings this does not improveEven if this does hurt Uber short-term, it sounds like the gig economy will be just fine, as long as companies change their behaviour with respect to the above points."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t know anything about how the law works, but it seems to accord with the reality of how people tend to think of jobs.Have you ever met an Uber driver who didn&#39;t give the impression that this was what he did all the time? I haven&#39;t, though I imagine not everyone is full time. It&#39;s quite a way from the idea that anyone with a car can give someone else a ride. For instance, I&#39;ve never met a driver who happened to be going where I was going, or someone who thought they&#39;d just make few extra bucks on their day off. They must exist but it seems to not be the norm.At the same time, we&#39;re shoehorning old ideas of what&#39;s work into a modern setting, because it&#39;s reasonably quick to become a driver, and communications with the employer are minimal. Uber doesn&#39;t seem like the kind of firm where drivers might have a teambuilding excursion, though perhaps I&#39;m wrong."</p>
