								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Naturally, I took down my project right away...So a CEO bullied you. He threatened to have lawyers look at something, accused you of behaving poorly, and accused you of being difficult. He is being manipulative. He is trying to guilt / scare you into stopping. And it worked.For all readers... do not be afraid of lawyers. Especially if nobody has even talked to them yet. Lawyers do not like to lose cases, so will not push a losing agenda. Yet they also must do what their client asks, so lawyers looking into a concern, or even sending nastygrams... those are meaningless actions. It only becomes meaningful if and when if their lawyers indicate they believe they really have a case, or if your own lawyer believes they have a case. Everything before that is posturing and bullying.If I were in the same situation as OP, I&#39;d state that my intent was positive, ask to be informed of the results of discussions with attorneys, and wish them to have a nice day. Admit no wrong, make no apologies, ignore irrelevant statements (in particular personal attacks), and just let it slide until they take a real action of some kind.Once they do take an action, then it might be appropriate to do what they want. But seriously... stop letting people be bullies."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A fancy funded company like Replit getting scared by an intern&#39;s weekend project is entertaining. If your moat is so low it can be replicated in a few days, I think this open source project is the least of their worries."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well, that is unfortunately.In 2015 I was fired because some issues on a site that I was working on because some friction with the company owner. Two months before I was fired I reported that some links to others sites non related to our service was on the initial page (some porn and some scams pages). After that I heard from my ex-coworkers that a manager from another area from the company told that I was fired because I was linking porn on some pages from our service. I didn’t knew at the time that those tools existed, but only today I realized that it is an option.I was really sad with that manager and didn’t understood the reason to lie to my friends the reason of my demission. But is nice to know what may have caused the issue. Better late than never hahaha."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Seeing a lot of posts like this. Open source is wonderful in its way, but it&#39;s really not sustainable to work on projects that make money for other people - including big commercial interests - when they don&#39;t help out in any fashion. I&#39;m not just talking money or contributions. I&#39;m talking about simple acknowledgement: &#34;we use project X&#34; - even privately.A open source library that I worked on at Intel (the Hyperscan high performance regular expression library) had to shed most of its staff (including all the original folks who worked on it, including me). One of the big contributing factors was a sense that &#34;well, who really uses this&#34;. The answer was &#34;tons of people, including some major Intel target customers&#34; but a number of Hyperscan users picked up the library and never told anyone (not asking for public plaudits, but even a private communication would have been something to show our management).When you can&#39;t even say &#34;thank you, we&#39;re using your library now, it&#39;s great&#34; in a goddamn email, don&#39;t be surprised when 75% of the people maintaining and advancing it don&#39;t have jobs anymore. Never mind paying money or contributing - even acknowledgement.Open source is a recipe for burn-out. If something is important to people - especially corporate interests - there needs to be a way of getting paid. Much as I dislike those wacky &#34;free for non-commercial use, otherwise, give me a call&#34; licenses, I&#39;m starting to see the point."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As somebody with experience in developing many OSS projects of different sizes (Redis, Hping, Jim Tcl, Visitors web analyzer, and many additional smaller ones), I think that the solution is simpler than it appears: just do what you want. When you are inside the flames of a successful open source project, you may think that the solution space is binary: don&#39;t do anything, or do everything people are demanding from you. Instead you can just keep doing what you want, cherry picking what issues you want to address, reply to, what features you want to add, and so forth. Just give you a fixed amount of time to spend on the project (in my case most of the time it was &#34;all the time I&#39;ve in a day, but up to 6/8 max&#34;, but it can be even just 10 minutes every day), and in this time do the things you like to do and ignore all the others. A few issues/PRs will be perfectly aligned to what you feel is right and you&#39;ll enjoy taking care of them. Others will not, and who cares?And anyway, doing things this way I was able to write a database that beaten, in the market, products developed with hundreds of developers while I was alone, so there must be some merit in what the original author feels is worth investing into. So, just do what you want, but:1. Don&#39;t fall in the trap of thinking that who asks you for things is doing some kind of mistake or abuse just because (for example) they are not paying you. Nope, they are fine asking for things, you are fine to ignore the requests.2. Don&#39;t fall in the trap that you are not accountable about the quality of the software just because it&#39;s free software: do only want you want, but ship finished work that is reasonably well written and well documented. To do what you want, at your own peace and according to your own personal expectation has NOTHING to do with the quality of your work. Software fails, but one thing is to ship terrible stuff just because &#34;Hey it&#39;s free&#34;, another thing is to do things the way you want, but with love.3. When people attack you, reply gently saying what you think. Don&#39;t get trapped into fights, don&#39;t feed the troll, remember that many criticizing you, if you are stealing money from the table providing something free, have specific agendas (but sometimes they are just assholes), and their goal is to mount a big case. Stop them replying carefully and without anger, then let the discussion end, or continue without you.4. Make good friends in the process. They&#39;ll help you immensely when there are hard times. Remember: the smartest people 99% of the times have a big hearth and are the most friendly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At my last gig I got budget to bring in the maintainer of an open-source testing library we using for some really important stuff.We paid him $1500 for a couple of days consulting. He showed us how to fix a couple of tricky bugs and gave a talk to the eng team. At this point we&#39;ve more than recouped the investment.He was psyched to see his tool being used and I feel the visit contributed to him continuing to maintain the project.After those two days we also tried to hire him (he declined because he was making bank elsewhere). But those two days were also the best interview process ever because we did hours of pairing in non-interview mode.If you&#39;re a senior dev at a tech company with money you can easily make this kind of thing happen and it&#39;s such a win-win"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I just want to throw my 2¢ out there, as a mid-20&#39;s who went to a high-rural-population high school, there&#39;s an entire new generation of farmers who have a) accepted that Deere&#39;s need constant/regular service calls, and b) don&#39;t care to learn how to fix it (or older equipment) themselves. At the end of the day farming is just a business same as any other, it&#39;s the same reason why a lot of trucking companies lease their trucks or warehouses lease their forklifts, it&#39;s generally cheaper and less of a headache overall.I&#39;ve tried to make pleas with some of my old friends who&#39;ve complained about the locked-down nature of their JD equipment, explaining that other companies like Kubota don&#39;t have that same limitation, but the branding is just too strong (&#34;the Kubota might be cheaper to buy, and cheaper to run, and I can easily maintain it myself, but, it&#39;s not a John Deere&#34; - actual quote from a SW Ontario farmer)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"diesel engine mechanic by trade here, and ive followed this topic with interest for about five years now.  Its similar to large over-the-road trucks in that its ultimately manufacturers catering to large fleets instead of owner/operators.most farms in America are corporate monoliths.  &#34;farmers&#34; here want mttf, mtbf, metrics, and a projection of how many cam chains, PTO knuckles, lockout converters, etc... they will need to buy in 30 years of depreciable service for a machine.  They want to be able to carve the machine they own down to the last cent...the only way to do that is to turn your IH or Komatsu into a rolling cloud.  even the windshield wipers get a sensor.smaller farms with actual farmers that wear hats and overalls already balk at a million dollar sticker shock from a harvester, and if you ever go to a farm and take a look around, most tractors there are nearly sixty years old.  the priority is farming, not investor return.  The tractor needs to perform its stated function first before anything else matters.  service interval warnings and degraded performance alerts here are a failure condition the farmer works around.  they arent incentivized to stop what theyre doing at 4:15 AM and call up the local JD dealer 143 miles away for an appointment.  there isnt a second tractor.If legislation isnt passed, ultimately youll end up with what commecial trucks got in response to sensor overkill:  Gliders.  gliders are 60 year old truck drivetrains and engines that get a new cab and body parts, and get recertified for the road.  they belch smog and roar like a freight train at idle, but all thats grandfathered into EPA legislation.  New manufacturers get to crank out fleet machines at high prices, and owner/operators get their old reliable filling the parking lot with NOx and waxy sulfur haze at 4 am.  they become a market that manufacturers refuse to tap, because it cannot be fully exploited to the disadvantage of the operator."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"No-one wants to sell hardware any longer, it&#39;s not as profitable as providing it on a subscription (dare we say &#34;rent&#34;) and forcing all support, maintenance and additions to go through your channels as part of the subscription package.Unfortunately this trend is everywhere now. It happened to servers, media, has started to happen to cars... but it&#39;s happened already to agricultural hardware.Super profitable if you are the provider (especially with all the data one can yield from operating the hardware), super annoying and frustrating if you are the consumer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wow. That is unexpected. I have to say that FaceTime in a browser sandbox is one of the few Apple products I would consider using. I wonder what made them take this path?I also wonder if someone could build a Matrix bridge if it is available via web, that would be fairly cool.Some questions:- Is it phone-number based IDs? Or can I pick a username or get a random ID?- Is spam going to be a problem? Previous Apple had the advantage that you had to buy a multi-hundred dollar advice to call someone. Will they need to implement new spam measures (or will you simply have to add a contact first)?"</p>

As soon as it detects a SIM card slot (with or without SIM in it) it only allows you to set it up as the primary device, rather than a secondary like a tablet."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not really sure why this was originally flagged (or this is possibly a dupe of the original post which was flagged?), but even though the comments that I&#39;ve seen so far are giving it a negative spin I think there are quite a few important points in the article about the way in which our (I&#39;m generalizing about the broad HN demographic) quite privileged lifestyles do have a concomitant cost for somebody who needs to service our day-to-day needs and wants.This ranges from everything like online shopping (I bought a pair of trainers yesterday on a Sunday afternoon, and they were shipped from the warehouse 2 hours later), to the people who are used in low-wage countries to make those trainers at a price I feel is &#39;affordable&#39;.I&#39;m reminded of a newspaper interview with a bank director here in Sweden a few years ago. She spoke at length about how we should accept that our children won&#39;t have regular jobs - they would have a few &#39;gig&#39; employments: driving a cab a few days each week before stocking shelves in the evening and maybe working part-time at an old-people&#39;s home. The obvious implication to me was that it was other people&#39;s children she was talking about not her&#39;s. On the contrary, they would obviously be sitting in the back of the cab, on their way to their well-paid career in banking, just like their mother."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You have a 40+ hour workweek, until you put in enough intelligently focused 80 hour work weeks coupled with some dumb luck, to possibly arrive at anything resembling a 4 hour workweek.I&#39;m really tired of seeing online &#39;equality&#39; warriors think entrepreneurship is easy and should be used to pay for all of society&#39;s financial hardships; entrepreneurship is a significant toll that can cause financial ruin and mental instability just to have a chance at arriving at any sort of time liberation.When you create something you place your own time, finances, energy at risk - in many cases you get a low ROI in return. But like all educations, one can get better and improve over time.One must vision the system, design the system, find ways to finance the system, execute the system, manage the system, and optimize the processes. Then possibly, you might be able to receive benefits from that system - but it is in no way guaranteed.So don&#39;t pity the founder, but don&#39;t denigrate them either; actions taken on own volition mean founders must enjoy or live with the outcomes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author has crab in a bucket mindset. One person having enough success to have the lifestyle they want does not mean somebody they employ is being victimized by them. This might resonate with some, but for me it is a big turn-off. It smacks of jealousy and a rejection of all personal responsibility in charting a path to where you want to go in life.Tim&#39;s book isn&#39;t without flaws (and is now significantly dated in many of the details), but one of the core messages is to recognize we all have a choice to do something other than work 50 years at a job we hate and then retire/die. Tons of people go through life without considering any alternatives to the path they are on, or developing the self-knowledge about what they actually want, which is a big reason so many people end up so unhappy.He also emphasizes creating repeatable systems that you can then automate with software or hand off to other people. This helps you scale your business and income, but more importantly it preserves your time for other things you value more. The blog author thinks this is somehow a bad thing, but if nobody ever realized the efficiencies of exchanging money for services then most of us would be naked and starving; a huge chain of such exchanges is needed to produce the modern miracles of cheap clothing and food that are the foundation of modern living.Tim didn&#39;t actually retire to the beach for a hedonic 4-hour lifestyle with servants refilling the wine glass and fanning him with palm fronds; the guy works harder than most people with a new huge book every couple of years, lots of active investing, and running a major podcast almost every week. The difference between him and other people is that he&#39;s not wasting time on stuff that other people could do for him.I&#39;m not a &#34;bro&#34;, but I guess I&#39;ll stand here and defend Tim&#39;s book because it gave me a lot to think about."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Founder here,ToolJet is a no-code platform for building &amp; deploying custom internal tools. ToolJet is built using Ruby on Rails and ReactJS. ToolJet can connect to existing data sources of companies such as databases, Google sheets, API endpoints, external services, and more. ToolJet&#39;s drag and drop app builder can quickly create UI widgets such as tables, charts, forms, etc and connect these widgets with the data from data sources.I have been dabbling with the idea of ToolJet for a while. but the real progress happened over the last 7 weeks while I was in quarantine.  One of my family members tested positive for covid and then came to the state-mandated lockdown. Not being able to step out of my home has been particularly hard, but nevertheless gave birth to ToolJet.I believe that the tools that require access to sensitive data should be self-hosted ( data never leaves the premises) and open-source ( modify the software to fit organization-specific requirements )."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like low-code apps like this have hit commodity level.A bit of history - in the late 90s, you could (and we did) build a multi-million dollar product doing basic content management for plain old web pages. That heydey lasted a couple years before Wordpress and other such tools came around and basic CMS was more of a solved problem than a unique product.The same has occurred over the years in multiple niches - a tool that would have been a terrific SaaS at one point gets built out, normalized, and well understood... to the point that it is no longer a unique value prop to just build a tool that solves problem X. You need to build the tool AND have some unique perspective and value prop that escalates it above all the others.Low-code CRUD builders with DB integration and some basic workflow, reporting, and security now have hit that mark. There have always been big players in this market (Microsoft, IBM, Salesforce, etc.) It is good to see smaller players coming into their  own in recent years, and this specific one is open source, which is a nice differentiator between it and many others."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Pretty cool project to build in 7 weeks! Congratulations! Your lockdown has been way more productive than for some of us.I&#39;m a founder of Appsmith, which Tooljet mentions in the GitHub project as an inspiration. https://github.com/appsmithorg/appsmithWe are an Apache 2.0 licensed internal apps builder that&#39;s being used by teams in Adobe, IBM, MSFT, Rappi, Swiggy, and 1000&#39;s of other companies.Difference vs. other projects mentioned here:
1. Community edition is free for unlimited users
2. Great developer experience(local development, debugging, &amp; Git sync is coming soon)
3. Pricing model will be usage based and not user based"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There are many parallels with seismic interpretation here.  Many companies/etc keep promising to &#34;revolutionize&#34; interpretation and remove the need for the &#34;tedious&#34; work of a geologist/geophysicist. This is very appealing to management for a wide variety of reasons, so it gets a lot of funding.What folks miss is that an interpreter _isn&#39;t_ just drawing lines / picking reflectors.  That&#39;s less than 1% of the time spent, if you&#39;re doing it right.Instead, the interpreter&#39;s role is to incorporate all of the information from _outside_ the image.  E.g. &#34;sure we see this here, but it can&#39;t be X because we see Y in this other area&#34;, or &#34;there must be a fault in this unimaged area because we see a fold 10 km away&#34;.By definition, you&#39;re in a data poor environment.  The features you&#39;re interested in are almost never what&#39;s clearly imaged -- instead, you&#39;re predicting what&#39;s in that unimaged, &#34;mushy&#34; area over there through fundamental laws of physics like conservation of mass and understanding of the larger regional context.  Those are deeply difficult to incorporate in machine learning in practice.Put a different way, the role is not to come up with a reasonable realization from an image or detect feature X in an image.  It&#39;s to outline the entire space of physically valid solutions and, most importantly, reject the non-physically valid solutions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Radiologists are not even trying. They treat their methods like FDA-approved medical devices. Even basic image segmentation to help with 3D structure recognition is off-limits. The benefits of neural networks in diagnostic radiology will not occur in one shot, and I don’t think it will happen at all in the United States until people start sending their data elsewhere. But good luck getting it. I just got my CT scan from a total mis-diagnosis that resulted in an unnecessary surgery. It came on a CD that won’t read in the only drive I have access to. And even that is just images. It’s not possible to get the actual data. This is not a failure of DNN. This is active AMA hostility toward technology, and not just in radiology. Just watch, people are going to start going elsewhere for medical care. They will do everything they can to get insurance requirements, subsidies, and laws against it, but they will lose. They are a dishonest Luddite cartel, and they’re hurting people."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Radiologist here with an interest in this topic. I think the problem with most AI applications in radiology thus far is that they simply don&#39;t add enough value to the system to gain widespread use. If something truly revolutionary comes along, and it causes a clinical benefit, healthcare systems will shift to adapt this in a few years. AI just hasn&#39;t lived up to it&#39;s promise, and I agree it&#39;s because most of the people involved don&#39;t get that the job of a radiologist is way more complex than they think it is.Everytime I open a journal, I see more examples of either downright AI nonsense (&#39;We used AI to detect COVID by the sounds of a cough&#39;) or stuff that&#39;s just cooked up in a lab somewhere for a publication (&#39;Our algorithm can detect pathology X with an accuracy of 95%, here&#39;s our AUC&#39;).Hyperbolic headlines - Geoff Hinton saying in 2016 that it&#39;s time to stop training radiologists springs to mind - don&#39;t help the over promise of AI, and then they shoot themselves in the foot when they underdeliver.Earlier discussions about radiologists being self interested in sabotaging AI is tinfoil hat stuff - if I had an AI algorithm in the morning that could sort out the 20 lung nodules in a scan, or tell me which MS plaque is new in a field of 40, I&#39;d be able to report twice as many scans and make twice as much money.Companies come along every month promising their AI pixie dust is going to improve your life. It probably will, but 10 years from now, not today. The AI Rad companies are caught in an endless hype cycle of overpromising and under delivering."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s a good list, but like most (all?) of these lists it doesn&#39;t offer too much advice on organizational best practices.IMO a security program which cannot justify its own worth to others in the organization is incomplete.Most security professionals I&#39;ve met (and I&#39;ve been one of them, too) assume that security is or should be everyone&#39;s top priority. They struggle to deal with people for whom security is just one of many competing concerns."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think of myself as pretty security-conscious. But it&#39;s striking to me just how _long_ this list is. Even as someone who is trying to constantly think about this stuff, if I were faced with a list of this magnitude, I&#39;d be tempted to throw in the towel and admit defeat right off the bat. It&#39;s no wonder so many SaaSes end up getting exposed. Even with a lot of best practices built in to so many cloud providers... how did we as an industry end up in a place where it&#39;s this dang hard to keep systems secure?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This list is the &#34;brute force&#34; security algo. Eg &#39;just make everything more secure&#39;. This would have someone upgrading a door lock with a hole in an adjacent wall.There are at least the following major factors:* what might happen (event A,B, ...) ?* how probable is eventi?* what is the cost if eventi happens?* how can one deal with eventi? (action 1, 2 ...) ?* how much / how long does actioni take?* what actions should we perform with the skills/resources/time we have?My algo:1 enumerate possible security issues2 assign approx probability and cost to business3 re-order by prob*cost4 imagine ways to address issues, assign cost to address5 decide on courses to address issues6 for next epoch, address issues7 goto 1"</p>
