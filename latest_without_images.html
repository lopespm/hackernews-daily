								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The Uber propaganda here in this thread is insane. Taxi’s maybe have been shit but that does not in anyway justify Uber breaking the law to conquer the market (btw, now that they’ve done that, they’ve also turned to shit because it was unsustainable).Perfect may be the enemy of good but we shouldn’t excuse companies using endless VC money and law breaking to achieve something that’s marginally better for consumers.Obviously there are some exceptions to this in the comments but generally, in modern countries where the taxi firms aren’t run by literal mafias and killing people, we should condemn Uber’s behaviour."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Still a million times better than what it replaced. About 20 years ago I was working with the Australian taxi cab industry. The hq of the regulatory authority shared the address of the main payment system. The regulatory authority was made up of representatives of each taxi cab company that each had one vote. There was one taxi company (the one that controlled the payment system allowed) with 200+ subsidiaries that made up that organization. If anyone tried to get into the taxi industry they&#39;d use their 200 votes to say they are not allowed by regulations. This was a company making 2billion a year in one state of Australia alone (NSW). It was so incredibly fucking corrupt and i am thankful to Uber Lyft and all the other incumbents for managing to get their foot in. It required dirty dealing to get past this corruption."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Uber isn&#39;t the most ethical company for sure but here in Brussels the taxi industry is pretty shady as well.Getting a taxi license costs an exorbitant amount of money and it&#39;s done through all kinds of dodgy deals.There&#39;s 1-2 companies that have a monopoly on the whole industry.There&#39;s weird rules about which types of taxis can &#34;serve&#34; the airport, akin to what mobsters are responsible for collecting trash in what areas.You&#39;ll often get &#34;sorry the payment terminal is out of order, cash only&#34; BS.A study a few years ago showed the main taxi company, according to their tax documents, earned a ridiculously low amount of money per day (= obvious dodging of taxes).They clearly refused to innovate for years. When you called their number you&#39;d get some unintelligible voice on the other end that would give you about 10 sec to state your details before they&#39;d clearly run out of patience.You could only request pickups at specific addresses that would then be connected to your phone number / profile. So &#34;pick me up on this street corner&#34; was impossible.The last time we called one for a ride to the airport they didn&#39;t show up at the agreed time so we got an Uber. Taxi company called us many times screaming insults down the phone, followed by an offensive email with an invitation to pay and threats of small claims courts.In light of all that, I have zero problems with someone else moving in fast to break things."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;Google makes $40bn...If I can create something that just a tiny fraction of people find useful, then I can create a huge amount of value.You conflate two meanings of value: monetary value, and intrinsic value. Search engines are intrinsically but not monetarily valuable to users. Search engines are monetarily, but not intrinsically, valuable to advertisers. You can get into trouble when you conflate these two meaning of &#34;value&#34;.In fact, right here is the pivot on which the internet goes from an idealistic shang-ri-la for geeks, to a commercial hellscape for the unwashed masses. It is surprisingly easy to create intrinsic value with computers! You see it all day every day on HN: some geek had a thought, spends a weekend making it, and then deploys a solution.It is surprisingly hard to extract monetary value from an intrinsically valuable solution. In fact, I believe that creating artificial scarcity is the hardest part of building an internet business, requiring invention on par with the intrinsically valuable part - and yet its the very thing that idealists rail against.(And making something artificially scarce does seem morally repugnant. And yet I don&#39;t see any other way to pay developers. Full stop. Open source software + consulting fees is a good way to go, but that can&#39;t apply to hosted search for the public. Well I guess it could, you could teach businesses how to game your own engine!)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Perhaps a better approach would be building an open source www index or even a full current cache - as an enabler for people to build their own search engines?Right now it is extremely difficult to build your own web crawler that would compete with Google. And that is not because of the technology, but because multiple sites will prevent your bot from accessing them if you&#39;re not Google or Bing - either through robots.txt, or through directly banning your IP if it&#39;s trying to crawl and it&#39;s not a confirmed google-bot.Having a non-profit, open source, crawler that keeps an up to date index (or web cache) of the web would help competition spring up."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Disclaimer: I work for Google, though far away from Search.Regardless of search engine design, there&#39;s HUGE money in SEO. Any successful search engine will be gamed. Do you have the developer power to go red-queen against all the large companies in the world?"</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32040506">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"(disclaimer: lead brand manager, been at the table of a lot of the meetings where these logo changes happen.)There&#39;s a few different reasons (especially depending on the company) why that these happen, but I personally think it boils down to two unintuitive quasi-psychological reasons.- When suits are fumbling around looking for a new shiny project that&#39;ll give them a sense of &#34;legacy&#34; and their fingerpints all over (that won&#39;t affect immediate profits), somewhere in marketing and brand is usually the first place they&#39;ll grab.  If wins, fantastic, they&#39;ve secured their legacy both in a career-spanning sense and at the company itself with a bonus. If it fails disastrously, easy enough to quietly switch back to the old and to save face by tackling a different project.- Sort of relatedly, a lot of marketing suits hate feeling &#34;left out&#34; of trends; it&#39;s something I loathe about the industry, the hyper-focus and optimization of being at the crest of new trends (when arguably they&#39;re usually shittier than the previous ones). Oftentimes their entire salary / sense of purpose of being at the job is tied into with presenting the latest and greatest, and insecure designers will be too happy to be enablers.(My opinion may be a minority of the industry itself as if it were me, we&#39;d be back to 90&#39;s era logos for the sheer zany quality.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article is confused about the difference between a logo and a word mark, which is what they are showing. Big brands are super pedantic about how and where logo marks and word marks are used. You shouldn&#39;t be seeing these word marks in contexts that are not already dripping in branding for the company.Look at the Pinterest Brand guidelines (https://business.pinterest.com/en-au/brand-guidelines/) and you well find them saying: &#34;Only use the Pinterest badge (please don’t use our word mark)&#34;. The Pinterest badge is the exact same stylised letter P from the old wordmark. So, almost everywhere you encounter a Pinterest logo it will be the stylised graphic. They can do that because enough people recognise the brand that they can drop the &#34;interest&#34;.The Facebook logo is an even weirder example because they are comparing the old Facebook app word mark with the newer Facebook-the-company word mark. That logo was specifically designed to look different from the app. Now that Facebook is now Meta, that uppercase logo has been retired.Microsoft, Facebook, Pinterest, Spotify and Airbnb all have stylised logo marks. eBay and Google use word marks, but are brightly coloured and immediately recognisable 99% of the time they are seen."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These are just the word marks, not the full logos.I mocked up a comparison of the logos (Microsoft/Airbnb/Spotify/Pinterest rarely use their word marks without the accompanying icon) and they start to retain a _little_ more personality, at least for the tech comparison.https://imgur.com/a/v5yKD3oIt still seems fair to say they&#39;re more bland than past iterations, though. The theme is ”[optional icon] + sans serif word mark”, and it&#39;s a good example of “small m minimalism” — a kind of unthinking collective march toward an absence of detail — touched on by The Cultural Tutor in this thread:https://twitter.com/culturaltutor/status/1538211892707086338&gt; Perhaps minimalist design is so prevalent because we no longer have anything to say.&gt; You don&#39;t need me to explain what the Gothic cathedral says, for example.&gt; But the skyscraper? It doesn&#39;t say anything, really. It&#39;s just... there.&gt; And suddenly everything, everywhere starts to look the same.&gt; Absolute neutrality. No detail. No identity.&gt; What does that say about us?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The linked article ends with this:“Why the Japanese media has refused to identify the  ‘religious group’ that formed the motive for the killing must remain as speculation at this juncture, though it reflects very poorly on Japan’s status as a democratic nation.”It’s important to note that the Japanese media is not monolithic.It’s true that the major newspapers (Asahi, Yomiuri, Mainichi, Nikkei, etc.) and the broadcaster NHK do not, as of this moment, seem to have named the religious group yet; nor do they seem to have explained why they are not naming it.However, the group is named in online news stories by some of the weekly magazines [1, 2, 3] and will presumably be in their print editions within a few days.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Lichess is amazing given how little they receive in funding. The interface is miles ahead of commercial competitors.They also handle guest plays much better. I&#39;ve faced less cheating bots and no annoying pop ups on lichess when playing as a guest compared to chess.comCan anyone point me to how they handle cheating detection? I would love a high level overview of how it works especially when you have no data on the player.fun nugget: HN users hosted tournaments on lichess at the start of the pandemic [0]0] https://lichess.org/team/hacker-news"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Always excited when chess pops up on HN once a month or so. As someone who picked it up as a hobby in December, I can attest that lichess is a great app and site for folks looking to get back into the game or get started (I’m also a premium chess.com member as I use both products).For those of you thinking about picking up chess, I’d highly recommend watching the Chess Brah “Building Habits” series on YouTube. Watch the first five or so videos, and just start practicing those habits in rapid games (recommend 15 minute with 10 second increment on lichess, which shows up as 15+10). Embrace the losses, and just keep working on not hanging your pieces for free.If you’re intimidated by playing other humans, you can try the “Maia 1” bot on Lichess. It’ll likely beat you up for a while if you’re a beginner, but it’s a bot designed to play more like a human, and it’ll help you get the reps to feel more comfortable playing other humans.From there, just enjoy yourself. Chess can be frustrating because by design you always lose about 50% or your takes, but once you learn to accept the losses, it can be a great mental exercise to keep your brain sharp."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yes! The front-end code for Lichess is what got me to learn Mithril years ago. Really clean code for such a complex application. Here’s a great example:https://github.com/lichess-org/lichobile/blob/master/src/ui/..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For the past few weeks, I&#39;ve been collecting and refining prompting tricks for getting GPT-3 to emit and understand various types of non-prose output. Many of these are discussed in the Twitter thread the OP links to, but I&#39;d like to highlight a few of my favorites here too.- GPT-3 can produce simple SVG diagrams (https://twitter.com/goodside/status/1545883023719239689) from an English description, or incrementally modify a given SVG diagram (https://twitter.com/goodside/status/1545888869207400454).- GPT-3 can produce diagrams using Graphviz dot notation (https://twitter.com/goodside/status/1545109709035900928), including diagrams that incorporate real-world context (https://twitter.com/goodside/status/1545112039147847682) not given in the prompt.- It can emit and understand HTML and Markdown, including table markup — e.g., &#34;Produce an HTML table giving the members of the Beatles and their instruments&#34;- It can accept/emit multiple named files, with arbitrary content, simply by embedding those files as values in a larger JSON/YAML document. Here, (https://twitter.com/goodside/status/1545848754883919872) I demonstrate completing the file tree of a trivial Python package given a README.md.- It can understand the raw JSON file contents of .ipynb files, successfully following directions given to it in markdown cells, emitting multiple code cells, etc.While all this is fun, as many people have pointed out the model has a bad habit of &#34;hallucinating&#34; — producing highly specific, wrong output. Avoiding this (https://twitter.com/goodside/status/1545793388871651330) is more of an art than a science. Be highly skeptical of any output you get from GPT-3, and search for verification methods where you can."</p>

 input a,c;
 output y;
 assign y= c ? a : 1&#39;bz; 
endmodule*This code is a Verilog module that defines three inputs (a, c, y) and one output (y). The output y is assigned to the value of a if c is true, otherwise it is assigned to 1&#39;bz.*What is 1&#39;bz ?*1&#39;bz is a Verilog constant that represents a bit value of &#39;z&#39;, which is used to indicate a high impedance state.*Why is high impedance used ?*High impedance is used in digital circuits to allow multiple drivers to share a single bus without contention. When two or more drivers attempt to drive the same bus at the same time, a contention can occur and the bus voltage can become undefined. By using high impedance, drivers can avoid contention and allow the bus to remain stable.*Give me a testbench for this module*module testbench;

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This course looks &#34;fine&#34;; however, I would recommend that anyone interested in exploring CS (or perhaps even if you are a self-taught and very able coder who wants to learn those missing fundamentals ) takes CS50 out of Harvard.It is easily the most engaging course I have ever taken and it&#39;s available for free on edx.org or you can take the &#34;real&#34; class from Harvard extension for a couple grand.  You can go into this class as an underwater basket weaver or a strong coder and get a ton out of it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d highly recommend looking at the edX course &#34;How to Code: Simple Data&#34; and &#34;How to Code: Complex Data&#34; as an introduction to computer science.  Those two classes were created around a solid pedagogy of how students learn to break real world problems down into code. Dr. Kiczales is incredibly good at taking everything step by step and making sure nothing gets left out or missed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When a person completes week 4, they&#39;ll have learned boolean logic,  if/for loops, bytes &amp; variables, and had an overview of hardware from the previous weeks.If the person is ambitious, that is the minimum required to begin, and it might be worth seeing just how far they can get in Nand2Tetris[0] where a person simulates building elementary logic gates and circuits leading to an also very basic Arithmetic logic unit and simple ram from nand gates.I wouldn&#39;t expect the person with just a few weeks of CS101 to do week 4 of Nand2Tetris where they try out machine language on their machine that leads to building an assembler, and then a compiler, as this eventually requires knowing Java or a similar language, but more power to them if they preview the course and see how much they can understand.[0] https://www.nand2tetris.org/"</p>
