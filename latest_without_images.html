								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If this effort succeeds (and I hope it does) now Python developers will need to contend with the event-loop albatross of asyncio and all of its weird complexity.In an alternate Python timeline, asyncio was not introduced into the Python standard library, and instead we got a natively supported, robust, easy-to-use concurrency paradigm built around green/virtual threading that accommodates both IO and CPU bound work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Threads are certainly important, but I have to say that I found the multiprocessing package to work very well. I think a lot of the things people think they need threads for would actually be better with multiprocessing instead. Memory protection is good! Shared memory is still available and explicit sharing of just what you need is better in a lot of ways than implicit sharing of everything.I will be glad if the GIL is fixed but I think people reach for threads too quickly and too often."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a great list of influences on the design (from the article comments where the prototype author Sam Gross responded to someone wishing for more cross pollination across language communities):—————&#34;… but I&#39;ll give a few more examples specific to this project of ideas (or code) taken from other communities:- Biased reference counting (originally implemented for Swift)- mimalloc (originally developed for Koka and Lean)- The design of the internal locks is taken from WebKit (https://webkit.org/blog/6161/locking-in-webkit/)- The collection thread-safety adapts some code from FreeBSD (https://github.com/colesbury/nogil/blob/nogil/Python/qsbr.c)- The interpreter took ideas from LuaJIT and V8&#39;s ignition interpreter (the register-accumulator model from ignition, fast function calls and other perf ideas from LuaJIT)- The stop-the-world implementation is influenced by Go&#39;s design (https://github.com/golang/go/blob/fad4a16fd43f6a72b6917eff65... )&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Most important paragraph, IMO:&gt; Conducted Oct. 8 to 10, the online poll surveyed 1,545 Canadians and cannot be assigned a margin of error because internet-based polls are not considered random samples.It&#39;s a pretty good sample-size, but we don&#39;t get error bars. I don&#39;t remember if there was anything FB-critical happening that week (when did the study about teen mental health come out?), but the timeframe could also affect the survey."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used to think, untill recently, that Facebook was just a tool and all this hatred was overblown. After all, I modulated my use of it just fine. My usage is sparse, and I use messenger to talk with people I know, it kept us together. I can see how community and bringing old friends together is precious.But, recently, I realized someone I used to be very close has mental problems. Undiagnosed, but there is no other way I can explain his behaviour to myself. Obsessive behaviour, can only talk about his conspiratorial obsession, erratic, spends most of his time &#34;learning&#34; about a specific conspiracy. And I see how Facebook is exacerbating this. I see how these things are poisoning his mind, fantasies weaved by other mentally ill people. It&#39;s just sad, when I thought about it and dawned on me  most of those _wild_ conspiracy theories are people that need help feeding each other&#39;s sickness.And then I look on my dad&#39;s wall, and saw the same hatred and resentment growing, and it scared me, the possibility he might drift even more this way.Now I changed my mind. I think it is harmful and it does induce bad states in people that would otherwise be better, or at least... Surrounded by better support systems. But I still think it&#39;s not _just_ Facebook. It&#39;s a confluence of factors."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a side note, I&#39;m a little saddened when I see friends apologize for their posts. There&#39;s such a reaction to &#34;influencer culture&#34; that people feel like foodgrams and humblebrags are a terrible thing, and in excess they certainly can be, but I think from most people it&#39;s a billion times better than strawman political arguments and manipulative media that is far worse for our mental health than just comparing ourselves to someone&#39;s good day.I had a friend post a picture of food made from ingredients they had made in their own garden, and it made them feel so good to eat it because they had had a rough year and it was a good personal win, so they apologetically posted a photo of it.Forget the rest of the trash on Facebook - seeing a friend I haven&#39;t seen in a while experience something good and being able to share that with them is something we need more of in the world. I&#39;d trade away all the &#34;only geniuses can remember the order of operations for this future scam page&#34; or &#34;you won&#39;t believe how this person misrepresents their opponents views and tears that misrepresentation apart!&#34; and keep stuff like this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Despite its reputation, Kubernetes is actually quite easy to master for simple use cases. And affordable enough for more complex ones.The fundamental abstractions are as simple as they can be, representing concepts that you&#39;d already be familiar with in a datacenter environment. A cluster has nodes (machines), and you can run multiple pods (which is the smallest deployable unit on the cluster) on each node. A pod runs various types of workloads such as web services, daemons, jobs and recurring jobs which are made available (to the cluster) as docker/container images. You can attach various types of storage to pods, front your services with load-balancers etc.All of the nouns in the previous paragraph are available as building blocks in Kubernetes. You build your complex system declaratively from these simpler parts.When I look at Nomad&#39;s documentation, I see complexity. It mixes these basic blocks with those from HashiCorp&#39;s product suite."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been running a production-grade Nomad cluster on Hetzner for the past 1 1/2 years and it&#39;s fantastic. It was amazingly easy to set up compared to Kubernetes (which I also did), the UI is awesome, updates haven&#39;t broken anything yet (as long as you follow the changelog) and it&#39;s stable. I really like the separation of concerns the HashiStack offers. You can start out just using Consul for your service meshing, and then add Nomad + Vault to get a similar experience to Kubernetes.Yes, it doesn&#39;t cover as many features as Kubernetes, but it should be good enough for most software and you can still make the switch later. I would never go back.You can read more on our blog if you&#39;re interested: https://pirsch.io/blog/techstack/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It is frustrating to me that despite the blunt verbiage about it being a beta device for software and hardware developers, people even here are griping about it being not ready for everyday use. If a free and open-source mobile operating system is missing software support for a feature you want, please contribute to its development."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It has a Quectel EG25-G modem.I&#39;ve not used this particular device, but I have used Quectel GNSS modules, and they&#39;ve been a surprisingly helpful company to work with. I&#39;m a nobody, and working with Sony, Trimble, or ublox has been an exercise in frustration; you have to convince a salesperson that you&#39;re a big company and you can sell thousands of devices in order to just read the datasheet.  This one does have some of the documents locked behind an access request, but in my experience, they&#39;ve been very generous with those grants.The modem supports the following bands:    LTE-FDD: B1/B2/B3/B4/B5/B7/B8/B12/B13/B18/B19/B20/B25/B26/B28   
    LTE-TDD: B38/B39/B40/B41 
    WCDMA: B1/B2/B4/B5/B6/B8/B19  
    GSM: B2/B3/B5/B8

which is pretty good. Americans will want 4G bands B2, 4, 5, 12, 13, 14, 17, 20, 25, 26, 29, 30, 41, 66, and 71; this implements 9/15, it&#39;s missing bands 14, 17, 29, 30, 66, and 71. Those missing bands are either subsets or supersets of other bands (which could be interesting from a firmware perspective - will a tower with a band 66 antenna give this modem some of the central band 4 subset, or will it try to negotiate a channel that this can&#39;t access?), little-used ATT bands, or the 600 MHz T-mobile band 71, which has a wide rollout but poor device support."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I received a Pinephone in the latest shipment, about three weeks ago. I also got the convergence dock to be able to attach a monitor, keyboard and mouse. I am extremely motivated to get off Android on my phone, and yet my Pinephone has already been discarded (and I never even put a SIM card in it).There are far too many out-of-the-box bugs and glitches to consider this a usable product. For example, the convergence dock will not display on a monitor. Firefox browser displays too wide for the phone screen, so unusable. A dozen other issues on first day.Even a development board should work better than this, have documentation of the known problems, and have some support mechanism that works.I don&#39;t think better/more expensive hardware is the problem. It&#39;s software, caused by lack of users, lack of investment, and too many &#34;competing&#34; distributions of Linux."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"While I don&#39;t have any sympathy for this pilot, I also find the FAA&#39;s excuses here to be less than convincing. Basically, their position is &#34;Well, we trusted this Boeing employee to tell us the truth about the new flight controls, and he didn&#39;t.&#34; But if the regulators had actually done their job and independently evaluated the new flight controls, they wouldn&#39;t have had to take the word of any Boeing employees. I realize that that&#39;s the way the FAA does things now, but this whole debacle should be a warning to everyone that that method of regulation is not acceptable. The whole point of independent regulation is to not allow obvious conflicts of interest to harm the public."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nailed for being the only guy stupid enough to write instant messages bragging about misleading the FAA.As a longtime corporate grunt, I can guess exactly how management leaned on him. He should have left and let the scumbags find another patsy to do their dirty work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Internal Boeing e-mails between various Chief Technical Pilots and other Boeing staff are available at [1]. It shows that there was an overarching requirement for the program to to ensure that 737 pilots could fly the 737 MAX with minimal &#34;Level B&#34; training (e.g. no need for hours of simulator training).Per [2], MCAS was poorly designed and exhibited a failure mode (e.g. AOA sensor failure) that required immediate pilot action to avert disaster. For pilots that were aware of the MCAS failure mode and how to respond, simulation showed they could respond and avert disaster within typically 4 seconds. A delay of 10 seconds from a pilot to respond correctly to the failure event would be catastrophic.A Boeing staffer wrote to the Chief Technical Pilot now indicted[^][1] regarding the pilot action required in those critical few seconds:  &#34;I fear that skill is not very intuitive any more with the younger pilots and those who have become too reliant on automation&#34;

The Chief Technical Pilot now indicted[^] responds:  &#34;This is the path with least risk to Level B. We need to sell this as very intuitive basic pilot skill&#34;.

Boeing it appears then opted for updating Non-Normal Checklists (NNCs) for pilots instead of:* Fixing the MCAS flaw to remove the failure mode altogether* Ensuring pilots were trained to handle an MCAS failure in a simulator* Otherwise ensuring that pilots were aware of the non-intuitive nature of MCAS and the particular failure mode requiring immediate &lt;10sec response from pilotsIf the failure mode with MCAS did occur, pilots didn&#39;t even have 10 seconds to find the NNC and go through the checklist steps before catastrophe was set to occur. They were not aware of MCAS being present on the aircraft and per the Boeing staffer raising the concern, &#34;that skill is not very intuitive&#34; in relation to acting on the failure mode should it have occurred.[1] https://transportation.house.gov/imo/media/doc/Compressed%20...[2] https://www.incose.org/docs/default-source/enchantment/21031...[^] Assumed from job titles in the e-mails, as names are redacted."</p>

My entire marketing strategy is just sharing all my ups and downs, instead of paying for ads. A lot like @patio11 did in his blog posts.This /open page is just another part of that besides my incessant tweeting about every little feature I built for years at https://twitter.com/levelsio.I still can&#39;t understand it&#39;s over $1M/y, it&#39;s an insane number for me and I think I would have never believed I&#39;d ever get there if you told me years ago. COVID had a lot do with making remote work suddenly big and my site benefits from that a lot.Thank you Hacker News!P.S. This wouldn&#39;t be possible without my server guy @daniellockyer, who has helped keep my VPS up for years.P.S.2.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not a solo founder, but I do a lot of ops professionally. Unless you have a specific reason, I say it’s best to avoid complicated tooling until later.k8s, ci, etc are all really useful and solve a lot of hard problems, but god are they a bitch to set up and then monitor, fix when something weird happens, secure from nasty people outside, patch when some update becomes necessary, resist the urge to “improve”, etc. This doesn’t include the time it takes to work these tools into your project, like k8s for example really requires you grok its model of how stuff it runs is supposed to look. There’s a reason entire companies exist that simply offer managed versions of these services!If you’re using fewer than like 10 boxes and don’t work with many people, you can get away with spooky arcane oldhat sysadmin deploy techniques (scp release to prod hosts, run deploy script, service or cron to keep running) and honestly it’s pretty fun to just run a command and poof you’re deployed. Then you can just wait until it starts making sense to use fancier tooling (more load, more sites/DCs, more services, more people/teams, etc). Monitoring is always good to start with, for other stuff a  good litmus test is that price points for hosted k8s &amp; ops stuff will start to make sense, you’ll be paying in time in any case. Who knows, maybe when that happens something new will pop up that makes even more sense. Until then, reducing the amount of stuff you need to worry about is always a good strategy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lots and lots of best practice exists specifically to help teams, and especially teams with some normal amount of turnover.The problems of a solo dev are very different than a dev on a team. Knowledge silos don&#39;t exist. Distributed expertise doesn&#39;t exist. There&#39;s no one to mentor, no shared vision to maintain, no intertia to combat.I consult on big complicated team projects. I also manage multiple solo projects.On solo projects, deployment is a script I run from my dev machine. I&#39;m the only person who deploys; anything else would be solving a problem I don&#39;t have.The only &#34;CI&#34; is running the tests before I run the deployment script. I&#39;m the only one who needs to see the outcome of the tests. Anything more would be solving a problem I don&#39;t have.Architecture is whatever makes the most sense to me personally -- which is often miles away from what I would recommend to a client, who needs something any new hire will recognize and be able to work with.I pay a service to manage backups so I can walk away from a solo project for months and know it&#39;s ticking away.The point is: solve problems you actually have. Don&#39;t try to run a &#34;professional&#34; operation by doing what big teams do all by yourself. Big teams have different problems."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have no idea why there&#39;s nothing here saying &#34;don&#39;t&#34;. Go and get a Heroku account, hook it up to your Github repository&#39;s master branch for deploys, use Github Actions for CI, and then get on with life.Yes, you&#39;ll pay more for a Heroku Postgres instance than you would for a VPS on Digital Ocean with Postgres running on it, likewise you&#39;ll pay more for Heroku Dynos than another VPS to run your application server. On the other side though, your backup, rollback, deploy, and scaling strategies can all be &#34;Heroku does that&#34;, and you can focus on the much more valuable job of building a business."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When developing a webapp these days, I use a local proxy.This allows me to type a staging/production URL into Chrome, and get the frontend and the backend from either my local machine or staging/prod. I can mix and match any combination by checking/unchecking a box in Proxyman.This means there is no need to whitelist localhost for CORS, and other hoops. Another advantage is that you&#39;re experiencing the app with SSL, so you may notice bugs that you would miss if you&#39;re used to work with HTTP locally. I&#39;ve had these bugs which &#34;only happen on production&#34; in the past, and it&#39;s a nasty thing to deal with because it will be in a rush, since it happens as a surprise, and impacts users immediately. It can also bypass QA if the QA environment is also using workarounds and not a prod-like setup with SSL and the likes.I recommend giving it a try.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can tell you how to lose at CORS in Chrome. If your browser caches a response, and sometime later you mutate the request by adding the &#34;Origin&#34; header it (e.g, add attribute crossorigin=&#34;anonymous&#34; to a &lt;script&gt; tag), Chrome won&#39;t make a new request. What it will do is use the cached response, which is missing the ACAO response header, and thus the browser rejects a file from its own cache via draconian security policy.There are many ways to lose at CORS and this one is my story."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Bonus fact: I wanted the &#39;app&#39; (https://jakearchibald.com/2021/cors/playground/) to allow the HTTP method to be set to anything, which meant I needed a server that could accept anything.I usually use NodeJS, but it turns out the HTTP library they use turns the HTTP method into an enum, so only a subset is supported (https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/d798de1c653efa5ec0015d44...). This restriction only exists in their HTTP/1 library, their HTTP/2 library supports any method.Anyway, I couldn&#39;t use that, so I used Deno via Deno Deploy. Their HTTP library supports any method, and the APIs they use are very similar to web APIs, so it was really easy to get started. Here&#39;s the server code: https://github.com/jakearchibald/cors-playground/blob/main/i...."</p>
