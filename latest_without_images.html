								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Founder of Atom here. We&#39;re building the spiritual successor to Atom over at https://zed.dev.We learned a lot with Atom and had a great time, but it always fell short of our vision. With Zed we&#39;re going to get it right. Written in Rust, custom native UI framework, engineered to be collaborative. Just starting our private alpha this week, so the timing of this announcement feels quite fitting.Here&#39;s a talk I gave last month: https://youtu.be/wXT73bBr83s"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"“Sunsetting” an open source project seems… unfitting? Hand it off to the community, look for new maintainers, donate it to the Apache Retirement Home for Veteran Projects, sure.But saying that you’ve decided to “sunset” or “archive” it, telling users to plan for their migration, seems counter to the notion that open source software forms part of a commons - something that Github, of all companies, should understand."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;I agree that it is unacceptable to have eighth grade Algebra I classes and gifted education programs that disproportionately exclude Black and brown children. But if equity is the goal, we should be mandating that every eighth grader takes Algebra I—and then structure the entire pre-K to seventh grade student experience to ensure this is a legitimate possibility for every child. Since when does equity mean everyone gets nothing?I don&#39;t know whether Algebra I is above or below what eighth graders can be expected to do, but raising the difficulty of every class to what the most advanced student is capable of is not the answer either. Everybody knows someone else that is better at math than they are, and someone who is not as good. It is universal common knowledge that the ease with which one takes to math is different for different people. Why can&#39;t we just admit it and quit trying to make people who are unique the same?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The gifted program helped me immensely in highschool, although the hour or two I actually spent in the gifted classroom was mostly wasted playing board games.  However being in that program gave me the ability to switch classes/teachers whenever one wasn&#39;t working for me, usually because some teachers could maintain a civil classroom and other teachers let the students run wild and taught nothing.  Because I was in the gifted program, the school permitted me to switch out of those classrooms into classes taught by competent/caring teachers.This suggests to me that the advantage of the program could be conferred to students who score low on IQ tests but are nevertheless behaved in class.  A better gifted program would be one that differentiates on the basis of civility, not IQ.  Of course, deferring measurement of IQ to some licensed professionals is easier than objectively quantifying a student&#39;s civility, so I don&#39;t know how this would actually be implemented."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Gifted programs are extremely important and the width of American gifted programs is a virtue.  Canada has a much higher standard for gifted, and in Ontario we generally admit roughly the top 1% of students (many American programs cater to the top 10%).There a number of large benefits to gifted, not the least of which is it changes the character of a program/school.  If you are surrounded by bright students with nerdy academic interests it&#39;s suddenly acceptable to nerd out on things. This single fact may be more valuable to the development of the student than the entire program itself.  Outside of gifted, schools have substantial challenges with creating environments where academic excellence is encouraged and rewarded not only by the schools grading system but also by social behaviour of peers. While bullying has gone down, and acceptability of geeky interests have improved in the past 30 years there is still nothing close to a gifted program from encouraging and accepting academic excellence.As someone who just barely missed the gifted cutoff, my schooling was much too easy and I basically never had to study for tests or exams.  I ended up developing poor academic habits that ultimately hurt me when the difficulty got hard enough that intellectual horsepower needed to be combined with hard work. I think being challenged early and often would have changed this behaviour substantially.  Even creating an environment where I wanted to be around other students enough to participate in more extra-curriculars could have helped. I worry that we are going to create a lot of bright but unmotivated students by offering years of programs that are too easy for them. There are consequences far beyond just having these students occasionally act out out of boredom and I think it&#39;s a very bad idea to create an educational culture that suggests bright people should be lazy. This is ultimately what the removal of gifted programs do because classroom teachers generally aren&#39;t given adequate prep time or other resources to properly offer enrichment.  I&#39;ve even known some principals who encouraged their teachers to not offer enrichment as it created problems in later grades when other teachers didn&#39;t offer similar enrichment and parents expected it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s weird that you can bribe individual EJ&#39;s in Philadelphia like this. In Chicagoland, every polling place has a team of 4-5 judges, and they all have to sign off on the final election result, and all the procedural steps that arrive at that number; every individual vote is recorded in the pollbook. I don&#39;t even know how you&#39;d generate fake votes in the first place, even if you bought off all 4 EJs.You can&#39;t just make people up! Every vote is tied to a specific registration. We do same-day registration, but those votes are cast provisionally, with a paper log; there aren&#39;t many of them, and they can all be set aside and audited after-the-fact.You certainly can&#39;t just make up a final tally. The numbers from the individual voting machines and the paper ballots have to match up; we had to stay an extra 2 hours after the polls closed last time I did this (in 2020) because of an equipment screwup that kept us from doing the final certified count/reconciliation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They make it sound so simple:Bribe the Judge of Elections who oversees everything. Dilute the vote tallies by using the voting machines to increment the votes for specific candidates. Certify that the fake results are correct. Lie if anybody asks.This person did this with 2 separate judges. Why is it so easy?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Honestly I think domain names should be the least of your worries when building something. You can always add a &#34;get&#34; prefix or &#34;app&#34; suffix (or a bunch of other options). If you are sold on a company name then by all means, grab the domain but don&#39;t confuse &#34;buying a domain&#34; with &#34;making actual progress&#34;.When I was younger I used to snap up domain names for every little idea I had. I executed on less than 1% of those ideas and ended up letting the domain expire 1-2 years later when I could finally admit to myself I was never going to pursue it. Literally hundreds of dollars flushed down the toilet all to get a temporary rush.I know that I have issues with thinking &#34;spending money&#34; === &#34;making progress&#34; (be it on home improvement projects or web apps) and I know I&#39;m not alone. If all you need is a domain to launch your product then go ahead and start looking, otherwise it&#39;s just a dopamine distraction."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"But is it a good one? There are better methods for finding an actually good domain name, you just have to think outside the box and come up with new ideas constantly.For example these domains should be available wink wink:

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Programmatic land grabs like this is why people today must suffer from lack of remaining .com domain names.Nothing wrong with the writer of this post. I think this is a rational behavior that should be considered &#34;expected&#34;. Whoever designed domain name registration/ownership model is to blame for failing to create a system which can efficiently give right domain names to people who actually need them and can use them for good (aka actually hosting businesses or contents instead of scalping)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Honestly, at this point in the U.S. maybe we should all have a lawyer on retainer and their phone number memorized and take no such situations lightly.Also, start actually punishing such mistakes. Detective(s), judge, police, and American Airlines (everyone involved) should be severely punished for once. And for God&#39;s sake, stop assuming someone that hasn&#39;t gone through a trial is guilty -- what is this...And for God&#39;s sake -- I know some other sibling commenter posted it too, but honestly just in case anybody misses it: Don&#39;t talk to the police. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-7o9xYp7eE -- his situation could have been worse unfortunately."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow this is insane. I hope this blows up in a big way and everyone is aware of what happened here, and I hope Mr Lowe gets a big payday.&gt;&gt;&gt;&#34;After Lowe had been in jail for eight days, he was taken to a local judge. He still received no information about why he was there, he said. The judge told him his only options were to waive extradition — in which New Mexico would deliver him to Texas authorities — or wait for Texas authorities to pick him up. Lowe, unsure what the legal implications were of either option, waived extradition based on the court’s suggestion that he do so.&#34;This is such a perfect application of the term &#34;kafkaesque&#34;.Also, is it weird that he was brought before a judge without having any sort of legal representation first, and that the judge was able to give Mr Lowe advice as to what to do? Imagining myself in his shoes, I wouldn&#39;t say a single word to the judge or anyone really before I had spoken with a lawyer, I don&#39;t care how long that takes. One wrong word and it&#39;s not hard to imagine his 17 day ordeal turning into something longer and more nightmarish."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those wondering why he&#39;s not suing the government:Suing a government entity is a very long and costly affair, and is fraught with difficulties.Suing a company is MUCH easier by comparison. Unlike governments, companies tend to be very sensitive to bad press, and thus much more likely to yield to legal pressure.Therefore, your most promising tactic is to use the suit against the company to build a war chest and establish official records of fact that can then be drawn upon in the longer government campaign."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I know the potential audience is most likely a lot smaller than Blender but we&#39;re really struggling to grow the volunteer community around Open Brush (the open source fork of Google&#39;s Tilt Brush).I was expecting it to grow organically but it&#39;s actually gone quiet recently - despite continuingly healthly download and usage numbers.If anyone has any suggestions that don&#39;t involve me spending all my time on community building or PR then I&#39;d love to hear them.https://openbrush.app/https://github.com/icosa-gallery/open-brush/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It never ceases to amaze me how much improvements Blender is getting all the time. I&#39;ve never used it much, simply because I got burned in the past by the (legacy) esoteric UI, but it has increasingly become a joy to get started with and just noodle around with.There are other cool open source tools of course. Blender could&#39;ve easily remained another one of those hard to use niche applications, but they&#39;ve definitely managed to transcend that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Blender is amazing. The other day, I needed to create a video of a rotating image so I looked around for potential software to use. Very quick and dirty job.I didn&#39;t want to download anything large like Davinci Resolve. I saw OpenShot but was not sure it can do what I needed easily. It&#39;s not even lightweight.Then someone mentioned that Blender can do video editing. Can you believe that blender is only around 200mb? I downloaded it, followed a quick tutorial on YouTube to figure out keyframes and how to render. 10 minutes after and I&#39;m done.It&#39;s great to see even more features to the video sequencer in this update. Will probably use again for my next video editing needs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"iPadOS 16 and still no multiuser support :-( Why can’t we use one iPad inside a family, with each user having his/her own apps, settings, bookmarks and so on? (Ok I know, Apple needs to sell an iPad to each one of us :-) )"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Stage Manager follows the same pattern as the other features Apple took too long to realize were already figured out on the Mac: make it arbitrarily different to be able to call it new. Just like the “changing cursor” for trackpad support on the iPad. But hey, I&#39;ll take it I guess.Unfortunately, in previous cases, these &#34;justification&#34; tweaks have resulted in a strictly worse experience IMO. The transforming cursor on the iPad is distracting and it can be weird how it disappears over icons (resulting in me losing track of it sometimes). The iPad Keyboard is more awkward than a real keyboard, top-heavy, and sold separately of course. I wouldn’t be surprised if the same is true of Stage Manager, although at least it&#39;s on the Mac too so hopefully if it turns out to not be that great, it won&#39;t be excused as &#34;people not getting it&#34; like all the weirdo undiscoverable gestures on the iPad.The sad reality though is that it&#39;s taken 10 years for the iPad to finally mature into... an arbitrarily different take on OS X? Same chip as the Mac. Works with a keyboard and mouse. Better for drawing but worse for external monitor support. And now basically the same window management we&#39;ve always had with the Mac. I was always (and remain, theoretically) a big believer in the opportunity the iPad presented, and think it could have gotten to the same place sooner, but bolder, with the actual aim of replacing the Mac (the same way the iPhone replaced the iPod). Where it&#39;s at now kind of proves that&#39;s always been possible... it just chose to get here meekly instead, not stepping on any toes, always making sure there was an excuse to need to buy both devices.Universal Control to me is the epitome of that mentality: a supremely technically impressive, but ultimately completely over-engineered and absolutely ridiculous &#34;solution&#34; to a problem that wouldn&#39;t exist if the Mac simply had a touch screen. You wouldn&#39;t need WiFi and communication between two computers to move your mouse from screen A to screen B if the Mac just had a touch screen. The experience of having a touch Mac that you just... plugged into an external display would be strictly better than the weird world of Universal Control, where you drag an image from Adobe Photoshop for Mac over to Adobe Photoshop for iPad, or sometimes, you drag it from Adobe Photoshop for iPad running on the Mac using Catalyst to Adobe Photoshop for iPad running &#34;natively&#34; on the iPad.I think Apple truly squandered the opportunity in the last decade to get truly get ahead on &#34;big screen&#34; (aka, non-phone-based) computing. Instead, the field still remains wide open."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;     If a machine could accomplish the task just as well as a human, or the need for the task could be designed away, that task is toil. If human judgment is essential for the task, there’s a good chance it’s not toil.21It&#39;s fun the the engineering at Google is so great at recognizing things, while the product/&#34;human&#34; teams (like whoever came up with the account reviews and other parts) seems to suck so much.If YouTube applied the same view of what should/shouldn&#39;t be automated, they could solve the problem of peoples YouTube channels being locked in front of them, even if they don&#39;t break any ToS&#39;s."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You should probably not automate all toil. You should only automate toil when the toil cost/effect is more burdensome than the cost of automating it. All automation has a cost, and may or may not create value. Automation should have a positive and timely return on investment. If the ROI is 10 years down the road, you probably shouldn&#39;t automate it (yet). If there is a cheaper way to deal with the toil, explore that avenue first.Several times in my career I worked on projects to reduce toil. Sometimes the project would fail because the time it took to work on them went well past the cost saving estimation. Sometimes they would be completed, but the value created was far less than their cost. And sometimes automation wasn&#39;t even the solution, and we just needed to change our process or system, or do some other manual thing that reduced the toil cost. Sometimes we chose to automate toil because we were afraid to take on a larger project we knew would make the toil unnecessary, so we paid for the automation and then later for rebuilding everything. Or toil was used as an excuse to justify a project that didn&#39;t really have to do with toil.One of my biggest mistakes as an engineer was assumptions I made about my work that ended up creating more waste than value. Talk to an outsider about your plans and why you&#39;re doing it, take their advice seriously. And if your automation is optional, make sure you have buy-in before you start working on it; i&#39;ve sunk months on things that nobody ended up using.A great way to automate toil is incrementally. Typically you have a runbook with step-by-step instructions, and over time you automate one step, then another, etc. The investment is minimal and gradual, it can change over time, and you can target the costliest parts of the toil, optimizing value."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Most of my work for SRE was the opposite; I did things manually because the automated systems were guaranteed to mess up some fraction of things.  At some point my managers wanted me to automate a hardware management process- I checked and it would take 6 months to deploy the code to prod.  Instead, I identified all the broken machines and filed tickets manually- getting things fixed far more quickly without a high rate of false positives and churn (google&#39;s hardware repair system churns a lot).Many of the automated systems at Google were developed by geniuses.  Others, not so much, and it ended up making a lot of work for other people."</p>
