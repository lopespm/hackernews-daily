								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I guess this is the end of &#34;sending customer data to the us&#34;.
Quite impressive how fast the US-politics can burn billions in $, endanger the technological lead and build a massive opportunity for Europe!I, as a European could not be happier about this, from a economic standpoint.Hope you guys over there are not drifting to a surveillance dystopian."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"US folks who are interested in writing their Senators can find information at https://www.senate.gov/senators/senators-contact.htm?OrderBy...FWIW, I sent the email below (largely cribbed from the EFF).Dear :I am a constituent.  I urge you to oppose the EARN IT act, S.3538.  It does not strike a reasonable balance between fighting crimes and the rights of users to privacy and encryption.The bill empowers every state or territory to create sweeping new Internet regulations, by stripping away the legal protections for websites and apps in Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. The states will be allowed to pass whatever law they want to hold private companies liable, as long as they somehow relate their new rules to online child abuse.The bill’s sponsors have stated that EARN IT will pressure Internet companies to do widespread scanning of user messages and photos. This scanning is incompatible with strong encryption.  Consequently, the act allows states to pass laws that will punish companies when they deploy end-to-end encryption, or offer other encrypted services. This includes messaging services like WhatsApp, Signal, and iMessage, as well as web hosts like Amazon Web Services.The sponsors have falsely claimed that the act would protect children. But abusive images are already highly illegal under federal law. Any Internet platforms that knows about child sexual abuse material being distributed or received are required to take action on it, and can be severely prosecuted if they do not.EARN IT would lead to penalties for people and companies that use encryption.  The harm done by this will fall on vulnerable people. Once we allow encryption to be compromised in order to scan for one thing, authoritarian regimes will demand the same capabilities to track information shared by activists and journalists. Another example is that people subject to domestic abuse, including children, won’t have secure channels of communication to report and reach out for trusted help.Once again, I urge you to oppose the EARN IT act.Thank you,"</p>

I can tell from the writeup what Blumenthal thinks of it, but not any other committee participants.I really wish politicians would embrace a &#34;we will make policies for things we can understand&#34; motto."</p>

I play professionally.  For money. On stage.If you play for your entire life, you can get really good at a ton of things.I played pedal steel at a rehearsal for my country band tonight.  I played piano at a rehearsal for my hot club jazz band on Monday.  I played upright bass at a rehearsal for a string band last night.Sunday I recorded a new track with my girlfriend, ambient techno (novation circuit, moog, girlfriend&#39;s esoteric warblings).Monday I finished an EDM track.I have a bunch of aspirational goals.  I&#39;d like to DJ at my local ecstatic dance.  I&#39;d like to front a Louis Prima style jazz band.I&#39;ve been playing trumpet and trombone every day for the last 2 months.I don&#39;t care if I have any professional success.  But hard to say all that is a hobby.  Maybe I&#39;ll eventually be able to retire and just work as a musician, teaching and doing my little gigs and producing the records I engineer for other folks and running sound for the little parties we play out in the desert in Utah.Don&#39;t care.

This has involved tiring meetings with city officials convincing them to give us access to the data and writing scraping bots where they weren&#39;t convinced, so I&#39;ve sunk countless hours into the project.I currently know of only 3 people using it, but I&#39;m one of them and I believe this is something that should exist, so I don&#39;t care that I&#39;ll likely never evem break even on it. I&#39;ve started a nonprofit to fund the project, but it&#39;s been mostly my own money so far. Working on it has been really fun and I learned a ton about how stuff gets done in the intersection of public and private sector - both positive and negative.// For anyone in Slovenia interested in using it, there&#39;s an email in my profile.

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-021-00819-6The big question is how quickly and completely can that layer restore itself? If damage accumulates over time and people are catching new variants every 3-4 months it is only a matter of time before mortality from cardiovascular issues in COVID negative formerly infected people goes much higher and much younger. We need studies on the cardiovascular recovery pace after COVID damage in different age groups, and after repeat COVID diagnosis from different variants."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Many of the &#34;Covid-19 increases risk of XYZ&#34; popular media articles lack baseline comparisons to other virus infections. (Disclaimer: Yes, we know Covid-19 isn&#39;t the flu, and it&#39;s more deadly.) My point is: how much does heart-disease risk increase post-Covid compared to say post-Influenza? Is it comparable or is the risk magnitudes larger than with other virus infections? This is an important benchmark, I understand scientific journals don&#39;t cater to laypeople but popular media does.From CDC website: &#34;Studies have shown that flu illness is associated with an increase in heart attacks and stroke. A 2018 study found that the risk of having a heart attack was 6 times higher within a week of a confirmed flu infection.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In my mind, state is the real enemy impacting: comprehension, 
brittleness towards making changes, and the surface area exposed to potential bugs. OOP as frequently implemented, while claiming to encapsulate state, ends up creating so much more.In accordance with this view, I think project architecture should be approached with an emphasis around how much state is necessary for it to run. This is why simulations like say someone making a game or simcity with like relatively independent entities that map to something in real life use OOP. If you&#39;re writing a service doing requests, you want as minimal state as possible. Singletons are state. Initialized/non-static objects are state. The smaller amount you have the easier it is to reason about the system.As I write this however, I worry a little that my view is overly simplistic, or maybe applicable only to domains that I have worked in. If anyone wouldn&#39;t mind poking holes in this argument or offering examples I would appreciate it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have not read the article but I&#39;ve seen other blog posts on the subject.
The issue with &#34;OOP is bad&#34; is that OOP means different things to different people.Abstract Data Types are sort of a subset of OOP and are massively useful, I certainly don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea to expose the internal implementation of a data structure most of the time. Any sort of plugin system works in an OO matter. It is a useful tool, no question.Even things like Actors like in Erlang (which are much closer to the Alan Kay style OO) are massively useful in a distributed setting where state is naturally distributed.Where you get into trouble is when you go the whole &#34;lets model a taxonomy of the world&#34; style with inheritance hierarchies or go ham on design patterns, layers upon layers of abstraction and other nonsense like that.The saddest thing about the &#34;object–relational impedance mismatch&#34; is that the focus went totally to the wrong side. The relational model is a much nicer way to model relations than a graph of objects (that&#39;s the whole point after all). SQL sucks but that&#39;s a separate issue, Entity Component Systems are a form of relational modeling for example and work really well, or even better Datalog."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My issue with OOP is: Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software.I don&#39;t take issue with the authors, with their insights, or anything related to the content of the book. It&#39;s that the book exists at all: it&#39;s a book filled with solutions to imaginary problems.When using a procedural language the first thing you do is start implementing a solution. When using OOP, you first have to solve the imaginary problems created by OOP, only then can you start down the path of typing out a solution.It&#39;s significantly more difficult to refactor OOP (even with great tools) than it is procedural.If you could spend 20% less brain power, possibly 40% fewer keystrokes to describe the exact same solution, why wouldn&#39;t you?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m literally playing Factorio right now, with my kid. Got into it over Christmas based on HN talking about it all the time. Good game to multi because I don&#39;t have to pay attention all the time.It really reminds me of software in many ways. You fiddle with tiny little things like balancing a belt, and then move on to building belt balancers. You then move up the abstractions to where you&#39;re not really placing inserters all the time. Maybe you make some blueprints and you&#39;re placing a whole set of nuke power plants in one go, or looking at trains.The kid loves it, but you can (luckily) tell the difference between what he makes and what I make. That engineer keep-stuff-organized thing takes a bit of time to hone, but he&#39;s getting there. He also understands how to find root causes now, based on looking at where there&#39;s a blockage in production and tracking back along the chain.One thing that&#39;s interesting is that the game is a bit, you know, dark. I mean we&#39;ve built hell and the kid doesn&#39;t mind. Literally paved paradise with concrete. The air is black with robots, 100k of them at the moment. There&#39;s furnaces all over the place. We got rid of the steam power generation but there are huge areas of nukes all over. The natives are getting atomic bombs thrown at them constantly, it takes a while to even get to the nearest spawner. Or water that isn&#39;t green.And yet he doesn&#39;t ask about how we destroyed all the cliffs and filled in the lakes, and chopped the trees.&#34;How should we make it bigger, dad?&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My problem with games like Factorio (and more recently Oxygen no Included), is that after I get addicted and get up past 100 hours of gameplay I start to question what the hell I&#39;m doing with my life. Up until that point it&#39;s great fun designing, building, and optimizing, but then a switch in my head flips. I start to become anxious about the fact that I was excited about getting better at skills in a virtual world. Usually around this time I start watching videos of more advanced builds, and then become increasingly depressed about the idea of sinking 1000+ hours into a game, when I could just be building something in the real world, or out riding my bike. This is usually the time I put the game down and never play it again.I think the problem for me is that these games give me the illusion of learning, building, and accomplishing things, which my little engineer brain loves. But once I come out of the haze of addiction, I realize it&#39;s nothing more than an illusion, and I just stomach going on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have over 5000 hours in Factorio. I am part of a group where several of us are over 5000 hours. Some of us have Autism. Some of us have ADHD. Some of us have both. The majority of us are in the tech industry.The companies we work at have been made to understand that the factory must grow."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What strikes me is not a bunch of people keeping their ego in check -- that helps because it ensures that all points will be heard, but it doesn&#39;t ensure coherent decision-making. What strikes me is that everybody was able to keep track of what were the major points and minor points, so they could talk through the whole range of possible objections and decide that they were all less valid or less important than the points in favor. This is how engineers talk, searching for flaws and weighing the ones they find.I think it&#39;s important for engineering decision-makers to be comfortable with this culture. It&#39;s disheartening when you have a great conversation like the one Feynman describes, the engineers are in agreement, and then the person in charge stands up and says, &#34;Look, if everybody hates this idea, we can&#39;t be lazy and go forward with it just because we don&#39;t have a better one,&#34; or, &#34;I guess we can&#39;t make a decision on this, because there&#39;s too much negativity and people are just going to nit-pick every idea to death!&#34; No, no, talking through every possible objection to an idea is how you can tell that people are starting to zero in on it as the most likely best solution. The closer an idea gets to acceptance, the more thoroughly you vet it. The more it becomes clear that an idea is the best way forward, the more you start to prepare for dealing with the reality of it.This makes practical sense, but not political sense, so it seems weird and unnatural to a lot of outside observers, who expect respect to be communicated by agreement, and emerging consensus around an idea to be expressed by a shared avoidance of mentioning the downsides."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In my experience (and coming just out of a meeting alike) these types of respectful and forward-moving meetings are typically in a case where each attendant has roughly the same level expertise in a given domain and knows the basics of scientific principles. Hence, everybody in the meeting brings in his or her unique view of the topic at hand and knows intrinsically when it makes sense to contribute something to the discussion. Usually things get out of hands, if somebody is talking just for the noise or, and this is worse, a clearly bad idea wins the discussion because politics or the messenger has shouted the loudest."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have been in such environments and I while I hadn&#39;t considered that the reason they worked so well was that they were great people: they were, in fact, great people.An interesting thing happens when there&#39;s a high level of respect.People stop being so anxious about not &#34;winning&#34;, or &#34;being heard&#34;, people just remove themselves from their ideas and feel comfortable and confident.I left that company because the company around that team was a bit shit, but I wish I could foster an environment of high trust and mutual respect like that again."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My 2 cents: The author presumably goes to Princeton - the ivy league is in general a tough place to &#34;start learning&#34; things, especially STEM. Few of the staff would teach you the basics of anything, mostly because you are attending a research college, where teaching is the professors&#39; side gig.I went to an ivy league school, and a large portion of the people in the CS program did competitive programming/knew number theory and discrete math from high school etc. All the problems we got as homework were really intense - I&#39;d consistently do more than 60-70 hours of studying outside of classes to keep up. Mind you, for me CS was/is like crack - I feel like I&#39;d have put in even more time if I didn&#39;t need to sleep or want to hang out with my friends.There are some intro classes, of course, but the quality of those varies a lot.Edit: I don&#39;t mean to discourage people with this post. I was actually one of the few people who didn&#39;t have much of a CS/quanty background in my CS classes. My advisor told me to have a backup major in case I fail the tougher required classes, but I made it through."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wonder if some universities should pay more attention to the impact of discouragement on some students.I remember attempting a grad class called &#34;Hard problems in combinatorial optimization&#34;. I was struggling so I asked the professor for advice on getting my footing in the class.His answer was that I may just not have the &#34;mathematical maturity&#34; for the material. I was so discouraged that I dropped out of the program.What I didn&#39;t realize at the time was the particular meaning of that term. His advice was well intended and accurate.But what I heard was that I was hopeless in this topic area because I wasn&#39;t smart enough.So much pain could have been avoided if we just extended the conversation by a few minutes, or he invited me for a discussion over coffee."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s the class description for MAT 202, &#34;Linear Algebra with Applications&#34;  at Princeton.[1] Here&#39;s a problem set with answers.[2]It&#39;s painful to read. Problem 2: &#34;Find the matrix A describing the following linear transformation from R2 to R&#39;2 : First rotate clockwise by π/6, then scale by a factor of 2, then reflect about the x2 axis.&#34; Anyone who programs video games recognizes that as a stack of transformations. You set up the matrix for the rotate, the scale, and the reflection (which is a scale of -1 on one axis). You multiply the matrices to get the result. This is a pain to do with pencil and paper. GPUs have hardware for it.Books on graphics programming cover this problem. But they usually do it much better, with graphical examples.
The presentation here is done very abstractly, without any motivation.
Most of linear algebra has graphical representations. It takes a useful and relatively easy area of math and makes it harder.This is apparently on purpose.  The class description says:The calculations are relatively simple once you understand what you need to compute, but it can take time to master the abstract concepts well enough to understand what that might be. The challenge in 201 (a calculus class) is usually how to finish a problem as the technical complications mount, whereas in 202 the challenge is often in seeing how to start the problem.Right. In calculus, problems usually involve trying to integrate something, where you get stuck and need to transform the problem in some non-obvious way to make forward progress. It&#39;s puzzle-solving. In linear algebra, the actual operations are mostly matrix adds and multiplies. It&#39;s setting up the problem that&#39;s hard.It&#39;s annoying to see this for a useful area of applied math. If you&#39;re headed for abstract algebra, where intuition breaks down, this approach might be useful. But if you want to use ordinary linear systems to get work done, which is common in engineering, it&#39;s not.[1] https://www.math.princeton.edu/undergraduate/placement/MAT20...[2] https://www.math.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/2018-04/M..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Android users are still vulnerable, and these announcements do nothing to reduce that. All a stalker needs to do, is remove the speaker. To detect a rogue AirTag, an Android owner needs to:1) know AirTags exist (many obviously don&#39;t)2) go out of their way to install Apple&#39;s Android AirTag scanner app (only 100k-500k worldwide have done so according to Google Play stats)3) manually open the scanner app and scan, since it doesn&#39;t scan passively in the background; and even then, it won&#39;t help you find the speaker-less AirTag, since it doesn&#39;t tell you proximity &amp; direction.I continue to think Apple should have never released AirTags to the public, and should discontinue it. It&#39;s a very limited income stream, with limited use cases, and significantly increases the average person&#39;s risk of stalking.Practically all positive social media coverage of AirTags involves someone tracking a stolen stolen items (car, bike). Those use cases are dead, since thieves with iPhones will get alerts, and most thieves with Android will know to scan for AirTags. And since most lost items turn into stolen items after a few hours, that removes most use cases involving losing objects in public.That leaves &#34;finding your keys within your home&#34; as the only truly &#34;officially supported&#34; use case. Is that worth all the problems, and brand damage?People will argue that stalkers could always buy trackers, but Apple increased their availability, ease-of-acquisition and ease-of-use by orders of magnitude. AirTags are cheaper than competing GPS trackers, most of which require subscriptions.I remember seeing a chills-down-your-spine Apple Watch Series 7 TV ad, that featured beautiful remote nature landscapes, with the audio of 911 calls made from people&#39;s Apple Watches whose lives were saved by their Watch. Probably one of Apple&#39;s best and most impactful ad in the past decade. Compare that to AirTag&#39;s impact on Apple&#39;s brand. Why did Apple even bother?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a great response - very happy to hear Apple&#39;s involvement with various groups to make things better.Some noteworthy bits:&gt; we innovated with the first-ever proactive system to alert you of unwanted trackingIf that&#39;s true, then Apple just raised the privacy bar and now Tile and other small players need to up their game to stay relevant.There is also lesson to learn here: whoever makes a tech/product popular is the one who gets the heat for all its shortcomings/problems. It doesn&#39;t matter how many existing small players were doing a horrible job for years.&gt; As an iPhone user moves, Precision Finding fuses input from the camera, ARKit, accelerometer, and gyroscope to guide them to the AirTagThis is something that&#39;s not appreciated. The UWB chip on the Airtag can only help iPhone know how far away it is from the tag. It&#39;s 3D modelling of the world through camera vision that helps triangulate and guide the user via live on-screen direction.Next time you think why we need tech X, just remember that you can&#39;t foresee what it&#39;ll enable in the future - (and before you comment &#34;all AR stuff to find my keys faster?&#34;, re-read the previous sentence again)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like the functionality of the AirTags so I don&#39;t want them nerfed, but I can think of no way to fix their fundamental problem of being such easy to use stalking devices.Chefs knives are great for cooking and are inexpensive and easy to purchase; they can be very dangerous weapons in the wrong hands so we make it against the law to use them in that manner. Maybe that&#39;s the best we can do with AirTags."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If Apple considers level 1 and 5 to both be associates and doesn’t share more than that that’s… fine?WaPo says this can be a 6 figure difference in compensation but frankly why should a future employer get to know how much I make? Maybe I’m a level 3 but deserved to be a level 4. Maybe I’m a level 5 but actually a level 2 that’s just really good at office politics.If I want my employer to know what number Apple assigned me, I’ll tell them.EDIT: Telling companies a Level 5 engineer was an associate if associate isn&#39;t a superset of Level 5&#39;s is shady, and I can&#39;t defend Apple on that point. From what I read of the article that wasn&#39;t clear to me. They do say the title is generally linked to more junior roles but that&#39;s relative and you can still be old, experienced and well-paid but if you&#39;re not a manager I might consider that an associate."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Something that&#39;s not mentioned here is this refusal to even confirm what you worked on also affects people&#39;s immigration status.To approve I-140, USCIS requires a signed letter from employers confirming your title, experience and skill sets.Most companies really don&#39;t like to give these details out for some reason, and it&#39;s always a struggle, especially outside tech. People manage by contacting their managers to past coworkers to attest this.This is intended as a general observation and not about AAPL (I can&#39;t attest to what happens there).Naturally, you can see how this puts pressure on visa employees to leave on good terms and be compliant knowing you might not be able to extend your visa otherwise."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reminds me of the practice of Translations.com / Transperfect, one of the largest language services providers. Their HR policy is to not allow employees to name the company in any online space, social media or otherwise. So when you see staff on LinkedIn, for instance, their employer will invariable say &#34;Leading language service provider&#34; or similar. These seem to be completely unreasonable policies, to me, that in effect are demanding that basic facts are ownable by the company."</p>
