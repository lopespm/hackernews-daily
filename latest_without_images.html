								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think it&#39;s easy to forget we&#39;re not the same people we were 20-25 years ago. I see all sorts of lamentations about various things in the world changing and becoming less magical. But as far as I&#39;m aware, I could still go and argue about bands in chatrooms. I could talk to other writers and dream about my future best-selling novels. I could go read random opinions about any subject and get into an exhilarating flamewar about it.I don&#39;t want to do any of those things. I&#39;m in my 40s and I have 3 kids. The internet 15-year-old me experienced was magical because _I_ was a blank slate. Every new friendship was thrilling, every new skill opened up infinite horizons, every nook and cranny felt like somewhere I could belong. But life moves on. I&#39;m more than half-way through my career, perhaps not the one I was expecting. I didn&#39;t marry the girl I met on IRC. I don&#39;t have strong opinions about Radiohead anymore. I find people, however delightful and kooky they are, quite tiring having got to know 10,000 of them at this point.I know all this is true because my kids love the internet and find their place in it with all the joy I used to. And I&#39;m pretty sure older generations frowning upon it all is part of the rush anyway."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From my perspective, I was in SWE at Apple for over a decade, their documentation started going downhill as iOS development ramped up. By the time they got to the yearly release cycle for macOS and iOS documentation was an afterthought. Most was generated with doxygen from inline docstrings.The reason I think the quality and quantity dropped was the internal schedules barely (or don&#39;t) leave enough time for the engineering work so there&#39;s very little time available for high level documentation. Internally tons of &#34;documentation&#34; existed as Radar comments or exchanges on internal mailing lists. Maybe a group&#39;s wiki had some crystallized documentation or high level architectural descriptions but good luck accessing it from outside that org. My favorite was some discussion about overall design or architecture that got the &#34;let&#39;s take this offline&#34; where all the helpful details ended up shared in an in-person meeting.The internal secrecy and rapid development pace made it really difficult to get good overviews of technologies internally. I really sympathize with outside developers trying to cobble together an understanding of something where the documentation sucks or is missing.The DocC tooling isn&#39;t going to be anymore effective than doxygen or other auto generated documentation without good architectural documentation. A function definition is nice but knowing you need to decombulate a frobnob before snizzlizing or that decombulation can only safely be done on the main thread is often more important. I can read a function signature but I can&#39;t necessarily know all the keys that go into some configuration NSDict passed into it.I hope the situation improves if the DocC tooling lowers the friction for writing documentation. It sucks having to mix a WWDC presentation, sample code, and iffy docs into a semblance of usable architectural documentation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Isn&#39;t the real time most software documentation started going down hill was as the internet became the primary way of distributing and updating software?When software distribution was tied to hardware mediums, it froze snapshots in time, and the documentation thereof could be snapshotted with it (to varying levels of success). Even needed to be.But once it all became primarily net based, it meant the software was always fluid, in motion. Imagine the tech writer approaching a developer now days:&#34;Explain how this works to me&#34;&#34;Ok, right now, it works like this, but we&#39;re working on a revised version for next year...&#34;&#34;Sigh. Ok, explain that to me too.&#34;&#34;You bet, but make sure and check back with me before you publish, because some things might change yet.&#34;It&#39;s an irony, that the original dream of &#34;the web&#34;, a distributed documentation system, is rendered ever instantly out dated in the realm of software because of the distribution models it eventually enabled. Unintended side effects I guess.As a side anecdote, consider man pages for venerable established Unix commands. Now consider the man pages for newer Unix utilities. IME, the newer features are often under documented and require going to code portals to get detailed/up to date answers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This speaks to me. I’m not deeply involved in the iOS development world but I do a lot of webview-adjacent stuff so I keep a close eye on the WKWebView documentation.It’s a mess. Case in point: introduced in the new beta: loadSimulatedRequest:https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkwebview/3...What does it do? Don’t know. I can make a few informed guesses from the name but I’m not sure if it’s maybe a performance measurement tool, or just a way of loading faked data. There is no documentation. To the best of my knowledge it isn’t covered in any talks either."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Rust has an interesting, and somewhat difficult, memory model.First, there&#39;s the single ownership tree. Single ownership is checked by the borrow checker. You can have only one mutable reference to a data object at a time, and that&#39;s also checked by the borrow checker. If you can stay within that model, if the program compiles, it will probably work at the data access level.But then there are all the escape hatches.There&#39;s &#34;Rc&#34;, which is reference counting for read-only use. This works fine for immutable objects, but not for mutable ones.There&#39;s &#34;Cell&#34; and &#34;RefCell&#34;. These allow multiple ownership, and only one mutable access at a time. Request mutable access via two routes and you get a panic, or an error if you use try_borrow();
The static analysis of the borrow checker is not able to figure out when you&#39;re headed for trouble via this route.There&#39;s &#34;Arc&#34; and &#34;Mutex&#34;, which allows access across thread boundaries. Request access via two routes in the same thread, and you deadlock.Designing the data structures for something tightly coupled with concurrency, like a window manager or a game, is difficult."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, I&#39;m surprised I never ran across this excellent essay before.I also liked the use of the term &#34;memory model&#34; in this case to mean conceptual model, because the metaphors and affordances of a language are what give (or restrict) its expressive power and the level of abstraction you can bring to bear.  A mixed blessing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Memory model&#34; has yet a third meaning, referring to interference between operations in multiple CPU cores, and mediated by variously-shared parts of cache systems of varying complexity.Here, complexity of the memory model is traded off against complexity of the primitives to manage the interference, (compare-and-set, load-locked/store conditional, etc.) and with the complexity of the cache system.Java&#39;s original memory model, perhaps the first formally specified, turned out to be unimplementable on common actual machines. The next language to get a formal memory model was C++, followed shortly by C and then others.Real multicore machines have sorted themselves out into two models of cache coherency; one more forgiving represented by mainstream x86 and now Apple M1, relying on deeply complex cache designs, and the other by the remaining lottery survivors, non-Apple ARM, and Power. The various RISC-V implementations will probably straddle the divide, like ARM/ARM-M1.Java, C++, and C can with some discipine be coded to work transparently on either, but very often programs accidentally depend on the x86/Apple model, never having been tested beyond it. Rust, absent &#34;unsafe&#34;, is happy on either. The Linux kernel works on either, and once supported other more exotic variations."</p>

[2], so it&#39;s a bit surprising that it is presented in this BBC article as something &#34;miraculous&#34; and new.What&#39;s curious to me is that the information presented in the BBC articles is slightly different from what has been reported here in Singapore. The BBC articles say that the wolbachia infection is passed on. Our reporting has been that male mosquitos infected with wolbachia that mate with females will not produce viable eggs, but otherwise, infected females will pass the wolbachia infection on. I wonder what the details are.[0] https://www.nea.gov.sg/corporate-functions/resources/researc...[1] https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/wolbachia-mos...[2] https://www.bbc.com/news/health-50487724"</p>

Bravo to https://www.clym.io/Nice article, covers the basics well. Credential files seem like simplest way to go and are secure enough for most local uses.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"In the programming language I’m working on, MethodScript, I’ve created a subclass of string, secure_string. The normal print value is “secure string”. Unlike somewhat equivalent classes in other languages, this is a subclass of string, which means it can be passed around opaquely to things that only accept strings, but then the functions that actually need to be aware of secrets can check for the subclass and call the special decryption method. The string is encrypted in memory, but this is really just obscurity, because the decryption key is there too. But it does prevent most logging from ever leaking the secret, including things like memory dumps. I wish mainstream languages had a feature like this, since MethodScript is still fairly far in the “toy” category for now."</p>

One of the things they talked was the recommendations of WHO and other organisations to focus on supportive care only (supporting the patient while their organism fights the disease by itself). They insist on not using other treatments outside clinical trials. The argument that running experiments would cost lives doesn&#39;t seem coherent.

And if creators want to migrate off Youtube, how are they supposed to do that when they&#39;ll get less than 10% of the audience on the other sites? Youtube&#39;s moat way is too deep to be threatened by any competition no matter how technically advanced the competition is.Youtube is a monopoly and needs to be regulated as such. The electric company can&#39;t cut off my power because I was using their electricity to discuss experimental medications, so why should Youtube be allowed to deny me access to the online public square for the same reason? If Youtube wants to be the thought police of their users, they need to first allow an alternative to survive."</p>
