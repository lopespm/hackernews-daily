								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am a professional traffic engineer and I build micro-simulation models for most of the projects I am involved with. I can say that compared to software that is used in industry (PTV Vissim, PTV Vistro, and Trafficware Synchro) it looks like A/B is a reasonable toy model that can get pretty close to the real thing. I think it is great that software exists at a level for individuals without huge budgets to be able to build and play around with traffic networks. Automating the intersection setup goes a long way toward this type of tool being accessible to the lay person. All that being said, I think the limitations of any model are important to understand when interpreting the outputs. I can take any model and make traffic flow or decrease the delay per vehicle, that doesn&#39;t mean my results are realistic.Keep up the work, this is an awesome tool and I hope it can get to the point where it can easily help inform people about traffic design and simulation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A/B Street is an open-source traffic simulator that lets you edit roads and intersections, based on OpenStreetMap data. But to even do that, first we have to geometrically represent the transportation network in great detail. This is a second deep-dive into how things work."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I got hit with a ~40Gbps DDoS last week. These attacks are on the rise. Some responses to folks above: Success working with upstreams is quite varied.  Some care, some don&#39;t, and it can be difficult to get to folks that can help- even if their networks are impacted as well.  Some carriers immediately turn this into a sales opp. - buy more bandwidth, buy more services.In our case it was based on DNS reflection from a large number of hosts.  I&#39;ve contacted the top sources (ISPs hosting the largest number of attackers) and provided IPs and timestamps. I&#39;ve received zero responses.Geo-based approaches yielded no helpful reduction in source traffic.Also, during this event we discovered an upstream of ours had misconfigured our realtime blackhole capability.  As a result, I&#39;m going to add recurring testing for this capability and burn a couple IPs to make sure upstreams are listening to our rtbh announcements.Very concerned about the recent microtik CVE, as that is going to make for some very large botnets.Personally this all is very disappointing because it creates an incentive to centralize / de-distribute applications to a few extremely large infrastructure providers who can survive an attack of these magnitudes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Since this is HN, it’s 2021 and DDoS’es are still a thing:  why are they still a thing? Is there some fundamental “anonymity” to the Internet that makes it impossible to structurally prevent DDoS attacks? Apart from CloudFlare-like approaches, are there any R&amp;D in the pipeline that may kill this type of attack once and for all?To me it’s incredibly infuriating to see the damage that still happens with these extremely simple techniques. Will it ever end?Edit: to elaborate, I know that there are tons of insecure Internet devices and whatnot. I’m more interested in standards, and core protocol improvements that can fundamentally rid the world of these types of attacks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m very much not a network engineer, but I&#39;d like to understand the magnitude of this issue because my intuition is wrong:250 Gbps seems like it would definitely be a lot for a server or website but it also seem like a drop in the bucket for an ISP providing broadband for many customers.Clearly I&#39;m wrong because it is an issue here. I&#39;d like to understand why I&#39;m wrong, and I hope that here, on HN, that&#39;s taken in the spirit of curiosity intended and not negativism.So, what am I missing? Maybe Belgian broadband is lower capacity than what I&#39;m used to in a US metropolitan area? Maybe this particular ISP served a population too small to have a... um... &#34;fat pipe&#34;? I&#39;d like to understand."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This seems great for language/library knowledge. As an experienced polyglot, the languages are not where I&#39;m hitting the wall these days though. It&#39;s the tooling. I can learn new language basics faster than I can figure out the ecosystem/tooling.For example, my current conundrum is how to deploy an Elixir Phoenix/MQTT app. Writing the app was a fun curve to climb. And I could use techniques like described here to learn from others in the actual programming. But how to build an executable I can wrap in a systemd process running on a different machine? Those are actions people do, not expressed so much in code I can look at. The few blogs I can find on the subject are mired in deep CI toolchains.I want the blog that discusses the secret sauce to learn to acquire the knowledge to work the raft of ever evolving tools we have to work with now days. The &#34;materials&#34; (the languages) are the easy part now days. It&#39;s the massively automated complicated machinery we&#39;ve built around the language of ideas that are my personal pain point of entry."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Contributing to open source is, to me, very similar to learning a language at work. The difference is that you seldom have the chance to learn a new language at work because you generally have to first be experienced with it.To me, I always learn the best when there&#39;s a necessity to ship my code. Side projects won&#39;t do, and I always revert to using my skills developed at work. Therefore, this sounds like a very good piece of advice to start with."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hey, author here. Surprised to see this on the front page of HN since I wrote it 5 years ago.I&#39;ve always been fascinated with talent acquisition and skill development and would probably different recommendations today after having more experience and reading Ultralearning by Scott Young."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Here in Mexico we have an opposite view of this: The majority of developers have spent their professional life doing &#34;consulting&#34; jobs in outsourcing firms. Few devs have experience developing a product and taking care of it 2 or 3 years later.The difference shows in the type of code they do, the &#34;ownership&#34; and engagement they have: Those with a consulting mind will do something and then have the notion that once its &#34;done&#34; they don&#39;t have to care about it. Those that have been  bitten by their own code from the past have a better notion on how to write maintainable code."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I completely disagree.Consulting is not for everyone and like everything you get out what you put in.Why I went into consulting
- I was working hard as ever, it’s my nature and I love what I do.
- My pay was average
- My projects looked amazing but in reality sucked and were driven by people in ivory towersMy concerns with consulting
- we had a newborn and worried about health insurance. In the US this is highly coupled with your jobThe outcome
- I am still busy as ever and love it.
- I am a seasoned 14 year dev with a lot to offer.
- health insurance because of Obama care is amazing. We pay about $150 more per month but it’s actually better health insurance.
- here is the kicker, last month I made 50k profit. Consulting is extremely lucrative and makes me feel like I was wasting my time as an employee before.Will I go back to working for someone? Oh yeah in a heartbeat. But I must be valued according and can enrich the company as I do now with consulting for my clients.What’s sucks about consulting
- billing / payroll for other devs that help me as 1099 when needed.Take away - consult for the right reasons. You will learn a lot but you can learn a lot as an employee as well. Let it happen naturally. Don’t force yourself to consult. You may be a completely happy employee and don’t let anyone tell you different and anyone worth being a human won’t discriminate against you for it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I spent more than half my career in digital consulting for mid-size (500-5000 people) that did full service product development (strategy, design, tech, marketing). Eventually working my way up to director level that meant doing sales and writing contracts.We did some crazy stuff. Delivered some gigantic ambitious projects with pure chutzpah. Dove into tech we didn&#39;t know anything about. Go sell a project to an airline, read everything about the airline business, then walk in like experts. It felt like fraud at times but we pulled it off so well you just start to feel invincible. It was a meat grinder but also thrilling. The kind of stuff I feel privileged to have been part of but never want to do again."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Seed creator here. For some context, I now code all my websites in HTML, CSS, and targeted JS (ie no frameworks or dependencies). Writing this was a great way to learn the ins and outs of DOM manipulation!Overall, I&#39;m happy with the way the Seed API turned out, but could never get the performance or package size to a good place.That said, I love coding in Rust, and use it all the time for embedded!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Kudos to the author for making this framework.I am using this for my personal project: https://www.biblemaze.com which is a Bible trivia game.Here are some things I like about Seed:1. The Elm architecture seems to flow nicely in Rust.2. The way of defining the elements on the page is more Rust like rather than html like. I initially tried Yew which is another similar framework, but since I am a more backend developer, I found writing in a more Rust style more comfortable than writing in a more html-like dsl. Other with different experiences may be more comfortable with more html-like syntax.3. Very easy to perform REST API calls. I am using Actix for the backend, and I have a shared library that declares the types which both the backend and frontend use. This is one big advantage for using Rust for both backend and frontend, in that you never have to worry about your types getting out of sync.4. In general as to why Rust for the front end, apart for being able to share types, for more complex algorithms, for me, having a compiled language with an emphasis on safety and that tries to ensure correctness as much as compile time (and especially pattern matching) makes writing complex code more enjoyable for me.5. Excellent documentation on the Seed website. There are lots of examples and walkthroughs of basics as well as examples of how to do stuff like integrate with Javascript libraries.Anyway, thanks again to the authors for making and supporting such an awesome library."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My most sincere thanks to the author(s) for “Why Not” section.   This level of self awareness and transparency makes me so happy; it takes so much guess work and unnecessary back and forth out of the discourse.  Again - kudos!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Disclaimer: I&#39;m a founder of Authzed (YC W21), a productized form of ZanzibarI&#39;d like to reiterate that Policy Engines and Zanzibar-like systems are orthogonal and can be used together very successfully. However, the article claims that ABAC cannot be done with ReBAC systems which is false[0] and it claims that Zanzibar systems do not support the concept of &#34;public&#34;, when the system at Google does[1]. The availability of Zanzibar-like systems outside of Google is still relatively new, so the user experience can be greatly improved. For example, the Authzed Schema Language[2] is a vast improvement over Zanzibar&#39;s raw userset rewrites.That being said, I think the Oso UX is quite nice in comparison to many products in the space, but architects should always spend the time to figure out what&#39;s best for their requirements. If you&#39;re just starting to explore AuthZ, this article is a pretty good primer for the problems in the space and why you&#39;re unlikely to design something great on the first go if you build it yourself. It&#39;s really hard to write about this subject in a digestible fashion, so props to the team!I especially liked the quote &#34;[...] authorization is a topic as cool as moving to Kubernetes!&#34;. Considering almost all of our team is ex-CoreOS and has deep ties to Kubernetes, we truly believe authorization is cool enough to stop working on Kubernetes ;)[0]: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-662-43936-4_...[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mstZT431AeQ[2]: https://play.authzed.com"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"We have been enjoying Casbin (ABAC):- technically: embedded in your DB, so not another infra problem  + can stay in-DB for hotpath queries (ex: view all). As db-native RLS etc keeps maturing, my bet is this is where a lot will end up anyways. This is orthogonal to their discussion of service vs monolith - it enables working at the data tier vs app tier.- governance: our app does not depend on an outside companyAt the same time, it was surprisingly slim pickings for such a core thing, so more diversity the better!Edit: For context, we have been thinking a lot about authorization recently and investing here, so a recent post on &#39;The Sharing Paradox&#39; on how we view it as an important way to grow successful team use, esp with modern features like friendly ABAC UIs: https://www.graphistry.com/blog/100x-sharing-paradox"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Maybe lithium-ion batteries in mass-market vehicles aren&#39;t such a good idea. We may need a battery technology that can survive poor maintenance less than perfect battery construction, and low-cost vehicle designs. Tesla had to put a titanium plate under their battery. That&#39;s not a mass-market solution.BYD is converting over to lithium iron phosphate, which is much better behaved when damaged. Toyota is working on solid state batteries, which hopefully don&#39;t catch fire.The NYFD reports over 55 electric bike and scooter fires so far this year.[1] Two deaths, 60 injuries, including 18 firefighters.  Fires destroying electric bike shops are a thing, with one fire expanding to all the batteries around. All we need now is for a cascade auto battery fire in a parking lot. Or, worst case, a garage under a building.Boosted skateboards used to use lithium iron phosphate, but were just too expensive.[1] https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/ny-e-bike-sco..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The automaker told Bolt owners to limit the charge to 90 percent, plug in more frequently and avoid depleting the battery to below about 70 miles of remaining range.Tesla&#39;s approach here would be to issue an OTA update that told your car to treat 90% as 100% and 25% as 0. I can&#39;t decide if I like that better or worse."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s insane. For (probably) a majority of owners it makes the car unusable if you adhere to that restriction.If I had one then I would have nowhere to park it. Certainly not at work. And at home with once car in the driveway and another in front of the house they couldn&#39;t be 50 feet apart. In tightly packed houses even one driveway to the next isn&#39;t 50 feet apart.If you went shopping and we&#39;re lucky enough to manage to find a space 50 feet away, there&#39;s no guarantee someone wouldn&#39;t park closer, though I can&#39;t even think of a place I go where finding such a spot in the first place is at all likely."</p>
