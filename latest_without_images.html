								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"With those comment counts, something dodgy is obviously happening.The interesting question here is whether Facebook is somehow accidentally amplifying it. Certainly it is not in Facebook&#39;s interest to allow this kind of data harvesting. If it hurts you to think that Facebook somehow isn&#39;t maximally evil, at least consider that this is data that could be only Facebook&#39;s. Allowing somebody else to harvest it is money straight out of Facebook&#39;s pocket.So, given FB should not be complicit, what mistake could they be making to allow the system to be haunted? The obvious guess is that they have a feedback loop in the ranking algorithm. It values comments very highly as a signal of good engagement, but they weren&#39;t prepared for &#34;content&#34; that is this good at eliciting low effort comments and have wide appeal demographically. As long as one of these reaches a critical mass, it&#39;ll be shown to tens or hundreds of millions of people just by any engagement feeding even more engagement.Is there anything less obvious?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This could be more benign than the article makes it out to be. Growing a content business in 2021 requires you to understand Facebook&#39;s algorithms and what will get your post amplified. Instagram famously only shows your posts to 10% of your followers by default [1]. The trigger points for your post to reach wider require certain engagement quotas, and if you&#39;re designing your post to get more comments then it&#39;ll hit them faster. Often accounts do these kinds of posts because their profile is about selling a single thing (like a book they wrote) or are dropshipping and focused on the marketing side. The real thing they want to get in front of users is the link in their bio.I think the real issue here is that it&#39;s impossible to tell the benign from the malignant. Is that cute mom blog going to start hawking ivermectin? What is my comment revealing about me that I don&#39;t authorize? There&#39;s no Better Business Bureau for Facebook pages. Maybe there should be.1. https://www.thelovelyescapist.com/2018-instagram-algorithm/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My FB feed is lousy with these sorts of things. My family &amp; friends seem to enjoy answering questions like &#34;What was the first concert you attended?&#34; I don&#39;t think it&#39;s for advertising purposes because I have not noticed any improvement in the accuracy of targeted ads. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s for political purposes because that is much easier to figure out without these oblique questions.One group who would benefit from detailed life style profiles are life insurance companies. More detail is better for setting accurate premiums while remaining competitive with other life insurance companies.Edit: I almost forgot to mention a really popular one I&#39;ve seen a lot of lately: &#34;Have you ever had a DUI ? I&#39;ll wait.&#34; It&#39;s unbelievable to me that people would answer this question, but it definitely something insurance companies would like to know because their records don&#39;t go that far back into the paper age. A lot of people answer something like &#34;No, but I should have.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The thing about Scrum is the observations and principles make sense, but then to sell it as a course they&#39;ve turned it into very specific prescriptions.I went on a scrum course and the takeaway was basically that feedback is a big deal, and you should try to get some repeatedly and quickly. It&#39;s also common sense that you should have tasks written down somewhere, and that some of them are more important than others.You certainly need to think about how long tasks will take, but there&#39;s no reason why you need to do planning poker, that just seems to be one among many ways to think about how long something might take. Tracking velocity is another one of these things that seems replaceable.If you have a team of people that more or less adheres to a few principles, there&#39;s no reason you can&#39;t get things done."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Engineers are encouraged to interact with the rest of the business and build relationships with non-engineers. In contrast, traditional companies often make it impossible for developers to interact with the rest of the business.In my experience “traditional companies” will often have a bunch of people in cushy “gatekeeping“ jobs whose main function is basically forwarding emails back and forth between devs and the business. If you try to get direct access to the business usually the business is quite happy but the gatekeepers get very upset."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really want to say this: SAFe is an awful process and a trend that will hopefully go the way of Unified Process/RUP. I won&#39;t go into it, but it&#39;s largely created and popularized by a vendor to sell their software. It is poison and exists to keep its practitioners employed. It attracts the highest-ego PMs like moths.I find it interesting that they author references Skype circa 2012. It sounds like classic &#34;uppercase A&#34; agile: they reframe success as shipping and hitting other invented agile milestones, while masking shipping lousy and incomplete product that is not succeeding in the market. That was right around the time Skype started being bad. It may succeed on some metrics because MSFT started bundling it, but anyone that actively used it at that time should know what I mean.The idea of an &#34;agile enterprise&#34; is intrinsically absurd. Teams are agile, not companies, and teams and products should be loosely coupled. That&#39;s why the big tech companies in this link have converged to similar answers to this problem (they are not &#34;agile enterprises&#34; but give teams some latitude to solve their own problems, and rather focus on results). Kanban is better in most ways for most teams.Also, Tuckman is a silly model that is only popular because it rhymes.PS: Strawberry-Jam-O-Meter and a Wrong-Order-O-Meter and their descriptions could hardly be more cringe inducing. Skype should be a part of the curriculum looking at less than ideal acquisitions and post-acquisition execution. https://www.wired.co.uk/article/skype-coronavirus-pandemic has is a reasonable overview if you&#39;re not familiar. They lost the consumer market and failed at enterprise (see Teams) and Teams in turn essentially failed in the general market- where most places that were free to do so went with Slack."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Google does this so they have click tracking data. But they don&#39;t need to mangle URLs in Chrome because it supports the `ping` attribute on &lt;a&gt; tags [0].The ping attribute basically adds click tracking as a native browser feature so you don&#39;t need to do URL redirects. It also makes these analytics much easier for the site and mysterious to the user. Looks like most vendors besides Firefox support it. (They were pretty opposed I recall)If you&#39;re a Chrome user, there&#39;s some extensions that disable ping requests/link auditing [1]. (EDIT: a commenter noted that uBlock Origin already blocks these! So I recommend that over this obscure extension)[0] https://caniuse.com/ping[1] https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ping-blocker/jkpoc..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find link mangling to be a great test for when a service becomes too powerful relative to its users, able to add friction to its product that serves no purpose for its users[1]. Google started doing this around 2004[2]. Facebook didn&#39;t do it until a few years ago. Slack and Discord don&#39;t do it. Yet.[1] Example: a search result that&#39;s a pdf. How do I share this link? If I click on it it downloads to my disk. If I rightclick on it I can copy a crappy URL.[2] http://akkartik.name/firefox.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It is really worth it to switch to DuckDuckGo. You can throw a g! at the end of your search if you don&#39;t like the results DDG gave and it will redirect you to Google. That was the feature that gave me the confidence to switch over, it&#39;s painless to get different results, even on a mobile keyboard."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Heya, author here. Fun to see this.I wrote the book after becoming hugely frustrated as an introverted technical founder trying to &#34;talk to customers&#34; but finding zero books about sales/interviews/etc that spoke to my context. That first company (yc s07) failed just as I started to figure it all out, but the casual approach proved useful (and comfortable) in my future businesses, so I wanted to document it for other folks like me.If it&#39;s helpful for anyone, I&#39;ve been answering reader questions with little youtube videos that touch on some of the common misunderstanding and sticking points.[1]Also, back when covid started, I also did a short series (5x 5min videos) about adapting the approach to remote interviews.[2][1] Q&amp;A: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvHabB7atz2uWPZN5m7z3...[2] Remote: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvHabB7atz2tOjQs1OMzj..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Best book on early stage startups period. And it&#39;s barely 100 pages long.My favorite quote from it:“Someone should definitely make an X!”“Have you looked for an X?”“No, why?”“There are like 10 different kinds of X.”“Well I didn&#39;t really need it anyway.”Long story short, that person is a complainer, not a customer. They’re stuck in the la-la-land of imagining they’re the sort of person who finds clever ways to solve the petty annoyances of their day."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Although not quite the same, this reminds me of a very simple trick many blind people are taught during training on how to navigate the city: Never ever ask &#34;Is this line 4&#34; if you want to know which tram just arrived. Ask &#34;which line is this?&#34;  Simply because the first version will make many people answer &#34;yeah yeah&#34; without even looking.  The second version forces them to actually answer your question with something other then yes/no."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Imgur, great service, lasted this long, amazing. But I always wondered how any of these random image hosts afforded bandwidth (reminds of the other various ones like TwitPic who was saved from being taken offline by Twitter). I mean, I have a gallery of images in there, privately stored, directly linked to here and there around the net, without paying for anything for years. I think at one point I can&#39;t even remember now I did pay them a small fee and then they removed that option to go it alone with ads and refused to &#39;take my money&#39;. Which seemed crazy and still does. Does the small imgur community (Which exists as a bizarre also-ran of Reddit) sustain them enough on ad views?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting company. It was created in 2018 [1], and the CEO is Michael Heyward, who was a co-founder of Whisper. Some interesting shuffling happened with Whisper [2] and it&#39;s now owned by MediaLab. Since then they have acquired a number of other properties, the general idea seems to buy declining brands for cheap and extract as much value as possible on mobile. [3] There is no public information on their funding.1. https://businesssearch.sos.ca.gov/CBS/SearchResults?SearchTy...2. https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-whisper...3. https://www.assemblyexchange.com/about-us - their job ads feature this ad network prominently."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hm. My bet would be that you can now count the number of years until imgur links go dead on one hand.This prompted me to check whether there were any backup efforts already, and how much data that would involve. Indeed, archiveteam has some good info: https://wiki.archiveteam.org/index.php/Imgur&gt; Imgur serves a massive amount of traffic. In 2012 alone, 42 petabytes of data were transferred. Fortunately, the amount of images uploaded is much less, albeit still a lot. In 2012, around 300,000,000 images were uploaded; assuming an average size of 120KB, that&#39;s 36TB in one year. As of 2014, there were 650 million images with 1.5 million being added each day according to one source. An analysis in 2015 based on extrapolation from a sample of random image IDs estimated about 2 billion images with a total raw full-resolution image size of 376 TiB.Also makes me think about whether/how much I currently link to imgur in various places on the internet, and whether there&#39;s anything that I should prepare to replace. Do people have suggestions how to best approach this?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some (most?) tools that output data in columns and fit each one to the largest value in that column need to scan the whole file as a first pass just to start displaying data.Not only is it the case with this tool, but from what I&#39;m reading in main.rs it looks like it&#39;s also loading the whole file in memory. I was going to say that scanning the file was a deal-breaker, but if true this is much more resource-intensive.This looks like a nice tool, but these design choices seem to limit its use to relatively small files. It could be updated to have a read-ahead buffer instead and adjust its output as new lines are discovered with values of different width, although doing this without a jarring resize could be challenging.Could someone with better knowledge of Rust than mine confirm this?I see the full dataset being loaded here[1] and the column widths being computed here.[2][1] https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/blob/main/src/main.rs#L183-...[2] https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/blob/main/src/main.rs#L218-..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is such a great post, and really covers the spiritual aspects of what it&#39;s like to work for prolonged periods in VR. Glad to see Immersed getting traction, and taking VR forward.  We all benefit from this.For Linux enthusiasts (possibly the OP as as well): SimulaVR (www.simulavr.com) is working on a portable Linux VR headset with office/programmer productivity as the #1 goal. It will offer the following advantages over the OP&#39;s Immersed setup:1. *More than double the text quality.* We are making a headset with more than double the PPD (pixels-per-degree) of the Oculus Quest 2.  This is extremely important for facilitating multi-hour VR sessions without eye fatigue.2. *Proper window management.* SimulaVR is a fully functional Linux window manager (built over Wayland/wlroots infrastructure).  Unlike Immersed, it isn&#39;t just emulating screens on another host OS.  This means you get an unlimited number of windows, popups can (when desired) behave as new windows, etc.  No hacks are required to get this sort of functionality.  It will also later on facilitate proper 3D/VR applications being able to share the same space with 2D applications.3. *Proper portability.* Our headset is going to be fully portable (with a detachable compute pack in the back), and won&#39;t require you to tether your headset to another computer over WiFi, or take along an additional laptop just to get your VR computer working somewhere else.4. *Proper hackability.*  Simula is built over FOSS, and is not tethered to the Facebook platform. If there&#39;s something you want to change or tweak, you&#39;re free to do so.One thing Immersed has though is immediate availability and scalability (there are an unlimited supply of Oculus Quests floating around :).  We&#39;re likely going to be constrained on the number of headsets we can produce, at least initially, and will have to queue first to the early users.We (and the industry at large) also have a lot of work ahead of us to improve upon a VR-centric UX (incorporating proper tiling management, and other things).  Very exciting."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The most critical thing in this piece:Get a better head-strap! He mentions it in passing in the article, but 90% of the strain from wearing the Quest 2 for extended periods of time can be traced to the garbage default head-strap. You want something that properly balances the headset. If you want, you can even get one that gives you a bit of extra charge, too. There are plenty of options.Something critical that doesn&#39;t seem to be mentioned:You can manually alter the resolution of Quest apps; if an app is looking blurry it&#39;s almost always because it&#39;s set to a lower resolution than native. This is a problem with a lot of &#34;productivity&#34; VR apps, and the main reason why I ended up working on my own for a few months.The standard 90hz is comfortable for me for prolonged periods of time, but if you feel nauseous, you can turn it up to 120hz, though some applications will require manual adjustment.The Quest 2 is really cheap and offers a lot of different ways to do work; you can pretty much throw it in a bag with a USB-C mouse and keyboard (and splitter, so you could technically also bring along a USB-A mouse and keyboard just fine if you bought a 2A-to-C splitter) or a bluetooth keyboard and mouse combo and you&#39;ve got a full computing environment anywhere, assuming you set it up beforehand. And if you bring around a laptop or other small form-factor PC while traveling, it works really well to augment those, too.Literal years ago Palmer Luckey talked about using a Go, a significantly less powerful headset, as a replacement for any monitor setups while traveling with his computer. We&#39;re finally at a point where you can do the same on any operating system, and it&#39;s honestly a really good experience."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a great breakdown of the early state of VR productivity. There are still a few key items that are barriers for me personally:1. Eye and face tracking. The author mentions lip syncing and hand tracking. That goes a long way, but it doesn&#39;t recreate the video experience to me. There are a few vtubers out there that are doing some seriously impressive tracking, but it requires tons of special equipment at the moment. Once this gets resolved in a consumer model, I think things will really shine for virtual presence.2. Lighter weight headsets. For longer sessions, a custom headstrap helps a ton, but even still lighter headsets will go a long ways to helping here.3. Better lenses and better displays. The lower res means you&#39;re really forced to work at huge virtual screen sizes, as the author mentions. While  this is the least needed item in this list for basic productivity, the screen door effect definitely creates a barrier some of the time.I highly anticipate that we&#39;ll see a sizable portion of the population change over to VR for productivity within ten years. It has huge potential, especially with the remote work environment many are in these days. I would love to be able to feel the presence of people around me again, while still not having a commute or the risks associated with being physically in the same room."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I work part-time for my university&#39;s help desk and I was both impressed and disappointed the first time I came across one of these--one the one hand, its highly customizable and supports SSH access. On the other hand, there is shockingly no way to get the MAC address without connecting via SSH, even though this is popular among academics who often need to get onto MAC filtered networks.In hindsight, we probably could have connected it to the guest network, gotten its IP and then had the networking group look up its MAC on their logs. What we wound up doing is telling the user to go home and check their own router for the MAC, which is obviously less than ideal service."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not trying to shill too hard, but it&#39;s rare I fall in love with a device the way I&#39;ve fallen in love with my Remarkable 2.I can&#39;t say it was 100% worth the price (half was paid as a gift), but everything about it is refreshingly elegant and simple.Great to know recovering from a brick is possible too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oh boy do I have opinions with this one. This seems like a lot of work to avoid using a perfectly good package manager on the device.They could have used rsync without installing rsync on the device. The target device doesn&#39;t need to have rsync for rsync to be used.They could have installed the package manager and left it. It doesn&#39;t run anything in the background on my device. It&#39;s easy enough to verify you don&#39;t have a systemd service or timer running it. (cron isn&#39;t installed, iirc)They could have compiled rsync with all of the libraries bundled with it. (Maybe this is beyond their expertise?)Their solution is using Docker to use the package manager and then overwriting system files on the device in the worse possible way, without understanding what they are doing. At that point, they verified in Docker. Should be safe to run it on the tablet then, yes?What attack vector are they worried about? :/ Toltec is actively worked on, odds are someone would notice someone else fucking with repository.The cherry on top was completely not understanding how the remarkable works. There are two partitions for a reason. The inactive one is used for software updates. When the reMarkable downloads an update, it downloads it to the inactive partition. When you &#34;install&#34; the update, it flips which of the two partitions is active. 
If the update fails to boot, it flips back to the known good state. All they had to do was switch the active partition, the next update would overwrite the broken partition. https://github.com/ddvk/remarkable2-recovery/issues/6This looks like a bad case of tunnel vision, combined with a lack of understanding. I&#39;m glad they managed to figure out how to fix it."</p>

This process has been TESTED but we aren&#39;t using it right now.Article claims:&gt; Known as the “Sabatier reaction” from the late French chemist Paul Sabatier, it’s a process the International Space Station uses to scrub the carbon dioxide from air the astronauts breathe and generate rocket fuel to keep the station in high orbit.Reality:We just shipped a new CO2 scrubber a few months agohttps://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/news/releases/2021/mar...For LONG space missions or colonieshttps://www.eni.com/en-IT/scientific-research/space-free-co2...The ISS is constantly falling back to earth.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The actual title is &#34;UC reactor makes Martian fuel&#34; and the subtitle is &#34;A gas station on Mars? Engineers envision the possibilities.&#34; But the submission title is &#34;UC reactor converts carbon dioxide to fuel to address climate change&#34;?While it does talk about applications with respect to carbon capture, if we consume the fuel byproduct, presumably we just end up with co2 in the atmosphere?&gt; “In the future we’ll develop other catalysts that can produce more products,” said Zhang, a doctoral student in chemical engineering.So I guess if we produce products which sequester carbon then maybe that would be useful, but this is purely speculative."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wish they addressed the fact that methane that they will be producing is said to be an even more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Are there any worries about the leakage for example?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve read the whole thread and am absolutely surprised. Why is nobody telling about plex&#39;s ditching of their plugin system?
Have invested a lot of time in developing plex&#39;s plugin for youtube, twitch, and my favorite streaming services, paid a lifetime fee to plex. And now the whole plugins system is disabled.That&#39;s the only reason why I&#39;ve switched to Jellyfin. It&#39;s not better than plex. It&#39;s definitely worse, but it&#39;s open, and that&#39;s how I am sure it will work forever."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For serving local music, the free and open source &#34;Logitech Media Server&#34;[0] is a great solution -- main weakness is the lack of a central organization promoting it. In addition to working smoothly with dedicated (&#34;squeeze&#34;) clients which can be Logitech-brand or DIY[1, 2], it has a massive plugin catalog that allows e.g.- airPlay integration: stream to your squeeze-clients via airPlay, stream to your airPlay clients from squeezebox.- chromeCast integration: stream to chromeCast devices from squeezeBox.- upNp integration: stream to upNp clients.The system was originally developed by &#34;SqueezeBox&#34; who also made (awesome) physical devices. SqueezeBox was acquired by Logitech many years ago. Logitech put out one or two devices before giving up, but they are actually playing really nice by continuing to support development on the server (see [0]).[0]: https://github.com/Logitech/slimserver

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been a Plex-to-Jellyfin convert for a long while now, and I&#39;ve nothing bad to say. I switched because Plex kept pushing their streaming services, and the fuzzy feeling I get from running FOSS.Jellyfin used to run on my desktop which has a beefy CPU/GPU, but runs fine on my puny Synology NAS."</p>
