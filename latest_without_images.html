								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"On a whim I changed the date to something else: 2008-08-08. One of the submissions on top was &#34;Ask PG: What are your thoughts on current YC News community?&#34;You&#39;d think the comments were made last year, not in 2008:&gt; I discovered HN in spring and Reddit to and I have found the quality of HN going down in the last month&gt; Personally I find nearly all the mass-media submissions to be a dilution, no matter how techie or startup they sound.Although I relate the most to the PG&#39;s comment:&gt; There are always a few highly ranked stories that make me think &#34;how could anyone vote that up?&#34; but on average they&#39;re pretty interesting. There&#39;s no other site I prefer.I&#39;m curious about this one too:&gt; If you must have a resume or portfolio, you should most definitely add your HN username and link to it.Did anyone do it?https://news.ycombinator.com/front?day=2008-08-08https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=270991"</p>

While the course of history flowed elsewhere for me, I have gratitude for the reminder in this moment. Thank you for sharing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I started reading HN around 2008 but created my account on October 22, 2009 when I made my first of two submissions to YC (didn&#39;t succeed in either). I just looked at my submission upvote history and its pretty much a history of my interests and time wasted in the past 12 years. Wow, time does fly!I&#39;ve upvoted 14,129 submissions, here&#39;s the first three:14129. Oct 22, 2009: The “Interview” with Y Combinator That’s Not,  https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=92372214128. Feb 24, 2010: Isaac Asimov - The Relativity of Wrong (1989) , https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=114796814127. Marc 10, 2010: Putting Google to the Test in Translation, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1180926The Asimov entry has my first HN comment ever, with 19 upvotes! How happy I must have been at the time. The crazy thing is that it took me 5 months to upvote three submissions, now I do more than that in my morning round! I must have been more discerning at the time.When I had slightly more than 10,000 links I thought of starting a blog called &#34;The March of the 10,000&#34;, to write about selected bookmarks from my upload list; never got around doing it. I must have been busy accumulating more HN bookmarks :-)"</p>

I wonder if Americans/Westerners are capable of appreciating the things that China gets right, or does right. I wonder if Americans/Westerners are capable of acknowledging the things that their countries get wrong, or do wrong. I wonder if we here in the West are as fair and balanced as we tend to think.This isn&#39;t merely an academic question, I think it goes to the core of the state of mind that is required to view situations objectively (regardless of whether we might be right or wrong in any specific context).In this case, I&#39;m totally on Wikimedia&#39;s side.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a neat article, but it does have some errors.One subtle point that the post gets wrong:&gt; So where does that come from? The answer is that Python stores everything inside dictionaries associated with each local scope. Which means that every piece of code has its own defined “local scope” which is accessed using locals() inside that code, that contains the values corresponding to each variable name.The dictionary returned by `locals()` is not literally a function&#39;s local namespace, it&#39;s a copy of that namespace. The actual local namespace is an array that is part of the frame object; in this way, references to local variables may happen much more quickly than would be the case if it had to look each variable up in a dictionary every time.One consequence of this is that you can&#39;t mutate the dict returned by `locals()` in order to change the value of a function-local variable.Another, less-subtle error in the post is this:&gt; int is another widely-used, fundamental primitive data type. It’s also the lowest common denominator of 2 other data types: , float and complex. complex is a supertype of float, which, in turn, is a supertype of int.&gt; What this means is that all ints are valid as a float as well as a complex, but not the other way around. Similarly, all floats are also valid as a complex.Oh, no no no. Python integers are arbitrary-precision integers. Floats are IEEE 754 double-precision binary floating-point values, and as such only support full integer precision up to 2^53. The int type can represent values beyond that range which the float type cannot.And while it is true that the complex type is just two floats stuck together, I would very much not call it a supertype. It performs distinct operations.&gt; Accessing an attribute with obj.x calls the __getattr__ method underneath. Similarly setting a new attribute and deleting an attribute calls __setattr__ and __detattr__ respectively.Attribute lookup in Python is way more complex than this. It&#39;s an enormous tar pit, too much so to detail in this comment, but __getattr__ is most often not involved, and the `object` type doesn&#39;t even have a __getattr__ method."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Cute fact about __debug__: it is one of the only ways to get compile-time conditionals in Python. Performing a comparison with `if __debug__:` will output byte code for the ensuing statement if and only if the interpreter is in debug mode - notably, in `-O` mode, it will not even generate a load of __debug__ and a conditional jump, and acts as if the statement didn’t exist at all."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In addition to this, I highly recommend just reading the codebase. I haven&#39;t written C since college and it&#39;s remarkably readable.I once tried to catalogue all the stdlib operations which release the GIL, meaning if you use only those (well, only those &#34;heavy&#34; bits, you can still use other small blocking glue bits), you can do &#34;real&#34; multithreading.It was a fun exercise!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"How do we neuter the power of Twitter mobs? Seems like they can bully and intimidate any organization from universities to corporations to GitHub projects to kowtow to their demands. Their demands are usually to fire, boycott, or boot people with opinions that run afoul of the mob.Not a healthy precedent to set. We will regret this later if we continue down this path."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Actually it&#39;s not different. University lecturers have been protested or cancelled for decades for reasons unrelated to their topic, usually due to political beliefs or corporate interests that clashed with students&#39; ideals. &#34;Cancel culture&#34; is specifically about &#34;personal&#34; societal reforms, which is what makes it different than the older complaints about general politics.Back in the day it was &#34;edgy&#34; to protest or cancel a speaker due to their support of the Vietnam war. People were just as angry (or more so!) at Vietnam protesters as people are today about &#34;cancel culture&#34; protesters, and vice versa. At the time, it was those young freaks with the long hair who were clearly nuts and extremists and going to erode the country&#39;s moral decency. Counter-culture folk in the 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s were a tiny but vocal minority of young people who were largely put down for their radical views about war and the environment. It&#39;s only in hindsight that protesting the Vietnam war seems socially acceptable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; John Carlson LectureAs a disclaimer I am against any censorship of academia and think that even Charles Murray should be allowed to speak at a university (assuming he is invited by an academic department or student group) and that the university should never have veto power.However, I think the example in the Atlantic is actually more mild than past cases: the John Carlson Lecture is a general audience talk that the university holds to boost its public image.It’s not an academic talk discussing new research or a political perspective, but rather summarizes ideas for the public. If MIT wants to decide who should give such talks I don’t care.In contrast, if a department or student group wants to invite a specific speaker for a specialized talk about politics, science, math, then the university censoring such discourse is what is truly dangerous.In this light, the cancellation of Milo Yiannopoulos who was invited by the College Republican club is much worse. Even though personally I do not think Yiannopoulos is anything but a provocateur, if someone (group/department) wants to invite him the university should not block him from speaking."</p>

Whatever effort the US spent to slander and discredit Assange does nothing to stop people inspired by him, or motivated by US foreign policy in countries that do not enjoy its favour.  The US seems completely oblivious to the fact that whatever happens to Assange the journalist, it simply isnt enough to curtail the overwhelming cacophony of demand for free and open journalism across the internet.Just let the guy go and focus the money, time, and effort on preventing this in the future.  nearly every major news outlet and journalist all see Assange as a journalist, not a hacker.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I cannot comment on the long term effect of blue light, but at the very least i experience very significant discomfort when turning off any piece of software that makes the screen a more warm color (for example, f.lux on Windows https://justgetflux.com/ and something like Redshift https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Redshift on *nix), to the point where it makes me avert my gaze.Due to me working primarily as a developer, i don&#39;t always need good color accuracy, so my current settings of screen color warmth are the following:  Day: 4300K
  Sunset: 3000K
  Night: 2550K

In addition to that, i have a few smart lightbulbs that change to a more red color as the night approaches and gently dim more and more when i don&#39;t need to do any reading and just have to walk around the house. Subjectively, i&#39;d say that it&#39;s better for me being able to fall asleep and experience a bit less eye strain (though admittedly, using a computer late into the night is never a good idea).Perhaps the discomfort is just because of eyes having a hard time adjusting to noticeably different lighting conditions, but maybe there&#39;s more to it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Headline is incorrect regarding danger to sleep.The study cited[1] regarding sleep only compares regular iPhone usage and iPhone usage with night mode, and found no benefit from the night mode.This is a weak result, since even with night light modes screens still emit a fair amount of blue and green light.[1]: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S23527..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recall that a paper published by Oxford in a journal related to gerontology claimed that blue light accelerated aging of the retina. If I understand correctly, this article doesn&#39;t counter that claim outright, it just didn&#39;t find that risk with the low intensity of blue light coming from a typical monitor.Tangentially related, that same Oxford paper (sorry I don&#39;t have a link and no longer have access to the paper) did however claim that light generated by red LEDs with sufficient intensity to leave a significant persistence effect after 3 minutes of exposure can reverse aging and damage in subjects over 40 years old although the sample size was just a few dozen people IIRC. It does so because somehow the retina&#39;s mitochondrial function is improved by light in the 650nm to 1000nm range.Continuing on this tangent, I am 50 and have been exposing my eyes to red light for 3 minutes a day for many months and feel like my night vision has been restored. If I wake up in the middle of the night I used to see gray noise and now I can see darker black with better contrast. But I may be kidding myself."</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28812486">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi all, I work on the VS Code team. This came up the other day in stand up and the initial plan was to deprecate and eventually remove the old setting. Several of us pushed back and said while we may deprecate the setting in favor of something else, the old setting should always be respected due to the sensitivity around telemetry.If there&#39;s any confusion around this messaging it&#39;s because this discussion literally happened 2 days ago. I&#39;ll reopen https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/134660 to make sure we clear up confusion."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Microsoft has really been pushing the telemetry lately. Edge phones home far more than any other browser. Windows itself has no way to fully disable data collection (only the option to send &#34;basic&#34; or &#34;full&#34; data, including which websites you visit--oof). If you use Pro and you are enough of a power user to feel comfortable editing registry settings, that&#39;s what is now required to turn telemetry off, and even then it&#39;s hard to know you did it correctly. And this type of tracking is pervasive across the entire Microsoft ecosystem, including within Xbox, Minecraft, Teams, and now VSCode. It&#39;s disappointing to say the least."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who&#39;s worked on multiple power-user GUIs professionally, telemetry can be genuinely useful for improving the product. You can discover features that are never used and should be removed so attention can be focused elsewhere, and others that are used frequently and deserve more attention, and others that users may frequently have trouble with and should be fixed or improved.I&#39;m not saying this justifies dark patterns, and I have no firsthand knowledge of whether Microsoft is exclusively using this data for legitimate purposes. If it were me I&#39;d enable it by default but make it clear and easy to disable for those who care. That said: I don&#39;t think the knee-jerk assumption that this is a wholly evil thing is justified."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you&#39;re looking at going even deeper into SSH tunneling and port redirection, I recently made The Cyber Plumber&#39;s Handbook free: https://github.com/opsdisk/the_cyber_plumbers_handbookI made it free to the HN community a few years back [1].  There is a paid interactive lab portion (details in the repo) if you are looking for hands-on experience.Book OverviewThis book is packed with practical and real world examples of SSH tunneling and port redirection in multiple realistic scenarios. It walks you through the basics of SSH tunneling (both local and remote port forwards), SOCKS proxies, port redirection, and how to utilize them with other tools like proxychains, nmap, Metasploit, and web browsers.Advanced topics included SSHing through 4 jump boxes, throwing exploits through SSH tunnels, scanning assets using proxychains and Metasploit&#39;s Meterpreter, browsing the Internet through a SOCKS proxy, utilizing proxychains and nmap to scan targets, and leveraging Metasploit&#39;s Meterpreter portfwd command.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19946941"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You can also change/add them after the ssh session has started.This uses the escape mechanism. For help on that, hit return, type &#34;~?&#34; and hit return again.From there you will see that &#34;~#&#34; will list them. And &#34;~C&#34; takes you to a line-oriented command prompt where you can add them.For example, type return &#34;~C&#34;, then at the prompt type &#34;-L1234:localhost:22&#34;. Then in another window, type &#34;telnet localhost 1234&#34;. Then back in the ssh window, type return &#34;~#&#34; and you will see the tunnel being used.Another trick: if you don&#39;t need a shell and only want to forward ports, run &#34;ssh -N&#34; instead of &#34;ssh&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have read far too many ssh tunneling articles and all of them either forget about the bind address or just pretend that the only host that can be tunneled is localhost.The fact is that ssh tunnels are bound to an interface on one side and the other can be any (reachable) host:port.  So if example.com:1234 isn’t reachable from your host network, you can do a local port forward to example.com:1234 from an intermediary host that can reach example.com:1234"</p>
