								<p class="story__comment_others">"The paper is surreal.An AI paper that starts with experiments on drowning cats and religious chimpanzees.Then it talks about making the system by cutting up a large wire mesh and assembling it back randomly.Then it talks about simulating the system on a computer, and coding it in a programming language called YAWN that is like English.Then it says that they could not obtain the machine that runs YAWN programs, so they emulated that machine on another computer (IBM 704).Then it says (excitedly) that the machine printed gibberish when presented with a certain input and on another run ejected the input punched card twice.I&#39;m not sure if this is real or a joke.I&#39;m not sure if the experiment itself was designed as a joke to waste US military&#39;s computer time.I&#39;m not sure if this has some deep lessons.To me, it felt like when Dumbledore set the chicken on fire in HPMOR."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Here are a few thoughts I haven&#39;t formulated before:It seems clear enough to me that training AIs on copyrighted works is typically or commonly a fair use under existing law, because the AIs can and commonly do learn non-copyrightable elements and aspects of those works. It&#39;s very obvious from enormous numbers of examples that current AI systems are capable of learning much more abstract features of human culture (grammar, concepts, facts, cultural tropes, and many others).A human being doesn&#39;t violate copyright in learning from a copyrighted work, including when that human being is later more able to produce other works based on that learning (e.g. reading fantasy novels and learning concepts, tropes, or vocabulary that one uses to produce other fantasy novels; reading a newspaper and learning facts that one incorporates into an essay; learning artistic techniques or stylistic conventions from studying existing artworks and using them when producing new artworks). Current AI systems are (amazingly) becoming capable of all of these things and may do them in ways that are somewhat akin to how human beings do them. (although I guess Jaron Lanier would object &#34;that&#39;s what they want you to think&#34;)But there are also examples in existing copyright doctrine where people accidentally repeat enough of a prior work to get in trouble for infringement -- most often with song composition (like George Harrison&#39;s &#34;My Sweet Lord&#34;) because relatively small pieces of melody (which a person might easily memorize) may be considered copyrightable.If human beings had much more accurate memories, copyright would be quite a bit more intrusive (and/or quite a bit less effective) because, following any exposure to some kinds of works, we could use our own memories to reproduce those entire works from scratch for our own use or pleasure without obtaining authorized copies from elsewhere.Computers do have such accurate memories, and machine learning systems, which are optimized for things like maximum likelihood estimation, can and do reproduce both copyrightable and non-copyrightable elements of works that they&#39;ve been trained on. After all, the maximum likelihood continuation of a fragment of a text or a song is ... the complete original work. And the ability to reproduce the complete original work would, other things being equal, reduce loss in training. After all, that&#39;s something someone might specifically ask for, and if the system could oblige, it would be doing a better job of providing what the user wanted.It&#39;s relatively foreseeable that machine learning systems would potentially be able to reproduce both copyrightable and non-copyrightable elements of various works, because the distinction between the two isn&#39;t especially clear from an algorithmic or mechanical point of view. (For instance, facts aren&#39;t copyrightable, but the notion of what constitutes a &#34;fact&#34; for this purpose is a culturally-bound legal notion and not at all straightforward to make precise.)But if you had a human author or artist or scholar or programmer who was &#34;trained on&#34; exposure to an enormous body of works, and that person had an exceptional eidetic memory, you could imagine that he or she would be perfectly capable of recreating many of those works from memory (and that other people might request such recreations). (Again, in music in particular, it&#39;s already routine that someone could have unambiguously copyrightable material memorized and be subject to copyright restrictions on performing songs. Like if a singer or band performs a cover from memory.)If you wanted to avoid this ability then you might need to build in an explicit notion of copyright that limits the accuracy or level of detail inside of the model in some way. This is tricky because (1) I don&#39;t think people have really tried to do this much so far, (2) copyright applies very differently to different categories of work, (3) it obviously wouldn&#39;t satisfy critics even if it mitigated the most extreme examples of &#34;regurgitation&#34;, and (4) it would be kind of weird because you would be intentionally limiting the quality and extent of learning that the system was allowed to do. (I imagine Jaron Lanier getting mad again about my repeated comparison between human learning and machine learning, and between human memory and machine memory)Some of the weirdness in point (4) is that accurate prediction is usually cool / great / impressive / accepted as an appropriate goal or capability, but if it&#39;s too accurate in certain contexts, it may be deemed a copyright infringement. Like if you said &#34;what word comes next? FOUR SCORE AND SEVEN YEARS AGO OUR FATHERS&#34;, there&#39;s a clear correct answer and knowing it requires having a certain text memorized. OK, if you said &#34;what word comes next? MR. AND MRS. DURSLEY OF NUMBER FOUR PRIVET DRIVE WERE PROUD TO SAY&#34; ... same thing, but Bloomsbury Publishing may be unhappy if you have a system that can get all such questions right."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It would be sad if someone succeeded in shutting down CoPilot for this kind of copyright stuff. It is genuinely useful. I don&#39;t care that it reproduces copyrighted content. The only way you can get it to do that is to bait it with the function names of functions that have already been copy and pasted thousands of times onto GitHub without proper licenses.Luckily, someone will probably come out with a &#34;renegade&#34; version trained on whatever makes it a useful assistant to my coding. I won&#39;t be afraid of accidently violating copyright myself, because I won&#39;t be trying to bait it into reproducing heavily copy&amp;pasted cherrypicked examples, and I won&#39;t use 20 lines of its output with zero modification."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"RSI took away my ability to write any significant amount of code 30 yrs ago. co-pilot plus speech recognition restored that ability.  what impressed me most was that from a textual description,co-pilot gave me code that could have been written by my mind and pre-injury hands.from the comments here, if I push copilot into giving me code that I would have written for a given problem and that code violates licenses, then who is responsible for the copyright violation? co-pilot for giving me code that looks like copyrighted code or me for tweaking co-pilot commands to give me the code I envisioned which looks like copyrighted code?also consider that the very tools used for solving problems in code lead coders to a small number of solutions for a given problem.  is it plagiarism or parallel original thought?also consider that when I wrote code, if I was solving a similar problem to what I solved before, I recreated that previously used code fragment (or larger) and use it to solve the problem at hand. I had zero issues leaving a trail of duplicate code behind me especially if the code was a major part of a software patent.I didn&#39;t care, my code was lauded for it&#39;s readability and reliability. reuse the same concepts in multiple variations, you get real good and writing code correctly.maybe co-pilot like programs could scan existing code bases and find examples of  code fragment plagiarism with the goal of showing that software copyrights are useless."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m sad that this is happening to an app that&#39;s useful to its users, but the reality is that scraping is legal, always possible, but difficult.This particular case is a bit harder since it&#39;s not purely using public data, but may still qualify since it&#39;s likely scraping with legally-obtained credentials.I know of businesses (scraping for ride-sharing, scraping for business intelligence for retailers, scraping from LinkedIn - see HiQ Labs v. LinkedIn) that have continuously succeeded via scraping in ways that large businesses oppose.The key is: you must make enough profit to justify dedicating engineering and legal techniques to defend your scraping.- Scraping public data is legal, as affirmed by the Supreme Court in Van Buren v. United States [1] and HiQ Labs v. LinkedIn [2]. Defending yourself or suing the data owner in court are both expensive though- Defeating anti-scraping via technical means is pretty much always possible, but can be costly depending on the scraped site&#39;s technical expertise and value in keeping their data private. The benefit to you must exceed the cost to you, and ideally should also exceed the cost to the data owner- Mobilizing PR and internal resistance may also be effective, but it&#39;s usually hard to have outcry from a large enough group to change an organization&#39;s policies. In this case, the union can push for it, but AA may try to withhold improvements until the next set of union negotiations1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Buren_v._United_States2. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HiQ_Labs_v._LinkedIn"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;One flight attendant said of the current situation affecting Sequence Decoder that they had “never seen a company go out of their way to make life harder for their workers.”&#34;Every large company I&#39;ve worked for had an IT department (or similar) that intentionally made developers&#39;/sysadmins&#39; lives harder. They don&#39;t care. So the good people leave, morale drops, productivity drops, management starts implementing crap policies to force more work to get done."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is really a story about a celebrity&#39;s mental illness and public breakdown. If you haven&#39;t been following the news, West has spent the week saying increasingly unhinged things, not just about politics but about Pete Davidson, his wife, and (if I&#39;m remembering right) his kids and the fake actor children that have been installed in his former home to corrupt them. He was interviewed for a show on Fox and a big chunk of what he said was edited out and later leaked; the &#34;people at the Gap&#34; knew about Uvalde, Kanye is now a Black Hebrew Israelite, &amp;c. He&#39;s quite evidently sick, and these Parler people are scamming him."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Musk and everyone else is right that we do need a platform with free speech. The only problem is that all those free speech advocates are actually NIMBY&#39;s when it comes to free speech.I have been following self proclaimed free speech absolutists(because I too, believe in free speech but don&#39;t believe it exists) and they are totally not the kind of people that say &#34;I hate what you say but I will die defending your right to say it&#34;. In all places, these people are curating comments and posts to push agenda.The only somewhat free place I&#39;ve seen is 4Chan but it contains so much toxicity, that&#39;s its barely bearable.Yet again, I like that Musk and Kanye kind of people claim that they want free speech because at least we can hold them responsible when they don&#39;t deliver it. This is in contrast with the pure fascist where they cannot be held responsible for anything because they don&#39;t claim virtue in first place. It&#39;s a bit like companies doing greenwashing, which can be exposed when they don&#39;t deliver on their claimed virtues versus companies who don&#39;t even claim such virtues and instead pretend that it doesn&#39;t matter. Those who claim virtue are better even if they ultimately fail."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"How could an average outside observer distinguish between another&#39;s mental illness and a guy who&#39;s just a real out of the box thinker who might be wrong about many ideas but might also add value to the world by perceiving reality in an atypical way?A lot of posters are claiming Kanye is mentally ill and unable to manage his own affairs. What is the direct evidence of this? And I don&#39;t simply mean &#34;provide examples of opinions he&#39;s said that I don&#39;t understand or care for&#34;.I think it&#39;s pretty dangerous to be labeling people involved in the national dialogue as mentally ill without a diagnosis, or at least some substantial and direct evidence. This label could be weaponized by an authoritarian political movement in a very dangerous way if that&#39;s the precedent we&#39;re using."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m curious how Sci-hub&#39;s approach compares to the What.cd/Redacted approach.IIUC Sci-hub has scooped up science docs through a good enough UX that it was able to leverage the goodwill of science folks to upload docs (plus whatever other methods it has used to scoop up docs), and it uses a public blitzkrieg-style distribution mechanism. I.e., I guess if one had a big enough harddrive and a fast enough internet connection, one could start downloading the lib right now and see if they win the race against the copyright holders.On the other hand, the What.cd/Redacted approach seems to use Bittorrent ratios to create a private-tracker economy. New users get a few gigs free download on joining. But apparently because a) there&#39;s a 1:1 upload/download ratio, and b) a few first-mover fat cats are sitting on enormous ratios, this means there is a scramble by everyone else to upload new FLACs to build up their ratio so they can continue to be able to download FLACs. It seems that would mean the library-in-its-entirety cannot be easily replicated at will. Yet the tracker was apparently already nuked off the internet as What.cd and reappeared later as Redacted. Was any data lost between the two services?Oh yeah, there&#39;s also apparently another approach in rutracker, which seems to be blitzkrieg to add content and publish, at the (apparent?) cost of quality of content.It&#39;s really a shame that the nerdy, completist domain of digital archiving through torrents isn&#39;t covered by fair use. Perhaps we could exclude the most recent 10 years of music so that the hopeful young musician streamers can get paid a few hundred dollars for millions of streams and then receive the silver lining of fair use protection against a label refusing to release one of their albums."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think Alexandra Elbakyan actually did not want to be revealed as the librarian behind Sci-Hub, it was her poor opsec that led to her being identified.Basically her servers were set up to emit detailed error messages from PHP, including full path of faulting source file, which was under directory /home/ringo-ring, which could be traced to a username she had online on an unrelated site, attached to her real name. Before this revelation, she was anonymous."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not in the pirate archivist space, but sections 3 and 5 are relevant to my interests. I&#39;ve had great luck with ZAP (https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy#readme) glued to a copy of Firefox (because it allows monkeying with the _browser_&#39;s proxy without having to alter the system one as other browsers do) for archiving all content seen while surfing around a site. It even achieves the stated goal of preserving the HTML (etc) in a database since ZAP uses hsqldbThen, section 5 reads like an advertisement for Scrapy since it is just stellar at following all pagination links and then either emitting the extracted payload as your own data structure and/or by telling Scrapy you want to download some media as-is. It will, by default, put the local content in a directory of your choice and hash the url to make the local filename. A separate json file serves as the &#34;accounting&#34; between the things it downloaded and their hashed on-disk filenameScrapy is also able to glue 3 and 5 together because it has a pluggable (everything, heh) dupe detection hook and also HTTP cache support that can be backed by anything, including the aforementioned hsqldb operating in network mode. Scrapy is also very test friendly, since each method accepts a well known python object and emits either a follow-on request, zero or more extracted objects, or nothing if pagination has ended. Thus, one need not rerun the whole scraping process just to test if a bug has been fixed, or during developmentI can appreciate there may be other scraping frameworks, but of the ones I&#39;ve tried Scrapy makes everything that I&#39;ve asked it to do simple and transparent"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi there - one of the few pro sellers on HN here.You&#39;re planning on prospecting into one of the most rejection-heavy domains out there with small physical business. These people get dozens of calls per day from companies they&#39;ve never heard of - many of whom are trying to rip them off - and even the best ones (Groupon, Yelp, google ads, etc.) are basically just rent-seeking. Oh, and most have gatekeepers who don&#39;t care the slightest bit about your pitch.Because of that I&#39;d stay away from all this &#34;smile and dial&#34; advice. You&#39;ll have no chance. Go out there and hit the pavement and meet these people at their establishments at off hours. If you catch the owner in there at a good time - do your best to inform them of your products benefits and come up with a really good offer to get started (something that loses you money and time). Free Trial, free month of services, whatever makes sense based on the context of your business. The goal is NOT to make money or build a book of business at this point - it&#39;s to get a person happy with your software to sell to later.If the owner is too busy or whatever - have some stuff printed out for them to read later that you can drop off. Ideally with a small gift (coffee, food, candy, etc.) and come back in a few weeks to see if you catch them at a better time (again with a gift, until they talk).A solid entry level book would be Fanatical Prospecting by Jeb Blount.Good Luck.*edit to fix book name"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To be frank you&#39;ve already committed the classic blunder of developer initiated startups.  You built before you sold.  Now there&#39;s no telling if what you built is what anyone wants.IMHO, and extrapolating a lot here it&#39;s very unlikely you will get any sale based off your MVP.  It&#39;s unlikely that you&#39;ve hit the right market fit without first having found customer #1.So I&#39;d back up a step and find someone with the problem you&#39;re trying to solve.  Offer the deal of a custom built solution to meet their need.  Once that&#39;s built and validated that it actually solves the problem then start selling to others."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a difference between marketing and sales. You&#39;re building a solution to a problem. Marketing is about getting people who have the problem to know your solution exists. Sales is about convincing them to pay money to solve the problem.If you built the MVP but don&#39;t have customers yet, you should already have some people in mind who suffer from the problem your solution is supposed to solve. Selling is then just a conversation that loosely follows the following steps:  (a) Ask if they still have the problem
  (b) Ask if your proposed solution solves their problem
  (c) Ask them to spend money to buy your solution

Note that every step starts with &#34;ask&#34;. This means that you need to listen to their response. If they don&#39;t still have the problem, walk away. If your proposed solution doesn&#39;t solve their problem, listen to why not, and focus on improving your product until it does solve their problem (hopefully in a generic way such that your improvements will help you sell to other customers in the future). If they aren&#39;t willing to spend the price you&#39;re asking to buy a solution that they consider to be a solution to a problem they have, then find a way to add more value so that they will be willing to pay that price."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is an excellent piece which really does a good job at explaining the nuance that exists in this challenging problem domain. Thank you for writing this. It&#39;s a great piece to point to whenever the next scandal gets &#34;exposed&#34; by click-seeking folks on the internet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It makes sense from a technical perspective why you&#39;d build a system like XCheck. The problem is that once you build XCheck you actually need to say to your C-suite and PR department &#34;Actually no, you can&#39;t say we treat everyone equally, we&#39;re manually going in and exempting certain people from scrutiny, and that&#39;s entirely within our discretion.&#34;The problem isn&#39;t technical, it&#39;s legal - you can&#39;t build a system that operates one way and then publicly misrepresent it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wish they would explain what xcheck is and how it works before the talk about the problems with it. This reads like a blog post to other Integrity FB engineers that already know that system."</p>
