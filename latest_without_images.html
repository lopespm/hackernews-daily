								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Related to Xiaomi, the company is also doing some sketchy things in the smart home space under their brand &#34;Aqara&#34;.  I use HomeKit in my apartment and opted for Aqara branded wireless buttons and temp/humidity sensors because of the attractive hardware and good reviews.  The devices require a wi-fi connected hub, not too strange for things that use Zigbee, so I gave that a go.Well, on cursory examination, the Aqara/Xiaomi hub was talking to a bunch of Chinese servers constantly.  I didn&#39;t dive too deep into what all they were actually for.  When I blocked the device from phoning home with my router, all the connected devices stopped working!  None of the buttons or sensors would work, the RGB light on the hub couldn&#39;t even be changed.  As soon as it lost the ability to ping its servers in China, the thing actually started strobe light flashing blue.  Re-enable the outside network access on it, starts working again.  This was totally antithetical to why I use HomeKit in the first place, so I removed the hub and paired all the Aqara accessories with a generic open source Zigbee hub (ConBee II) and added it to HomeKit with HomeBridge.In the future I plan to give brands more scrutiny before investing time/money in them and granting them unfettered access to my LAN..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This paragraph stood out to me:&gt; The intention here seems to be that aigt is the timestamp when the ID was generated. So if that timestamp deviates from current time by more than 7776000000 milliseconds (90 days) a new ID is going to be generated. However, this implementation is buggy, it will update aigt on every call rather than only when a new ID is generated. So the only scenario where a new ID will be generated is: this method wasn’t called for 90 days, meaning that the browser wasn’t started for 90 days. And that’s rather unlikely, so one has to consider this ID permanent.If we assume that Xiaomi aren&#39;t literally trying to spy for a government and are in fact just poorly calibrated on what&#39;s legitimate to collect for product analytics purposes, this paragraph highlights why that&#39;s still incredibly dangerous despite &#34;good intentions&#34;.I remember the UK government investigation into Huawei concluding that not only was their security posture insufficient for critical infrastructure, but their engineering practices were likely a decade away from being at a point where they could start to claim good security practice.This paragraph seems to suggest a similar problem at Xiaomi. This should have been caught at a security review stage during design, it should have been caught at the code review stage, it should have been caught by automated tests, it should have been caught by QA, it should have been caught once live by data tests, it should have been seen once live by analysts, it should have been fixed at so many different points. The fact it wasn&#39;t suggests that these stages either don&#39;t exist or are insufficient."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I truly don&#39;t understand, from a security and privacy perspective, why would anyone outside of China would voluntarily choose to run closed-source software from a company that&#39;s subject to domestic laws and regulations in China. The MSS is no joke.https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&amp;q=china+mss...This is the same reason that Zoom is banned at my workplace and many other partner companies.You&#39;ve actually got two problems here. One is the commercial advertising/for-profit related data sharing problem described in the article. The second is that Xiaomi, as a company with that collected data resident in China on its servers, is obliged to provide a pipeline for a copy of their database to the MSS upon request."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Throwaway because I don&#39;t want my co-workers to know.I was poor. My father left home when I was a kid in middle school. My mom worked part time cleaning houses and left us when she found a new husband. I dropped out of high-school in the 9th grade and went to work. Low paying jobs. I lived with my aunt on the bad side of town.Fast-forward 35 years. Today, I make about 200K per year. I got a GED, went to trade school, then got into college (full Pell Grant because I was so poor) and came out with a few degrees.Everything I own is fully paid for. House, cars, etc. because I&#39;m always afraid I&#39;m going to be poor again. Of course, I only own modest things. Nothing fancy.If you have never been poor, you may not realize how awesome Small houses and Toyota Corollas are.My fears about being poor again drive my wife and kids crazy. They think I&#39;m nuts and say I need counseling. I probably do.Anyway, people think I&#39;m &#39;privileged&#39; now because I earn a lot of money, but they have no idea that I used to sleep on the floor and eat in soup lines.I made it and you can too. Poverty has no color. It impacts everyone. You can&#39;t tell just by looking at someone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a great write-up, and as someone who spent time being poor-ish, it really resonated.What I realized from my own life experience: the US sawed the bottom rungs off the ladder in the 1950s when it suburbanized. There is no affordable housing or transportation in 95% of the North American land area, and virtually every societal problem we deal with either stems from this or is made worse by it. Then the healthcare disaster is the cherry on top.The US is a great place to live and work with tremendous upward mobility —— but only if you can stay above the event horizon which is reliable car ownership and insurance coverage (health, home/renters, auto). If you fall under that, you will need help or a lot of good luck to get back out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"His point on housing is so important, and its adjacent to a lot of other poverty-related issues.It&#39;s one of the reasons advocates for the poor often seem to speak a different language to their opposition.If you live in median-and-above-land, you think of all costs existing on a spectrum.  Fancy dinners for $100 on one end. Rice and beans for pennies at the other. This is true for clothes, smartphones, furniture... lots of things. There&#39;s a spectrum with options all along it.It is not true for housing, transport and a lot of other, unavoidable expenses. Housing is the extreme example. Say an average smartphone is $350. $700 buys a luxury phone. $175 gets you an decent phone. Say median rent is $1500. Going above $3k will get you a palace and $750 probably doesn&#39;t get you anything. Quality, below median prices is on an extremely steep curve.Household economics are just completely different below and above a certain threshold... and this has gotten more pronounced over the last generation or two.Ireland has/had a whole literary genre of stories about miserable poverty-stricken childhoods. They paint a very vivid picture. If you compare it to poverty today, besides being less harsh, it&#39;s quite different.  They had housing. It was basic, often insecure, but they did have housing.Food was scarce. That&#39;s no longer the case. Stuff though... they had no stuff. No bed, no mugs, no shoes, no pencils. Getting these things was an epic mission and served as a landmark. That is all changed now. Stuff is extremely abundant. Basics like housing and transport are almost as scarce as they were in the bad old days.The upshot of all this is that we underestimate how poor poor is."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Seen the GTA post already and the sscanf behavior is very surprising as one would expect it to parse the given string until the given format is satisfied or \0 is hit. Seems like this is not the case. Found this: https://stackoverflow.com/a/23924112&gt; sscanf() converts the string you pass in to an _IO_FILE* to make the string look like a &#34;file&#34;. This is so the same internal _IO_vfscanf() can be used for both a string and a FILE*. However, as part of that conversion, done in a _IO_str_init_static_internal() function, it calls __rawmemchr (ptr, &#39;\0&#39;); essentially a strlen() call, on your input string.Looks correct. Call flow:https://github.com/bminor/glibc/blob/21c3f4b5368686ade28d90d...https://github.com/bminor/glibc/blob/21c3f4b5368686ade28d90d...https://github.com/bminor/glibc/blob/21c3f4b5368686ade28d90d...https://github.com/bminor/glibc/blob/83908b3a1ea51e3aa7ff422..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I found this while making a collection of what C implementation does what at https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26298300 .There are two basic implementation strategies.  The BSD (FreeBSD and OpenBSD and more than likely NetBSD too), Microsoft, GNU, and MUSL C libraries use one, and suffer from this; whereas the OpenWatcom, P.J. Plauger, Tru64 Unix, and my standard C libraries use another, and do not.The 2002 report in the comp.lang.c Usenet newsgroup (listed in that discussion) is the earliest that I&#39;ve found so far.There have been several assertions that library support for strings in C++ is poor.  However, note that the fix here was to switch from the Standard C library function sscanf() to a C++ library.* https://github.com/fastfloatOne might advocate using other people&#39;s libraries, on the grounds that they will have got such things right.  However, note that this is RapidYAML, and the bug got fixed several years after GTA Online was released.  Other third-party parsing libraries have suffered from being layered on top of sscanf() in other ways.* https://github.com/json-c/json-c/issues/173* https://github.com/kgabis/parson/commit/96150ba1fd7f3398aa6a..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have come to the conclusion there are two kinds of audience and two kinds of diagram, abs they almost exactly overlap1. Engineering diagrams, explaining concepts to other engineers who are using the diagram as a jumping off point to deeper explorations2. &#34;Business&#34; diagrams - the sort of thing we want to see in a Medium article or presentation.  The style and correct placement matters far more than engineering.The first is very amenable to markdown style production - often we want to spend no more than a few minutes creating the diagram.  We get (60?) 80% of the way there with 20% effort.But with every markdown approach I have tried the remaining 20% is flat out days of work.  There is almost always a need to place that box there and have this one below and to the right and dammit the layout engine will not agree.What I would ideally like is a combo - markdown to get me most of the way there, and then drop into some vector format that lets me tweak."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It was such a senseless destruction. People miss AIM, people miss MSN Messenger and just a couple years later it turned out instant messaging platforms were worth billions.It&#39;s still insane to me these corporations shut down perfectly viable platforms that were still used by millions. The short sightedness and pettiness of these directors is something of legend, I hope there&#39;s a chapter about this in new management textbooks, but who knows.Anyone got a good explanation why it made sense to shut down these services?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really miss AIM.It was the way you knew friends were available to chat. It was much closer to in-person conversation than most media we use nowadays.It&#39;s not uncommon for someone to {iMessage, SMS, FB Message, IG Message, etc.} me while I&#39;m otherwise busy. Then, I need to find a second to let them know of this (unless I either totally drop the ball or consciously decide to not reply). I also need to let them know I&#39;ll be free to chat after work, at lunch time, etc.With AIM, you just logged in and set whether you were available, idle, away, or invisible. Friends knew whether they would disturb you or not.Not only that but it was pretty much the singular form of instant communication that almost everybody used. Now I have people I reply to on multiple platforms such that we&#39;ll even branch off in separate conversations per platform, I only talk to on X, Y, or Z platform, etc.I&#39;m not one to &lt;Old man yells at cloud&gt; typically but this is one aspect of social media that I think we&#39;ve lost over the past decade and it really sucks."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Surprising how much press &#34;cancel culture&#34; gets these days as if it&#39;s a new thing or as if it&#39;s a new thing being pushed on society by the left. We&#39;ve always had cancel culture. Some might remember the Dixie Chicks. How about the Rachael Ray ad that Dunkin Donuts pulled merely because it looked like an Arab scarf? Jerry Falwell came to prominence entirely based on his pushing of cancel culture. When I lived in North Carolina, one of the things that was repeated all the time was that a newspaper editor would lose his job for publishing a story with a positive spin on free trade. You can go back further to McCarthyism, Turing being prosecuted for being gay, and on and on.Cancel culture remains a thing. Apparently now that folks aren&#39;t just being cancelled for supporting gay marriage, the free exchange of ideas is suddenly important. The outright hypocrisy of so many on this issue is the biggest story.Edit: Forgot to mention this extreme example of cancel culture:https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/professor-who-wore-hijab-...A professor was cancelled because she wore a hijab. There was no outrage at all from the usual suspects."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I genuinely wonder what cancel culture is going to look like in the next 5-10 years and beyond. Just about everyone I speak to about the subject agrees that cancel culture is bad but very few people seem willing to confront it. I sense that people hope the rest of society will come to its senses and we all stop being so judgemental.But as much as I loathe cancel culture and it&#39;s chilling effects on the free exchange of ideas, I can&#39;t help but admit that it seems to work. From a detached and objective standpoint, an ideology that utilizes cancel culture is really good at stamping out opposition. You are free to think and believe whatever you want in private and then you self-censor in public out of fear. It takes a certain critical mass of people to affect change and cancel culture excels at keeping individuals from speaking out because the consequences have the potential to ruin your life.So all that being said, I genuinely wonder if cancel culture is here to stay, because the next ideology to come along will also realize how powerful of a tool it is."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find it almost funny how the media/culture/etc. seems determined to build a group of people that will react negatively to so-called &#34;cancel culture.&#34; They seem to think that people will gladly follow the ever-growing list of arbitrary rules indefinitely.If I were a betting man, I&#39;d predict a resurgence in punk attitudes in about 2025 or 2030. At some point, the dam will break and people will stop caring. I already get a sense that the 13-19 generation is a bit tired of it."</p>

It’s not a pedestrian crosswalk button.I found this out the hard way when my wife could no longer send or receive messages nor sign into Messages and we had to contact Apple support. I’ve accidentally reported tons of people as spam because of this stupid Messages experience, and I can only guess that I’ve reported my own wife so many times from clearing all of my Messages conversations that they disabled her Messages account.The support tech had the gall to tell me they’d reactivate her account as a one-time exception, and I practically wanted to kill the guy over the phone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Now that I work for a big evil corporation, I have some insights on why these inexplicably evil things happen. Fun at parties, I know. Not excusing it, just shedding light for anyone interested in the systems perspective.&gt;It appears as though charges from Apple are specialThis is exactly right. You offer branded cards because interchange fees are expensive. You want people who buy your stuff to pay you by ACH. That&#39;s not practical at the point of sale, but it is practical if you frame it as the monthly payment on your store-brand credit card. Charges at the store on the store-brand card are always special. That&#39;s why the cards are offered.From a merchant&#39;s perspective, anyone who buys something is really taking out a loan. In most cases such a loan will be settled by the customer&#39;s card issuer, less the interchange fee. In the case of a branded card, it will be settled by the customer directly and in full. In either case, if this doesn&#39;t happen on time, the customer&#39;s account with the merchant is now in arrears.Most of the time this happens, the &#34;customer&#34; is farming stolen credit card numbers for resalable goods. You are never going to find these people, let alone rehabilitate them and settle up. So the &#34;hey, you did a lot of chargebacks to us, what the hell?&#34; state is not user friendly.

Linking Apple Id&#39;s to Apple Card accounts is crazy. Shocked when I realized that was going on.Here&#39;s a *long* screenshot of my support history https://breckyunits.com/appleCard.pngSmall pain in the big scheme of things, but sad to see Apple not really innovate behind the fancy UI. I&#39;d vote they nix this thing and leave consumer cards to Stripe and PayPal and others who are more focused on building better financial products for consumers. Don&#39;t pull a GE and get mixed up in finance Apple, you&#39;re better than this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is definitely the most reasonable case I&#39;ve heard made from this argument, and it&#39;s changed my stance on the issue.That said, I feel the cryptography project handled this poorly. I encountered the issue when one day, installing a Python Ansible module the same way I did the day before required a compiler for a different language that I&#39;ve never used before and that is hardly used, if at all, in the rest of my stack. The Ansible project seemed to be taken by surprise, and eventually  I found the root upstream issue, where the initial attitude was &#34;too bad&#34;. Some people making those comments worked for Red Hat / IBM, Ansible is heavily backed by that. What company cares more about Linux on S390 than Red Hat / IBM? I would suggest none. So the fact that they had this attitude and community reaction to me suggests the problem is not one of expecting free work for a corporation on a non-free architecture. It was IMHO a combination of a lack of forethought, communication, and yes, perhaps a change that is overdue and will just be a little painful. The suggestion to maintain an LTS release while people figure out how to proceed is the right move."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I do think that we&#39;re going to see more of this. This is just a relatively early example. Rust and LLVM bring things to the table that make them inevitable if we as an ecosystem, on the whole, value privacy and security. This is where the rubber of the ethos hits the road. C for all it&#39;s good work and history, is a leaky mess and the source of so many zero-days, especially the bad bad state actor level ones.If we are to move to a more abstracted and safer system, the ideas behind LLVM are just going to be a fact of life in years to come. The solution to this is to either fund greater LLVM integration (or similar that isn&#39;t on the scene yet) or accept the status-quo. I choose the former, but I sincerely hope the future direction leaves as few out in the cold as possible through the effort of smart people. But protecting hobbyists is a stretch goal in my mind compared to improving the security and privacy of the global interconnected world we&#39;re in."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Don&#39;t know about crypto. But any open source package, ported to a new environment (one not explicitly tested by the maintainter) is going to have issues. That&#39;s the nature of software.E.g. I just added pnglib to an embedded assembly. Has a display among other things. Wanted to put compressed PNG images into (limited) flash, then decompress into (plentiful) RAM at boot.Of course pnglib didn&#39;t build for my environment. Never mind it has a C library. There are 50+ compile switches in pnglib, and I was setting them in a pattern that wasn&#39;t part of the tested configurations. It didn&#39;t even compile. Once it compiled (after some source changes) it didn&#39;t run. More source changes and it would run until it hit some endianness issues. Fix those, and it would do (just) what I wanted, which was to decompress certain PNG image formats with limited features, once.No problem. That was my goal, achieved. But at no time did I blame the maintainers for not anticipating my use case.I would say this: maintainers, flag compile-time options that aren&#39;t tried both ways in your test environments. To give me some chance of estimating how hard my job is going to be."</p>
