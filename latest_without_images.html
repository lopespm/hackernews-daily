								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"You are trying to solve a real-world problem experienced by a lot of profitable companies, so there is already a market of paying customers waiting for this.  One of my clients is actively trying to reduce their dependence on Amazon and instead integrate with other marketplaces.I see it&#39;s just Shopify-to-Shopify for now - bravo for starting with probably one of the most costly integrations.  I&#39;m working with a client right now who had to build these integrations using a low-code drag-n-drop platform which allows a quick MVP but has slow job processing, so isn&#39;t great for high order volume.The &#34;amazon&#34; comparison is good for marketing - sure you&#39;re not doing all their marketing, or having their reach but you are connecting suppliers, buyers and fulfilment which is a genuine problem.The companies who would use this often have developers on board already, so providing open source, accepting contributions and turning this into a useful dev-friendly service will almost certainly find paying customers.Following :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A few points I&#39;m skeptical of:  simply connect to the seller’s infra instead of locking them in.

One of the value-adds of Amazon is there&#39;s a whole bunch of tech sellers don&#39;t need to know how to write, run, and maintain. You&#39;d need to understand how big the niche &#34;technically literate to run their own e-commerce business, but selling on Amazon for other reasons&#34; is, then how your operation would answer those &#34;other reasons&#34; to make you competitive to the niche.  If, for some reason, the seller is removed from the marketplace, their software stays with them and they can continue accepting orders directly.

Apart from the software systems, there&#39;s a whole bunch of basic business processes that Amazon takes care of, which are less portable. Using FBA? Leaving means learning how to run a warehouse, shipping logistics, pricing, staffing, etc. Not using FBA? How&#39;s your Marketing department doing? Hopefully you didn&#39;t let it get too anemic or too fitted to &#34;people who are good at gaming Amazon&#39;s algorithm.&#34;In short, if your value add is: &#34;Amazon, but you get to take the tech home with you if you leave the platform,&#34; then that feels like a small niche of highly competent businesses, then you&#39;re stuck with &#34;well if they could do all this on their own anyway, why are they choosing Amazon?&#34;Hope that helps and wasn&#39;t just me blabbering. Good luck!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Love open source projects in the eCommerce domain, especially ones that are JavaScript instead of PHP! Two pieces of feedback:- Using a copyleft license like AGPL makes this an automatic non-starter for most businesses, no matter how impressive your tech might be. You&#39;ll have a lot more luck with mid-size and enterprise adoption with an MIT license.- You&#39;ve really built an Order Management System for marketplace use cases, which is in industry typically a distinct domain from a Warehouse Management System (WMS) or a Transportation Management System (TMS) which at large-scale tend to handle how orders actually get fulfilled and shipped to customers. Your naming is a bit misleading - at the very least I&#39;d emphasize somewhere on your landing page that this is an open source Order Management System if you want eCommerce domain folks to grok quickly what you&#39;ve built and how it plugs into a broader architecture."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s always great to see different ways folks are using Firecracker. Snapshot-and-restore is a particularly cool capability, especially if you solve the data movement problems (like these folks have).One challenge to clone-and-restore that they don&#39;t talk about here is making sure that clones don&#39;t behave too similarly (like returning the same cryptographic random numbers). We wrote a paper about that a while back (https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12892), and the Linux kernel community has been doing some great work in that area recently too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Beware that such techniques slow down memory access for the newly running VM quite substantially.For example, a simple memset() call across a few gigabytes of RAM inside the VM might slow down a factor of 1000x after a VM clone like this.Both &#39;parent&#39; and &#39;child&#39; VM&#39;s see the slowdowns.Some types of garbage collector also see really substantial slowdowns.It was a deal-breaker for my project where I did similar sorts of things."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not to diminish this work, but I think it&#39;s worth noting that it&#39;s increasingly possibly to launch new VMs extremely quickly too.  FreeBSD/Firecracker can reach userland in 33 ms, and the OSv unikernel boots in under 10 ms.I think increasingly we&#39;ll see Firecracker used with EC2-like setups of &#34;create a disk image with everything preinstalled and then boot it&#34; rather than using snapshots of running (suspended) VMs."</p>

Not only did the technology improve, allowing for lighter, smaller, and programmable pacemakers, but doctors began to realize that this excessive longevity of nuclear pacemakers was excessive. Lithium pacemakers often last 10-15 years allowing for doctors to check in on their patients and replace either the batteries or the pacemakers themselves with new and improved technology as it is develops in those 10-15 year spans."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Both Kagi and Orion are deeply impressive products. Even though I try every new general purpose web browser and search engine that comes out, this combo is the only one that stuck.Orion: Finally a non-chrome based web browser that can compete with the likes of Brave and Arc. It works much better on Mac than the alternatives, with the same engine as Safari it also benefits from deeper system integration such as native Sign-in with Apple and password management. Also, like Brave, comes with powerful ad and tracker blocker so you don&#39;t need a separate extension. I also love its built-in tree-style tabs implementation.Kagi: It is Google without all the bad parts. It is user centric like some other alternatives, without the poor index and search results.Props to the team, I am looking forward to what&#39;s to come. It is mind blowing how a single small company can make one of the best desktop browser AND search engine AND mobile browser on the market. Hope they are not spreading themselves too thin and can fund the development of all these for a long time!My only complaints are the slow performance of Orion on iOS, and its poor handling of app urls. Latter caused some issues when I had Orion set as the default browser on my iPhone and some payment flow that used app redirects between my banking app and the store app got stuck. I was lucky and I could manually launch the app by pasting the app link in Safari, but I hope it can handle these cases as well as Mobile Safari in the future."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I joined the Kagi beta two weeks before it ended and have been a paying user ever since. I find the price to be quite steep but so far it have no regrets and will most likely continue my subscription. I average over 2000 queries per month.- Search result quality is at least equal to Google for most queries and far superior for queries involving discussions or technical topics. Sadly, it is inferior for queries in my area of expertise (Swiss law).- Kagi is the only alternative to Google that I know of (and I have tried many) which is able to produce good regional results and mix them - when appropriate - with international results. Most privacy focused search engines are very US centric.- Blog spam and copy cats are not completely gone but the situation is at least bearable, especially after continuosly filtering them and boosting credible sites instead.- Customization options, filtering options, speed and site layout are also far superior when compared to Google.Apart from the lower quality results from queries involving my area of expertise, the only thing that still keeps me using Google Search are the reviews from Google Maps.All in all, I recommend supporting this product."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can&#39;t stress how much better Kagi is than Google, I&#39;m a paying user. No more scrolling through tons of ads. Filtering by time and language is great, no more GitHub and Stackoverflow clones in the result. 
Thank you, I actually haven&#39;t realized how small Kagi still is, given how polished that product already is."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’ve been interviewing for 8 months. Getting to many final rounds, 1 lowballed offer, 1 rescinded offer, and it’s playing a mental toll. Today, I got a rejection that went along the lines of “everyone loved you and there was absolutely 0 negative feedback, but we just found a better fit.”  I almost broke down, but hid behind a facade of positivity because the long weekend was starting and my kids can’t afford a bummed out Friday.Interviewing shouldn’t require such thick skin. I’m here questioning my life, and reduced to worthlessness."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These styles of multi-round interviews inspired by the FAANG collective started picking up in Australia before the pandemic, but it got to a point where most of my more talented colleagues and I all agreed it just wasn’t worth the time for the salaries being offered. 4 round interviews for a ‘senior’ developer position on $120k?When interviewing my own candidates, I use a 1 hour interview mostly focused on approach and personality. We have a probation period to work out if they’ve over-promised, and most of our tech industry is big banks that won’t notice if they waste a few weeks salary trying someone out. Honestly, for the salaries the local market provides, I think 1 interview is fair. Any more and I think we’re wasting peoples time for nothing.Personally, I’ve dropped out of application processes when they’ve indicated there are multiple rounds, and my salary hasn’t suffered for it relative to my friends who put up with them, so I feel like I’m ahead."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My last job search took a toll on my mental health. I felt like a worthless person for 3 months. I could feel (or imagine?) the disdain of the interviewers as I was failing their tests. The fake enthusiasm on their side as they rejected me (&#34;that was great! But we&#39;re not going to move forward with you! Good luck!!!&#34;) and on my side while pretending I was excited when in fact I was worried about money and the gap on my resume.I dread the next one."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There is actually a way to delete Meetup groups, versus just leaving/stepping down from them.The Meetup docs are quite clear about the default behavior if you leave/step down: https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002865332-Closi...The answer you needed was just a quick Google search away: https://www.google.com/search?q=delete+meetup+group, e.g. https://support.google.com/developergroups/answer/7378020?hl... and many other results.Could Meetup offer up this distinction more clearly in their user docs? Sure. But like I said, the Meetup docs are pretty clear what happens when you follow their instructions.It&#39;s hard not to read OP as &#34;we took an action without doing due diligence to fully understand the consequences of doing so.&#34; The point at which you make an assumption like this is the point at which you bear equal responsibility for unfavorable outcomes.Edit—the UI is actually very clear about this, and has been for at least the last couple of years: &#34;Your members will be given the chance to become the organizer and keep the group running without you.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This has been an issue with Meetup for as long as I remember. The problem is there are two distinct scenarios.One is that the organizer has lost interest or is stepping down for some reason. Allowing the community to continue on Meetup in that case makes sense, by having someone step up to continue paying Meetup.The other is that the community as a whole has decided to move to a new platform. In this case keeping the now defunct community around and making it seem viable is bad. The current active members will know where to go, but new potential members or former members that want to re-engage are going to get confused.I got burned by this a couple of times, finding a group on meetup only to discover that it’s a ghost group, to the point where I’m now suspicious of any meetup group I find that hasn’t had an active event in the last couple of months.This is where I think Meetup is shooting themselves in the foot by not having a way to dissolve a group if the group as a whole decides to move."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am a multiple meetup organizer and owner on meetup.com and I find it actually great that the meetup can stay alive if the organizer stop to pay.
Your communities are not owned by you.
Also, they don&#39;t give subscribers infos but just &#34;an access&#34; to send them email communication to the list, not the &#34;list&#34; with email list etc..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This really sucks to hear. What’s unclear to me is whether Twitter is being negligent or abnormal here or whether this is just shitty world politics unfolding partly on Twitter. Twitter is being used by both sides to fight over a narrative. Nothing new in that respect.The author doesn&#39;t really propose a solution other than Twitter essentially siding with him and take (what appears to me to be) a political stance. Of course moderating political topics isn’t outside Twitter’s wheelhouse, but this is what you get as a society when you let arbitrary entities arbitrate speech: ambiguity and unclear expectations.On the one hand, it’s reasonable for the author to expect that Twitter removes clear misinformation from their platform since that’s what they purportedly claim to do. On the other hand doing so would go against a national narrative and piss off lots of Pakistanis. Uh oh.Maybe Twitter was never about being arbiters of facts and instead just pandering to the popular political narrative of the time? Or maybe they are objective and they’re just trying their best and we’re all human and we’ll do better next time? Regardless, this is the reason people get so frustrated with censorship: it cannot be applied objectively and fairly in every case.Twitter and social commentary aside: sounds like the author needs political asylum or at least real protection. Twitter is not the right entity to depend on to handle this situation, I fear."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am sorry for the responses I am seeing on HN. People with cushy lives who&#39;ve likely never faced similar danger seem to just not really get it.I will say that your framing is one that most Westerners will have trouble taking seriously.It might go over better to document known cases where this pattern occurred and show the similarities.  Walk people through it like they are five, so to speak.I know it&#39;s hard to do that kind of objective writing when you are feeling so threatened due to genuine threats, but in my experience that approach works better.I know you didn&#39;t ask for advice. I apologize for my bad habit of trying to be helpful in the only way I know how.I hope something improves soon."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Twitter, despite millions of Pakistani users, it seems has no moderation system that understands local dynamics.Many would argue they don&#39;t even understand the local dynamics of the U.S. It&#39;s impossible for twitter to be an arbiter of the truth around the world, and you shouldn&#39;t expect them to be. However, I understand that&#39;s cold comfort for someone facing the threat of torture, death, or exile from their home, and I think your decision to call out twitter using your own platform to act with respect to your specific circumstances is the right thing to do and really the only way to handle this kind of thing.Good luck, I hope you stay safe and that the government doesn&#39;t succeed in silencing you."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My favorite Stephenson&#39;s novel is Anathem with superb world building (as usual) but also a pretty good story and ending.But it&#39;s also a book whose world (specifically the avout society) attracts me. I&#39;ve grown up in a Catholic setting, but &#34;converted&#34; to atheism/agnosticism pretty early. But even with its many failings, there are certain aspects of religions which seem worth preserving - the focus on community, the rituals, a particular rule framework, meditation (prayers) and introspection.The book presents a (on a certain level) pretty attractive model of society which combines the practical religious patterns with a full rationalism.I kind of understand why such &#34;atheist religion&#34; is unlikely to get off in the real world, but it&#39;s still something I would wish for."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I agree, I don&#39;t think diamond age gets enough interest. It&#39;s one of my favorite books and the ending is unsatisfying but at least upbeat. Seveneves is also tons of fun. And if you know anyone who likes history, his older Baroque Cycle is pretty greatI haven&#39;t heard this in an interview or anything but I think now Stephenson is older and successful enough, he just writes the books exactly how he likes. Diamond age feels like he was agonizing over every word to keep everything so short. But Fall, and his newest book Termination Shock (which I also didn&#39;t like most of) ,just feels like an author who likes writing. Both have these amazing moments, which reminds me like a jazz musician, where it&#39;s almost effortlessly insightful and funny. But with no editing or second thoughts"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Much as I love Neal Stephenson&#39;s novels, I really wish he&#39;d stayed around at the writer&#39;s class he surely took until they had learned how to wrap up books and write endings; more often than not, I turn the page on a Stephenson novel only to find it was the last...(While I exaggerate a little, his stories do not end as much as END - I would be thrilled if he could spend a few pages wrapping it up in the end before leaving us waiting for the next title...)The yarns he constructs are definitely entertaining enough for me to cope with this very minor annoyance, though."</p>
