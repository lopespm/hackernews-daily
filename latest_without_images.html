								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;On LinkedIn, our members trust us with their information, which is why we prohibit unauthorized scraping on our platform.&#34;This is an unpersuasive argument because it ignores all the computer users who are not &#34;members&#34;.  Whether or not &#34;members&#34; trust LinkedIn should have no bearning on whether other computer users who may or may not be &#34;members&#34; can retrieve others&#39; public information.Even more, this statement does not decry so-called scraping only &#34;unauthorised&#34; scraping.  Who provides &#34;authorisation&#34;.  Surely not the LinkedIn members.It is presumptuous if not ridiculous for &#34;tech&#34; companies to claim computer users &#34;trust&#34; them.   Most of these companies recieve no feedback from the majority of their &#34;members&#34;.  Tech companies generally have no &#34;customer service&#34; for the members they target with data collection.Further, there is an absence of meaningful choice.  It is like saying people &#34;trust&#34; credit bureaus with their information.  History shows these data collection intermediaries could not be trusted and that is why Americans have the Fair Credit Reporting Act."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Web scraping is legal&#34; seems to be an overbroad interpretation - the Ninth Circuit is merely reaffirming a preliminary injunction in light of a recent and separate ruling by the Supreme Court. The opinion [1] only weighs the merits hiQ&#39;s request for injunctive relief, and doesn&#39;t say anything about the meatier topic of web scraping legality.I think the real action will be the ruling of the district court.[1] https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2022/04/18/1..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While I have sympathy for what the scrapers are trying to do in many cases, it bothers me that this doesn&#39;t seem to address what happens when badly-behaved scrapers cause, in effect, a DOS on the site.For the family of sites I&#39;m responsible for, bot traffic comprises a majority of traffic - that is, to a first approximation, the lion&#39;s share of our operational costs are from needing to scale to handle the huge amount of bot traffic. Even when it&#39;s not as big as a DOS, it doesn&#39;t seem right to me that I can&#39;t tell people they&#39;re not welcome to cause this additional system load.Or even if there was some standardized way that we could provide a dumb API, just giving them raw data so we don&#39;t need to incur the additional expense of the processing for creature comforts on the page designed to make our users happier but the bots won&#39;t notice."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The upsells on TurboTax are getting a lot more shameless in recent years.  I saw the exact same one pop up at least 2-3 times.The one that really aggravated me though was the one at the end: after you FILE your taxes, they present this damned progress-bar looking thing as if you are somehow “not done” yet, as if this totally optional product sale is a required step!!  No, no, no, that is just misleading garbage, and it is so annoying to have to constantly hunt around the page for the magic text to get around these things.  I mean, I couldn’t even reach the page that lets me download my forms as PDF until I skipped this upsell.What’s more, the product itself is getting more expensive but worse.  On desktop, the whole thing is just a blown-up mobile UI (are that many people doing taxes on their phones!?) with all kinds of things unnecessarily hidden.  On page after page, there is more than enough space to show everything but instead it’s giant white space everywhere; they HIDE things behind disclosure arrows, and with no logic whatsoever; e.g. on one page it shows the 2020 numbers by default but hides all the 2021 numbers behind arrows!?Guess what isn’t an insultingly-small, truncated experience on desktop?  The ads, the upsells.  THOSE are full-page, taking full advantage of screen space and even scrolling off the edges.Really shows their priorities."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve done my taxes on Turbotax for a few years, and didn&#39;t even check alternate options because I had the perception they were clunky.I&#39;ve tried for the first time FreeTaxUSA to prepare my mother&#39;s tax return. Guess what? It&#39;s even better than Turbotax in some aspects(the UI is similar, but doesn&#39;t waste your time with animations), and way cheaper. It only charges you to file state but, if you come from the Free File IRS website (and are under the income requirements), it doesn&#39;t even charge you that. There&#39;s one upsell for their tax consultants or whatever, but it&#39;s only done once.It does not automatically import W2s though, but that saves you maybe 5 minutes per W2. Not sure about stock transactions import either, it seems they can&#39;t import from brokers. I will have to check next year. They do seem to have spreadsheet import, so maybe that&#39;s something we (as in, HN community) could fix until they have the feature.The competition seems to have improved as well, although I don&#39;t have first hand knowledge (but watched some youtube reviews where they walk through the filing with every software).It&#39;s time we ditch Intuit. If we can&#39;t have free IRS software, then we should at least bleed Intuit dry.EDIT: it&#39;s particularly egregious that Intuit came up with the Free File program as a compromise so that IRS wouldn&#39;t have their own tax software, only to leave the program."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Going to give a +1 for FreeTaxUSA. Significantly cheaper than H&amp;R Block and a user interface that is just as good.The large tax companies are engaging in regulatory capture and ought to be sidelined in favor of a healthy society."</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31068388">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Over the years, I have become convinced that much of the observed age-correlated cognitive decline in people younger than ~70 results from voluntary life choices, such as settling into fixed behavioural patterns (e.g. doing the same thing over and over for decades) and lack of exposure to new stimuli.It&#39;s the case for some physical activities as well: almost all people&#39;s actual performance degrades way, way faster, than their potential peak performance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m 53 and recently embarked on a complex self-guided mini-medical education to try to understand my son&#39;s rare condition.I&#39;ve pushed my way through a 400 page nursing textbook, dozens of scientific papers and a 900 page freshman neuroscience textbook (currently at page 90).I never took any bioscience class after high school software chem.There have been ups and downs. Mentally comparing myself to when I was in school and reading comparable material, I feel my ability to master it was at or above that - at its best. However the amount of time I spend &#34;at my best&#34; in general is MUCH lower than when I was that age.Today I have trouble sleeping many nights. An old hip injury and also anxiety.A night I don&#39;t sleep well is definitely not going to be followed by a day where I gain understanding of neuronal membrane chemistry.Didn&#39;t have those issues when I was 17 - any time was study time.So I guess this goes along with the thesis of the story. Mental powers are there, but other body systems aren&#39;t able to support the brain&#39;s demands at quite the same level."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"AbstractResponse speeds in simple decision-making tasks begin to decline from early and middle adulthood.However, response times are not pure measures of mental speed but instead represent the sum of multiple processes.Here we apply a Bayesian diffusion model to extract interpretable cognitive components from raw response time data. We apply our model to cross-sectional data from 1.2 million participants to examine age differences in cognitive parameters.To efficiently parse this large dataset, we apply a Bayesian inference method for efficient parameter estimation using specialized neural networks.Our results indicate that response time slowing begins as early as age 20, but this slowing was attributable to increases in decision caution and to slower non-decisional processes, rather than to differences in mental speed.Slowing of mental speed was observed only after approximately age 60.Our research thus challenges widespread beliefs about the relationship between age and mental speed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From reading the other comments here, I understand that it&#39;s easy to pick something RMS said and say &#34;Yeah, right...&#34;But you have to keep in mind that RMS advocates the free software philosophy - the complete left end of the software spectrum - the white angel on your shoulder (not the red devil on the other).And while I find some of his points too radical to implement practically in my own situation, I believe it&#39;s very important that we have someone like him in the tech world. As a result, whenever there is a RMS talk, I listen to it. And each time I gain new and valuable perspectives about free software that help guide future decisions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Now, more free games? It doesn&#39;t satisfy an urgent practical need, obviously... But the crucial thing is, free ones might make it easier for some people to say, &#39;Let&#39;s move off this non-free thing, and play a game that is free. So we can have the same pleasure, but without paying freedom as the price.&#39;“i&#39;m sorry but i just can&#39;t read this without laughing. what does stallman think gamers are like?i can only imagine the average teenage gamer trying to get their friends to stop playing virtually every game on the market and instead play some obscure game and trying to teach them how to install gcc and git to get it running"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Around the 8 and 9 min mark RMS talks about old hardware losing software support, like 32 bit systems. I am a kernel developer and the kernel removes code for a lot of older systems all the time (often lesser known 32bit ARM systems).Phoronix reported that 5.18 removed the Andes NDS32 CPU arch code. https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;item=linux-51...The reason they do this is because a lot of these systems can break as the internal kAPIs change all the time and the users will not know since the embedded custom distro of software + kernel is not upgraded. Support can be broken for these arches for years until someone gets these systems second hand and posts about them, but may not care to fix it or it is cheaper to replace it.RMS calls this a major issue, specifically 32-bit support in Ubuntu. I do not agree. My last 32 bit computer died a long time ago after the battery died years ago. It was a Gateway so getting replacement parts would be difficult. I also was never able to get it to run Linux. Aside from my brother-in-law finding his old laptop no one I know uses 32 bit computers (well except for myself with my Pi Zero: ARM v6, which I used once).It just feels like the wrong battle to pick when Linux&#39;s biggest competitor is forcing practically all PCs to use a bootloader signed with their key. Major vendors can choose to refuse to allow users to install their own key. They are already locking CPUs (Ryzens) to their brand of motherboards with a builtin fuse provided by AMD. He of course talks about it-it just feels like the 32 bit part distracts from it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not to tone police that much but I really don&#39;t get people like Casey. Like his whole thing is spending a billion years writing his game engine, and then whining about all these &#34;bloated&#34; tools. Just completely dismissive of everything that doesn&#39;t align directly with his values (which don&#39;t include actually shipping game!)I like people who write their own engines and make bespoke things for fun. Just really dislike people who lack the imagination to wonder why some people just want to make games rather than spend their life writing engine code, and actively shitting on stuff that exists. Just so much negative energy to put out in the world.Of course in practice Unity _is_ a major pain in the butt but UE has the nice aspect of actually working for very large projects and shipping stuff. Yeah there&#39;s obtuse stuff, but in practice what happens is you join a team and then you actually learn to use it. In exchange you have releases.The one thing that really is rough for me with _both_ UE and Unity is that they&#39;re both very oriented towards teams with dedicated art people who can put out assets to use. BSP-based workflows where you can quickly greybox out levels to playtest (basically giving level designers without art sense a fighting chance) are much nicer with older engines.There&#39;s a nice missing middle that Valve kinda fills with Source, except everyone that has worked with Source seems to dislike it for other reasons. But I&#39;m sure we could make 3D engines with nicer usability for people who, for lack of a better word, can&#39;t 3D model too great."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a software developer I&#39;ve worked with Unity and Unreal in a professional capacity for many years, and shipped quite a few games on both engines. Unreal is powerful, but really shows its game development studio and FPS game roots. Unity has limitations, I won&#39;t deny that. And both engines have their own issues and different frustrations in using and deploying them. I have also shipped games on internal, custom built engines too. From a business perspective, hiring Unity developers, i.e. people who can code in C#, is a lot easier. Unreal developers are plentiful, but their knowledge of the guts of Unreal usually stops at the surface level, barely dipping below Blueprints, at least from my experience.Personally, I prefer Unity over Unreal, but am not averse to using either, in the right context."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In this critique of unity they say that the back half of making a game is the half of suffering. In my experience, it highlights something else that is a massive problem in the game dev space. The game dev community is stuck in software practices of 2005, leading to naive implementation patterns.As a hobbyist game developer of ~1year, one thing that struck me was how I have not found many good sources of teaching that explains how to make a maintainable game. How does one make a code base for a video game that has desirable the non-functional qualities like maintainability? That question doesn&#39;t really have an answer...I think it doesn&#39;t have an answer because those teaching game development haven&#39;t really asked. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s due to many factors.For anecdotal, I&#39;ve asked about testing and CI/CD for unity in online spaces. There isn&#39;t much content on these critical subjects in the video game education space. I usually get a mix of responses but one that stuck out to me is that video games aren&#39;t appropriate for tests and it just slows down game creation.I think that thought process more than anything is what leads to back half issues. I think that the video game industry has lagged behind the rest of the software industry and there is a huge opportunity for disruption.In 5-10 years people should think it&#39;s absolutely outlandish to start a complex software project such as a video game project without a CI/CD engine running a suite of sensible tests. I think today that is true for most software projects, although as a community were still wrapping our heads around &#34;what is a good test?&#34;My 2cents"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My key takeaways:1. Uber is actually a higher cost/less efficient producer of urban car services than the taxi companies it has driven out of business2. Individual Uber drivers with limited capital cannot acquire, finance, maintain and insure vehicles more economically than Yellow Cab3. Expenses other than drivers, vehicles, and fuel account for 15 percent of traditional taxi costs but Uber charges drivers 25-30 percent without coming close to covering their actual costs4. Uber’s surge pricing does not improve efficiency, it simply prices those night shift workers out of the market5. And as Uber has demonstrated, unlimited taxi market entry can lead to ruinous overcapacity and can allow part-timers to cherry-pick the peak revenue that full-time drivers depend on to cover their costs6. Uber’s investors knew that it needed raw political power to accelerate growth, and to maintain its hoped-for dominance7. Uber’s major strategic breakthrough was to treat business development as an entirely political process, using techniques that had proven successful in partisan political settings8. All of Uber’s early popularity and rapid revenue and valuation growth are explained by the billions in predatory investor subsidies needed to drive those more efficient (but poorly capitalized) incumbents into bankruptcy9. That [early popularity] allowed [Uber] to pursue more stratospheric valuations by exploiting anticompetitive market power and rent-extraction and buying out any potential competitive threats"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel this entire thread has quite missed the point of the question
the way a neutrino passes through a solid object and interacts with
nothing but empty space.People have talked about microeconomics, gig economies, labour
shifting, bad old days, safety, subsidies, licenses.... but we&#39;ve
gotten no closer to understanding;&#34;Why Is a Company That Lost Billions Claimed to Be Successful?&#34;To answer this one must ask &#34;What is financialisation?&#34; The short
answer is; a system in which the success or failure of a company is of
no relevance to its &#34;value&#34;. Under financialised logic it is
absolutely immaterial whether Twitter, Uber or whatever make a
penny. Ever. Or whether any of the stakeholders are served. The rules
of traditional business go out the window. All that matters is the
stock price of a tradable financial entity (a company) based on brand
confidence/perception.Under that system, Uber is successful so long as the financial market
says it is. When it decides it&#39;s not successful, it&#39;s not. One has to
realise that a total detachment of political economics and power has
taken place."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When traveling in India, I foolishly took a cycle rickshaw. It was gross/shameful. A man far less fortunate than I was sweating, working hard, barely getting paid, and breathing horribly polluted New Delhi air while I just sat there.When Uber started to squeeze its drivers, I again felt just like this. I hated hearing drivers complain about their life problems. I hated doing the math and seeing how little these people were making out of this transaction. I hated feeling like a perpetrator of class division.The common argument in support of Uber’s poor economics is their superior user experience compared to taxis. However, exploitative industry is a terrible “user experience” for the ethically- or morally-conscious. And that’s just the privileged party’s perspective…"</p>
