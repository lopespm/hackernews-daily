								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; In theory, there is no path for a malicious Tailscale control plane to remotely execute code on your machine, unless you happen to run network services that are designed to allow it, like an SSH server with Tailscale-backed authentication.Now I feel less crazy for not using Tailscale SSH for similar reasons.I&#39;d like to see a security evaluation of Tailscale, on a per feature basis.I&#39;d like to see tailscaled run with far fewer privileges.Is there a Tailscale alternative that just does Wireguard + NAT traversal and doesn&#39;t try to do key management?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Do they have enough logs to reach out to people that were affected? As far as vulnerabilities go, this set is one is one of the worst ones I&#39;ve seen this decade, and they seem rather straightforward.Would be nice to get a blog post from them that goes a bit into impact, not just a report that tells you to update. It&#39;s nice that they responded quickly, but I feel like this shouldn&#39;t have happened in the first place for a network security company and it makes the Windows client feel like a bit of an afterthought. Looks like they have a PR open to switch it to named pipes, I hope that is properly reviewed by someone that knows Windows APIs before it&#39;s merged."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Blockchain was invented to solve one particular problem: distributed consensus on a sequence of transactions, where the choice of which transaction to include from a set of conflicting transactions is irrelevant.The latter property here is key to understanding where blockchain is useful. It was created to solve the &#34;double spend problem&#34;, ie. two transitions that spend the same coin but send it to different recipients (and so they conflict and cannot both be included in the canonical list of transactions). A double spend is the result of the sender either (a) making a mistake, or (b) attempting fraud. In both cases the important property is that as long as only a single of these conflicting transactions is included, the systems works.Only if your problem exhibits the above property (and it&#39;s a distributed system) does using a blockchain make sense."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had a real experience that perfectly reflects the research presented here (safer ledgers useful, blockchains are not).I accidentally got wrapped up in a project to automate some HR functions, and the product manager demanded that it must be blockchain because blockchains are the future.It turns out that append-only databases are well-suited for HR records, and (especially when dealing with things like background checks, immigration papers, etc.) it doesn&#39;t hurt to have a history with cryptographically-verifiable date stamps.We used an existing database that did all of the above, told everyone it was blockchain, and released the product.That was a great strategy for a few years until everyone realized blockchain was a boondoggle, and now you never need to work with anyone who still believes in it. You can just understand their mention of blockchain to be a sign that you need to avoid doing business with them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; [Andy Jassey] said something like this: “All these leaders [CIOs and CTOs of huge enterprises] are asking me what our blockchain strategy is. They tell me that everyone’s saying it’s the future, the platform that’s going to obsolete everything else. I need to have a good answer for them. I’ll be honest, when they explain why it’s wonderful I just don’t get it. You guys got to go figure it out for us.”To me the tell is not just that Andy didn&#39;t understand.It&#39;s that all of these leaders said &#34;everyone says it&#39;s the future&#34;, but not one of them said &#34;I have this problem and here&#39;s how blockchain solves it for me.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Because corporations are doing the majority of that pro-environmental advertising. I mean that both in terms of companies making changes (both real and greenwashing) and the News/Media corporations reporting on it.Telecommuting could be absolutely massive for reduced emissions, could bring down urban house prices, improve inter-family relationships, and revitalized suburban neighborhoods (e.g. more walkable areas). Plus increase wealth to relatively poor rural areas.Even some corporations are starting to realize that telecommuting isn&#39;t their enemy, but large ships move slowly, and recently we&#39;ve been seeing a lot of &#34;return to work&#34; used as a way to conduct layoffs with lower negative PR/stock tanking. This isn&#39;t a byproduct but a goal of return-to-work (e.g. see Musk&#39;s text message conversation during Twitter-lawsuit discovery)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is nothing more illogical in modern society than commuting to an office every day. Employees waste 2 of their 16 available waking hours in the non-productive commute while incurring significant financial costs (lease/insurance/fuel/energy) in order to support this patently absurd activity. Employers waste time and energy negotiating leases, re-arranging offices, purchasing AV equipment for meeting rooms, etc., in addition to paying the likely enormously expensive lease itself. The impacts on the environment, the number of hours of human life wasted in commute, the pointless buildings and associated costs to employers as well as the public infrastructure to support it (roads, trains, busses, etc.) are all incredibly wasteful. Surely, all of this could only be justified if physical presence had a dramatic impact on productivity. Yet, we cannot tell one way or the other if it actually improves outcomes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Two main problems1. Middle and senior management who don&#39;t want to lose control or be rendered less effective.
2. Engineers who are not trained in written communication and largely cannot autonomously move a group towards a goal without a lot of supervision.If you solve for no 2, then that acts counter to no 1 - because middle management will be questioned - why do we need you ? If a group of engineers can function on their own towards a common goal, then the manager&#39;s role is more or less rendered redundant. Sure there may be a need for psychological support but you surely won&#39;t need the current ratio of engineers: managers.There is a deep rooted old school interest in staying physically connected. This won&#39;t go away anytime soon. I am not debating whether that is right or wrong, but the general notion that &#39;we are better if we are physically together&#39; still persists. I don&#39;t know if this is a genuine feel-good-together feeling or just a made up emotion to mask point no 1 above.I am flummoxed by how executive leadership is simply blind to these facts in most companies. I mean the CEO can declare a fully remote constraint sort of like the exact opposite of what Musk did at Twitter and drive productivity higher. The cynic in me says execs can&#39;t force this decision because the senior management simply will come back and say &#39;we cannot be this productive with a fully remote team anymore&#39;. I don&#39;t know but I for one cannot understand the irrational exuberance behind RTO."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of my professors in grad school was really into wine and every couple of years he would put on an after-hours wine tasting class for a semester.  One of the points he made was that there are absolutely wines which are objectively better and worse and that experts can reliably tell them apart.  He had met enough experts who could identify a vineyard and vintage blind to know there was something to it.  But sitting on top of that there is a frothy market that is driven by fads, speculation, and hype.He was of the opinion that generally speaking the quality of a typical wine increases monotonically with price up until around the $40 range with the big steps around the $5, $10, and $20 price points.  But above $50 or so, you&#39;re no longer paying for higher quality, per se.  It&#39;s more that you are paying for a unique flavor profile and reliability.  But unless you&#39;re seeking out that particular flavor profile, you can get a bottle that is just as good for $30-40 (and occasionally even cheaper).  And above a few hundred dollars it&#39;s all just fads, speculation, and hype.  (He liked to say that the people who buy those wines have &#34;more money than sense.&#34;)  They&#39;re good wines, but you can get a bottle that is just as good for a fraction of the price."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked at WineSpectator.com in 2012-2013. I&#39;ll say this in their favor: the wine tastings were blind. A bunch of interns would set up the wine tasting, pouring the wine into glasses and then hiding the bottles. Only after everything was setup were the editors allowed into the room. So when the editors drank the wine, they had no idea if they were drinking a $9 bottle or a $900 bottle. They had to focus on the taste and balance, and write their report. Only afterwards were they told which wine they had tasted.Having said that, I&#39;ll also mention, the way the editors struggled for new adjectives did sometimes make me laugh:&#34;a vast, hearty body, notes of blue and a hint of graphite steel&#34;&#34;a radiance similar to the sun at dawn, a strong body, notes of orange&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Two scientific points to bring up about this article:1. When the author talks about Coke vs. Pepsi, he comes to the conclusion that the reason people prefer Pepsi in blind taste tests but Coke in unblinded ones is &#34;Think of it as the brain combining two sources of input to make a final taste perception: the actual taste of the two sodas and a preconceived notion (probably based on great marketing) that Coke should taste better.&#34; I&#39;ve read elsewhere, though, that the reason for this difference is actually because of the difference between &#34;sip tests&#34; vs. &#34;drinking tests&#34;. Pepsi is objectively sweeter than Coke, so if you&#39;re just taking a few quick sips (as most taste tests are set up), you may prefer the sweeter taste of Pepsi because it stands out more, but if you&#39;re drinking a whole bunch, the sweeter taste of Pepsi can feel cloying.2. The article includes this quote, &#34;the correlation between price and overall rating is small and negative, suggesting that individuals on average enjoy more expensive wines slightly less.&#34; I wonder if this could be due to Berkon&#39;s paradox, a statistical paradox that was on the HN front page yesterday, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33677781. After all, I&#39;m guessing most truly bad wines may not be rated at all."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My wife and I use Briar for household communication because of subsidiarity rather than any direct privacy concerns. Out of all the messenger projects that we&#39;ve tried, Briar actually works for local communication. It&#39;s actually instant messaging without any client hiccups or latency (looking at you, Signal). We&#39;ve tried a ton of other options, but we keep ending up back at Briar.There are points of UX friction in the name of good opsec that are inconvenient but totally understandable given the project goals. The big ones being that you have to manually login after any reboots and notifications are intentionally sparse, so good luck using a smartwatch for reading or replying. Otherwise, the forums and blogs are great for managing household projects, IM is a dream, and as a bonus, anyone willing to install and use it probably has a large enough values overlap that we can use it as a social pre-filter for close friends.The only other option that has come even remotely close to being as functional as Briar is DeltaChat. The only issue that stops us from using DeltaChat (or email in general) is that we both have email hosting in Europe while we live in the US, so neither of us, being frugal in principal, wants to send information to Europe and back in order to tell the person 100 ft away to come help bring in the groceries."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just wanna say this app saved my family and I when we went on a cruise. Normally, we would had had to pay to use the chat service via the ship&#39;s paid-only Wi-Fi (since we get no phone reception on the seas). Without needing to pay for the Wi-Fi, we were all able to use Briar to communicate whilst connected to the network, which made coordinating and finding each other on the ship way easier. It was great and worked really well. So thanks, Briar!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t know if I have ADHD, but if I do an online survey it says I most probably definitely do. I was never diagnosed as a child because I largely functioned as a kid and was quiet and non-disruptive, but looking back the signs were all there.Fast forward as an adult I have a number of coping mechanisms and one of them is to have something on in the background. I have never associated the effectiveness with the noise itself, but rather with something that is keeping part of my brain quiet. It prevents my mind from wandering. It is ideally something I already know. Like a show I have seen before or a podcast that I am okay not fully retaining. Not enough stimulation and I get distracted easily, too much stimulation and I shut down completely. Music doesn&#39;t usually work for me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have ADHD and I straight-up don&#39;t do silence. Between restless brain and tinnitus, actual silence, or anything with a noise floor below ~15dB, just doesn&#39;t sit right with me. 20-30dB is about ideal. Especially when trying to sleep. I have some sort of fan/filter in just about every room. When I&#39;m working, I&#39;m almost always listening to music (unless I&#39;m way over stimulated).It probably started when I was much younger with much worse asthma and always had a HEPA filter running in the background. Eventually this turned into basically always having some kind of fan in my primary locations. Right now I dig the Coway air filters on low or medium.Even beyond the alleged &#34;noise floor dopamine boost&#34;, I find some kind of background whoosh really nice for masking otherwise variable sounds, such as cars, airplanes, and the wind, which are far more distracting.10/10 would recommend running some sort of air filter all the time. Plus, cleaner air (air pollution has all kinds of bad effects)."</p>

(Archived because the original site is quite slow: http://retiary.org/ls/programs.html)It was written by Laurie Spiegel, a composer and early pioneer in electronic music.&gt; Music Mouse is an algorithmic musical composition software developed by Laurie Spiegel. The &#34;intelligent instrument&#34; name refers to the program&#39;s built-in knowledge of chord and scale convention and stylistic constraints. Automating these processes allows the user to focus on other aspects of the music in real time.&gt; In addition to improvisations using this software, Spiegel composed several works for &#34;Music Mouse&#34;, including Cavis muris in 1986, Three Sonic Spaces in 1989, and Sound Zones in 1990.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"By total chance, this revealed a flaw with my mouse that&#39;s been haunting me for months.My right mouse button intermittently doesn&#39;t bring up context menus, which I seemingly confirmed by recording the screen and visualizing click events in a presentation mode. It would show what looked like one right click, but no context menu, or a context menu that appeared and was immediately dismissed.But this revealed that it&#39;s actually rapidly sending multiple logical clicks per physical click. The logical clicks are fast enough that the screen recordings didn&#39;t differentiate them as separate events - which sent me in the wrong direction, making me think the OS was disregarding clicks. But here, the multiple clicks are clearly audible.So thanks!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think people&#39;s expectations became so exaggerated it was inevitable they wouldn&#39;t be lived up to.  I&#39;m sure Twitter will experience degradation from the drastic cost-cutting, but it was never going to happen overnight and I&#39;m not sure why news outlets were saying that (except that their sources were employees with slightly inflated senses of their own importance, which we&#39;re all sometimes guilty of).  And people became really invested in the idea that a site cannot possibly stay up without dedicated SREs, as though tons of tech sites (including big names like Amazon) don&#39;t just devolve this work to their on-call rotations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a pattern of diverging expectations here, one is the non-technical/naïve one,    - Twitter is going to go down tomorrow and it&#39;s all over. RIP.

The second is,    - Twitter is going to experience a failure cascade over time.

The third is,    - It&#39;s all going to be fine.

I suspect that the real question is, how many individual wires can break before the cable holding the suspended platform snaps?I am not that good of a developer, but watching Twitter I can&#39;t help but be reminded of Arecibo, except at a larger, more abstract scale. There was no single massive event that caused the failure, rather a series of factors and events, tiny cables breaking that eventually leads to a failure cascade that then causes the suspended platform to crash.From what I can tell, in the past week or so,    - Twitter&#39;s copyright system failed

    - Two Factor Authentication broke down (it seems to be back up?)

    - (anecdata) Tweets have been loading sporadically for me and other people, sometimes we try to open a tweet and it says that it doesn&#39;t exist. Happens more frequently with new/recent tweets.

    - (unconfirmed) Twitter&#39;s managed account backend is behaving &#34;strangely.&#34; For e.g., &#34;One of my campaign managers logged in last week and found all our paused creatives from the past 6 years had been reactivated.&#34; from https://www.teamblind.com/post/i-told-my-team-to-pause-our-750kmonth-twitter-ads-budget-last-week-4dnbo1Ft ———— Friends have told me other similar stories

Are these failures symptomatic of a larger problem, or are they well-isolated parts misbehaving? Can Twitter even experience a failure cascade like Arecibo? Can that be paused/stopped?I am asking this question because I don&#39;t know. And I&#39;d like to develop a better mental model to understand what happens next."</p>
