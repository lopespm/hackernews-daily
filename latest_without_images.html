He _tricked_ her into taking them by making it sound like he just wanted her to hold them for him. She was actually being kind to him by doing him a favor, and then he basically ran away and stuck her with them. That&#39;s not kind at all, it&#39;s pushy and exploitative. As someone who doesn&#39;t usually like to accept gifts from random strangers, I&#39;d be really put off and uncomfortable; and that&#39;s before taking into consideration the fact that it was filmed and put online for people to gawk at."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The reason this act breaks a moral boundary is that it subverts a
principle of &#34;ends&#34; [1]. A genuine random act of kindness cannot occur
if it&#39;s being filmed.  Filming the act turns it into a virtue
display. It also turns the subject into an object of utility, a means
and not and end in themself.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Ends"</p>

Truly I tell you, they already have their full reward. But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your giving may be in secret. And your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.&#34; Matthew 6"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Man, not putting Fully Qualified Domain Names in code has been such a recurring source of pain in my software life. You make so many assumptions about the way people parse domain names and all of them are wrong. Vendors do all kinds of things to &#34;simplify&#34; their workflows internally and sometimes they just parse URLs and domains in all kinds of ways that break your brain.Reminds me so much of the way &#34;smart&#34; telecom engineers bastardized SS7 to ship new features onto legacy telco infrastructure. SS7 is like 20M lines of C. You can&#39;t really change it without breaking it in many other places, AT&amp;T used to have a metric which was something like &#34;for every 10 lines of code you alter in SS7, you create 8 bugs in other parts of the code.&#34; So &#34;smart&#34; telecom engineers would take existing fields in the SS7 logic and use them for different functions inside of their telco. A billing field could instead be used as a feature flag for some sort of customer state, but only inside of the telco&#39;s network (and re-written back to the compliant SS7 standard when the data was headed out of the network). This was called encapsulation and wrapping and un-wrapping packets just in time was the source of many many problems in my telecom life.Just in time editing of network packets at the boundary is always fun. Most of the problems that would happen would come from forgetting to rewrite back to SS7 and transmitting the internal codes out."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Thanks Justine, you&#39;re doing the Lord&#39;s work here.One of the best introductions I&#39;ve seen to pledge() is Kristaps Dzonson&#39;s writeup on it that you can find here [1]. The whole website in general is furthermore a guide on how to write webapps in C, which may sound like a crazy idea to some people who have written it off as everything from an elaborate joke to a security nightmare that nobody should ever consider doing [2], but for people like me who end up having to write that kind of code in constrained execution environments it&#39;s been extremely enlightening and I really appreciate knowing how to do it more securely. If pledge is something I can access in Linux it really helps me out for things in the future going forward, I hope to create some cool things with it![1] https://learnbchs.org/pledge.html[2] https://learnbchs.org/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oh god yes please. If pledge() makes it into the mainline kernel, we OpenBSD-type people seem less weird when submitting patches for some syscall &#34;nobody uses&#34;.Many OpenBSD ports contain pledge() support. Steal all you can. OpenBSD does &#34;hoisting&#34; in many userland programs, meaning all the open calls and such take place at the very start but isn&#39;t actually parsed until after we have locked ourselves in with pledge() and unveil(). I hope this also means many non-base programs are redesigned in this manner."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hi jart,I noticed that you&#39;re missing the sendfd promise. Is there a reason for that omission? Also you&#39;ve added a number of extensions that perhaps should be documented as such.Also there&#39;s a pretty significant undocumented difference between your implementation and OpenBSD, in that promises are by inherited across exec in yours, and not on OpenBSD.OpenBSD experimented with that by specifying the second argument as execpromises, but discovered that it was extremely difficult if not impossible to write meaningful execpromises in the parent for potentially unrelated programs, it&#39;s also happening too early before dynamic linking, and before the program has had an opportunity to &#34;initialize&#34; or &#34;do privileged stuff&#34; and call pledge(2) later itself with more accurate knowledge of what to self-restrict. As such, no calls with execpromises set to anything but NULL/0 exist today. I&#39;m curious how to reconcile those differences."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"About a decade ago, I briefly worked for a company with the same business model. Since most Windows installers require Administrator privileges, the DLLs that they side-load will inherit these elevated privileges and can scan the user&#39;s machine for anything they are interested in.The way this software worked (as far as I can recall): The installer bundled a DLL from which only a few minor functions were exposed to display offers within the host process. Usually, the only thing the client portion of this DLL needed was a HWND. During initialization, the DLL stored a copy of itself in the user&#39;s temp directory. The host application unknowingly then used rundll32 to load this copy as a separate (also elevated) process. This process would run at least as long as the calling process would. Once in place, the process would scan the user&#39;s computer for specific use patterns (geoinformation; MS Office presence; what language; etc.). In order to retrieve the latest advertising &#34;offers&#34;, the DLL called home with this information over a secure pipe and checked for updates. This data was stored and referenced if the same user invoked the DLL again at some point. Only at this point would any actual targeted ads be displayed in the client application&#39;s window.Things may have changed since then - these were the pre-Windows 10 days - but if it&#39;s anything like this, it&#39;s wise to avoid the Unity installer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"All of this makes me ask the question of, &#34;How does a company go public without losing themselves? Is that even possible?&#34;This type of going public and chasing shareholder, share selling, cash infusion (sorry for the word salad, I couldn&#39;t think of a better way to put it) - which is often needed for growth past a certain point - how does a company not compromise their vision and bow to the shareholders once they go public, when their directive then becomes &#34;Maximize stock value for the shareholders&#34;?NOTE: I&#39;m an engineer who graduated with an art degree, so this is way out of my wheel house. I&#39;ve always built things, and have not been privy to the business side of the show. It&#39;s a bit foreign to me."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It looks like there may be a typo with the estimated year of deployment in Ontario: the estimate is likely for 2028, not 2018.The article was published on July 11, 2022, but opens with: &#34;Saskatchewan and Ontario have each chosen GE-Hitachi as the supplier of small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs), which could be deployed in the Prairie province by the 2030s and in Ontario by 2018.&#34; Then, the article concludes with: &#34;GEH and Ontario plan to construct up to four 300 MWe small module reactors, with the first coming online by 2028.&#34;A separate source by The Canadian Press [0] also reflects an estimate of 2028 for Ontario: &#34;The governments of Ontario, Saskatchewan, New Brunswick and Alberta have put forward a nuclear plan that they say will transition them toward cleaner energy. The provinces’ energy ministers agreed today to a joint plan for small modular reactors, with the first 300-megawatt plant to be built in Darlington, Ont., by 2028.&#34;[0] https://financialpost.com/commodities/energy/renewables/onta..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think it&#39;s worth pointing out that nuclear is pretty well loved in Ontario. Around 2/3 of our energy is coming from it already.https://www.ieso.ca/power-dataNuclear is the base load, alternatives supply what they can, and hydroelectric dams and gas plants act as the variable load supply.If we can just lose the gas plants, we&#39;d be pretty close to zero carbon. And I think that achievable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They looked at the price tags of these reactors vs solar and wind, and chose the lowest number, fine.  But I&#39;ve never heard of a nuclear project coming in at under multiple times its original estimate, and taking a decade or more longer than expected.    Has any new nuclear power come online anywhere since Fukushima?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had a very nasty case of insomnia 7 years ago. Without going into details of my associated illness, I went 2-3 months with almost no sleep due to hypnic jerks/sleep starts. When I told people I couldn&#39;t sleep, they assumed I just had difficulty falling asleep, but I literally could not fall asleep. It is terrifying. For whatever reason, whenever I miss a significant amount of sleep (one or two nights) I get very bad sleep jerks to the point I would start to fall asleep 30+ times a night and then wake back up immediately. The only two ways past it I found was a benzo sleeping pill or alcohol and both were hit and miss (just to inhibit the jerks - I had no problem starting to actually fall asleep). Even then, my body seems to build up massive adrenaline after sleep deprivation, so I would wake up 1-2 hours later in a cold sweat and have to start all over. The more sleep I miss, the worse it gets, and after you miss several nights in a row you get VERY &#34;sleep anxious&#34;, and so the cycle continues. Once I&#39;m caught up, I&#39;m fine and the jerks disappear completely, but it takes a while. I just had another case of the jerks this year for the first time since then but I was able to get over it in about 3 weeks this time. Still, it freaked me out as I had considered myself past that and had gotten a little bit careless.The point of this long winded intro: Don&#39;t take sleep for granted. If you sleep well, cherish it. Ever since this time I keep immaculate sleep hygiene. I go to bed on time, at the same time, get daily sunlight, don&#39;t eat before bed, and 9/10 times I&#39;m asleep in minutes and sleep great. I still have occasional early wake insomnia, but for the most part sleep well.Occasionally I think about things like mentioned in this article and what the long term effects will be, but mostly I just don&#39;t worry about it. There isn&#39;t anything I can do about it at this point except try to sleep as best I can from this point forward."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like no one read the entire article, and it&#39;s partially the fault of traditional newspaper writing style for sticking the juiciest stuff up from, but the article concludes there&#39;s no consensus on what chronic sleep deprivation does to humans.&gt; Nevertheless, many scientists said that the new research should not be cause for panic. “It is possible that sleep deprivation damages rat and mouse brains, but that doesn’t mean that you should get stressed about not getting enough sleep,” said Jerome Siegel, a sleep scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who did not contribute to the review.&gt; Dr. Siegel noted that neural injury comes in degrees, and that the extent of sleep deprivation’s effect on the human brain is still largely unknown. He also expressed concern that undue worry about the long-term effects of sleep deprivation could lead people to try to sleep more, unnecessarily and with medication.The opinion of a single review paper on effects in mice is not conclusive science. So, in other words, there&#39;s no news here."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As much as I&#39;d like to use Godot, there are two features missing that I really don&#39;t think I could do without:- Asset store. I totally get it, handling payments, curating, etc. are a huge task... but man, I&#39;m a coder, and I don&#39;t have the funds to pay an artist or a musician full time. Being able to just go buy a pack of trees for $20 or something is a huge timer saver.- Animation re-targeting. It seems like there&#39;s a 3rd party plugin for this but it also seems like it hasn&#39;t been updated in a year. In unity I can buy a big pack of animations for pretty cheap and reuse it on almost all my humanoid characters. That&#39;s huge. I think this can be done in Blender or Maya, but it&#39;s so seamless in the engine compared to using a 3rd party tool."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"With 4.0 getting more and more advanced features [0] and Unity merging with an Ad company [1], Godot is looking like it could be an attractive proposition for a lot of Unity shops.[0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32003065[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32081051"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been using Godot for hobby projects on-and-off for a while now, and overall I vastly prefer it to Unity. The scene hierarchy of Godot is a better mental model (for me) than the GameObject/MonoBehavior ever was.That said, I have a _few_ items that I think are absolute showstoppers for solo-dev side projects.1. The asset pipeline is simply not as clean as Unity&#39;s. The ability to drop a .blend file in the project in Unity is so underrated. In Godot FBX imports are unreliable, texture imports misbehave frequently, and rigging goes wrong even in the recommended file formats. There&#39;s a lot less clarity around the path to getting real assets in game, which can be a major pain point for solo devs.2. Along the same lines, there is no equivalent of Unity&#39;s mecanim. With Unity, if you can model and rig a character in Blender, you can pull free mocap or other animations from the asset store and get to work. In Godot you&#39;re still best off authoring your own animations for each character. This drastically increases the amount of time spent making assets.3. Godot is in a weird spot version wise for anyone who wants to use C#; the beta version of 4.0 is rapidly approaching, and guarantees to break any project you start in 3.x --- but 4.0 still doesn&#39;t come built with C# support. Hopefully this gets resolved soon."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Love this idea. I also thing there is a great use case here for people in sales, customer support / onboarding. Listening as a skill is very important for roles like this, and anything that can help people be a bit more conscious about this is great.A top bar icon for this could also be useful, so not to take up too my screen real estate, e.g. for example if you are giving a sales demo, you may want to hide the application, but still see visually how you are doing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hey there, great app.By way of feedback:* The play icon with the strike through is not meaningful to me. I recommend a popover on hover to explain what this means. You probably thought about a log of different icons but might be worth polling for a few or letting the user pick one of a few a preference (At first I thought it &#34;wasn&#39;t working&#34;)* It would be nice to be able to add meta to the session, i.e. &#34;1:1 with joseph&#34; that automatically gets timestamped for start and end. Then be able to show the graphs from a day of meetings stacked.* Analysis would be good. Being able to say how many others are in the meeting so it makes more sense when there are longer gaps.* Someone mentioned additional recommendations, that would be awesome if it had a guidance mode where I could fit a template over this thing and have it help keep the meeting on track. 5 mins introductions / waiting for quorum, 5 mins agenda, 10 mins topic 1 etc.I realize the idea for this is to be a simple private app and its great at that. If necessary, I&#39;d suggest offering something more complex that might require greater buy in privacy wise so it can do more.I&#39;d still recommend requiring zero network requests as you&#39;ve done on this version, even though the analytics might be useful.I use an network filter and manually allow connections from apps.Starting with this high level of privacy is how you get someone like me to be comfortable allowing your app to run on my machine."</p>
