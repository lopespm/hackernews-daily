								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I worked on a J2ME app that needed to access location on phones without GPS, I was in touch with the operator and got a list of cell ids with lat, lon.With that I created a daemon in Symbian that would query the cell id and open up a socket server to give it to the J2ME app.With that we developed an app to request a taxi service, but none of the taxi companies wanted it. Some of the complaints were:1. GPRS data plans were too expensive for end users
2. No one would put an expensive Sony Ericsson touch phone on a windshield, the windshield would be broken by thieves to steal it.
3. Looking at a screen on the windshield while driving was never going to be approved by authorities."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oh man, do I have fond memories of developing on feature phones!Started wayyy back in 2007, and was a cofounder of a startup that made popular J2ME games available for free to people by wrapping it in our proprietary ad serving software. We launched more or less the same time that AbMob did, invented more or less the same stack (ad delivery to mobile phones), but we focussed on the product (games) whereas they focussed on the platform (ad delivery). A few years later AdMob was acquired for mega $$$ by Google, whereas we just kind of limped along and died a slow, natural death! Many years later I discovered that my cofounder just let our 4 letter domain expire (www.hovr.com) and I think it&#39;s up for sale now :(Also remember developing games on the BREW platform by Qualcomm, circa 2005. Whereas I was in India which mostly had GSM J2ME phones, BREW was much more popular on North American CDMA handsets. I, along with a friend, developed one of the first real-time multiplayer games called Blingster Battle, which was on top of Verizon&#39;s charts for a brief period of time! Truly groundbreaking stuff at that time..The most amazing bit, though, was when we made some BREW apps around 2013. By then iOS and Android had firmly taken over the smartphone market, and all the cool kids were downloading apps/games on them. However there was a very significant portion of the market - primarily composed of the elderly - who were still hanging on to their old CDMA feature phones and were still interested in buying new apps. We made a couple of quiz types games, that actually generated a couple of thousand dollars in revenue every month till last year, until Qualcomm finally pulled the plug on BREW!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked at a startup, Javaground [1], where we ported and developed games for J2ME phones.  We had a room full of dressers full of all the different mobile phones of the day.Each phone had different implementation quirks, such as variable audio delay when playing a file, audio/image formats that were faster/slower, odd button events (some used press, some used ondown, some had no ondown, etc).  A lot of our work was learning all of these quirks and implementing them into the automated porting platform.Then the iPhone came out and started to build momentum.I still have my old flip phone, the one with the least quirks, with some of our games on it.1: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javaground"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"That is one hell of a comprehensive article. I wonder how much impact would such extreme optimizations on a real-world application, which for example does DB queries.This experiment feels similar to people who buy old cars and remove everything from the inside except the engine, which they tune up so that the car runs faster :)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Disabling [spectre] mitigations gives us a performance boost of around 28%Every couple months these last several years there always seems to be some bug where the fix only costs us 3% performance. Since those tiny performance hits add up over time, security is sort of like inflation in the compute economy. What I want to know is how high can we make that 28% go? The author could likely build a custom kernel that turns off stuff like pie, aslr, retpoline, etc. which would likely yield another 10%. Can anyone think of anything else?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d love to use a lighter  (in terms of resources) editor like this, but after using IDEA (not for java - but it&#39;s the single Jetbrains tool that supports all other language packs) the editor in this feels like comparing a car to a bicycle.Sure, the bicycle starts off quicker, and you feel so much quicker.But that&#39;s where the benefits end, IMO. I just opened up a client project with this (that project is a mixture of php, sql, shell, and some client side browser code).The symbol recognition compared to IDEA was pretty abysmal. Then I thought maybe I need to try the other way (i.e. find a usage of a symbol manually and then try to resolve it back to its definition).That the find-in-files results are just another text view with paths in there is probably appealing to some people... me I&#39;d rather you just let me open the file."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel bad using VSCode after years of supporting Sublime (by purchasing a license). However the one case where I do use sublime repeatedly? When I need to open an editor QUICKLY. It boots faster than VSCode, and frankly, it finally broke me of my constant habit of VIMming now that I have it on my mac, win and linux boxes. I am eager to try V4, but I&#39;m so deep in VSCode now, I don&#39;t know if I can find my way out! I can even cross compile C and debug in VSCode!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s very odd, I use to use Instagram and it would make me depressed. IDK how to explain, I don&#39;t even have any friends on there I follow. Just something about seeing everyone at their best 100% of the time, doing amazing things 100% of the time, never facing adversity 100% of the time.I know it&#39;s not realistic but it still gets to your head.I uninstalled it from my phone I feel better about myself after a few weeks.I&#39;m guessing most of, if not all, social media is the same. I&#39;m slowly trying to ween myself off but it is so meticulously addictive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Note that Facebook does not have the choice to agree. To do so would be to open Facebook to unimaginable legal liability. So Facebook&#39;s opinion in the matter is moot. There are practically no inputs to this function that will change its behavior."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; &#34;The correlational evidence showing that there is a link between social media use and depression is pretty definitive at this point,&#34; said Jean Twenge, a psychology professor at San Diego State University. &#34;The largest and most well-conducted studies that we have all show that teens who spend more time on social media are more likely to be depressed or unhappy.&#34;&gt; Correlation is not causation, and one area of further study is whether greater social media usage leads to poor mental health outcomes or whether those who are depressed and unhappy are drawn to spend more time on social media.These are correlational studies. They aren&#39;t saying that they have evidence that Facebook causes depression. They&#39;re saying that increased social media usage is correlated with depression.Stepping back, it appears that screen time is correlated with depressive symptoms, with or without social media. One such study: Association between screen time and depression among US adults https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5574844/ This includes watching TV or simply using a computer for leisure of any sort.I know Facebook is a popular villain, but we shouldn&#39;t be jumping to conclusions that this data means Facebook causes depression or that Facebook is uniquely worse than other forms of screen time in its correlation with depression."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Material goods:Ear plugs (silicone). Don&#39;t waste your money on noise-cancelling headphones, I have $200 ones and they don&#39;t compare to simple ear plugs. If you live in a moderately noisy area and you want peace and quiet, get them. They basically just make everything quiet. 24 from CVS = $10.OpenMove by Aftershokz - Bone-conduction headphones. Perfect for running and just good for listening to music. They work, they&#39;re way easier to wear and more comfortable than earpods, I haven&#39;t had any issues since I got them about 8-months ago. Plus, you can wear them with earplugs for music + noise cancellation. $99Cast iron skillet. This is more of a personal preference. I hate getting new kitchenware and then worrying about breaking it or getting it all stained. But these are super easy to clean and AFAIK practically never wear out. Also very cheap (iirc $15).Software:JetBrains tools. Basically the only software I can imagine spending $250 a year on, and it actually being worth it.Patreon and Github sponsors. Not much (I think $15 a month total). It&#39;s sad how few sponsors a lot of these projects have. I&#39;m not rich, but I can afford donating $5/month here and there. I really think the world would be a better place if more people donate to open source and content creators they like."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unlikely to get upvoted here but a used Porsche Panamera with an extended bumper-to-bumper manufacturer warranty.  As Doug Demuro says it&#39;s cheap, really cheap.There&#39;s not a single brand new car costing, say, 75 K EUR or less that I&#39;d have rather than that because the quality simply ain&#39;t there.The ride comfort, soundsystem, sound insulation, interior quality, how it drives superbly (and can yet be used for some spirited drive if you fancy that), etc.Best car I ever had. Next one is going to be another used Panamera, probably the plug-in hybrid. I tried the Porsche Taycan (their 100% EV) and it&#39;s amazing but I&#39;ll wait a bit until you can find used ones at bargain prices.I&#39;m a big fan of Tesla but, to me, the build quality simply ain&#39;t anywhere close: as in... It&#39;s not even remotely comparable. They are worlds apart. And as I don&#39;t rice at the greenlight, I don&#39;t care about the 0-60 perfs.There&#39;s nothing better to cruise at 110 mph on the autobahn or to go pick up the kid at school.It&#39;s high-end luxury with quality materials for less than the price of a new Camry.https://youtu.be/EAezax2ugQUBy very far my favorite purchase of the last two years+."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Airpods Pro.Not traditionally an apple guy so didn&#39;t expect to like them, but the guy talked us into them while we were upgrading my wife&#39;s phone.Wow. These things are just way better than any other earbuds and so much more convenient and comfortable than headphones. The Bluetooth just works even when switching between my Android and MacBook. The noise cancelling is great as well, way better than my Sennheisers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My company is moving away from it. We built a few services but after a few years some of the original people that introduced it left the company and it became very difficult to hire for. New hires were either people wanting to learn (so we had to spend a good bunch of resources into teaching + end up with a system built by noobs to the language) or very expensive developers with a lot of experience in erlang and elixir.We also found many times missing libraries, or found libraries which are incomplete, or unmaintained or just not well documented. Just compare the total amount of libraries in Hex, vs the total amount of libraries in rubygems. Somebody will say &#34;but Elixir libraries are higher quality so we need less, etc,etc&#34; as if there were not good developers in the ruby world and every elixir developer were a rockstar.Tooling is just terrible. The VSCode plugin is crap, kills the CPU unless you disable features. There is no IDE from jetbrains. There is a plugin but last time I tried it, it was even worse than the VSCode plugin.Also, I&#39;ve read some comments where people mention &#34;we don&#39;t need redis&#34;, &#34;we don&#39;t need workers&#34; everything is so much easier. That was our thinking at first. But then you realize on deployments you will lose your cache, or your background jobs, etc. So you have to persist them either in mnesia or in the database. At that point you&#39;re just reinventing your crappy undocumented and untested version of delayed_job.Most of what you get from elixir in terms of redundancy, high availability, etc you can have that anyway from kubernetes, heroku or any PaaS.... you will need more than 1 server anyway, so...Liveview sounds amazing until you try to use it in the real world. The most minimum latency kills the experience.In the end, we are back to Rails and much happier. Specially now we are using all the hotwire stuff. Not fancy, and not fashionable though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m at a relatively early stage VC-backed startup and from day 1 it&#39;s been written in Elixir. It was a fantastic choice, for many reasons, with some being:- Elixir is good for just getting stuff done. I came from a previous startup that used Go and Elm.- The community isn&#39;t as small as people make it out to be, or, it&#39;s quality over quantity. ;)- There&#39;s a lot of good modules out there, and if you need to write your own, it&#39;s easy and there&#39;s well-defined patterns. E.g. I recently improved our internal Zendesk client and it was a breeze.- https://dashbit.co/ for paid support/advice is amazing.- The console for experimentation, debugging, inspection, etc. is fantastic.- The let it crash, and other Elixir/Erlang philosophies, have been very helpful.- There&#39;s a solid amount of batteries-included, but not in an overbearing/restrictive way.- It&#39;s such a pleasant day-to-day dev experience.I didn&#39;t know Elixir before joining this startup. For myself, and workmates who also didn&#39;t have prior experience, it&#39;s been a breeze to get up to speed in."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s not argument &#34;against&#34; selecting it (it&#39;s a free world, and mileage vary), but a couple of scar-earned advice:- Be careful about libraries. If you know that your system has to interact with X, don&#39;t assume that there is a running, idiomatic, maintained libary for X on `hex.pm`.
Do a bit of due diligence. 
We had experience ranging from `meeh` (oauth2, graphql, http) to `pretty bad` (mqtt, swagger.)But as other say, if you&#39;re doing vanilla Phoenix/Plug/Ecto with exactly the right kind of DB, you&#39;ll should be ok.- Give a little though about how you&#39;ll be deploying and operating. `releases` and `configuration` haved changed in pretty big ways in the past (https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2019/06/24/elixir-v1-9-0-releas...), the ecosystem is constantly in flux (`config.exs` vs `Application.get_env` vs ENV_VAR vs..) . Plus, the erlang virtual machine (BEAM) has knobs that are not always easy to play with. And if you hide it behind, say, docker containers, you&#39;ll have other troubles. Don&#39;t expect an `heroku do-some-magic` experience.- Unless you&#39;re familiar with the Actor Model already, and your application is very simple, expect a learning curve made of:  1. A period where you&#39;re afraid of GenServer and fail to do anything because you don&#39;t want to create a supervision tree
  2. A period where you think you&#39;ve understood GenServers and you create GenServers like crazy
  3. A sobering period where you don&#39;t understand anything about your application
  4. A couple of refactorings where you move the pendulum until you reach something that&#39;s acceptable

- Finally, you&#39;re coming from RoR, so you&#39;re probably fine with not having static types anyway ; may St Isidore help you ;)  There is a thing called `dialyxir`. It might help a bit ; It will disappoint a lot."</p>

For example, being able the use the watch one-handed is great if your other hand is occupied, like carrying something.(The reason I still wear a watch at all is so I can see the time without having to dig the phone out of my pocket and turn it on, which is hopeless while driving.)Just like although I can hear, I use closed-captioning when I don&#39;t wish to disturb others, or when watching a show at high speed (I can read faster than I can understand speech)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Everyday sounds can be distracting, discomforting, or overwhelming, and in support of neurodiversity, Apple is introducing new background sounds to help minimize distractions and help users focus, stay calm, or rest. Balanced, bright, or dark noise, as well as ocean, rain, or stream sounds continuously play in the background to mask unwanted environmental or external noise, and the sounds mix into or duck under other audio and system sounds.Wow, I never thought of background sounds as something connected to neurodiversity, but TIL.I definitely never expected Apple to get into the business of white noise apps, but here they are.I wonder what the quality of these sounds will be, how long they&#39;ll loop for? And if all the background noise apps that already exist will continue to operate as they do now, or if they&#39;ll be able to integrate with this in order to take advantage of the new mixing/ducking features."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My money doesn&#39;t seem to fit in any of the slots on my computer...Apple just keeps knocking it out of the park and into a completely new sports metaphor assistive technology provision, they really do. Any measure, I&#39;m a massive nerd/geek/hacker and I really have looked into alternatives both in the open source and proprietary basis and nobody at all is assistive technology as well as at all right now.It really is as simple as whenever I have a new iShiny, I pounds on the nearest able-bodied monkey and get them to take total box and connected to Wi-Fi and then it&#39;s all me. From then on I don&#39;t need any more able-bodied assistance whatsoever with setting up the new device, it&#39;s awesome. And whilst it&#39;s been a few months, the last time I looked known of the other major players were able to come anywhere close to this level of frictionless setup for quadriplegics like me.ALSO! ALSO! Let&#39;s not forget that this isn&#39;t some crappy subset of functions that quadriplegics have to settle for whilst everybody else gets the full fat version of the software. Nope, with very few exceptions pretty much anything an able-bodied person can do with their iShiny I&#39;ll be able to do as well. Just a little slower.Apple, and specifically their approach to accessibility is only one of many reasons I&#39;m able to work, see my family and generally engage with society as well as I currently do.Also, I quite like the term cripple, differently abled or on a good day Stuart. WTF cares what label you give me, I am much more interested in whether this laptop enables me to do the shopping independently and see my Nieces without having to check with an able-bodied person first."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Several versions ago Jose talked about how Elixir is basically &#34;done&#34;, which is so refreshing these days!But since then, the developer experience has improved by leaps and bounds through all these improvements other than the core language. As a professional Elixir developer for the last 4 years, I&#39;m loving it. A few improvements in the last few versions off the top of my head that have been really nice:* Robust, timezone handling DateTime support in the standard library. I don&#39;t need Timex anymore!* Finally a good approach for configuring applications ar run time (e.g. with ENV vars), that works for dev, test, prod and releases, via config/runtime.exs.* Better compiler warnings verging on a little &#34;light&#34; type checking* Mix.install in this release finally makes Elixir work well for one-off little scripts, since you can just throw a Mix.install([:jason, :mojito]) on top.* LiveView is amazing, and I now keep open a LiveBook notebook for doodling in code, exploring an API, CSV, etc* Not really Elixir, but I&#39;m jazzed about Erlang/OTP 24 JIT support for better performance.Basically, if you took a look at Elixir a few years ago and thought it wasn&#39;t ready, might be worth another peek now."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As an outside observer, who has no crypto holdings at all, but is very deeply invested in the public stock market with a heavy weight on technology stocks... this doesn&#39;t look like a crash to me at all. It just looks like some steam being let off and old investors cash out and new investors get more comfortable with how much and where to invest.I consider crypto currency as it is to be an elaborate Ponzi scheme (personal view), but even with that cynicism nothing about this dip looks unhealthy to me. (I have views on what ultimately happens, but I will hold back on that)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Bitcoin is the ultimate, purely financial object. It has no revenues or profits. The supply is fixed -- unlike, say, gold, where high prices mean people will eventually start digging mines, BTC supply is entirely price-inelastic. The only thing that determines BTC price is demand. And over the past 13 years, we&#39;ve seen reflexivity at work: The price has gone up, so more people want it, so the price goes up further, and on and on.There&#39;s no reason this can&#39;t happen in reverse. As in previous crashes, once the price starts going down, more people want to sell.Really just an interestingly pure experiment in group psychology."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We are living in a culture of overwork because work (esp. desk work) has lost all boundaries.I&#39;m in academia and had been idealizing overwork for quite a while (&#34;the noble goal of devoting your life to science!&#34;), but now have to fend off becoming cynical about the culture (increasingly after a parent with a blue collar-company died shortly before their well-earned retirement, stress played a role here).I have met various of these types, obviously not all scientists are like this, but they seem to become more frequent the more one raises up the ladder:* spending years in an excitingly different foreign country.. on a desk, experiencing little of what the country has to offer (think spending 10 years in California but never visiting Yosemite or the Grand Ganyon), sometimes condescending when told about travel experiences in the same country* working up to the point where they appear to be in psychological pain and lost authentic interest* complete tunnel vision about work* abusive behaviour because of stress* talking suicide in project meetings* continuous smart drug usage* lunch with them is usually cynical, edgy and negative* regret that they&#39;ve lost their 20s to academic workAcademically, these are often quite successful people whose ideas and scientific results are admired. I&#39;d like to stay in academia but fear I will be erased from the system if I don&#39;t pay the same price. Is this view too negative? Can someone offer a different perspective here?Could some older users share their (anecdotal) experiences and perspective on this topic? How did continuous heavy overwork pay off for people you have observed (or yourself)? Is this just temporary and can be overcome by smarter decisions about where to allocate energy?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I would differentiate between “working” and “sitting in the office”. My grandfather was a passionate carpenter. His workweek was always at least 60 hours. Sourcing wood, visiting clients, organizing everything, etc. He was in good shape and died at 92 years age. Being forced to sit in the office 45 hours a week I don’t think that I reach age above 60 years. This sitting whole day in the noisy environment was destroying my health. Luckily pandemic came and I was able to work from home."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My well-being, expectedly, increased when I stopped caring more about my projects than my clients did. What I was not expecting is that my quality of work remained constant or even improved while I was working fewer hours a day."</p>
