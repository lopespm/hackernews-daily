								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Working in IT/tech for school district is the worst. My experience from many years ago - around 2002, I think:1. First day on the job, email to boss: &#34;Hey, the computer lab at Springfield High has a ton of known security flaws that are begging to be exploited.&#34;2. Reply, 1 week later: &#34;Sorry, we don&#39;t have any money for that. Just keep everything up-and-running.&#34;3. 3 weeks later the computer lab at Springfield High got &#34;hacked&#34;. All the computers displayed a popup window that said, &#34;Miss Krabappel is a dyke!&#34; (sorry for the offensive language)4. Next day, email from boss: &#34;The computer lab at Springfield High was hacked! Figure out how to fix this and make sure it doesn&#39;t happen again!&#34;5. A few days later Miss Krabappel filed to sue the school district. The local newspaper picked up the story.6. Email from boss, in full panic mode: &#34;I need you to figure out who hacked the computer lab at Springfield High so we can report him to the police!&#34;7. A week later an independent consulting firm was brought in to help identify the person behind the &#34;hack&#34;. I heard they were paid $50K and found nothing. However, the kid got ratted out when he told all his friends. (It wasn&#39;t Bart Simpson! ;) )8. Several weeks later: meeting to discuss working with a consulting firm that&#39;s gonna fix all the security issues because the current staff (me and my team) lacks the skills.9. About 6 months later, I quit."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reminds of me my school leaving prank. I rewrote the whole internet on my school&#39;s computers. Google&#39;s logo became &#34;Leavers &#39;08&#34;, Facebook became &#34;Hatebook&#34; and was red, YouTube only played videos of cats, amongst other things.These were the days when nothing had SSL, so you could just intercept and rewrite traffic!My only requirement was: do no actual damageIt was implemented as a Debian live CD that you could drop into any school computer. It would boot up, then Ettercap would MITM the whole network by spoofing the router. It routed all HTTP traffic via Squid and a custom ICAP server that did the actual rewriting. If you removed the live CDs, the network just went back to normal within a couple of minutes.Routing the whole school&#39;s network through one old Pentium machine wouldn&#39;t work though, so I figured out a way of doing distributed load balancing: it would do the ARP spoofing slowly and randomly. So, as you added more machines, it would just magically balance between them.It worked great for about an hour then whole network mysteriously stopped working for the rest of the day. I left all the live CDs in the computers as a calling card.Sorry, school network admins."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Three things are remarkable about this, and make it a happy story.First, that the pranksters were so egregiously responsible in the way they went about it. They avoided disrupting any actual educational activities; it was meant to be harmless fun, not vandalism. No harm came to anything here.Second, that they documented their findings to the administration as part of the action, including recommendations for improvements.Third, the administration took this as exactly that: a harmless prank by smart, ethical kids who ALSO did them a favor by pointing out the vulnerabilities. If the admin had a panicked fit about this, they could have made it an ugly situation.My educational experience was populated far more by &#34;freak out and yell&#34; types than this school district, which was a shame."</p>

					<h3><a href="https://rancherdesktop.io/">Rancher Desktop, a Docker Desktop Replacement</a></h3>
				</div>
				<div class="story__comments">
					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28835690">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Dropping by to express healthy interest in this project.Rancher have a pretty good track record so far:  - the Rancher platform itself (https://rancher.com/) is a really powerful and user friendly way to manage container clusters of all sorts, giving you a self-hosted dashboard for both your cloud and on prem clusters, for a variety of Kubernetes distributions; you can even manage the available drivers and also create deployments graphically
  - the K3s distribution (https://k3s.io/) is in my eyes one of the best ways to run Kubernetes yourself, both in development environments and production ones. I benchmarked K3s alongside Docker Swarm as a part of my Master&#39;s thesis and it was surprising to see that its overhead was actually very close to that of Docker Swarm (a more lightweight orchestrator that&#39;s included with Docker and uses the Docker Compose format), only exceeding it by a few hundred MB with similar deployments being active, making K3s passable for small nodes

As for this particular project, it&#39;s very positive to see that it supports all of the big OSes, even though the 0.6.0 version tag would still advise caution for a while, even though it can definitely be considered as a replacement for Docker Desktop.Admittedly, it&#39;s also nice to see that Docker and the ecosystem around it is still supported and is alive and kicking, since for many projects out there it&#39;s a perfectly serviceable stack with tools that a lot of people will be familiar with, as opposed to having to migrate to podman, while it&#39;s still becoming more and more stable, yet isn&#39;t quite there yet. Now, that may be a controversial take, and Docker Inc also have their fair share of challenges, about which there was a very nice writeup here: https://www.infoworld.com/article/3632142/how-docker-broke-i..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Let me say it; I love to see it. There&#39;s just something that strikes me as harmfully greedy about the idea of &#34;Docker, a gajillion dollar company.&#34;  There&#39;s just no way that THAT kind of service could be tweaked to return that much to stakeholders without seriously screwing up the experience for people who need it to just work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was amazed by the news at first, but seeing it again, it doesn&#39;t seem to be a direct replacement of Docker Desktop. It makes use of K3s under the hood, which is lighter than a full-blown Kubernetes, but still quite heavy. My nearly empty K3s cluster is consistently consuming ~10% CPU time on my local machine. This is not acceptable to me, so a proper replacement of Docker Desktop should be more lightweight."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Utility Types[0] will help you get to the next level on Typescript. It&#39;s important to know them and know how and when to use them.[0] https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.h..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m so happy powerful type systems are more popular now. TypeScript bringing a great type system to a language as popular as JS is fantastic. Rust is also a great way to get a great type system while staying in a systems programming and procedural environment. Hell, even python type annotations support union types.I never knew the depth of type systems until the last year when I took a type theory course and a compiler course taught by a man who loved his types. So much power - I can&#39;t wait to see the future of type systems."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s another. Instead of returning Sometype|undefined from a function which may or may not have a value to return (such as searchCustomer), return Sometype|null.That forces the function to return a value that&#39;s explicitly intended rather than defaulting from a missed out if-else codepath. This is useful since JS is often imperative style code."</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28840066">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Oh, this is just laser fusion. One pulse of power. That&#39;s not a power source, even potentially. It&#39;s a lab-sized H-bomb experiment. This isn&#39;t one of the magnetic containment systems achieving ignition and sustaining the reaction. Now that would be an achievement."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Meta-question about fusion energy -something I don&#39;t understand about the movement. I spent a few years as CTO of a company providing heat-to-electricity plants. We financed and built them off high-heat plants like natural gas turbines. The &#34;fuel&#34; was heat going up the stack - so it was essentially free. We still couldn&#39;t compete with conventional electricity plants, even with a $30/tonne price on carbon in Canada.Geothermal energy is the same: sustainable, long-life electricity with no &#34;fuel&#34; costs, but it costs 2-3x as much to build a geothermal plant (in most areas, depends on geology) as e.g. a natural gas turbine powered plant, so the overall cost of electricity is much higher and you can&#39;t get financing.How is fusion different? The fuel will be free and unlimited, but the &#34;levelized cost of electricity&#34;, dominated by the capital cost of the plant, will still be much higher than other sources of electricity. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a world -- even one where the onerous regulations go away and a  market price on carbon is available -- where the LCOE of fusion power is less than that from natural gas, or even close."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Fusion ignition is the point at which a nuclear fusion reaction becomes self-sustaining. This occurs when the energy being given off by the fusion reactions heats the fuel mass more rapidly than various loss mechanisms cool it.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_ignition"</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28841177">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The article is discussing the media and government being intentionally vague or even misinformative because they don&#39;t trust the public, but it backfires and causes more distrust. The flip side that wasn&#39;t discussed is the belittling and censoring of voices that were skeptical of the narratives, which engendered even more distrust. Their strategy of information control backfired, and they doubled down. Now we&#39;ve got a huge swath of US citizens that will never take the vaccine."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"How about the biggest dishonesty - lack of admission that not everyone is at the same risk and that lockdowns have significant irreversible costs for low risk individuals and for society? Young children are not getting critical development years back. Healthy 20 somethings only have limited time to date, party and have fun before being saddled with adult responsibilities forever. Most of shattered local businesses are not coming back. While pandemic was not the only reason for BLM and Jan 6 riots, all the young men not being kept busy and receiving stimulus checks to support unproductive activities was certainly a contributing factor - and the fallout permanently damaged trust we have in each other. What of all the deaths of despair - suicides and drug overdoses? Mixed cancer diagnoses because people were scared to go to see doctor? Plummeting birth rates?All of this adds up to the fact that optimum precautions for an obese 70 year old guy is not a same as for a healthy 19 year old woman, and individuals should have a role in deciding what&#39;s right for them. While vast majority should take a vaccine, there may be a small group for whom it&#39;s a reasonable choice to hold off. Say you are a 19 year old healthy make and your risk from serious vaccine side effects is largest while your risk from COVID-19 is smallest. Plus, you already recovered from COVID during the time Delta variant was common. Are you really bonkers for making a decision either way?Above all, society must not sacrifice its young for those of us who had a chance to live for quite a bit already."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author is completely right in that the government at least in the US attempting to downplay, mislead or &#39;avoid panic&#39; absolutely destroyed any credibility and is still suffering from it. Most people are not stupid, if provided with all available information as well as clear statements regarding the reliability of that information and just a clear message saying &#34;hey this is new and we have no idea, we are making our best guess&#34; people will make decent choices. Unfortunately the US decided to torpedo its credibility, and all sides decided to turn it into a political issue which a pandemic should very much not be. All politics all the time and the US is now crippling itself. In the absence of real honest leadership people turned to the loudest voices of the media. Once the people distrust the government and think they are lying its very hard to appeal to their logic again. I am very much not a fan of Bush II but he did it right after 9/11. What he did after though is a topic for another day."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A distinction needs to be made clear here with regards to the data being transmitted to Google by LineageOS in this study.In the cited paper (https://www.scss.tcd.ie/Doug.Leith/Android_privacy_report.pd...), the device used to test LineageOS was a Google Pixel 2 running LineageOS 17.1 which also included an installation of OpenGapps 10.0 nano.It&#39;s not the OS that is transmitting the data over to Google, but rather OpenGapps (ie. Google Play). OpenGapps is software that can be optionally installed after the initial installation of LineageOS (but before first boot). A user can still use LineageOS without OpenGapps, though they just won&#39;t have the benefits (and drawbacks) that come with it (such as being able to use apps that require GSF). The user can instead opt for an app manager like F-droid or possibly Aurora Store.In addition, there exists an alternative to OpenGapps called MicroG. This is like Google Play but allows users the option to anonymize themselves. One can find custom LineageOS builds that include MicroG from the MicroG website (as the members of the LineageOS project do not advocate for its use, instead giving preference to OpenGapps). Keep in mind, however, that there are fewer devices supported by those builds."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I use GraphineOS and LineageOS without Google Play Services. They are great and are suitable replacements for Apple and Google.- Osmand(FOSS) for maps (supports being fully offline!)- Signal and Discord for messaging (Discord is sandboxed)- Newpipe(FOSS) for Youtube- F-droid(FOSS) for my FOSS appstore- APKmirror for the few non-free apps I need- Libretorrent(FOSS) and VLC(FOSS) for watching movies- Firefox(FOSS) and Vanadium(FOSS) for browser- K9 Mail(FOSS) for email- Infinity(FOSS) for Reddit- Secur(FOSS) for 2FA- Taskkeeper(FOSS) for remindersAlmost everything you need is in the F-droid FOSS app repository. It all works, and it works well. You can buy a used Pixel 3a for around $80 on Ebay and have a better experience in every category than iOS, hardware and software.The only limitation is push notifications, which isn&#39;t a problem because FOSS apps like Signal bundle their own notification system that does not use Google Play Services. Discord however, does not get push notifications (which I wouldn&#39;t want anyway)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Android takes snapshots (screenshots) of apps as soon as you switch to another app. When you view the app list, it already has the last view of each app.But the Xiaomi/MIUI Android sends over those screenshots back to the company is new information."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I can understand if a product has limitations, or odd edge cases, but Microsoft MFA is purposefully designed to be user-hostile.Some examples that came up recently in &#34;not corner case&#34; scenarios:1) For tenant-to-tenant guest access, each user must re-register MFA for each tenant they&#39;ve been invited to. So if you already have the Authenticator app installed and configured, it doesn&#39;t matter. It&#39;ll prompt you to create a new entry each time. I have dozens already and clocking up.2) When logging in to Azure, Microsoft has purposefully added &#34;dark patterns&#34; to hide options related to other, non-Microsoft-Authenticator technologies. They&#39;re available, but they&#39;re always tiny, tiny links squirrelled away so that you&#39;re inexorably lead towards using the Authenticator app. Someone at Redmond really wanted their KPIs met at Yubikey&#39;s expense.3) If you get a new iPhone, unlike everything else on the phone, the Authenticator app will not transfer your MFA registrations. Apple IOS will securely transfer your accounts, passwords, etc... but Authenticator is special. You need to first configure a consumer account(!) to back up your enterprise MFA settings, and then restore them manually. At which point... none of them will work, and you get partial instructions that you can&#39;t follow. If you&#39;ve wiped your old phone (e.g.: trade-in or repair), you are now locked out.All of the above were designed, architected, and developed on purpose. None of these are oversights, bugs, or missing features."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Everything about Microsoft cloud and its ecosystem is broken. I recently signed up for onedrive (microsoft business basic, actually), and I didn&#39;t even know which domain to navigate to. They have a gazillion different URLs, and each of them is different from the other. Here&#39;s a (partial!) list:azure.com onedrive.live.com admin.microsoft.com microsoftonline.com office.com office365.com onedrive.com onmicrosoft.com sharepoint.com windowsazure.comEach one of those portals take you to SOME view of your account with a gazillion settings. Many of them are repeated, and changing it on one portal doesn&#39;t necessarily reflect in others. For example, I enabled 2FA somewhere (and it worked), but going to admin.microsoft.com showed 2FA disabled.Even payments, which every other website seems to have figured out, is broken. There was a recent change in regulations in India for subscriptions on credit cards that allow the customer to control the period of subscription, enabling/disabling, etc. Microsoft of course, hasn&#39;t implemented the changes (despite the regulations being notified in August 2019), and because of that, transactions are being declined.So can I go and make that payment online? Well, no. Your subscription shows up as &#34;expired&#34; because it couldn&#39;t charge your account, and the only option it gives is for you to &#34;reactivate&#34; the account. Great, so I&#39;ll just reactivate. But no, it doesn&#39;t allow you to pay when you reactivate - it&#39;s going to try and charge your credit card again, itself, as a subscription, sometime. And of course, that&#39;s going to fail again. Loop!Addendum:So somehow, with the help of Microsoft support, I manage to sign-up for another subscription with the same licenses for the same cost, and they disable the old one. Great. So this time, it tries to charge my card, fails, but then allows me to &#34;settle&#34; the &#34;overdue&#34; amount manually. I do that, and my account is &#34;active&#34; again!Do they send me a mail saying they&#39;ve received the amount? Nope. Does my Microsoft account billing page show that I&#39;ve made any payment to Microsoft? Nope. The only indication that I&#39;ve made a payment is that my account is active with an expiration date in the future."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Microsoft VP Identity Division, Alex Simons, apologised on twitter and said they will release a fix overnight. I was actually able to log into my account today. But before you get too excited, what they&#39;ve done is they&#39;ve completely disabled the sign-in preferences menu and still have the bug - I cannot enable password-less login as it tries to send a notification to my phone, but that is no longer listed on my account. But the system clearly knows about it and wants to send a notification. Unfortunately, it cannot because it also requires it to be a sign-in option. It&#39;s a crazy loop of madness."</p>
