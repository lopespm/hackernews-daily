								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the most unfortunate things in the past 6 years is that support of Julian Assange and Wikileaks became a partisan issue purely because they exposed corruption in your favorite political party.It&#39;s hard to put a finger on just how much the current form of western democracy differs from the 18th century ideal of western democracy. Let this concretize it: Global western &#34;democracy&#34; conspires to put the single most hard-hitting journalist of the past decade in jail indefinitely on fictitious charges and virtually nobody cares. Where are the protests? Where is the outrage? Do most Americans even know who Julian Assange is?&#34;Fascism&#34; gets thrown around a lot and I know it feels a bit overplayed, and I&#39;m not saying we&#39;re there yet, but when most people are apathetic and the remainder form their opinion based entirely on their political faction, it&#39;s hard for me to believe that fascism isn&#39;t inevitable. After all, what is fascism about if it&#39;s not &#39;party firmly over principle&#39;?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The really startling thing is ... considering how effective this technique is with the internet it must have been nearly flawless prior to about 2015 when most of the world didn&#39;t have access to the internet.What we&#39;re seeing isn&#39;t so much an elite group controlling the narrative as an elite group who used to be able to control the narrative and now can&#39;t patch over the rough spots."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t think Sigurdur Ingi Thordarson is a &#34;key witness&#34; in the claims against Assange. He might be A witness, but I very much doubt the charges rely on his testimony. As far as the media goes, most people don&#39;t care about Assange as much as the conspiracy crowd. And some of the comments here are verging on very conspiratorial."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; An honest list of drawbacksI appreciate putting up a list like this. That said, I want to comment on one of the listed drawbacks:&gt; Occasionally, obscure email servers will block emails sent through usI have a few years of experience running my own email server and I can tell you this is a major pain in the ass. When you send your email via a small email server (a server that sends a low volume of email), you will have constant issues getting mail delivered. Also, most of the issues will not be with obscure email servers, they will be with Outlook and Gmail. When you send email, you will never know if your email will be delivered to inbox, delivered to spam folder, or blackholed entirely.Related:&gt; We&#39;re not a suitable platform for sending marketing emails (although you should use a dedicated marketing platform anyway).Please explicitly ban people from using your platform to send &#34;marketing email&#34;. Clients like that are going to ruin deliverability for your other clients."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"An issue with desalination systems of this type (that have water vapor in a carrier gas, so called HDH or Humidification-Dehumidification desalination systems) is the retardation of mass transfer to the cold surface by the carrier gas.  Multieffect distillation (MED) systems usually operate without a carrier gas for this reason, but this means they operate below atmospheric pressure, so they have to be sturdy to resist pressure loads.A few years ago, some people at MIT solved this problem with a bubble heat exchanger: the humidified carrier gas is bubbled up through trays of water (at progressively lower temperatures).  The surfaces of the bubbles provide a very large surface area for heat/mass transfer.https://news.mit.edu/2013/produced-water-cleanup-0205
https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/86334
http://web.mit.edu/lienhard/www/papers/reviews/HDH-Desalinat...Some of those involved went on to form a company to commercialize the technology, which has been used to recycle/purify brine from natural gas wells and other industrial tasks.   I think they ended up being bought out after several years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those curious what the 385% refers to&gt; the team’s demonstration device can achieve an overall efficiency of 385 percent in converting the energy of sunlight into the energy of water evaporation.Honestly I still don&#39;t know what that means, or how efficiency can be over 100%."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"FTA: &#34;Unlike some desalination systems, there is no accumulation of salt or concentrated brines to be disposed of. In a free-floating configuration, any salt that accumulates during the day would simply be carried back out at night through the wicking material and back into the seawater, according to the researchers.&#34;The capabilities are freaking interesting, but let&#39;s say someone builds a big enough settlement on a coastline or island in which every building has one or more of these devices on its rooftop. Would this release back enough salt so that the surrounding seawater becomes hostile to its previous lifeforms? Also, since then the water used in the process would contain more salt, how much would that render the device less efficient?"</p>

					<h3><a href="https://twitter.com/AlexanderNL/status/1410253599502962692">Brickit – scans your Lego bricks and helps you build new creations</a></h3>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27693560">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I just tried it on my kids&#39; Legos. I made two scans, one per box: it found ~2500 bricks, which I think is a very high hit rate.
However, the build suggestions are very, very lacking. For reference, my kids are 8 and 4.
The builds proposed are very simple, small, and still mention missing pieces (probably related to colors, which honestly most kids don&#39;t care about).
I think my 8yo would like it, she tends to build &#34;worlds&#34;, assembling many related contraption that each are fairly simple and match the themes found on suggestions.As for my 4yo, forget it. He is a builder, making very elaborate and complex constructions, the bigger the better. He would find suggestions absolutely uninteresting.
I didn&#39;t try to scan Technic legos (which he is fond of and make astonishingly complex contraption given his age). But it&#39;s an even more complex problem to solve.I suspect work on the app was focused on recognition, which honestly is impressive. The second part, finding models, maybe need a bit of work ?
I would recommend at least having an option to &#34;ignore color&#34;: it&#39;s nice to have a build that looks good, but overall most kids - including myself - like to build first."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve tried it this week and it&#39;s really cool to see it process a big batch of bricks.I was a bit disappointed by the suggested builds, because they&#39;re small, but I also understand it&#39;s early on and a difficult thing to do.Not vital, but I was surprised that it doesn&#39;t look for colors at all.One thing I&#39;d love is the same technology, but used to look for a particular part. It does that once you pick a build, but imagine building your own thing rather than suggestions and having the app tell you where you can find the piece you&#39;re looking for. If you&#39;re adventurous, you would even have a custom tray with a spotlight directed at your pile :)I&#39;ve been trying to take thousands of mixed parts back into their original sets and I was hoping this might be helpful. The technology itself probably would, but not packaged as it is for the moment.All that being said: really well done!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Peripheral question. The app appears to be iPhone only.I&#39;m honestly curious why people do this, and I&#39;ve never gotten a satisfactory answer. iPhone market share is 15% at best while Android is 75%. It seems like releasing an iPhone-only first iteration kneecaps the enterprise out of the gate. What am I not understanding?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Could someone spell out a use case for this?

It&#39;s frustrating that validating email addresses is still something that people get so wrong. Please just take whatever seeming garbage I&#39;ve entered into your email address field and try to send a message to it.(Their site also had stupid password generation rules such that I couldn&#39;t use the 21-character one my password manager auto-generated, but even after I made one that followed the rules on the page, it was still rejected because there were apparently rules on the back end that weren&#39;t spelled out in the front end.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love Neovim. I switched from VSCode and never looked back, it&#39;s just so much more efficient to just do everything with your keyboard.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"In my experience, the built in LSP is a mixed bag. Getting language servers configured is a breeze, diagnostics and go-to definition work just fine. But trying to get autocomplete and snippets to work is an exercise in frustration. There&#39;s a handful of different hobbyist implementations which are all somewhat-maintained and somewhat work together but it&#39;s buggy and you end up needing to do 20x the effort of using VS code to get not quite the same ease of use.I really hope they&#39;ll do some official work on lua-based solutions for autocomplete and code snippets in the future to really round out the LSP support, if that&#39;s something that they want to highlight as a feature of neovim. I still think VS code is the way to go if you want LSP features, but 0.5 is a terrific step forward and everyone who worked on it should be very proud."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those out there trying to &#34;learn&#34; vim, give neovim 0.5 a try!I&#39;ve been using neovim HEAD (0.5 pre-release) for a while and it has been awesome. It all started with this config [0] and from there and haven&#39;t tried (as before) to join a vim cult but instead to use it as a tool that works for me (i.e. use mouse scroll to browse around, use arrows on insert mode, and other vim sins)Little by little I&#39;ve been looking at how I could do something a little better and pretty much every time vim has an awesome way for me to do something! Yanked some text then deleted something but I want to paste the yanked text, not the deleted one? &#34;0p is the answer. Need to replace all ___ but not modify the prefixed numbers? I can use visual regex to easily work that out! I&#39;m doing something over and over? I can make that into a macro! There&#39;s a macro that I always use on certain file types? I can make an autocmd to load some string to some macro when I open certain file.It&#39;a awesome feeling that time I&#39;ve actually learning about registers, macros, regex, windows, buffers, and everything else in a modern and snappy tool![0] https://github.com/mjlbach/defaults.nvim"</p>
