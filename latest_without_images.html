eight “snapshots” of the email and put the copies into the author’s draft email folder. No action was required by the author. It was all done by the auto-save.When Google learned that it had inadvertently produced 
draft versions of the email to Oracle, it requested that 
Oracle return all copies. Oracle complied, but filed a 
motion to compel production of the draft and final versions of the email. Oracle successfully convinced the district court that the email was not protected by any privilege, and the court ordered the production of all versions of the email.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I enjoyed the piece.Personally, I want no part of it, but I think it might work well for people who are not me.I&#39;ve always been &#34;on my own.&#34; My life really is a series of watersheds, where I&#39;ve been the only person to believe in me, before the event, and a whole bunch of folks seemed to believe in me, after the fact. Not a particularly good setup for selling &#34;Chris-Tokens™.&#34;Not a bad thing, in the long run. It hurt like hell, the first few times, but I realized that I don&#39;t have the personal skills to &#34;sell&#34; myself (like being able to spew jargon, sound like I&#39;m TED-talking all the time, or beat LeetCode tests), so I can&#39;t blame folks for not wanting to &#34;invest&#34; in me. It is what it is. I come across as a socially-awkward dork, so people don&#39;t take me seriously. I&#39;m actually fairly good at what I do, but If I mention that, it comes across as &#34;arrogant,&#34; despite the enormous ocean of hubris that pretty much defines today&#39;s tech scene. I don&#39;t really have the skill to &#34;humble-brag.&#34;It taught me to live a conservative lifestyle, be Honest and Honorable, do top-shelf work, bust my ass, and not expect much from others.I couldn&#39;t rely on anyone else to clean up my messes, or get me out of jackpots. It has taught me to learn what I have needed to learn, despite active roadblocks being tossed out by &#34;gatekeepers,&#34; and it also prevented me from getting mixed up with some truly awful disasters; both personal, and business."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hey, Alex Masmej here. Just wanted to say that I had no choice because I had no money in the bank. During the start of COVID, I lost my only (and very first) source income at the time, and I lost all my savings in crypto (DeFi is dangerous even to crypto people like me).Financially, this ISA freed me instantly, and gave me a newfound legitimacy as a crypto innovator. This was by far the best way I could find to break out as an entrepreneur."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Instead of more palatable user tracking, how about we tell advertisers and internet companies: fuck off, we don&#39;t want any tracking? How about we hunt down and eliminate all features that allow cross-site information sharing? How about we treat attacks on user privacy as security problems of the web standards, à la Tor, and build technology that aggressively hides any user signature in any layer, from rotating IP and MAC addresses to user agents, referers and canvas leaks?But wait you say, how would the very useful internet ecosystem survive without advertising revenue? Well, there is nothing wrong with advertising per se, it&#39;s a natural part of a free market economy. It&#39;s ok to target ads to the user&#39;s search terms or social feed. The problem is that, in the pursuit of advertising revenue, a cutthroat economic competition pushed advertisers to mine more and more personal data simply to stay competitive. It&#39;s a low sum game: it doesn&#39;t bring much more money in advertising or make the internet significantly more useful, but it destroys the privacy of everyone. A spectacular market failure ripe for correction."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"FLoC stands for Federated Learning of Cohorts which aims to target advertising better without it directly relying on singularly personal information.https://web.dev/floc/  FLoC enables ad selection without sharing the browsing behaviour of individual users.

  FLoC provides a privacy-preserving mechanism for interest-based ad selection.

  As a user moves around the web, their browser uses the FLoC algorithm to work out its &#34;interest cohort&#34;, which will be the same for thousands of browsers with a similar recent browsing history. The browser recalculates its cohort periodically, on the user&#39;s device, without sharing individual browsing data with the browser vendor or anyone else.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s a very interesting move. The patch seems fairly small, but now it&#39;s a patch that Brave needs to maintain and update every time they merge a new upstream version.That&#39;s what makes me wary of the whole Chromium fork concept. Every time Brave/Vivaldi/Edge/etc decide to take a different path from Google&#39;s they effectively add to their maintenance burden forever, even if like in this case they actually disable an unwanted feature.How long until the list of patches to backport for every new version of Chromium becomes so large that they have to pick and choose which one to keep maintaining and which one to give up on? If tomorrow Google decides to push a very deep change to the way, say, extensions are handled that makes them less effective at ad blocking, will Brave accept the burden to suddenly have to maintain a very deep fork of the browser in order to maintain old functionality?I&#39;m effectively FUDing right now, but my concern is genuine. I&#39;m very perplex that you can make an effectively anti-ad, pro-privacy browser based on the source code of one of the biggest ad companies in the world."</p>

The guy is good, at a FANG he would earn 200+ guaranteed and a pension plan.I don&#39;t want to attack this comment in particular, specially because they&#39;re saying this to simply support the argument that the guy is an excellent programmer, but it irks me when people say stuff this assuming that an excellent programmer always has easy access to a FAANG.Some people simply live in underdeveloped countries where their talents can&#39;t shine and they have no way to get an interview at FAANG, some people are either too young or too old to be a good candidate, and a myriad other things that could get in the way of an excellent programmer. In such scenarios, an Internet business like this is the only way out for some programmers. I&#39;d bet there are hundreds or thousands of genius programmers living in Russia, Brazil, the Balkans, Guatemala and many other countries that simply couldn&#39;t land a job at FAANG even if they wanted to."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I find more amazing is what an incredible equalizer IT is: An individual with nothing more than a computer (and $50 worth of rented production infrastructure) plus the right skills can build a project that makes a (well-deserved) million a year, from anywhere in the world.It also shows the power of smart design and keeping as much as you can client side. Attempting to move any of the actual work to the server side would create an unsustainable amount of a) additional development work, b) infrastructure cost, c) infrastructure operations work. It&#39;s also a great example that you truly can do everything inside a browser nowadays.Regarding the incredulous people who can&#39;t imagine how 12 TB/month cost only $50, the hosting provider may be taking a small loss on it, and make it up with other customers. At Hetzner, extra bandwidth (after you&#39;ve exhausted your included allocation) retails for 1 EUR/TB + VAT. A provider can afford to lose $10-20/month on a single customer, and kicking them out is probably not worth the effort and the risk of even the smallest amount of bad press/word-of-mouth."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I use Photopea a lot and the amount of Photoshop features it has is astounding. Like adjustment layers, smart objects etc. The PSDs it exports work nicely with the Photoshop I have in my Windows PC. This is just mind-blowing.
That brings me to a question I have. GIMP has been in development for longer time. And supposedly it has a bigger team behind it. So how come GIMP is missing a lot of nice features like non-destructive editing, layer styles etc? I saw some of these features in its roadmap, but why is its development so slow? Is it only because working on GIMP doesn&#39;t generate any money?Edit: rephrase"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"(author here)I thought I would answer to some of the comments here.&gt; It&#39;s their place, their rulesDefinitely true. And I am not going to try to go against those rules. But I believe I am allowed to voice my opinion about them.&gt; Use in-app purchases insteadThis is definitely a valid option, but that requires diving into Google Pay, which from what I understand is not the easiest API to work with. It also means I have to maintain additional code for Google Play. More not-so-fun work to do for a side project.&gt; Make it a paid gameAnother valid option, but given how everybody is used to free games on Android, I doubt it would get much success. It also does not help that Google Play disallows switching a published app from free to paid and vice-versa: it&#39;s a one-way decision.I might end up going that way though, because it has the advantage of not having to write store-specific code. Pixel Wheels is not Android only: it also works on Linux, Windows and macOS, so not having to deal with store-specific requirements gives me more time to work on the game itself. The game would still be available for free on F-Droid and for pay-what-you-want on itch.io.I also happen to run other open-source projects, and my goal with donations is to get people to support this open-source work, not just my work on this particular project. I don&#39;t expect to ever live from this: in my wildest dreams donations would let me spend a work-day per week or every two weeks to work on open-source projects."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recently implemented Google Play billing in my app (after doing Stripe and Apple App Store) and Stripe was by far the easiest to implement/test/maintain.  Google and Apple not only take their 15/30% cut, their payment systems add a very non trivial amount of work (cost) to implement and maintain while offering none of the (automated) testing capabilities of Stripe.  Work that I&#39;m forced to do, even though I had already implemented Stripe.  All because they have a monopoly on their platform.For something as critical as payment processing, both Apple and Google make it an arcane journey into API documentation and stack overflow questions. 
Hoping to write a blog post detailing all of this in the near future."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Many comments here confuse paid apps or in-app purchases with donations. In fact, donations are sort of a blind spot on Google Play: They&#39;re forbidden through the platform&#39;s payment system (because it would be a price charged without service in direct return), but donation buttons are also forbidden. Since both are forbidden, it&#39;s not (just) commercial optimization by Google, but that just makes it weirder IMO.As a rule of thumb, don&#39;t include a direct link to PayPal, Patreon or similar, but create a dedicated page on your website listing those and link that page."</p>

A few years ago, I made a joke app[1] which got a bit famous on campus back when I was in school, and the process of getting it on the Play store was literally harder than writing the darn thing.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I made a &#34;feeding tracker&#34; app because my wife wanted to wean our infant off breast milk. There are mobile apps that do this, but the problem was that we didn&#39;t want to wake up our child due to the phone screen at night. So, I hooked up an IoT button to Lambda + Dynamo, created a UI and everything -- my wife only needed to press the button. Turns out my wife was generally too sleepy and forgot to press the button. Also turns out that she liked to breast feed anyway, so the app went totally unused. User requirements are hard!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My immediate thought: the algorithm is wrong! Deciding which film to watch together isn&#39;t a matter of both parties saying which films they are willing to watch and then picking one from the intersection of those two sets. It&#39;s a negotiation, and it could be like negotiating Brexit.Take just a simple example: suppose P1 and P2 are both willing to watch films F1 and F2, but P1 would prefer to watch F1 and P2 would prefer to watch F2. But suppose P1 knows, because of an unguarded remark that P2 made, that P2 is willing to watch F1, but P1 has managed to keep quiet about their willingness to watch F2. Then P1 can &#34;win&#34; the negotiation by claiming that they are only willing to watch F1.So this app needs to be upgraded to act as an agent on behalf of each user. Each user tells the app which films they are willing to watch and what their preferences are, and also what information they have managed to obtain about the preferences of the adversary (significant other). The two AI-powered agents then negotiate on behalf of the users, complete with bogus deadlines, threats to walk out and so on.A premium version of the app could take account of other household duties, long-standing grievances and so on and use them as additional &#34;bargaining chips&#34;."</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26741829">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From a storage perspective, describing commits as snapshots seems like a bad mental model. Suppose I have a directory that is 100MB in size. If I take a snapshot of it, my snapshot would be 100MB in size. If I take a 2nd snapshot of it tomorrow, my 2nd snapshot would also be 100MB in size. My total storage needs would now be 300MB.Whereas if I had used git, and created 2 additional commits, each making a change to a small text file, my total storage size would be barely larger than 100MB. Describing the commits as a diff, as opposed to a snapshot, leads to a better intuitive understanding of why this would be the case.Not to mention other features the article discussed, such as cherry-picking. What does it even mean to &#34;cherry-pick a snapshot&#34;? In comparison, cherry-picking a diff and applying it to your current state, is far more intuitive.And let&#39;s not forget commit messages. If a commit is a snapshot, I would expect the commit-message to be descriptive of the entire snapshot. Whereas if a commit is a diff, I would expect the commit message to be descriptive of the diff. Which is exactly how most people use commit messages.Obviously both &#34;diffs&#34; and &#34;snapshots&#34; are leaky abstractions. If you insist on using the &#34;snapshot&#34; abstraction, you will need to resolve all of the above points of confusion by adding more complexity to your abstraction. And if you prefer to use the &#34;diff&#34; abstraction, you will eventually need to explain that a commit is actually a combination of diffs, along with some other metadata like a pointer to a parent commit. As a teaching tool, you can make either abstraction work. But I find it far more intuitive and useful to think of commits as &#34;diffs + some metadata&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why have so many people written long thoughtful explanations about how the author is wrong to suggest snapshots are a better mental model, and that you think all abstractions are leaky, but you find diffs a better mental model?The entire article is literally about how commits are literally snapshots. I would say people didn&#39;t read TFA, but a lot of people are quoting lines from TFA and then going on to argue with/expand on them in a way that is directly contradicted by the next few lines.I think it&#39;s because most of the people here have spent years working with git, and are so deeply attached to their understanding that they didn&#39;t hear most of what the article said.(Some commentators have pointed out specific oversimplifications the author makes like glossing over pack files, I&#39;m referring to the people who say a git blob is a diff when the entire point of TFA is that it isn&#39;t)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I believe that Git becomes understandable if we peel back the curtain and look at how Git stores your repository data.I agree, and like many, I have been saying that for years (nay, for more than a decade): and that&#39;s exactly the problem!You don&#39;t need to understand how an internal combustion engine works to drive a car... You don&#39;t need to understand how your graphics card renders stuff to develop a web page... You don&#39;t need to know how a brushless motor works to use a drill...There is a pattern there, and it&#39;s the one that makes sense.I&#39;ve read up on the internals of git a dozen times by now. But I only occasionally need to do something weird that makes me go back to it, so I usually forget the relevant bits.The trouble is that I&#39;ve used a distributed VCS that did not ask me to understand internals and it had a sane UI, and good model (like tree-like commit history, so a top-level commit log would only have merges, but you could dive deeper into individual commits if you so pleased). It wasn&#39;t perfect, but it&#39;s hard for me to accept that we have gone with a subpar solution where every &#34;tutorial&#34; starts with how you need to understand the internals! But you also need to memorise them, dammit!Just like I keep forgetting the Emacs rectangle editing shortcuts since I seldom use them, I&#39;ll keep forgetting the specifics of git internals that I might need once every 12 months.And it&#39;s not me, it&#39;s _you_, git!"</p>
