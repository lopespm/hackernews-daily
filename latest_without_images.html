								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Awesome! Takes me back :)My 8 yo son is playing it now, he knows all the modern consoles, but this is challenging him. He is frustrated things are hard from the beginning, jumps don&#39;t work right away and he stopped after a few minutes. I remember my perseverance as a kid.I was thinking about that lately, I see my kids don&#39;t have this strong motivation as I had, not for anything. Everything works for them and is layed out. For example, when I was young I had a lego technic motor, but the wires sometimes got oxidatid or just broke, and I had to fix it. My son has a new lego set, and the motor always works, except when the wireless remote runs out of battery. 
Same with gaming, it always works, while in the past even getting a game to run could be a challenge on its own. And when he gets stuck in a game he watches a YouTube. No hours of frustration and endless searching and figuring for a solution.I see my kids don&#39;t have much of these challenges, everything works for them.Don&#39;t know how this will affect them on the long run. Now it&#39;s only my observation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great job! It&#39;s amazing to be able to feel again the sensations I had 30 years ago while developing the Atari version of this game. Thanks again!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So many memories playing this, thanks!I expected after finishing level 1 to see the “page 4 line 2 character 6” challenge room, where you were supposed to prove you owned the official manual.When I was a kid we had it on floppy disk but never had the original book, and I remember diligently filling in a table of failures each time I drank the wrong letter and died. Eventually I got them all!Because of this I remember level 1 extremely well :D"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In the late 2000s, as a teenager, I was gifted a Runescape account. This account had level 80+ woodcutting, allowing one to chop magic trees - which would produce the most expensive lumber in the game. It took a staggering number of real hours to achieve this skill level, we&#39;re talking several hundred hours minimum.At some point I had realized that there were different sketchy websites that would buy and sell the in-game currency, gold pieces or GP. It was something like $10 to 1M GP. I could chop enough magic logs in about 4-6 hours to make $10.I had a breakthrough. What if I wrote a macro to record my cursor and clicks during my route from the &#39;bank&#39; (where you can deposit any amount of any material) to the nearby respawning magic tree forest?Weeks went by and I had passive income. Runescape eventually introduced the Grand Exchange, a literal in-game stock market that allowed power users like me to sell much larger quantities of certain items instantly, across all Runescape servers (referred to as Worlds) simultaneously. This required a standardized pricing mechanism, like an order book, where prices of any item would fluctuate based on buy and sell orders.Suddenly, I now could see a +-10% change on the value of my digital assets, on which my passive income was built.I could go on; Runescape in fact taught me much about economics. What&#39;s extraordinary is selling Runescape gold led me to Bitcoin, and I&#39;ve watched cryptocurrency for nearly a decade, seeing trends from a MMO propagate throughout the world. It seems human nature to innovate and stagnate, and the more immediate our collective feedback loops, the quicker these cycles are."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A thought exercise you should undertake if you&#39;re thinking about / talking about crypto/NFT/web3-related projects:  If the financial instrument that underlies the project were to stop going up in value XX% per month, would you still be interested in the project?I do this a lot because I&#39;ve made the conscious (and perhaps financially foolish) choice to stay away from everything crypto/blockchain related (for now, at least).  So I have some perspective in being able to ask myself &#34;Why is this interesting?&#34; without any emotional-financial attachment.  I do this little exercise every time I read about some new brain-twisting scheme to move money around and capture some of the XX%/month rise.Play-to-earn seems to fit the same mold:  You can talk all you want about how play-to-earn is &#34;the new new&#34; and how it&#39;s helping people out of poverty and changing the dymanics of gaming and yadda yadda yadda.  But just ask yourself:  If the money music stopped tomorrow, would you play the game?Is there a &#34;there&#34; there without an underlying token that&#39;s gone up XX% in the last N months and everyone hopes will still go up XX% in the next N months?It sounds like the answer, at least when it comes to Axie Infinity, is no.  It doesn&#39;t sound fun.  It doesn&#39;t sound compelling.  It DOES sound like an opportunity for people to extract money from the crypto system that&#39;s fundamentally based on the assumption that the crypto system will continue rising in value forever."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I didnt read much of the thread but I will assume that most of the people here is aware of how every single NFT game is just a ponzi.But I&#39;ve lived myself, what the author mentions as a &#34;way to lift people out of poverty.&#34;, from the era before NFT or &#34;play to earn&#34; games existed.I come from Venezuela, a full 3rd world country and I was &#34;lucky&#34; to play an MMO (lineage 2) during my young days and somehow I was good at it, i invested so many hours on it and managed to get into top tier guilds and worlds 1st event, and somehow, my character and my items were worth thousands of dollars in the market, and suddenly i went from being a 14 y.o boy sitting in pc, to bringing more money in 1 week to my family, than my entire family together for 1 year.I could understand that, while all other people on the game were playing for fun, it became my job, a job that actually got me and my family out of poverty...At the time (2007) there were a lot of chinese &#34;farmers&#34;, and people used to make fun of them, not only fun but the rest of the players were blantantly denigrating towards them, at 1st I didnt understand but once that I became a non-chinese farmer, I realized how It was a really good thing to do.Eventually I started botting, I bought more PCs and had a full army of bots, I kept making more and more money, and it helped me and my family leave the country and pretty much bought a house, a car and paid my family expenses for like 4 years out of lineage 2 adena farming.Also, scripting the bots pretty much got me to learn programming and english, so what I am now it&#39;s pretty much the result of some guy from chicago offering me 20$ in paypal for an item i had in my inventory that i got it while killing a monster, it all started there, that litle forbidden transaction in an MMO, changed my life completelySo, even tho it was like a job for me, I never saw it like a job, even tho it gave me a lot of money, i never got into the game as a way to get money, i was just a young kid trying to have some fun..But now, I get really sad everytime I see those ponzi NFT games, that only sell the idea of getting rich, and I get even more sad when I see tons of venezuelan youngsters fall for it, honestly, they are just playing with their desperation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"People choose platforms because of their functionality, not because of their code licensing status - see the case of Scala, linked in a different sibling comment.  Matrix and Zulip, even after years of chasing, still sadly haven&#39;t caught up to Discord functionality- and UX-wise; until that happens, people won&#39;t have a good reason to budge.Regarding IRC, Drew is kind of famous with his ascetism, claiming that the impossibility to share GIFs, videos, files, use threads, have internal chat history, are all features rather than limitations[1]. The thing is, people don&#39;t care about it, they&#39;ll simply vote with their own legs. Mail and mailgroups face a similar UX challenge. Not everyone is willing to endure the pain of learning and using mailgroups and IRC just because they&#39;re FOSS.[1] https://drewdevault.com/2019/07/01/Absence-of-features-in-IR..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On a related note, I’ve found myself actively seeking alternatives (edit: to the project itself, not just to chat) when an OSS project only has a chat-based community as opposed to forums or mailing-lists, for two (edit: three) reasons:- it’s impossible to search chats meaningfully, whereas forums/DLs let you quickly figure out if you’re facing a common issue (and finding resolutions easily)- asking about something in chat and tracking replies a day or two later (because you will quite likely not get a quick reply to complex issues) is also quite hard unless you just happen to be awake at the same time as a core dev and can actually spend the time together (although that usually devolves into “file an issue with more details and tag me”).- I don’t want to sign up for a dozen different services or private forums to even access that info.Not to mention that (depending on community) you might just get a lot of irrelevant chatter thrown in, or just plain “this is the wrong channel” replies because there are no signposts."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Disregarding closed source issue I find Discord, any chat, unsuitable as a public user-developer interface.Why?1. Asynchrony. User needs time to collect data, write a bug report and so on. Developer needs time to reproduce the issue, work on it. Finally there are a lot of timezones - people ask/answer at different points of time.2. Long lasting. Communication can take days, weeks and even months as new details emerge. Accessing a year old thread should be as easy as accessing a thread created yesterday.3. Publicity. You want everything written to be as public as possible. Read access should be available to everyone without registration. Read access should be available via web browser. So that other users (who often experience the same issues) can easily find existing communication on the topic, and if they can&#39;t find it themselves you can at least send them a link which brings me to permanence.4. Permanence. Each individual communication (message) should be accessible by a URI which never changes. Each individual communication page should have links to thread/parent/children/references.5. Searchability. Follows from (3) and (4) but the easier it is for a user to find past discussions - the less noise you&#39;ll have.Chat systems such as Discord, Slack or Matrix are fundamentally incompatible with these requirements as they are focused on synchronous, ephemeral communication."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"related: Ask HN: How did my LastPass master password get leaked? https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29705957"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"LastPass has had a history of security incidents (no company can completely avoid incidents, but if security is literally a primary part of your value, you shouldn’t be having so many).Even worse, they have a history of doing hand-wavy corporate non-explanations for what actually happened in these incidents. The antithesis of being responsible and respecting users in the modern day."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is framed so negatively toward LastPass, which is unfortunate. They stopped all usage of correct passwords they believed were compromised, which is exactly what I&#39;d want them to do in this situation. Them warning users their master passwords are compromised is a good thing! Yet it&#39;s framed as though they&#39;re admitting to something.&#34;However, users receiving these warnings have stated that their passwords are unique to LastPass and not used elsewhere.&#34; That&#39;s really hard to verify. I think most users would say that rather than admit they re-used passwords (or used similar passwords that were easy to reverse engineer). Since there only seems to be 2-3 reports of this, and they&#39;re self-reported and not cited, it doesn&#39;t seem like LastPass was compromised.I&#39;m not saying I like LastPass (I use 1Password and find LastPass to be much worse), but I haven&#39;t seen any indication at this point that LastPass has been compromised at all.(To be clear, it&#39;s very possible I&#39;m wrong and this message won&#39;t age well. But so far, it seems like LastPass is doing its job, and I&#39;d want to see more than this before jumping on the blame-LastPass bandwagon.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Recruiters love phone calls and don’t like doing things over email or text. This means that it is very easy to get overwhelmed by the number of recruiters trying to call you, and we will explore time management a little further down the text.This has been my experience as well, and while I understand the desire for introductory &#34;sales mode&#34; type calls, I think it&#39;s progressed past that point to something nearly pathological.As an example, I recently had a recruiter that I was previously in contact with over email cold-call me while I was skiing, trying to schedule a meeting with a hiring manager (I picked up the call because I thought it might be one of the people in my group that I didn&#39;t have in my contacts). When I requested she please send me an email to schedule the meeting, as I was out of the office, I got an email where she sent an email to schedule the phone call, to then schedule the meeting over the phone. It was 100% the least efficient way to do this, and only happened because of this illogically strong preference for phone calls that recruiters seem to have..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When looking at his LinkedIn, I only see one job with tenure over 4 years almost 10 years back and most other jobs are well below 2 years. It seems like he definitely is able to find new jobs very efficiently so I think his advice here is valuable.However if I were hiring for an engineering leader, I would probably pass him over. I don’t see anyone being an effective leader by only sticking around for less than 2 years. Having tenures less than 2 years especially at senior roles doesn’t give a lot of positive feelings of leadership in my opinion."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Independent headhunters and recruiters are a valuable resourceI had an experience with an independent recruiter that went so poorly that I haven’t been able to take those kinds of people seriously since.A few years back, I was recruited to an up-and-coming startup in the healthcare space in a senior role. It was a massive pay increase, meaningful equity, and a company name I was proud to put on my resume.An independent firm reached out to me about the role and I was definitely interested. One thing I noticed while doing my independent research was that lots of people had very poor Glassdoor reviews of the company, basically comparing it to Theranos in terms of its culture, constant firings, cult-like CEO, etc. I reached out to several former employees to discuss their experience and could not get one to talk to me about working there. Meanwhile, I was hearing from the recruiters that they hired a new exec team and most complaints were not relevant to the current situation there.I brought the complaints up with the recruiter and the company during my interview process, and they both told me it was just a couple disgruntled former employees trying to make the company look bad. The recruiter offered to put me in touch with others they placed at the company, but I couldn’t view them as objective sources.I started the gig and it took me all of two weeks to realize the company was in fact firing people constantly and I had been completely lied to by the recruiter and the company.As much as I want to believe that there are recruiters out there that look out for devs, the reality is that software talent is the product in that relationship and there aren’t a lot of financial incentives to ensure transparency going into these professional relationships. Recruiters get paid when you sign, which creates an inherent conflict of interest when you’re looking to them as a trusted resource."</p>

I am happy for the OP to correct me, but thought I&#39;d mention this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thinking aloud here, it does seem like (as we&#39;ve always known), anyone doing eCommerce online is effectively beholden to their payment provider.Given Stripe is pretty popular, it feels like for many it is becoming the &#34;S3&#34; of payments in terms of an API. Would it be viable for others to implement the same API on the basis of compatibility, portability and interoperability?In the past, I recall dealing with systems where you&#39;d have multiple backend processors for major external functions, and you&#39;d load balance which provider was used. Some might have more favourable pricing, and be a preferred partner, while others might be potential future preferred partners being tried out (see how many failures you get from them, compared with the current preferred partner).It seems that, if this was possible to implement (card tokenization obviously being an issue here), you could have multiple independent backend providers implementing the Stripe API as a provider, and you load balance across them.Just like how you could use another S3 API provider for storage if one is giving you hassle, or not offering satisfactory performance or support. Sure, you have migration work to do, but having the same API and underlying properties should speed things up and let you get new transactions onto the new storage ASAP.ACME is like this for SSL - there&#39;s now multiple CAs implementing the one API. Could we get there for payments too?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"100% atheism. Was raised some kind of protestant I forget which one, and derived tremendous spiritual and psychological relief when I realized all of that was absolute nonsense at the age of 9. I knew I was gay at the time and wouldn&#39;t come out until I was 18 or so, but my life just got a lot easier when I removed religion completely. I also recall discovering increased moral agency -- as a Christian I had been taught I could simply confess whatever and it would be forgiven (an idea I found laughable), and that the objective basis for making moral judgements comes directly from god (another idea I found laughable). As an atheist I was suddenly responsible for making my own moral judgements and conclusions (I had to decide upon my own objective basis for making moral judgements), and forgiveness was something I had to work towards myself (as in I had to forgive myself for things, which is not easy, but is incredibly rewarding) versus simply getting it for free from some nonexistent deity.

Thus I commend myself to this daily humbling, this emptying, and also trust myself to the daily prayer of the monks, whose prayer and sacrifice are also hidden from the world and whose labors I suspect are also just as arduous, frustrating, and challenging at times.&gt; For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find i"</p>
