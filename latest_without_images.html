								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This should be a sobering view of how the world really works. Above a certain threshold, every veneer of civilization vanishes no matter what the country (some have a higher threshold than others).At this level, only power matters. And the first rule of power is: Don&#39;t embarrass the powerful unless you can call on a lot of power to defend yourself.Laws can&#39;t protect you; they can be thwarted and bent, and the legal process &#34;guided&#34; to the required outcome.International organizations can&#39;t protect you; they can only register complaints that will be duly ignored by everyone if the champion is important enough.Even countries can&#39;t protect you at this level; they&#39;re beholden to power themselves after a certain point.This is the message to would-be activists anywhere: Stay out of the big boy pool or we&#39;ll make you regret it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To fully appreciate the context:- he’s not a us citizen- none of the “crimes” happened on US soil- he’s a world famous journalist with prior work- was charged with bogus crimes in Europe in an attempt to arrest him. All dropped- the person who stole the files he released is already free and the tax payers paid for their transition"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Surprisingly few technical people understand the extent to which the CFAA charges he faces are bullshit.It all goes back to a jabber log that they got from Manning. The gist of it is as follows:Manning: &lt;some bytes from a hexdump&gt;Manning: can you guys crack NTLM?Assange: we have rainbow tables. I’ll forward it onto someone on our team.Few days later,Manning: any update on NTLM?Assange: no luck so far.And this is computer conspiracy. No additional access to any machine was had, and there’s no real evidence that any cracking was attempted at all. He merely agreed to take a look and reported no progress on it. It’s been a while since I looked at the details but I seem to recall that the pcap hexdump manning sent wasn’t even the correct bytes to do an attack — it wasn’t even possible.There are so many explanations for why Assange could have said this while plausibly not attempting to crack the hash. Manning put him in a strange position to become complicit and he had to strike a balance between not saying to his source, “lol that’s illegal no way, you’re on your own dude” while simultaneously saying exactly that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; This resulted in a large surge of connection activity that overwhelmed the networking devices between the internal network and the main AWS network, resulting in delays for communication between these networks. These delays increased latency and errors for services communicating between these networks, resulting in even more connection attempts and retries. This led to persistent congestion and performance issues on the devices connecting the two networks.I remember my first experience realizing the client retry logic we had implemented was making our lives way worse. Not sure if it&#39;s heartening or disheartening that this was part of the issue here.Our mistake was resetting the exponential backoff delay whenever a client successfully connected and received a response. At the time a percentage but not all responses were degraded and extremely slow, and the request that checked the connection was not. So a client would time out, retry for a while, backing off exponentially, eventually successfully reconnect and then after a subsequent failure start aggressively trying again. System dynamics are hard."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; This congestion immediately impacted the availability of real-time monitoring data for our internal operations teams, which impaired their ability to find the source of congestion and resolve it.Disruption of the standard incident response mechanism seems to be a common element of longer lasting incidents."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wow. I didn’t know this, but I was actually able to observe this state on myself. When going to sleep, my mind is wandering. But at one point it drifts from real world thoughts to completely abstract concepts and wild imagination that sometimes makes no sense. It’s almost like a hallucination. What’s most interesting is that sometimes I am able to notice the transition to this state and consciously observe it. Usually it makes me happy because I know I’m about to fall asleep within the next few seconds (which I often have problem with, writing this comment at 1:26am again..). I am also able to consciously observe the images being generated. It’s very weird, because it feels like one brain looking into someone else’s brain to the extent that is impossible by any technology or in any other way. Sometimes I’m able to consciously wake up from this state, because I have weird “sleep phobias”. Sometimes I am fascinated by the idea generated at that stage. But unless I write them down or really get up, they are typically lost if I fall asleep within next 5 minutes - maybe I’d have a Nobel prize already, if only I kept a pen and paper ready next to my bed. Or apartment full of crappy kitch paintings.."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Anecdote: I distinctly remember being on the edge of sleep writing a song one night in 2019. I was about to fall asleep on the floor with a notebook in my hand, and just at that moment, the music came into my mind. For whatever reason, I was able to stay awake and flesh it out as a recording. After reflecting on it the next day I realised I had written an acoustic fingerstyle piece that moved across keys as if there were multiple voicings in the accompaniment all moving independently in polyphony. Far more harmonically complex than anything I had written before, or since.Three weeks later my partner and I played it for the first time in a pub, and the normally cosy and laugh-filled room fell silent. We had the exact same experience in another open mic night a couple of weeks afterwards, where we took the first-place prize before the competition even finished. It was as if people were moved by it without any effort or coercion, like we cast a spell over people.Now it makes sense! I’ve heard music play in my mind as I’ve fallen asleep before; this news explains this story almost perfectly. Unreal. Live on the edge of sleep and magic can happen. I wonder what health risks there are with prolonged use?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think I once got into this hypnagogic state by accident. I was having a nap and my dogs woke me up because it was time for their walk.I felt sleepy while walking the dogs but also had a clarity regarding anything I examined in my mind. It&#39;s as if my regular state of mind was like walking in a forest with limited visibility, and now I could see the territory from a bird&#39;s perspective.This lasted for about 15 mins maybe. I&#39;ve never been able to experience this again. Maybe I should try this technique :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I suspect this is to foreclose against a future option for Google to monetize ‘free’ content in the play store without compensating the developers much as they do people’s videos on Youtube.For those who aren’t aware, in the games industry the distributor has been in the role of adding DRM to games on the pretense that they are “protecting their interests and channels”. As the distributor, Google may feel empowered to make these sort of “protective” changes, and the one that would be most likely (in my estimation) would be wrapping the APK such that it played a pre-roll ad before your free game started.I could be completely off base here but to my way of thinking it would be consistent with Google’s moves in the past."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good?What&#39;s the alternative? Have a crappy, paid-for, add filled, bloated app promote itself as &#34;Cauliflower Cooker Lite - the #1 free cauliflower app. 100% ad-free&#34;.Metadata like file size, whether there are in-app ads or purchases, etc, should be part of the store&#39;s listing - not the title."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So, let&#39;s be clear here.  The problem is not that they&#39;ve prohibited people from putting this information in the app title.  The problem comes if they&#39;ve done so without introducing another way for the user to express their preference for ad-free apps.  E.g. it should even work better if, hypothetically, the search function prioritized ad-free apps anyway when the user puts &#34;no ads&#34; in the search box.I can&#39;t tell if this is the case right now because, well, the store is still full of apps with &#34;no ads&#34; in the title.  Those are still coming up first."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is the scientific meat of the press release where it claims a 25 times neutralizing antibody titers against the Omicron strain with a third dose of Pfizer-BionTech:The sera were collected from subjects 3 weeks after receiving the second dose or one month after receiving the third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Each serum was tested simultaneously for its neutralizing antibody titer against the wild-type SARS-Cov-2 spike protein, and the Omicron spike variant. The third dose significantly increased the neutralizing antibody titers against the Omicron strain spike by 25-fold. Neutralization against the Omicron variant after three doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was comparable to the neutralization against the wild-type strain observed in sera from individuals who received two doses of the companies’ COVID-19 vaccine: The geometric mean titer (GMT) of neutralizing antibody against the Omicron variant measured in the samples was 154 (after three doses), compared to 398 against the Delta variant (after three doses) and 155 against the ancestral strain (after two doses). Data on the persistence of neutralizing titers over time after a booster dose of BNT162b2 against the Omicron variant will be collected.---At the bottom of the press release it mentions that Pfizer is the marketing distribution partner for BionTech in many countries. Does anyone have a list where BionTech distributes directly?&#34;BioNTech is the Marketing Authorization Holder in the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada and other countries and the holder of emergency use authorizations or equivalents in the United States (jointly with Pfizer) and other countries.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If I&#39;m reading this correctly, this is &#34;protection against severe disease&#34; and has little to do with transmission. The National Airport Data from Israel seems to suggest &#34;the absolute number of infected individuals in the Vaccinated (boosted) group is likely to be at least as high as in the Unvaccinated&#34; [0]So it seems to me that as long as we all remain obsessed with case numbers and not actual hospitalizations and death, this isn&#39;t going away, at least not anytime soon. I personally find this beyond depressing.[0] https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3963606"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If there is an expert in immunology here I&#39;d really like to ask a question:Aren&#39;t antibody titers just one measure of immunity?Since ~everyone with just two shots get them a while ago, and people receiving the boosters are receiving them now, wouldn&#39;t we expect must higher levels of neutralizing antibodies in boosted people? I know the number of antibodies fades over time, (whether from vaccine or infection) but this doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t have lasting protection after this, right?Wouldn&#39;t it therefore be a mistake/misleading to conclude something specific about a level of protection from this titer data alone?"</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29510616">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Based on my anecdotal experience this seems to very much understate inflation. 
How is housing up only 3.8%? This site says over 17% rent increase nationally over the last year: https://www.apartmentlist.com/research/national-rent-data which seems to be more accurate.  Anyone with a web browser knows that home prices have experienced a monumental increase.Also a trip to the grocery store appears to cost me 50% more now for essentially the same goods. Every trip to the store pre-covid cost me around $100, now its $150. I do buy primarily proteins so that is the source of the increase but to ignore that seems ill advised.Not generally a conspiracy theorist but unless the people that built this report are using some accepted formula that is very different than the real world this report seems to be intentionally underselling inflation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Fed was initially saying the inflation was transitory, but have recently dropped the &#34;transitory&#34; label.Back in July, Siegel pointed out that the M2 money supply is 30% over pre-pandemic levels and predicted that would translate into 20% cumulative inflation over the next 3 years.  Here are my talk notes / video links if you&#39;re interested: https://neapowers.com/investing/jeremy-siegel/In July Siegel said &#34;There is zero need for the Fed to be buying $120 billion in bonds every month given market conditions.&#34;  I don&#39;t know why the Fed is buying mortgage backed securities in the midst of an apparent housing bubble.Larry Summers was voicing inflation concerns back in March: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBnaahSe7JU&amp;ab_channel=Bloom...The main macroeconomists I follow (Siegel, Gundlach, Summers) are all puzzled by the Feds actions recently."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of this is due to fuel prices. The price of fuel affects the price of everything else. It&#39;s a benchmark since everything requires fuel. Manufacturing, transportation, agriculture, etc. It all requires fuel. It doesn&#39;t help that OPEC refuses to increase production in order to make up for their budget shortfalls last year. Also doesn&#39;t help that the US government is sending signals that it is no longer on board with fossil fuels. The shutting down of pipelines, ending of fossil fuel leasing, etc. sends a market signal to producers and traders that the US is hostile towards the industry, leading the producers to cut production and maintain their profits.Best option would be to have a diverse portfolio of energy production: oil, natural gas, solar, wind, hydroelectric, and nuclear. Don&#39;t go all in on one, that&#39;s how you arrive at the situation we are currently in."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I first encountered quaternions in the concept of abstract algebra. It&#39;s interesting to think of it as part of a spectrum starting with reals and continuing to octonions (and beyond). Interestingly with each extension we lose something:Complex numbers (2-dimensional): No more orderingQuaternions (4-dimensional): No more commutative multiplicationOctonions (8-dimensional): No more associative multiplicationSedenions (16-dimensional): We lose the alternative property, i.e., with octonions its still true that x(xy) = (xx)y but with sedenions it is not.We can continue this process indefinitely, although I know nothing of the characteristics of trigintaduonions or what comes later. I suspect that it might be the loss of the flexible identity next, a(ba) = (ab)a but I don&#39;t know for sure."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"W.R Hamilton&#39;s discovery of the Quaternions is semi-famous itself, with the story being that after the critical flash of insight he carved the equation describing quaternion multiplication into a bridge in Ireland with a penknife.A interesting read is this letter [0] written the following day, where he explains his ideas in his own words. It&#39;s a great (and accessible!) look into his thought process.[0] https://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/HistMath/People/Hamilton/QLette..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One interesting thing about quaternions that’s almost never mentioned anywhere on the internets, there’re two conventions for them.The convention in that article is known as “Hamilton&#39;s quaternions”. There’s another incompatible one usually called “JPL quaternions”, for some American Jet Propulsion Laboratory.Authors of 99% articles about the quaternions, and software libraries implementing quaternions, are assuming exactly one of these conventions, and almost never mention which one that is.More info there: https://fzheng.me/2017/11/12/quaternion_conventions_en/"</p>
