								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is the best news I&#39;ve heard all week.  The more widely vegan &#34;meat&#34; is available, the more likely it is to be adopted by average people and not just dedicated vegans.Reducing the demand for real beef is probably one of the best things we can do in the short term for the environment, due to the amount of land required for cattle farming, and due to the surprising amount of methane emitted by cattle.
(see the documentary &#34;Cowspiricy&#34;, or Mark Rober&#39;s &#34;Feeding Bill Gates a Fake Burger to save the world: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k-V3ESHcfA)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I enjoy eating meat and have no plans of going off of it completely. But we eat so much of it as a culture.And when you add up every hot pocket, frozen pizza, slider, hot dog, or chicken nugget, it&#39;s hard to argue that most of meat actually being consumed can&#39;t be easily substituted. For something healthier and cheaper too!And I know people blast tech companies for focusing too much on making things flashy and cool, but the people who are making electric cars and fake meat cool are the ones who are going to save our asses while we were busy scolding people for not trying harder to enjoy brown rice."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This brand was tested by German magazine called &#34;Öko-Test&#34; on their ingredients. Also not for the first time. It got a BAD review again because it contains too much mineral oil in it (could have various reasons, packaging of ingredients or oily manufacturing machines) and 20g fat per 100g &#34;meat&#34;.So it&#39;s unhealthy on mineral oil (MOSH) which can easily accumulate in your body and fat percentage.One of the sources which you can Google translate:https://www.businessinsider.de/gruenderszene/food/beyond-mea...Another English article:http://www.ezineblog.org/2020/12/12/beyond-meat-fails-the-te..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"He&#39;s kind of totally wrong about the phones and thus the speed being THE killer feature. First of all, Symbian phones, which were the market leader smartphones when the iphone was released were pretty fast. So were feature phones (i.e. dumb phones).What iphone was a LOT better at than everyone else was UX. Of which speed is one component, of course. It&#39;s funny how much people never get it although it happened in front of us, it happened to us. At the time I was working at Nokia Research and I remember my girlfriend telling me how his boss got this wonderful phone that you can take photos with and you can view them, etc. The funny thing is that I had such a phone since 2001. I have been working with smartphones for 6 years then, she knew it, she listened to me when I told her or others what I was doing (and then listen to others responding &#34;yeah, but phones are for making phone calls&#34;). She saw me browsing the net on my phones (a 9210 communicator and then a 9500), send emails from the beach, etc.Still it somehow didn&#39;t register. Because it looked like something that she&#39;d never use. And then the iphone that did a lot less made her and basically everyone understand what a smartphone is. (Even though by then symbian smartphones were pretty common, most people didn&#39;t use them as smartphones.)So no, it&#39;s not simply the speed. It&#39;s the UX. And even if we talk about speed, it&#39;s still not the speed, but it&#39;s the perception of the speed, which a lot has been written about: delay (lagging) matters a lot even if speed on average is OK."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I vividly remember using a kiosk to order a sandwich at a gas station 3 years ago... Not because the sandwich was great, not because it had a great logo, or a great name...The INSTANT I hit the button to complete the order, the built in printer almost spat the ticket at me. I ordered a second sandwich just so I could get a video of that happening again.Edit: Just found and uploaded the video :)
https://youtu.be/TX_-dXIpPvAEdit2: looks like it was a soda, not a second sandwich."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This might be because I am a former semi-pro Quake3 player but these days I grind my teeth with 95% of all software. Everything feels like it has at least 200ms delay injected, on every transition.I&#39;d honestly pay extra for an iPhone where I can disable ALL motion, too. But that&#39;s the least of the problems.I don&#39;t want to become the grumpy old grandpa yelling &#34;back in my day!...&#34; but we have waaaaaaaaaaay too much young JS devs who know nothing else.We need to get back to native UIs. Is it awfully hard? Yes it is. Do the users care? No, they don&#39;t. Many people want fast UIs.But to be fair to all sides -- there are also a lot of people who don&#39;t notice certain slowdowns that I scoff at. So there is a middle ground that won&#39;t cost billions to achieve and IMO that should be chased after."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a recent video presentation by Jonah Edwards, who runs the Core Infrastructure Team at the Internet Archive. He explains the IA’s server, storage, and networking infrastructure, and then takes questions from other people at the Archive.I found it all interesting. But the main takeaway for me is his response to Brewster Kahle’s question, beginning at 13:06, about why the IA does everything in-house rather than having its storage and processing hosted by, for example, AWS. His answer: lower cost, greater control, and greater confidence that their users are not being tracked."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I was a kid, my dreams was to work at Google, Microsoft, Apple or any of these big companies. Now that I am reaching 30 (and becoming very nostlagic of the old web), I think the company that would make me most happy of login every morning to get some work done would be Internet Archive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I see incredible value in IA collection of books, videos and software. OTOH I&#39;m puzzled by lack of organization.Take for example this newer document: https://archive.org/details/manualzilla-id-5695071  The document has horrible name and useless tags, and the content seems to be only section 2 of some SW manual. How would I ever hope to find it if I needed that exact document?Obviously such huge archive cannot be categorized and annotated by small team, so it would make sense to crowdsource the labeling process. Yet, as registered user I can only flag the item, or write a review. Why doesn&#39;t IA let users label content and build their own curated collections of items?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Submitted title was &#34;MIT Press has granted full access to all its journals&#34;. What&#39;s the source for that? It&#39;s extremely important to be accurate with this kind of thing. The discussion below is all based on assuming that that title is literally true.The HN guidelines specifically ask you not to rewrite titles unless they are misleading or linkbait: https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html.I&#39;ve changed the URL from https://www.mitpressjournals.org/action/showPublications, which doesn&#39;t explain anything, to the press release which, although it&#39;s a press release, sort of does. Nevertheless it&#39;s hard to figure out what exactly is being announced here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To MIT Press, thank you. But without an announcement, I fear that this is just a one time, brief thing.Springer did this awhile ago for a weekend, not its entire catalog but many books were free to download. It was wonderful, but brief. From down thread, https://mitpress.mit.edu/blog/mit-press-launches-direct-openI think it is important for folks to recognize how hard this must have been and how many heated verbal battles were exchanged inside of MIT over this. Thank You. And thank Aaron, always a champion in spreading the world&#39;s knowledge to the most people possible.  We should empower everyone as much as we can with the bits we have available.Folks should check some fun journals likeComputer Music Journal https://www.mitpressjournals.org/loi/comjEvolutionary Computation https://www.mitpressjournals.org/loi/evcoAdd your own below!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It seems slightly weird to me that university presses and learned society journals aren’t generally open access. I thought the point was to aid the university’s research. Surely it helps the name of the university to have important widely accessible journals with the university’s name on them. Maybe the presses tend to have been spun off as commercial enterprises, or maybe the university really loves the income. Or maybe they are really expensive to run for some reason. I know the press at my university has a pretty large building but I’d figured a lot of it was a warehouse. Maybe it’s full of salespeople negotiating with librarians.I don’t think there’s much hope of the commercial journals owned by Elsevier or Springer opening up, but I do hope that the trend of journals flipping (where the entire editorial board resigns and forms a similarly named open access journal) will increase.Perhaps another problem is that in those fields that are already closest to open access (say because they use the arxiv), there is less incentive for people to jot publish in commercial journals as everyone who matters will have already read the preprint in the arxiv."</p>

				</div>
				<div class="story__comments">
					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26311522">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"More background from the point of view of Frogware:The Sinking City is Being Delisted. Here’s Whyhttps://frogwares.com/the-sinking-city-is-being-delisted-her...Without wishing to take sides, here&#39;s what seems to be at the root of the dispute, from Frogware&#39;s POV:On June 27, 2019, The Sinking City was released on Xbox One, PS4, and Epic Games Store. That was a great day for us. And once the game was released, we received a letter from Bigben/Nacon that the milestones that were previously approved are being canceled, meaning that we would not receive any profit from the sales of the game. A retroactive cancellation on not delivering a product on time that is already out in the market is not acceptable. That was when our legal battle began.We filed a lawsuit against Bigben/Nacon on August 2019 and, incidentally, only then we started to receive income reports, though incomplete and undocumented. So it was not possible for us to see if the revenue was correctly calculated or even how many units we sold. At some point we received a statement claiming that one of the console manufacturers hasn’t paid royalties for more than 5 months, while actually the same console manufacturer paid our royalties from other games without any delay in the same period of time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was working near some game publishers many many years ago, and the case when they would crack the game in order to publish/republish/rewrap installer, localize to some local market or release some critical patch, when the original team was not responsive, not experienced in certain tech issues, had no resources allocated, was drown in bureaucracy, or even was not existing anymore, was not so uncommon.The case when this is breaching original contracts is the well the separate issue. Often times the publisher and developer have different views of the world, - relationships in this industry have always been tense."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hadn&#39;t heard of this before, so maybe I am missing some context here, but something seems fishy:&gt; Steam is one of the listed platforms of commercialization in the contract between Frogwares and Nacon. But since the release of the game, Nacon’s unlawful actions have forced Frogwares to defend its property and react in front of the French Justice for lack of payments, attempts to steal our IPs, etc which we made a public letter about back in August 2020.Here&#39;s the previous statement from Nacon:https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/750130/view/30584784...I can&#39;t find any of the details about Nacon&#39;s unlawful actions, and it seems Frogware is being intentionally vague. Doing some digging, it seems like this is almost a complete retread of a legal battle they had before:https://twinfinite.net/2019/09/frogwares-games-delisted-alle...It seems like they may have a history of playing a copyright game with publishers - take their money to develop a game, then use legal trickery to take back the property outright.In this case Nacon may have felt they had a &#34;mechanic&#39;s lien&#34; on the code and felt justified stealing it back outright (probably a bad choice in the long run). But regardless, I don&#39;t get the sense that Frogwares is completely being on the up and up about the relationship with their exes.Update: Frogwares has a much more detailed list of grievances here: https://frogwares.com/the-sinking-city-is-being-delisted-her... Some seem petty and some seem serious. But it still leaves questions. How much did Nacon already pay Frogwares? Does Frogwares plan on paying it back?&gt; The agreement is, therefore, terminated without further formality. Moreover, on July 17, 2020, Nacon attempted to oppose the termination in court, but the judge rejected the demand, and the contract is now terminated in the eyes of the law.Maybe French law is much weirder than ours, but this phrasing would be highly suspect in the US. You would get a really affirmative ruling that you are still bound by contract or not."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Stuff like this is so cool, and also highlights the importance of archiving the internet.I&#39;ve never used Lotus 1-2-3, but this makes me want to try and get it running to try out older software that is brutally efficient."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think there is something kind of fun about purposefully using &#34;outdated&#34; software, and even valuable sometimes, in the same way that it&#39;s useful to use a dead language like Latin nowadays; it&#39;s not changing so there&#39;s sort of a bit of &#34;equality&#34; to it, for want of a better word.For example, I&#39;ve actually thought it might make sense for people to release new software on DOS or the Sega Genesis, simply because they&#39;re  not being updated anymore, and as a result, there&#39;s a ton of great emulators for both that can run on pretty much any modern platform under the sun.  A Linux program I write might not run under FreeBSD or AmigaOS, but I would bet that I could get basically nearly any SNES game running nearly flawlessly on them with an emulator."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m so sick of these profound-sounding blog posts that take 1 million words to say precisely jack shit. Yes, the key innovation around Bitcoin was to order events. You can call this &#39;time&#39; if you want. This is literally the most obvious thing you can say about the system. It&#39;s so obvious in fact that it&#39;s in the introduction section to the Bitcoin whitepaper. Here is the entire blog post written much shorter and more precisely by Satoshi:&#39;In this paper, we propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributed timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions.&#39;Not trying to be elitist but if you find this topic new then you probably also find Bitcoin&#39;s technical workings new. Since it&#39;s now more than a decade old I don&#39;t find this a very topical inclusion for a &#39;news&#39; site."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Let me fix that title. Happy to be downvoted into negative territory. I only have 11 points. Go ahead.&#34;Bitcoin Is A Waste of Time (and Resources)&#34;What Bitcoin has done is that it taught people they can come together in a sustained flash mob (like an on-the-fly hedge fund operation) and manipulate the price of speculative assets by creating artificial short-term pump-n-dump type demand. Bitcoin has trained our collective neural network to do this.The huddled masses can take their new superpower and apply it to stock, crypto, commodities on the commodity exchange, and all kinds of speculative assets, especially the virtual kind.It&#39;s taken a gambling-friendly society with feverish lust for winning (think for-profit fantasy sports, online poker, day trading, Vegas et al) and turned us into a giant decentralized casino."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m ready to be downvoted to oblivion, especially by all the Bitcoin purists, but I hope my message sparks at least some curiosity.Bitcoin is getting &#34;weaker&#34; every year for several reasons:- emerging centralization due to economies of scale. If this trend continues the mining power will be so consolidated that a 51% attack will be likely. The Nakamoto coefficient is already at 4, and tending towards 3.- energy usage due to Proof of Work is growing astronomically, and the higher the price of bitcoin, the less incentive there is to use renewable energy. Bitcoin uses more energy than the country of Argentina.- transaction times are SLOW, and expensive. The lightning network is incredibly buggy and won&#39;t actually solve the problems it&#39;s promising.There is a better alternative. RaiBlocks, named nano since 2018. It got a bad rap due to the BitGrail hack, but it&#39;s picking up steam again. The developer community is great, the main dev team on the Nano protocol has been consistently chugging along regardless of the 3 years of crypto winter on a shoestring budget and the nano community is made up of users, not speculators.This article sums it up quite nicely: https://senatusspqr.medium.com/why-nano-is-the-ultimate-stor...I&#39;m happy to receive downvotes, but all I ask in return is that you give it a read with an open mind."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ll admit, I didn&#39;t read all four articles. I got about half way through the first one and was just wondering &#34;I still have no idea what this is all about.&#34; Fortunately, the Wikipedia article on the author has a brief summary.In particular, I thought this quote from the Wikipedia article really summarizes the differences between older and younger generations: &#34;there is a profound difference between using a racial epithet in the course of a discussion about that racial epithet&#39;s use, and using a racial epithet to diminish or to wound someone.&#34;For &#34;socially conscious&#34; people in my generation (Gen X), I think nearly all of us would find calling someone a racial epithet abhorrent. At the same time, while I understand culture has shifted and I wouldn&#39;t do it now, I still find it quite bizarre that the mere utterance of the epithet, even in a sentence like &#34;You should never call someone a &lt;racial epithet&gt; because that is extremely offensive&#34; is considered itself racist by younger people.I recall hearing about a young popular YouTuber about a year or so ago who was accused of being racist simply for singing along to the lyrics of a popular rap song. Even more strange to me was that his defense (which was true if one looked up his Instagram video) was that he did NOT utter said epithet, in that he was singing along with the lyrics but when it got to that word he just skipped it and didn&#39;t say it.I understand culture changes, but it still bothers me that we&#39;ve gotten to the point where we completely disregard intent and focus instead just on the syntax of what was said. To be clear, I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s indeed what occurred in Mr. McNeil&#39;s case, but I certainly have seen it in other examples."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; 1. Yes, I did use the word, in this context: A student asked me if I thought her high school’s administration was right to suspend a classmate of hers for using the word in a video she’d made in eighth grade. I said “Did she actually call someone a (offending word)? Or was she singing a rap song or quoting a book title or something?” When the student explained that it was the student, who was white and Jewish, sitting with a black friend and the two were jokingly insulting each other by calling each other offensive names for a black person and a Jew, I said “She was suspended for that? Two years later? No, I don’t think suspension was warranted. Somebody should have talked to her, but any school administrator should know that 12-year-olds say dumb things. It’s part of growing up.”&gt; 2. I was never asked if I believed in white privilege. As someone who lived in South Africa in the 1990’s and has reported in Africa almost every year since, I have a clearer idea than most Americans of white privilege. I was asked if I believed in systemic racism. I answered words to the effect of: “Yeah, of course, but tell me which system we’re talking about. The U.S. military? The L.A.P.D.? The New York Times? They’re all different.”&gt; 3. The question about blackface was part of a discussion of cultural appropriation. The students felt that it was never, ever appropriate for any white person to adopt anything from another culture — not clothes, not music, not anything. I counter-argued that all cultures grow by adopting from others. I gave examples — gunpowder and paper. I said I was a San Franciscan, and we invented blue jeans. Did that mean they — East Coast private school students — couldn’t wear blue jeans? I said we were in Peru, and the tomato came from Peru. Did that mean that Italians had to stop using tomatoes? That they had to stop eating pizza? Then one of the students said: “Does that mean that blackface is OK?” I said “No, not normally — but is it OK for black people to wear blackface?” “The student, sounding outraged, said “Black people don’t wear blackface!” I said “In South Africa, they absolutely do. The so-called colored people in Cape Town have a festival every year called the Coon Carnival where they wear blackface, play Dixieland music and wear striped jackets. It started when a minstrel show came to South Africa in the early 1900’s. Americans who visit South Africa tell them they’re offended they shouldn’t do it, and they answer ‘Buzz off. This is our culture now. Don’t come here from America and tell us what to do.’ So what do you say to them? Is it up to you, a white American, to tell black South Africans what is and isn’t their culture?”I fundamentally don&#39;t understand why the Times didn&#39;t explain this early on. Not necessarily release these statements verbatim, but certainly provide some of this context."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think people who don&#39;t care for long term investments like this are afraid of the idea that the world will go on without them just as well as it is now. They believe in their fear that some catastrophy bigger than their own death must be coming or what was the point of their life at all? The world was fine before you and it will be fine after you. Endeavours like these are the only worthwhile contributions we have to make towards the future."</p>

Do the intermediate nodes have gigabytes of available storage to emit data to the next available node once it becomes visible ?"</p>

I&#39;m pessimistic that we will ever leave our solar system, and if so in 1000 years, I do not care.Hopefully people learn how tiny our bubble is and protect our environment more.
The Martian environment looks so boring -- as a replacement for polluted Earth.
(We will pollute Mars faster than Earth).I&#39;m living at the ocean, trying to keep my vicinity free of garbage.
Today I pulled out pair of trousers and some plastic bands out out water.
Sometimes I&#39;m having fights with my elderly village neighbors, who are burning household trash (paper, wood) on the ocean shore.
I take their garbage out their hands and carry it to my home, later drive to the garbage processing center."</p>
