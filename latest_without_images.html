								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I see a lot of comments misinterpreting this.First, it&#39;s not about private files, it&#39;s about distributing content.Google isn&#39;t spying on your private files, but does scan them when you share them publicly. E.g. keep all the pirated movies you want on your Drive, and even give private access to friends, but the moment you make them publicly viewable Google scans them and limits access accordingly. So no, this isn&#39;t applying to your private diary or privately shared documents.And second, to those who claim absolute free speech with no limits -- notice that the two main categories here are related to democracy and health. All our legal protections ultimately depend on a democratic foundation -- undo that with misinformation and you don&#39;t have anything anymore. Similarly, your rights don&#39;t matter much if you&#39;re dead. Companies aren&#39;t allowed to advertise rat poison as medicine and neither are you."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just cancelled my drive subscription.I don&#39;t know how anyone could continue using it after this.I probably have dozens of docs and hundreds of research papers contradicting government health advice on diabetes and heart disease. These would fall under &#34;Misleading content related to harmful health practices&#34; since they promote a health theory which the government considers harmful.However I would have cancelled regardless since the idea of automatic bans and/or content deletion based on ML models is crazy. They are obviously going to find a lot a false positives and I can&#39;t deal with the idea of trying to speak to google to explain that their algorithm mistakenly flagged my innocent content. In other words even if you are the perfect citizen, there is a chance you will get flagged anyway."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The road to hell is paved with &#34;good intentions&#34;. We desperately need to find a globally adoptable alternative to google and the services that it provides. Docs, Sheets, Drive, etc. are fantastic services in that they work really well on a massive scale. However, Google&#39;s increasing role as an arbiter of right vs wrong and a steward of information puts too much power into the hands of one corporation, whose best interests are provably not aligned with that of the general population.I&#39;ve been working as a SWE at google (in ads...) for over two years and I&#39;ve really started to loathe it over the past year. The pay is fantastic and it&#39;s really hard to walk away from that, but the idea that they are not (or at least no longer) contributing to the better world that I think we need, has started to weigh heavier and heavier on me...We should be able to implement services like these, that are free of ads, on globally distributed infrastructure, with no central authority, to have truly free-flowing information.edit: added quotes around &#34;good intentions&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Okay, this is just straight up awesome. I&#39;ve played piano for 37 years. I&#39;ve built things all my life. But I never even considered the possibility of building a piano from the ground up. Let alone the difficulty of engineering an instrument that defied all the normal parameters. This is real world hacking at its finest. Not to mention it sounds great."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fun story: four years ago, I hired Adrian to move a second-hand piano into our house. We lived on a very steep area with a narrow elbow driveway. Adrian has this incredible spatial memory and fine motor control that I still find it hard to believe how he did it.He loaded the piano in his trailer and basically backed his BMW all the way up with half meter at most on each side, slowly through that elbow bend and parked the trailer&#39;s door right on where we planned to unload the piano. Maybe 2cm away from where he intended to land it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I think because I was so young I absolutely knew it was totally possible to do, I was fully determined and without consulting any professionals I had no barrier stopping me.IMO, this is the mindset of greatness to come. So many who have failed before us are quick to proclaim the impossible. Time and time again humans have displayed that the impossible may in fact be nothing more than a lack of imagination."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I remember when this telescope was first launched and deployed, and how its initial lackluster performance was a great source of mockery and derision of &#34;government overspending for nothing&#34; and a general disdain for space-based science. Since then, it has absolutely revolutionized our understanding of the universe and provided untold inspiration for millions (The famous Deep Field image being the prime example). It is a crowning achievement for NASA and should be used as an example any time some elected official questions the spending on research instruments like this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s amazing how much redundancy was built into those out-of-touch systems, 30 years ago.
However, the number of backup units is finite, so let&#39;s hope the now-operating system can last for several more decades."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was 9 years old when Hubble was launched, today I am 40 years old, so it has been around for all of my adult life and then some.Also, it has provided lots and lots and lots of beautiful pictures that are stunning to look at even for people who otherwise do not care about astronomy at all. I think it&#39;s fair to say that no other project/mission/device since the Moon landing had a bigger impact in making astronomy &#34;cool&#34;. The Hubble Deep Field pictures alone are breath-taking, and they may very well have had as much of an impact on our current model of the universe as Hubble&#39;s original discovery of an expanding universe, at least from the perspective of a non-scientist.As far as I can recall, Hubble was supposed to go down in flames quite a few years ago, but it just kept working, and no equivalent replacement was available. James Webb Space Telescope is not exactly a replacement, as it is an infrared telescope. It will be quite interesting to see how long they can keep Hubble working. It had a rough start, but the fact that after some initial corrections, it has lasted way longer than it was supposed to speaks of the quality of engineering that created it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My daughter is insulin dependent.We live in the UK - which has a fantastic free provision for diabetics, my daughter has a Diasend artificial pancreas (on her phone + a sensor on her arm and a pump for the insulin controlled by the app). This gives her very very high levels of control and flexibility.However, when covid hit I was really scared because I thought that if things went really wrong (beyond loo paper being sold out) there would be no possibility of me protecting my daughter - I simply had no means to provide insulin for her that don&#39;t depend on a large scale modern pharma supply chain.Any way that was viable for insulin to be made in a shed or a garage would be huge from my perspective because it would give me an option in the case of a SHTF situation - right now I haven&#39;t got one. If things go bad, my daughter dies - no if&#39;s no buts. I know (in my heart) that the reality is that if SHTF then I will die too, but the sheer hopelessness of my daughters position is really hard to take."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Looked cool, until i scrolled further down. Not only is any info lacking on how it&#39;s done and what the status is. There are even a bunch of &#34;community projects&#34; listed. Among them &#34;Real Vegan Cheese and Narwhal evolutionary genomics&#34; and &#34;Mushroom Lovers&#34;. Not judging those, but that&#39;s far off from &#34;let&#39;s provide the poor with safe and affordable insulin&#34;. Feels dishonest, tbh."</p>

					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27856593">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There are two kinds of non-competes, and both have problems.First, there&#39;s the really nasty ones saying &#34;If you ever work here, you can&#39;t work for any competitor for X years&#34;, and they&#39;re clearly abusing of employees, labor, etc. I hope there is a straight up ban on that.The second kind is &#34;You can&#39;t compete with us while you work here&#34;. And that is a much more complex beast. Obviously, if I work as a developer making a stock trading app, I shouldn&#39;t be making a competing stock trading app after hours.But my employer does everything. There is no field that my employer is not involved in, somehow. You can guess who they are, probably, or just read my profile. And they say &#34;You cannot do anything that competes with anything we do&#34;. Which is everything. Want to make a Sudoku app? That&#39;s a game, we do games. Want to do some open source ML library work? We do ML, you can&#39;t do ML outside of work (I asked legal that one). And that&#39;s ignoring the who-knows-how-many secret un-released projects that might relate.They don&#39;t even tell us &#34;no&#34; anymore. They just say &#34;read the non-compete agreement and do what it says&#34;. Basically &#34;do what you like, but if we ever feel like it wasn&#39;t right, you&#39;re fired and maybe sued&#34;.And when I apply to other companies, they ask &#34;do you have a github account?&#34;. No, I&#39;ve been highly motivated not to.Edit: eesh, this was a bit of a rant, wasn&#39;t it? Apologies for that. But maybe folks have ideas on what to do about it, apart from the obvious."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I lived in Alabama for 4 years or so and at least at the time (I have no idea if it&#39;s changed since I left), their non-compete situation was garbage.They were valid and enforceable even if you got laid off or fired. One of my friends&#39; mother got laid off in the 2008 financial crisis from Bellsouth (or AT&amp;T, I don&#39;t recall if the (re)merger was finished yet). She was told she couldn&#39;t work for any other telecom in the state for at least 18 months. She ended up going to stay with family in another state for that time so she could find another job, even though her husband and her son were in AL. It was a hard period for them.I&#39;ve had a hatred of non-competes since for the most part. If you (a company) are afraid of losing key talent, maybe you should actively try to retain it rather than turning your company into a prison."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My state has severely limited non-compete agreements to the point that they’re only narrowly enforceable, if at all.That didn’t stop  one of my previous employers from using non-compete scare tactics against employees. Many of us left in a large exodus when benefits and bonuses were cut and management made a number of other bad decisions.The company responded by sending remaining employees an e-mail with a list of competitors that they said would be covered by our non-compete agreement. The e-mail implied that if we wanted to leave for one of those companies we needed to get approval from the legal team before we moved, otherwise we might be at risk of being sued.My lawyer rolled his eyes when I showed it to him and explained that they wouldn’t win due to my state’s laws, but they could try to make my life difficult with legal proceedings if they wanted.The tactic worked enough to scare some of my old coworkers away from taking job offers at competitors, though. Some others also went into hiding and lied on their LinkedIn profiles to prevent their old employer from finding out they went to competitors.Having some clear, national guidelines that make non-competes a non-issue would do wonders for situations like this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t believe the blurred images at the end have anything to do with eye focus, as the author suggests.After all, chromatic aberration is blurring of only a very, very small amount.The demonstrated seemingly negligible perceptual effect of blurring blue to a huge degree in a multicolor image doesn&#39;t seem to have anything to do with that, but rather the fact that we perceive primary blue as a much darker color than primary red or green, and we perceive differences in lighter colors much more easily.If the author were correct that we have big problems focusing on blue, then we&#39;d see that blue text against a black background would be massively blurry -- but it&#39;s simply not. It&#39;s comparatively low-contrast (because blue is a dark color), but it&#39;s nearly indistinguishably as sharp as red and green."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting demo, but I think the retina resolution has more effect on this.Also note that blue neurons are also much less dense, and our eye blue channel has natively much lower resolution.This is why in old Windows installers, blue color was used for gradient, when colors were 16 or 256 -- blue and black dots were blurred in the eyes, while the same combo of green dots was very visible.A windows setup with blue background: https://guidebookgallery.org/pics/gui/installation/copying/w...

								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of my favourite series in art is Yves Klein&#39;s blue work. For anyone unfamiliar, he found a blue that he considered the bluest possible blue [1], and went on a journey painting everything in that blue. I loved that he did this, and then eventually managed to get to an exhibition of his work at the Tate Modern and was absolutely blown away by it - it really needs to be seen in the flesh to appreciate it. There&#39;s something about his blue, that when painted on to a sculpture, almost makes the 3D disappear and the sculpture looks 2 dimensional. Extremely beautiful.As a side note, some (many?) cultures around the world have no word for blue, blue is just other shades of green.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Klein_Blue"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; After hours of interrogation, police told one of the teenagers, Terrill Swift, that if he just confessed to being at the scene he could go home — so he did.What&#39;s the advantage to society of allowing interviewers to lie (to anyone, let alone kids)? Not just insinuate something like &#34;your partner&#39;s in the next room, it&#39;s only a matter of time until he talks so you should come clean now&#34;, but blatantly lie and then be able to rely on the result of that in court?It kinda feels a little like the common law doctrine of Promissary Estoppel [0] where if someone relies on something you&#39;ve promised, you can&#39;t then hold them responsible for relying on that thing.[0] https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/promissory_estoppel"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Every American should watch this video. There is no reason to talk to the police, it will pretty much never help you.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-7o9xYp7eEEdit:
The lawyer made a follow up video clarifying that in routine traffic stops police do have autonomy. So as long as you are reasonable and just showing the policeman you aren&#39;t a public menace is seems ok. For any other reason I&#39;d have my lawyer on me no matter what.Also this video specifically pertains to the 5th US constitutional amendment.Also IANAL but the guy in the video is."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I honestly think police shouldn&#39;t be allowed to interview children at all (at least those under 13), it should be left to forensic psychologists. Not just interrogations, interviews of witnesses or potential victims too. Children are simply so easy to lead in questions, there&#39;s an entire field of study in psychology devoted to figuring out how to ask questions of children without leading them. Here&#39;s some examples: if you ask a child a yes-no question that they don&#39;t understand, they default to saying yes. If you ask them a multi-choice question (&#34;Would you rather X, Y, or Z?&#34;) they default to whichever option was given last."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Often I hear the argument, people saying &#34;I prefer ads that are relevant for me over random ads&#34;. But the result of the tracking is not only that you get &#34;relevant&#34; ads, it&#39;s that your timelines and your feeds and your news gets tweaked in ways that makes you engage with ads as much as possible.Not only do you get manipulated in buying stuff you didn&#39;t ask for (ads in general). You&#39;re also getting spoonfed content that tries to make you as vulnerable as possible to this manipulation. Up to a point that this is downright threatening democracy and our way of life.I guess you could call this a form of censorship. Content gets suppressed, simply because it doesn&#39;t generate enough ad revenue. It&#39;s this type of censorship on &#34;social&#34; media that I consider much more harmful than the type that usually gets most of our attention."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I dislike being tracked as much as the next guy, but I often wonder what &#34;our&#34; ideal end-game goal is? By &#34;our&#34; I mean the typical HN crowd that understands both the technological and the economical implications of this.If we want top-grade products to remain available without a direct monetary transaction (i.e &#34;free&#34;), it seems we must give something that the product providers can turn into monetary value indirectly somehow. Yet it seems we are actively against any such options: We block ads guilt-free, we rally against any attempt at collecting valuable personal information even anonymously, we consider crypto mining in the background (which is basically paying via your electricity bill) borderline malware.I am part of this &#34;we&#34;, and yet I ask myself, what am I willing to give as indirect payment?

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"    After checking the contents of the file to send the report, I was surprised.
    Surprisingly, clearly sensitive information such as GITHUB_REPO_API_KEY and WORKERS_KV_API_TOKEN was displayed. I couldn’t understand what happened for a moment, and when I checked the command log, I found that I accidentally put a link to /proc/self/environ instead of /proc/self/maps.
    […]
    It seems that GitHub notified Cloudflare immediately because GITHUB_REPO_API_KEY (API key of GitHub) was included in the repository, and Cloudflare started incident response immediately after the notification.

    […]

    April 6, 2021 20:30 cdnjs processed the file
    At the same time    GitHub sent an alert to Cloudflare
    At the same time    Cloudflare started an incident response
