								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi guys, Alex Oshmyansky here, CEO of the Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drug Company. Crazy to see our little project at the top of Hacker News!We&#39;re planning to introduce a lot more drugs with transparent prices later this year, cutting out monopolistic middlemen in the supply chain and alleviating pharma drug shortages, particularly for rare and orphan disease conditions.We are looking for a few devs (fullstack, frontend, and backend). If anybody is interested, drop me a line at alex@costplusdrugs.comIn the meantime, happy to answer questions if anyone is interested!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve wondered for a long time how much money could be saved if the non-trivial administrative overhead of insurance companies were removed from all but truly catastrophic cases (where claims start at $10k or more) and medical, dental, and drug costs were paid out of pocket (including via an HSA account).  There are numerous cases where cash-only medical clinics are able to offer up-front pricing for a fraction of what is billed to medical insurance companies.  If Cuban&#39;s idea is &#34;we don&#39;t do insurance but you&#39;re free to pay with an HSA card or seek reimbursement from your insurance company&#34; then this could be a huge winner."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem with drug prices isn&#39;t because of the drug manufacturers, it&#39;s with the middle-men and private insurance companies. At least, that&#39;s what the manufacturers are sayingFor instance, with the manufacturers of insulin, none of them are American and they offer to sell the insulin to everyone at the same price.The problem is that the large insurance companies use just three middle-men drug buyers called Pharmacy Benefits Managers (PBM) who DEMAND growing discounts every year from drug manufacturers, so the drug manufactures have to raise the prices to the US market every year to keep making a profit.Novo Nordisk is willing to sell insulin much cheaper, but the drug buyers demand about a 75% discount off of the wholesale cost or they&#39;ll make the product not covered by the insurance companies they represent. To compensate, they raise the wholesale price in the US so after the forced discounts, they still make the same amount of money.The people who suffer are the ones who don&#39;t have insurance.The solution, at least in the case of insulin, isn&#39;t cheaper prices from the manufacturer, it&#39;s for the US to pass a law that prevents insurance companies from dropping a product based on the refusal to discount the product if it&#39;s under a certain price-per-month.This article seems to cover the finger-pointing between the manufacturers and PBM&#39;s and insurane companies very well: https://www.healthline.com/diabetesmine/pharmacy-benefit-man...?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; These points doubtless make me appear to be a complacent shill for the financial industry, talking down to the rubes. For the record, I’m still angry about the way workers were ripped off in Britain more than three decades ago, and about the way the little guy ended up bearing the brunt for the financial implosions of 2000 and 2008. But it looks horribly to me as though the same thing is going to happen again — and I don’t think the answer to today’s many ills is to empower poor people to bankrupt themselves with margin accounts and derivatives.Who is this hurting, exactly? The author is making it sound like messing up the short stock is somehow hurting &#34;the little guy&#34; in the long run, and I wouldn&#39;t see that happening unless:a) Gamestop is somehow in a bunch of mutual funds tied to employee pensions/401k&#39;sb) The &#34;little guy&#34; refers to the Reddit traders that are making a killing right now, with the expectation that eventually the stock price will crash again.As best I can figure, most of the /r/ guys are doing this as a form of trolling and aren&#39;t expecting to get rich off it or pour their live-savings into it. And again, as best I can figure, the only people this &#34;hurts&#34; are the ones who were originally shorting the stock. So if this comes down to guys on Reddit pissing in Wall Street&#39;s cornflakes, it&#39;s hard for me to feel sympathetic for Wall Street."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are 100 cows.A hedge-fund believes that the milk consumption will go to zero, so they borrow the 100 cows for one month and sell them for $1 each.Then they borrow them again, and sell them once more for 90c. Certain that they will worth $0 at the end of the monthA Redditor notices this. She knows that in a month&#39;s time, the hedge-fund will have to buy 200 cows, and there are only 100 available.Her plan is simple. Buy all 100 cows, and at the end of the month, when the hedge fund will have to buy the cows back(twice), she will be able to dictate the price.Hedge-fund cries foul. Doesn&#39;t like being beaten in it&#39;s own game.Milk consumption doesn&#39;t even matter."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s none of my business if Ikea wants to buy productive forest land and take it out of production.However, I don&#39;t understand how it is any kind of signal of virtue.Would it be virtuous to buy productive farm land and take it out of circulation?How is forest land any different?In a previous life, it would be broadly correct to say that I worked in the forest industry.  My body still hurts when I think about it.I worked for wood lot owners, felling trees, trimming off the branches, sectioning the logs, splitting the wood and then stacking it to be sold by the cord.  These woodlots had been in operation for over 150 years.  Same land, different trees.  They still operate now.I also worked as a tree planter, hired by small contractors working for &#39;big forest&#39;.  Us tree planters went in after the heavy equipment had ripped out the trees, tearing the land to shreds in the process.  It felt like what ground would have been like after a B-52 strike, an eerie hell scape, but with an explosion of small plants and flowers with new access to the sun, deer and other wildlife roaming free, wondering at the strange human interloper.  Sometimes wolves and bears, at which point it felt rather lonely, me with a Swiss Army knife (mostly for the fork) and my nearest crew mate being well outside shouting distance.The churned up land we were planting had been pulp forest itself for over a hundred years.  As I planted, others were taking soil and water samples.  To the forest company, the forest was a long term asset and that it thrived was in their interest.I didn&#39;t think about it much then, but others long dead had planted that ground before me.  Those foot long trees I planted have long been harvested and new trees planted in their place.Trees are like wheat, or corn, or quinoa.  Except instead of being a once a year crop, trees are once every twenty five years or so.Otherwise, what&#39;s the difference?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Somewhat related. IKEA is the largest owner of forests in Lithuania (around 33% of the total land area is forest):https://www.lrt.lt/en/news-in-english/19/1104260/ikea-the-bi...At the time of this article (2019), they owned 66,000 acres of forest in the country."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not implying that this is corporate propaganda to cater to the US public, but something similar happened to my country where saving the planet is not on the agenda of its citizens since there are other problems that need to be solved first. [1]&#34;IKEA’s goal is to purchase wood which is 100 per cent FSC-certified from these countries. At the same time there are many indications that forests with high conservation values are being logged by FSC-certified companies. FSC-certification is far from a guarantee for socially- and environmentally friendly forestry and FSC has received serious criticism from many environmental organizations, both in Sweden and internationally.  Several environmental organizations have left FSC in protest. &#34; [2]So practically, you have a situation where IKEA acts on some shady rules established by this FCS that are unreliable. Moreover, countries with corrupt officials will eventually end up in prison but too late, before the harm is done. Generally, if as a Romanian I go outside to protest against IKEA and corrupt politicians exploiting the Carpathians, I&#39;m told that I don&#39;t respect private property and that IKEA acts according to the laws of that country (created by corrupt policians with shady lobbies), in the end IKEA becomes the victim.[1] https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/ikea-buys-83000-acre-fore...

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a fantastic article, it does miss one very key point about bog-standard HTML which is worth mentioning though.The standard widgets are all accessible, people with screen readers, limited mobility, poor vision, etc, all rely on pages being written so the devices they use to read the web can function properly. People who choose to eschew these standard components very frequently end up with a site which is unusable for disabled people.Very few people have the skill to turn a div into an effective button, yet over and over I see web sites with rows of buttons which are in fact just divs with javascript behind them.Making your site accessible isn&#39;t just a good practice, in the US, it is the law. Courts have ruled that the ADA applies to web sites along with any other type of business.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am not a front-end developer but looking at it from a distance I really don&#39;t get modern web design. Sure some sites might need fancy javascript single page features, like if your webpage is an interactive map or realtime game, but most sites are just text and some pictures. Whats with all the javascript? Your site looks just like the next one anyway! It feels like an &#34;Emperor&#39;s New Clothes&#34; situation or maybe more likely I just don&#39;t understand the allure as an clueless user.. I am almost tempted to make a webpage to see what the big fuss is about!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Made me think of a time I didnt do adequate research before buying an expensive flight ticket: I was in Changi Airport and had a cheap return ticket to Malaysia, when I got back I was going to travel in the east coast of Australia for a few weeks as the end of my study abroad in Asia.
It dawned to me that I never actually checked the Visa rules for Australia, but just pressumed that they would be like any othet commonweath country I had previously visited. Turned out I was lucky and didnt need a paper visa, but could do with an e-visa. 
As my HTC Desire Android phone had died in the humiddity, I only had the cheapest nokia I could find, X-1 ... Armed with a 2011 public internet kiosk of internet explorer, I tabulated through the australian immigration forms and found the correct form, filled it out while my browsing session of the kiosk expired, after a few tries, I knew exactly the way around the static site, and was what some would call &#34;speedrunning&#34; through their website. After sumbitting I just had to hope for the best. If that site had been required any more than it did, I am not sure I would have been able to submit my application through that public internet browser."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In graduate school, in my lab there was a grad student who was kind of an unlikely &#34;professor&#39;s pet&#34;.  He was tall and had surfer&#39;s long hair with a bit of a hippie aesthetic.  Anyways, he was also really completely clueless about how to do science correctly, but also, I guess, really good about playing politics (there was a time when he asked me to put some bacterial plasmid DNA on my mammalian cells.  I told him &#34;it doesn&#39;t work that way&#34;, but I did it anyways and handed over the cells, and he got the observation he was expecting).  On his main project he was teamed up with a super sketchy foreign postdoc that I was convinced would say anything to get high profile papers out.So they did a series of experiments and reported results that screamed &#34;artefact&#34;.  On one of them, for example, the postdoc got trained to use the electron microscope and they went through thousands and thousands of images to pick out the one that had &#34;just the right morphology&#34; (I am pretty sure they were snapping photos of salt crystals).  On another, they reported that their research subject protein was so fast at the process we were studying that everything occurred IN MIXING TIME.  That to me, screams &#34;you are not doing your experiments carefully&#34;.Meanwhile I was sweating balls working on a very careful preparation of similarly finicky proteins (you agitate them and they do bad things since they&#39;re metastable) and finally got it to produce reproducible results.  I suggested they adapt my preparation to their protein but they couldn&#39;t give a damn, they had already published their paper and had moved on to sexier proteins.But then an intern was put on the project, and she could not reproduce their results, after working on it for six months (she is careful and honest).  At the end, I felt so bad for her, I offered to train her on my technique, but she passed.  I think she was burned out on the project.  I asked if I could get a sample of the protein that she had prepped, and she agreed.I ran the protein through my preparatory technique and observed that there was a contamination that could have seeded the kinetics of their process.  Upon isolating an uncontaminated sample, I carefully but briskly rushed the sample over to the machine.  Nothing.  Curious, I jacked the temperature up to get it going faster.  Nothing.  I left it in the machine overnight.  Nothing.  Finally, convinced that I had likely done something wrong, I dropped the sample in a shaker at temperature, came back the next day and recorded amazingly high signal.  In short, the observation that it was &#34;super fast&#34; was entirely an artefact.As I, too, was trained on the Electron Microscope, I quickly spotted my sample onto an EM disc, reserved some time and hopped on the &#39;scope.  The first grid sector I looked at, there was literally TEXTBOOK morphology in front of my eyes.I stapled together my results, gave it to the grad student, and told him that the general gist of his paper was probably still correct, but that he should be careful about characterizing his protein as exceptional.  I then said it was in his hands to do the right thing.What do you think he did?  Nothing, of course.  He kept on the talks circuit, still talking about how exceptional his discovery was, and to date there have been no retractions.  He even won the NIH grad student of the year award.The epilog is that after a decade of floundering I realized that even though I am pretty good at science, I was no good at playing academic politics and quit the pursuit; I drove for lyft/uber for a bit, and now I&#39;m a backend dev.  I am certain that my experiences are not unique.  Amazingly the intern returned to our lab, and had her own three-year stint chasing ghosts that turned out to be overoptimistic interpretation of results reported by a postdoc.Oh.  What happened to the grad student?  He&#39;s a professor in the genomics department at UW."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article mentions Brandolini’s Law:“The amount of energy needed to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude larger than to produce it.”It&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve heard it, but it&#39;s a very appropriate observation in today&#39;s world where misinformation travels faster and wider than correct information. If you&#39;re just making stuff up, it&#39;s much faster than looking up sources."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A fried of mine reported scientific misconduct (p-hacking) and, together with a few colleagues, left the research group, due to moral harassment by the head of that group.The university removed all of them from the research group and said they could continue working on the data because it belongs to the university.3 months later:- investigations of scientific fraud against the people leaving (neglecting authorship because the data could after all not be used and the head wanted a say in the articles, i.e., change them completely). Also some random other allegations that didn&#39;t stick.- police investigation of defamation (because they reported the scientific misconduct and some other misleading statements used by the head in sales for a research-related product)- the university now expects them to contact the head of the ex-research group to clarify questions of authorship- the head meanwhile continues as before"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was addicted to Twitter in high school. I spent hours on it at night, getting no sleep. I spent so much time and mental bandwidth thinking of funny things to say or memes to make to get more likes. I was addicted to the likes and keeping up with everyone I knew.First semester of college, I stopped using Twitter. My sleep got better, I had more free time, and I was noticeably happier and freer. I no longer spent time in that dopamine cycle.I&#39;ve been weening off of Reddit and HN the past few months as well. YouTube is my next beast to conquer, and that might be the biggest one for me right now. I&#39;m trying to adapt to longer form content again, instead of only watching videos under a minute or reading 280 character tweets. I want to have an attention span again, I really do.Is social media an inherently evil thing? I don&#39;t think so, but I don&#39;t think I should use it.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Aside: I&#39;ve heard about web platform tests, but I never realized that it could be a viable alternative to MDN for representing browser compatibility information. In this case they have a pretty good collection of tests [1] that give you a picture of overall WebRTC compatibility. Of course MDN is still the gold standard and we on web.dev will always link there as our default choice when they do a good job representing browser compatibility data, but in this case they don&#39;t seem to have a good table representing the state of WebRTC at large [2] (happy to update the article if it&#39;s just an oversight on my part and they do have a good browser compat table somewhere that I missed). Specifically, it seems like the WebRTC API page [3] should have a list of the browser compatibility of each of the interfaces that are mentioned on the page.[1] https://wpt.fyi/results/webrtc?label=experimental&amp;label=mast...[2] https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API[3] https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_APIDisclosure: I edited the web.dev announcement"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have tried using this API and found it incredibly technical and complex. Personally I find the PeerJS library an excellent wrapper rendering it useable.Hopefully over time it will become more accessible."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Even if you don’t find the tool useful, the implementation under the hood is very clever. The dependency graph between the jobs is stored as a bunch of live processes flock()ing on each other’s log files. Once the files are unlocked, the process execs the requested job. This makes the scheduling and error handling code much simpler. Also, right now the dependency graph is dense (a job depends on all previous jobs) but it would be straightforward to thin it out to allow parallel jobs.Overall, a clever trick I intend to steal."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The AIX print spooler can be used as a generic queueing system - I remember setting up queues with shells as backends. Jobs sent to those queues would then be executed in sequence, and could be cancelled/reprioritized/etc like any print job.Can&#39;t claim any credit for the idea though, it was actually suggested in the documentation...It might be possible on other unix systems too, but I never had to try it."</p>
