This morning I woke up with a cheerful notification that Google can help with COVID notifications and gov.ma.covid19.exposurenotifications.v3 installed -- the app was pushed overnight over explicit instructions NOT to update (sure, one can say auto-install != auto-update, but it is worrying that forced pushes can happen even with every single relevant UI switch turned off).adb logcat seems to have the following relevant lines:    06-19 09:27:54.481  1689  1990 I PackageManager: Integrity check passed for file:///data/app/vmdl1074248108.tmp

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It is obvious that we need better legislation to deal with all the new possibilities that technologies have opened.The installation of this app, even done with good intent, open a lot of questions on what should be possible or not to be done by government and corporations.When you get a device with pre-installed, uninstallable, or auto-installed apps. What are the rules?&gt; &#34;By enabling this service, you can be quickly notified if you’ve likely been exposed to the virus by another MassNotify user, allowing you to reduce risk to your loved ones, seek medical attention, and slow the spread in your community.&#34;In this case it seems that the same goal could have been better achieved by SMS that do not depend on the brand of your phone. The dependency on proprietary app stores and OSs seems a risk for the continuation of a free and reliable communications.The only thing that is impossible to achieve without an app is to allow the user to select contacts to whom send a notification. Corporations like Google, and Apple know the list of all your contacts. So, it seems that the intention of the app is to reduce friction and send notifications as easy and effortlessly as possible to avoid that procrastination causes people to delay the warning.But, instead of the silent install the government could have spend money in advertisement campaigns to assure a correct amount of installations. It costs money, but, people pay taxes so the government can engage on this type of initiative at a scale. This could have been a very good alternative, even if it means increasing the budged. Medical emergencies are worth the investing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fellow humans, there are alternatives! Your neck need not be under FAANG&#39;s boot! You don&#39;t even need to give up any functionality:CalyxOS: https://calyxos.org/
Privacy-respecting Android distribution that replaces Google spyware with MicroG, so you can have your cake and eat it too. Most everything will work as you&#39;re used to, but it does still talk to Google to make that happen.GrapheneOS: https://grapheneos.org/
Very much like Calyx, but extra-hardened and with no MicroG. No involvement with Google at all.LineageOS: https://lineageos.org/
The successor to CyanogenMod, will work with many different phones. More privacy and control than stock Android.There are also many others: Sailfish, Replicant, eHardware-wise: CalyxOS and GrapheneOS run best on Pixel 3, 3a, 3XL, 4, 4a, 4XL, 5. The path of least resistance is to get one of these phones and run CalyxOS (if there is an app you need to use that needs Google services like Firebase Cloud Messaging...note that many that can use FCM will run fine without), otherwise run GrapheneOS.You can also buy a Librem 5 https://puri.sm/products/librem-5/
If privacy and security and hacking are really important to you.Or a pinephone: https://www.pine64.org/pinephone/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Disclaimer: I work at Microsoft, but not on Windows (and I deal with a SaaS at MSFT). I am a FreeBSD committer and help maintain FreeBSD&#39;s GNOME packages and (very recently) the graphics drivers.The reason why Windows is full of UI inconsistencies is (largely) because of one thing: backwards compatibility.While backwards compatibility has it&#39;s perks, it also means having lots of old code in Windows that can&#39;t be touched very easily without breaking compatibility, And that means many old UI elements may stay, that&#39;s a side effect.While desktop Linux/BSD isn&#39;t exactly well known for it&#39;s UIs, I found GNOME 3/40 to be more consistent UI-wise than Windows 10, being a user of GNOME 3 on FreeBSD at home (which I am typing this comment from), and helping port GNOME 40, while (unsurprisingly) using Windows 10 at $DAYJOB.But then GNOME, KDE, Apple, et al. is more willing to break things than Windows is. They aren&#39;t as bound to legacy compatibility, so old UI elements can be shed easily."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like the Run dialog and the folder properties menu and others that have been untouched since the early days. Their utility has been proven and so much muscle memory has been built up. I can not possibly imagine a revision that could be done to them that would have more benefits than simply leaving them be.All of the Fluent/Metro designs have made things markedly worse. For example, check out the Metro control panel widget for selecting a default program for a file extension. It&#39;s a list view with 5 file extensions visible at a time, with no search. That&#39;s what I think of when I hear about a Windows UI update, and I&#39;d love to be proven wrong."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This issue is way overblown here on HN.In day-to-day usage, I have rarely been annoyed by these &#34;inconsistencies&#34;.The best example to illustrate this article is: Installing a driver with the Windows XP layer. That&#39;s probably something that will only happen to people installing very old hardware with drivers from over 10 years ago. I consider that a backward compatibility win: It is great that it even works in Windows 10."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What a fascinating case. There are so many details in such a short articles that is each worth its own discussion!Let’s start with my personally theory that hopefully won’t color all of the conversation about the individual points. This guy pissed off some people and those people are using their petty power to make his life hell. It’s like the 10’s of thousands of people jaywalking without issue and then the homeless guy that gets arrested for jaw walking. We all know that’s not why he was arrested but the law is clear, he was breaking the law, and they enforced it. So the individual incident dots it’s I’s and crosses it’s t’s as long as you don’t bring up the dreaded ‘uneven enforcement’ issue which is at the heart of everything wrong with the law in America. I have no evidence for the theory but it makes sense with the multiple issues involving this guy mentioned in such a short article.Next interesting point. Is giving a speech about how to treat a broken bone considered ‘practicing medicine’? Who gets to decide the answer. Is a PHD candidate writing an exploration of the efficacy of the various methods for treating a migraine practicing medicine? What if he’s selling copies of his paper on the checkout counter at the drug store? I use medicine instead of engineering because I think it’s easier to discuss but the point should hold the same regardless of which licensed profession we are discussing.Shit I have to run but hope to return to this conversation to discuss the other fun questions raised."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Texas may do a lot of crazy things when it comes to state government, but one thing I think we definitely got right is the Texas Sunset Commission (https://www.sunset.texas.gov/). Basically, all boards set up by the state government are automatically abolished every 10 years I believe unless the state legislature passes a law to continue the board.  So every 10 years the Sunset Commission evaluates agencies/boards about to expire and gives recommendations on if they should be merged, eliminated, etc.The whole idea is to prevent these little long-running fiefdoms from continuing indefinitely, where board members just become more concerned about their own power than their stated purpose.People being people it&#39;s not perfect, but it does go a long way to cut down on this type of abuse."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Of course it&#39;s corporate corruption of government that is driving this case.&#34;he is an engineer at heart and speaks up when he sees people make what he believes to be engineering mistakes. He has written letters to state and county governments and testified before a county commission. But Wayne’s troubles began when he when he agreed to help his son, Kyle, a North Carolina attorney, with a case about a piping system that allegedly flooded a few local homes&#34;If he were telling lies, he would be legally accountable to the individuals or companies that his lies harmed.  That would probably be an easy case to bring against him to stop him from telling lies.  But this approach of trying to silence him on grounds of not technically being an engineer shows plainly that he is telling enough truth that he wouldn&#39;t be accountable for lying and causing harm.Cases like this are probably common, although the methods of silencing vary from situation to situation.  While the US may not be as corrupt as many other countries, it still has a significant amount which ultimately harms the general public and certainly harms the few individuals that find themselves on the wrong side of a corrupt authority."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I vehemently disagree that vertical space used is negligible.  Due to standard aspect ratios, the vertical space of the display is at a premium. 1920*1080 means you have 840 less vertical pixels than horizontal - it makes a lot of sense to me to try to reclaim some of that space for actual content instead of widgets."</p>

They made a series of patches that allow games to utilize one of the SNES enhancement chips on various games.

That&#39;s actually a bit of slowdown rather than an effect."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Another thing I’ve discovered is that many students— not just a couple here and there, but several in every class— consistently use umlauts in place of quotation marks and acute accent marks in place of apostrophes.&gt;I don’t know how this happens— I had to do some poking around on character code tables just to figure out how to replicate the effect.Look at the Spanish Mexican keyboard layout: http://kbdlayout.info/KBDLA/It has the umlaut (actually diaeresis in a Spanish context I think) and acute accent mark pretty prominently available.Look at the Spanish Spain keyboard layout: http://kbdlayout.info/kbdspIt has them even more prominently available, right on the same key that an English American keyboard would have the single and double quote.I wonder whether the students&#39; families are from Spain or Mexico, and whether they&#39;re using the Spain vs the Mexico keyboard.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve made similar comments in the past but I think we’re just trying to predict too much about what programs are trying to do in hardware.I’d rather have simple hardware that is light on energy requirements and easier to understand. I don’t think software as an industry really has a “this chip isn’t fast enough problem”. Most of the real slowdowns anyone has in day to day performance has more to do with inefficient code than hardware anyways.Look at old game consoles (like a regular old PlayStation) and what they were able to render on what today would be laughably slow hardware. They could do it because developers learned the stack inside and out.I’m hopeful that the emergence of arm as a desktop/server competitor will help in some ways by putting enough pressure on companies like intel to really rethink some of their core stuff, but who knows."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I know this is so different, but I can&#39;t help but think of the 1950&#39;s DoD Heavy Press Program[0]. I think about these special industrial monsters a lot when I read about semi fabs.In WW2 after examining the components from aircraft kills, german wing spars would often survive. It was discovered that Germany used unique forged alloy wing spars to achieve their excellent aircraft performance, perplexing allied engineers. These wing spars&#39; strength and weight is critical to the structural properties of modern air frames. Without them, jet air craft like the f-15 would have been impossible.Machining these advanced alloy parts proved difficult, expensive, error prone, and impossible to manufacture but a die forged alloy wing spar was stronger, lighter, cheaper and beyond the industrial capability of every allied nation. We did not have the metallurgical technology to create such a large forged alloy wing spar in 1945.After the war, the US and Soviets recovered designs for the extremely large press assemblies required for advanced air frames. In the 1950s, a huge national program was geared up to create absolutely massive Heavy Press machines. The Soviets had a massive 30,000lb press for these parts, and we created a couple of monstrous 50,000lb machines[1] that are still in operation today. These things are older than we are and still out there cranking out air frame parts today for modern air frames in 2021.Without this kind of national investment in this kind of unique manufacturing, we would be unable to fly without importing 747 parts from wherever they could be created.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_Press_Program

China is going through a whole of society effort to expand its semiconductor sector in order to not be dependent on anything the US can cut off via sanctions. China will expand its semiconductor sector, regardless whether it is economical feasible, because it is a matter of national security.The countries that are going to be hurt by these US semiconductor subsidies are going be Taiwan, South Korea, Japan ... not China."</p>

I think of that place as a form of institutionalised child abuse, and frankly if someone pipebombed it, I would not shed a tear.One simple thing: it wasn’t authoritarian adults or teachers. If anything, they were AWOL. It was the students that really made each other’s life hell. Of course, we were teenagers. Much later, I stopped blaming the individuals and started blaming the institution.Here’s a tiny anecdote. One guy, who I think was genuinely evil, took psychology as a minor subject. As an experiment, he decided to drive another, younger, vulnerable pupil mad. Gaslighting him, messing with his head, that kind of stuff. And he succeeded!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was sent to an “emotional growth boarding school” in the ‘90s. I wasn’t kidnapped but many of my schoolmates were. A few years later the department of education (can’t remember if it was state or federal) shut the school down after stories got out about the horrific things that were going on there. Kids forced to sit in corners for days at a time, ambulances not being called for kids who had very seriously self-harmed, strip searches (administered by other kids), physical restraints... I could go on. The place had a cult-like atmosphere that was centered on the headmaster and his weird homegrown therapeutic method.I had nightmares for years afterwards and still haven’t fully come to grips with what happened there."</p>
