Here is the github repo for their open source adblock engine written in rust:https://github.com/brave/adblock-rustHere is a (somewhat dated) article describing it by the authors:https://brave.com/improved-ad-blocker-performance/&gt; Google will take decisions that benefit their advertisement business, like making impossible to use adblockers on any Chromium based browser.Because the brave adblocker is integrated directly into the browser (ie. not an extension) the Manifest V3 limitations don&#39;t apply."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find Brave Rewards very egregious. You get lots of BAT and the marketing copy hypes it up immensely without mentioning, anywhere, that you need to provide your SSN and Driver&#39;s License to a third-party (Uphold) if you actually, you know, want to cash out.This seems particularly irritating because, let&#39;s say you set your browser to show you the max amount of ads for a while. You saved up for a few months, decided you had enough, tried to cash out only to discover that slap in your face that they never mentioned. Of course this benefits them, but the fact that the browser puts you in the situation of giving up your privacy to receive money is ridiculous for a &#34;privacy&#34; browser."</p>

Every time I&#39;ve looked into it, it seems much worse.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Amateur mistake, compared to my professional mistakes.I once wrote a bot that sent email within the company (100K+ employees). I kick-started the bot on a server remotely and only then discovered it&#39;s an endless loop. It required server admin rights to stop it, which I did not have.I couldn&#39;t immediately reach server admins so had to physically drive there. An hour or so later somebody helped me kill the process.The emails already sent could not be cleared out server-side, which meant that recipients had freezing email clients for over a week, unable to handle the volume, a typical 300K new emails per recipient. They had to Ctrl+A and Delete 100 emails, do this for the next 100, and so on, whilst not deleting real and useful emails.I pretty much destroyed email for those people.I don&#39;t just destroy things at scale though, also at home. Around the time we had our first home broadband internet connection, I set up a web server and just kept my PC running. Unknown to me, the web server software included an email server with open relay enabled by default.About 3 days later, my dad complained about the internet connection not working. The IPS detected the issue (millions of emails sent out via my home server) and gave us a red card, fully shutting us down, permanently."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Aww I’m feeling bad for the poor engineer who is saying “crap” a thousand times now, or is blissfully unaware that their day is about to get much worse.Once during a system upgrade we ran some scripts and they triggered emails to about 8,000 people before we realized it (would’ve been 150k people otherwise). The next day was all about clean up, sending an apology email etc.My mother had visited the next day and asked why I wasn’t hanging out and my son (6 at the time) said, totally unphased, “oh he can’t come now because he’s saying sorry to 8,000 people”Hope you get through it! These mistakes happen. Oh, and your test passed. :-)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I joined, I was perplexed by this way of operating meetings. It surprised me greatly that people wouldn&#39;t want to read the doc at ahead, give it time for thinking and researching, and then come to the table feeling prepare to contribute to the best if your ability.Now, I understand and deeply appreciate this method. I believe it provides lots of benefits. It drives towards better docs that can be understood quickly by non-experts. When there are just a few minutes to review the doc, we don&#39;t have time to go digging for information on our own - the critical information must be provided in the material given. There will also be SMEs in the room who can clarify any shortcomings here. Because the audience of the docs is non-SMEs, it drives towards inclusion of other teams. From this, you get more diverse viewpoints, considerations, and experience. It also contributes towards cross-team awareness and education. It makes it much easier to participate as a contributor to the meeting while simultaneously less impactful when you don&#39;t. It let&#39;s us timebox our attention span - you won&#39;t accidentally spend hours rabbit-holing into a doc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Amazonion here. The purpose of doc writing is for the author to dump their ideas and convey the critical pieces of information. It lets the reader consume the information at their pace, and re-read even after the meeting. The document starts the conversation and let’s the reader understand the problem, why it’s important, what things we have or have not considered, what trade offs have been made, and how we arrived at the conclusion or solution.There are many, many things Amazon does not get right. The document writing culture is probably one of our not so secret, “secret weapons”.At many companies I worked at, we had a PowerPoint or presentation driven culture. And the purpose of those meetings is to listen to the presenter, at the presenters pace. The meeting becomes about the presenter and what they think is important, as opposed to being about the reader. In presentation driven meetings, the presenter talks and questions actually distract from the presentation - often times presenters will bluntly ask for questions to be saved to the end.My own team has a strong culture of getting engineers to write, and help them write well. It’s not about perfect English, but it is about touching on the key points and letting readers comment and ask questions.Meetings without documents often go completely off the rails - especially because if the kinds of problems we’re solving. Without focus, meetings delve into tangents and branches off of those tangents. To be fair - this still happens if the document hasn’t been adequately prepared, but often because you find the document owner hasn’t fully thought through the problem or fully did their homework."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"An ex-Amazon PM ‘promoted’ the silent reading culture in my previous company. Definitely brought a lot of benefits:- forced more senior / leadership members to read through and internalize the details. Reduces wasted time asking already answered questions.- we used google docs. Question and answers were posted as comments. This formed a log of the majority of the discussion. Less note taking needed.- allowed less assertive members to ask questions or give answers.The only drawback - the overwhelming silence at the start that I never really got over…"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Two interesting takeaways:&gt; This is the beautiful thing about having a company that isn&#39;t on the stock market. Imagine you have a company that goes slower and slower every quarter, and then you confront the shareholders with the statement, that the way to solve it, is to do absolutely no new features for a quarter or two, refactor the code, learn new methodologies etc. I doubt that the shareholders would allow that. Luckily, we don&#39;t have any shareholders, and we understand the vital importance of this investment in the long run. Not only in the project, but also in our skill and knowledge, so we do better next time.This is reassuring the notion of what I think actually matters, what the real essence is of developing a product, may that be a piece of art and entertainment (like here) or a productivity tool etc.There are creators and there are consumers. We split them up by developers, designers, domain experts and so on, but what matters is that all the other participants, especially those who can exert power traditionally are not part of the essence and if not being careful and responsible, can easily add complexity and limitations that are entirely accidental and can even be harmful.This reminds me of the agile manifesto, modern UX approaches and other processes that are driven by creators, but are often and very unfortunately being bent over backwards to fit into hierarchical power structures.&gt; TDD actually is the constant fast swithing between extending the tests and making them pass continously. So as you write tests, you write code to satisfy them basically at the same time. This allows you to instantly test what you write, and mainly use tests as specifiation of what the code should acctually do, which guides the thought process to make you think about where you are headed to, and to write code that is more structured and testable from the very beginning.The important notion here is that TDD is not about tests and correctness, but about development. It continuously checks assumptions and explores the surrounding code, state and data until a sufficient solution is found.If we squint a little we can see how closely related TDD with REPL Driven Development is. In essence it is the same thing and even has similar results, where the tests or REPL code can be left as an artifact for further, likely historical understanding.We know now that neither is sufficient for a high degree of correctness, but they are certainly useful for understanding and development."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d be curious to hear what kovarex thinks in 2-3 months.TDD is often sold as a fix-all solution, which is incredibly appealing to mgmt and quite fun for most programmers as a new paradigm, allowing for quick adoption.It also has its uses, especially in the enterprise space where requirements aren&#39;t often clear. But I don&#39;t know many good programmers that truly stick to the dogma after the honeymoon period. It becomes just another tool in your toolset.Uncle bob is a salesman, not a &#34;craftsman&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Every time a Factorio thread makes it to HN I feel like a fully recovered meth addict who suddenly has their old dealer knocking at their door:--Dealer: &#34;Hey? You there? I got some meth for you.&#34;Me: &#34;Go away! I don&#39;t want any!&#34;Dealer: &#34;Oh now don&#39;t say that. You remember how good it is? I know you do.&#34;Me: &#34;I can&#39;t, I can&#39;t afford it, the price is too high.&#34;Dealer: &#34;What? Come on, it&#39;s free! You already paid for it!.Me: &#34;I&#39;ll lose my job, I can&#39;t, just go away!&#34;Dealer: &#34;Your JOB? This IS your job. Open the damn door, THE FACTORY MUST GROW&#34;Me: ::cowers in the closet chanting please leave please leave please leave::--Also it was never good. It was more like a mind virus. Like the sort of problem or project at work you can&#39;t stop thinking about until it&#39;s done. Only with Factorio, it&#39;s never done. Never.My best defense against it are other video games I can stop &amp; start when needed.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think anybody developing open source / collaborative commons software that targets non-technical users could learn some tricks from streetcomplete. It has managed to lower barriers to entry and seems to get many people engaged in what is quite a technical area. Some UI expert might be better able break it down but here is my braindump of some key factors:* at a basic level, generally smooth handling of drawing of a legible map and basic UI functions (esp. compared with some other foss openstreetmap apps, no need to name names :-)* considerably narrows down the map editing options. by presenting controlled choice lists the novice editor feels &#34;safe&#34;* uses simple and innocent gamification (scoreboards, &#34;unlocking&#34; websites etc)There are ofcourse glitches and indeed a keen openstreetmap enthousiast may &#34;outgrow&#34; it relatively quickly but assuming the devs get further support and build on the initial success it could be a reference point for highly usable open source apps targeting larger audiences"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I personally have problems with doors, and stuff that should be locked. I can never be sure I locked properly.Totally did backtrack unreasonable distances just to check if I had closed the door.It&#39;s all fine when it&#39;s my door. Worst case scenario, I get robbed.However it&#39;s more of a problem when it&#39;s someone else&#39;s door. Worst case scenario, they get robbed, and that&#39;s a different story. Or pets get out...Obviously I can&#39;t take the door on my front seat... So my solution is to take a picture of me trying to open the door, a kind of proof that it&#39;s closed.And, would you know it, it works!

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember a panel on a news program years ago where the one guest was a psychologist who was treating &#34;untreatable&#34; drug addicts by getting them &#34;hooked&#34; on running or weightlifting or martial arts.  They would stop drugs but would instead be doing martial arts for hours a day or running 20 miles every morning.  Then he would start treating the addiction personality and causes, but in many cases the patients would just stop coming and live three or more hours of every day in the gym.The other guests were various degrees of horrified.His patients went from literally living on the street as heroin addicts to doing 3 hour gym sessions and holding down a job; and his peers thought he shouldn&#39;t be allowed to practice.Recently I was reading a book on ADHD and the author was quite adamant that you could only be diagnosed with ADHD if your life was worse than  &#34;the norm&#34;.  In this view, if you have symptoms of ADHD but can, for instance, hold down a good job then by definition you don&#39;t have ADHD.  I deleted the book from my Audible account."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve read most of Scott&#39;s blog posts and he rarely mentions OCD and when he does it tends to be &#34;this is what I think people with OCD experience&#34; and not &#34;this is what my patients have told me&#34; which leads me to believe that he is not an expert in OCD.I have OCD and it&#39;s ruined my life in ways that are hard to articulate. Which is why I can point out two good reasons why what&#39;s being described might not be a good idea. First, giving into compulsions just legitimizes them and reinforces the patterns that are central to OCD and can ultimately make things worse. Secondly, OCD has a habit of changing how it manifests. Sure, maybe the woman is no longer bothered by the hairdryer, but what happens when it becomes changes to worrying if the oven is on? She&#39;ll be right back where she started.I doubt that the anecdote actually happened as described. It&#39;s way too contrived, simplistic and borders on &#34;Psychiatrists hate her! Cure your OCD with this one simple trick!&#34;. Realistically, OCD is incredibly insidious and if it were that simple to cure then nobody would have OCD. What&#39;s described is, at best, a short-term fix and half the psychiatrists likely knew that such things rarely stick.I&#39;ve had the same thing happen to me more times than I can count. I think I found the silver bullet, a way to permanently defeat my obsessive thoughts. If I&#39;m lucky then it&#39;ll last a week before my OCD comes back in full force. But the truth is that you cannot directly fight OCD, it&#39;s like squeezing dough. When you clamp down in one spot, it just squirts out somewhere else. There&#39;s a quote that I think describes it perfectly &#34;To hate me is to give me breath, to fight me is to give me strength&#34;. Fighting OCD or giving into its demands is just falling into its traps. You only truly win when you reach a point where you don&#39;t respond to it."</p>

MAPS.ME was a much better client, with faster and prettier UI until they started monetizing the app in the last year or so (?). Glad to see this new fork of MAPS.ME in the same privacy-first and open-source spirit of earlier clients.Another OSM client that I&#39;ve recently fallen in love with is StreetComplete. Its UI is fantastic, though it is geared towards gamification of map metadata enrichment. I wish they would do a full OSM client using whatever technology its uses in the future.

BRouter on Android is a bit tricky to set up (you need to download routing tiles in addition to the map files through a really ugly UI), but once you&#39;re done it&#39;s the best bike navigator I can think of (and it&#39;s really fast).The BRouter profiles are highly customizable, check out Poutnik&#39;s repositories [3] for examples.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I appeciate how Schmidhuber puts focus on non-US-centric history of Deep Learning and modern AI.He sometimes overdoes these. Even when something is not related to Deep Learning and modern AI. He tries to push very narrow and one-sided views without much room for nuance.For example- &#34;Turing used his (quite inefficient) model only to rephrase the results of Gödel and Church on the limits of computability.&#34;He is trying to say that Turing did nothing new, his work is a mere extension of Godel&#39;s (!), and he only accounted for practical computational reality. That is not true.He goes on further by saying, &#34;Later, however, the simplicity of these machines made them a convenient tool for theoretical studies of complexity.&#34; Like, Turing and Church&#39;s work was only good for that. I digress. I believe that Turing&#39;s work is more seminal and paved the way for modern general computers.Another bit here says &#34;The formal models of Gödel (1931-34), Church (1935), Turing (1936), and Post (1936) were theoretical pen &amp; paper constructs that cannot directly serve as a foundation for practical computers.&#34;It is putting the works of Turing, Post, Church, and Godel all together. Like they are the same. I see the logic as they are all impractical, but they are different levels of impractical. Putting them all under one bracket like that makes no sense.I respect Schmidhuber a lot, but some of his behaviour is borderline childish which are more pronounced in his claims about AI history. You should be skeptical about what he says (and what anyone says).Despite all this, I did not know many things written in this article. I learned a lot and had fun reading it.I first read about Zuse in Isaacson&#39;s Innovators book. Did not know that he used a high-level language for a chess program. Fascinating. He is very underrated."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"How can you leave out von Neumann from such a list?Also, I feel like Schmidhuber tends to be German-speaking-centric.And overall, acknowledging that this is his signature shtick and it&#39;s good to have a voice like this too, he does a lot of anachronistic reinterpretations of early discoveries in light of later results. It streamlines the story as if it was always headed towards the today, culling aspects that didn&#39;t pan out or magnifying aspects that were at the time more minor and not considered the central issue or angle."</p>
