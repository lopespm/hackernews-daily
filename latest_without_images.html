								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article is well made and uncovers very interesting thing. I love how it was technically put together, browsing it on mobile was a great experience, chapeaux bas, i love how great new formats are available to publishers in the digital era outside of serving autoplaying ads.On thing that caught my attention was the supposed USCentric approach since it counted a distance in miles. I also wonder whether it was translated into russian so it can be shared with russian citizens that they’re being lied to by TikTok"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love the execution of this!Not comparing but I did a similar project 8 years ago at the peak of Israel / Palestine conflict to compare tweets from Palestine vs tweets from Israel.Incredible difference when you see them side by side.It would be great if someone would execute such an idea for more areas of conflict to bring awareness."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a great visual and concrete example of how easily a narrative can be controlled.This is but one example of a larger systemic issue with media in the 21st century, and an issue with how people consume that media.Virtually every platform is like this, not just TikTok. It&#39;s not like TikTok tries to present itself as a neutral, unbiased source. Their whole premise is delivering &#34;highly curated&#34; content to you as fast as possible. The problem is that people have accepted that as normal and it&#39;s doing horrible things to the world. There&#39;s a reason everyone feels like we&#39;re the most divided we&#39;ve ever been...and it starts with things like this.As far as the war in Ukraine is concerned, this is just like classic WW2 propaganda but turned up to 11 due to the nature of how fast and easy it is to spread [mis]information these days."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think people are really over-analyzing this move. I think it&#39;s motivated by prestige, not money, nor is free speech the heart of the matter.Twitter is a stagnant company. They have thousands of engineers that in the span of a decade don&#39;t seem to produce much at all, nothing visible or memorable anyway. Long-lasting Twitter problems (culture, spam, algorithm issues) never seem addressed. User growth is stagnating as Twitter fails to appeal to &#34;normies&#34; in a way Facebook and other networks can.A perfect target for Musk to come in, do a few sweeping changes, and get out. Thereby proving once again that he gets shit done where others can&#39;t. Case closed.It doesn&#39;t take much. People have been begging for an edit button for a decade. If he&#39;d get only that feature implemented, it will be remembered forever."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think Twitter&#39;s CEO summed it up well, and I agree:&gt; He’s both a passionate believer and intense critic of the service which is exactly what we need on @Twitter, and in the boardroom, to make us stronger in the long-term.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s either this or one of its competitors rises to take them on at some point and we get a bifurcated society where specific companies cater to specific politics. That may be unavoidable anyways.I think people outside the SV bubble (I grew up there, don&#39;t live there anymore) don&#39;t realize how hated and despised their censorship policies really are.  Musk has his pulse on that, so I&#39;m happy to see him step in and shake up the group think."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wanted to give it a shot but got disappointed when I launched it and the following happened:- Outgoing request to googleapis.com- Outgoing request to segment.io- Outgoing request to sentry.io- Requires sign up (only via Github, mind you)I understand the first request is probably to get some dynamic configuration, even though I&#39;d rather my terminal ship with static configuration. But then you have segment and sentry: not interested in sending telemetry from my terminal. Finally having user accounts for a terminal is such as strange concept.I really wanted to like it, too. The screenshots look great"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Like others here, I&#39;m leery of replacing my terminal with a VC-backed, maybe open-sourced eventually product, and a bit annoyed it claimed a name already in use in the Rust world.But...it is exciting to see someone reimagining the terminal a bit. People frequently talk about wanting a better GUI interaction model for everyone, but the actual ideas to improve it seem to be missing, I think because the desktop status quo is really not that bad for low-learning curve systems. (In fact, I think many of the changes in the name of desktop/mobile convergence have been for the worse.) I&#39;m way more interested in the idea of creating a hybrid text/graphic command interface for programmers. There&#39;s a much better interface waiting for someone with the vision and (more importantly) ability to create an ecosystem around it. Some ideas:* Warp&#39;s more visual completion is super welcome. Does it work with the shell&#39;s standard completion scripts?* Warp&#39;s blocks look like a nice step in the right direction. How do they work? I&#39;d guess it&#39;s ANSI codes like iTerm uses to distinguish the ends of commands, although that has the downside that a broken/hostile command can impersonate the shell saying the command has ended. It&#39;d be nice to work out some compatible yet more robust protocol. (Maybe the shell takes responsibility for piping subcommand&#39;s output through it and filtering, or maybe something else.)* It&#39;d be interesting to further extend blocks with some protocol that allows programs to output within their block using richer elements: non-monotype fonts, adjustable tables, etc. A little like a Jupyter notebook, maybe. Even better if it works with some richer way for programs to pipe information to each other.* Likewise, when launching alternate-screen terminal stuff, to allow them to do more with the rectangle than a grid of text. Closer to embedding an arbitrary cross-platform network-transparent GUI, launched from the shell, occupying its rectangle.* And at first glance, looks like it&#39;s missing tmux-like features (whether integration with tmux proper like iTerm has or its own thing). I&#39;d want that in any richer terminal app—most of my work in terminals is on remote machines, often over flaky network connections."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It looks nice but I&#39;d never use a shell that phone&#39;s home. Period.I mean the CLI has been one of the last parts of my system that I really still trust is working on my behalf only.This product made me rethink that assumption.As for capturing the output from a command line on the mac (and also on linux IIRC) just use pbcopy/pbpaste.My opinion: It&#39;s not worth giving your privacy away for features like this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think &#39;more customization&#39; which is a theme with a lot of these alternatives is a fundamental dead end. I don&#39;t know where this persistent myth comes from that people love choice and tinkering, because they clearly don&#39;t. There&#39;s a huge cost associated with having to make choices, and one feature of successful modern apps is that they&#39;re frictionless. That&#39;s why TikTok is so successful. There&#39;s no login, no user chosen social graph, everything&#39;s abstracted away.And that&#39;s by the way why Google is still successful as well. Because it literally still is a simple box where you put a question in and it gives you answers without needing to do anything else. The only way to beat that is to make it even better while not making it more complicated which is very hard to do."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just went on a mini vacation to Vegas, and was thinking how nice it would be to just call up someone and ask for some simple advice.  I did a bunch of online research before I booked things, but man was it painful.  There are so many copy-cat blogs who just throw together a bunch of basic information with no real research done in order to get those clicks/adwords.For example: best hotel pool in vegas.  Seems simple enough.  Circus Circus actually has a waterslide, but if you dive deeper (read a hundred reviews manually) you find out parts are often shut down, and the hotel itself is quite trashy and smells bad and has bad service (explains the really cheap room rate).  But do you find that information on blogs?  No way, they just include all the hotels with pools and copy in the verbiage directly from the hotel websites or other blogs.There&#39;s probably an actual traveler blog out there that tells you all this and has great information, but it&#39;s hidden by all the SEO optimized trash blogs.And this example can be applied to so many things we do all the time.  Try to find a product you want on Amazon without spending half a day sorting through reviews and trash blogs.So, personally, I think the future will be actual human service.  I&#39;d pay a few bucks to call up a service to answer these questions definitively for me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These solutions don&#39;t answer any of the fundamental problems with Google:- who pays for the service (ads? users pay? Average user will never use a paid service if a free one is available)- how to resist attacks against the algorithm (Google has been fighting spam for decades)- how to personalize without invading privacy, e.g. Google had an option to search through your email in Google search...it&#39;s gone now, I wonder why?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you are looking for a language agnostic version manager, the nix package manager [0] might be worth a try. In combination with lorri [1] you will be dropped into a shell with all required development dependencies available, when you enter the project directory. This does not only include the interpreter/compiler versions but also any other dependency you can think of, like specific libraries the project links against (well almost any, it has to be available as a nix expression, best case directly in upstream nixpkgs).For me, it has come so far that I don&#39;t have any interpreters or compilers in my main OS environment and even for one off REPL sessions, I&#39;ll use `nix shell nixpkgs#python3 -c python3`.[0]: https://nixos.org/[1]: https://github.com/nix-community/lorri/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recently discovered Hermit[1], which is a really straightforward tool for managing versions of tools for a given project. From the FAQ[2]:&gt; Hermit is probably most similar to asdf, but their goals differ. Hermit&#39;s goal is to make isolated cross-platform tooling consistent, self-bootstrapping, and reproducible at the project level. asdf&#39;s primary goal is to allow developers to install and switch between multiple versions of languages and tooling.The downside for the author of this post, though, is that Hermit doesn&#39;t yet support Ruby because it&#39;s not static/relocatable.[1]: https://cashapp.github.io/hermit/

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’m constantly amazed at how Metaverse aficionados quote Snow Crash and and other 1990s works as cornerstones of cyberspace, when Gibson invented the term and Neuromancer was written in 1984. Gibson is the original. The passage where Case connects to the matrix (also a Gibson term) again for the first time once his nervous system is repaired is heartbreakingly beautiful. I relate to it as a young phone phreak growing up in South Africa in the 80s and 90s when I would bluebox the home country direct phone trunks to connect to BBSs in the USA. When I could not get through, usually because they were filtering my seize tones, I felt the same deprivation. And when I finally connected I felt the same elation Case feels in this scene…“Please, he prayed, now—A gray disk, the color of Chiba sky.Now—Disk beginning to rotate, faster, becoming a sphere of paler gray. Expanding—And flowed, flowered for him, fluid neon origami trick, the unfolding of his distanceless home, his country, transparent 3D chessboard extending to infinity. Inner eye opening to the stepped scarlet pyramid of the Eastern Seaboard Fission Authority burning beyond the green cubes of Mitsubishi Bank of America, and high and very far away he saw the spiral arms of military systems, forever beyond his reach.And somewhere he was laughing, in a white-painted loft, distant fingers caressing the deck, tears of release streaking his face.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing I read somewhere -- and it might have been an interview with Gibson or with someone else talking about his work -- is how much William Gibson despises derivatives of cyberpunk in the books, videogames and movies that followed.Specifically, he dislikes the focus on the aesthetic, neon lights, mirror shades, etc. I think Gibson really dislikes Cyberpunk 2077, for example. Gibson argued they are missing the point, staying shallow and forgetting the &#34;message&#34;, which was PUNK: a rebellion and a rejection of the mainstream state of affairs. Gibson was a punk writer, and his writing was a critique of Reaganomics and the direction the world was going back then.I think he means we need a different kind of critique now, not anchored to neon lights and vaguely Japanese inspired retrofuturistic aesthetics which look like what the 80s thought the future would be. And nothing can be more conformist and anti-punk than lazily copying a now classic aesthetic and doing nothing else with it.That said, I love that aesthetic myself, and have no problem being stuck in the past. But I see his point."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Sprawl trilogy and its fashion/world is formed a lot by politics. Gibson himself says that Neuromancer is an exaggerated critique of Reaganomics and the problems it exasperated (or, at the very least, failed to address). The rampant drug abuse, sovereign corporations, the ever increasing gap of poverty and technology -- I think a lot of derivative media adopts these elements to look cool (without actually understanding their context or meaning)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t know what it is about game development that really brings out the yak shaving in people.One time, about 8 years ago, I backed a game called Nowhere[1] by a very talented programmer. The original premise was an alien life simulator.Well, it&#39;s been eight years, and development is still going strong!The developer is currently working on the String implementation for the programming language he invented[2], which he&#39;s using to write the other programming language he invented[3], which is eventually going to be used to write the game.[1] https://duangle.com/nowhere[2] https://hg.sr.ht/~duangle/scopes[3] https://hg.sr.ht/~duangle/tukan"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s interesting that this phenomenon is much more prevalent in game development, as opposed to (for example) web development: some people build their own web development frameworks, but it seems like every game dev tries to make an engine at some point.My theory why: good web frameworks consider developer experience to be of paramount importance, and invest heavily into examples, documentation, and API improvements. Unreal and Unity by comparison are unpleasant to work in. The UI is clunky, the examples cap out after a certain point of complexity, and community input is almost nothing when compared to the Django, Express, Rails, or language-specific ecosystems.Anyway, I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve ever made it far enough down the rabbit hole to want to make my own language... but I know for me, the desire to make my own engine* has punctuated every attempt over the years to get better at both Unity and Unreal*Acknowledgment that I might be partially disproving my own point, as I&#39;ve tried to build both my own web framework, AND my own game engine... but I spent a lot more time on the game engine (https://github.com/RobertTownley/gamehook)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Always a pleasant surprise to be scrolling through HN and seeing one of my articles on the front page!For anyone interested in how that code would get zero memory safety overhead without the classic borrow checker, a big part of it is because of the &#34;region borrow checker&#34; [0]. There are some other factors (iso regions, hybrid-generational-memory, etc.) but region borrow checking is the big one.[0] https://verdagon.dev/blog/zero-cost-refs-regions"</p>
