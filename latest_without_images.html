Use of GPT-3 to augment OCR is an amazing (and, retrospectively, obvious) insight and a great immediate use case for these language models.I wish Remarkable took this idea -- they really oversold their OCR capabilities[1]. It works great in their support and promo videos, but I found the actual performance to be absolutely terrible.[1] https://support.remarkable.com/hc/en-us/articles/36000266143..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That is not the first time I see one of your stories and it always brings me a smile to see your new ideas and how implement them.It also amazes me how some countries make it so easy to open a business. Doing so in Brazil would be a legal nightmare. Your projects are super inspiring and I always have a mind to leave my job and start doing the same. I should probably move to the US or Canada first, otherwise it might not be possible for me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Marshall McLuhan would have appreciated this. Most everyone is familiar with his “The medium is the message” phrase, but if you dig a little deeper, you’ll come to appreciate his fascination with “Technology as extension of the human body.”That brio pen; the light bulb illuminating your workspace; the words you write; they’re all extensions of your body — from transcribing your internal thoughts, through your extremities, through transmission and distribution.If the author is reading this, I hope you’ll consider connecting with a few reputable online stationary retailers to offer a curated collection of reasonably-priced premium notebooks and pens. Additionally, consider expanding your original scope to include tags, which would open up your platform to paper-based automation opportunities.If you’ve made it this far and are just looking for the best cross-platform handwriting recognition, check out the Nebo app. It requires a stylus, but it’s the best I’ve come across and it reads PDFs, too."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s a type alias, introduced for generics. By the way, Go 1.18 Beta 1 is released (with generics): https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/eAjK4Oezs_A"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is fantastic. It&#39;ll make Go feel much less weird. eg from the diff:  []interface{}{1, 2.0, &#34;hi&#34;} -&gt; []any{1, 2.0, &#34;hi&#34;}

Now that Go is going to have generics, all we need is sugar syntax for early return on error -- like more modern languages such as Rust and Zig have -- and Go may finally be pleasant to program in!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not sure I like this change. I liked interface{} since it just works out naturally from Go&#39;s relatively simple type system, and anyone could come to the conclusion without actually being told &#34;use interface{} to represent any possible value&#34; just by having an understanding of that type system. Adding what is simply a type alias, multiple words for the same underlying concept, to me just feels like jargon. I admire Go for its simplicity and clarity and this change gives me anxiety that that will be obfuscated."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The author presents the idea that &#34;you may be born into a culture with social practices that you don&#39;t understand but that work for your benefit; they may work better if you don&#39;t understand them!&#34;I find this idea a little repellant, but it&#39;s something Friedrich Hayek wrote about too.  (In my mind Hayek is the person most associated with distributed knowledge.)  ~&#34;You may not understand the forces that have led society to be organized the way that it is, but you should respect that sometimes the order of things reflects knowledge you may not have.&#34;One of his essays on this topic was &#34;Individualism: True and False&#34;:&#34;&#34;&#34;This brings me to my second point: the necessity, in any complex society in which the effects of anyone’s action reach far beyond his possible range of vision, of the individual submitting to the anonymous and seemingly irrational forces of society—a submission which must include not only the acceptance of rules of behavior as valid without examining what depends in the particular instance on their being observed but also a readiness to adjust himself to changes which may profoundly affect his fortunes and opportunities and the causes of which may be altogether unintelligible to him.&#34;&#34;&#34;https://fee.org/articles/individualism-true-and-false/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of CEO-speak.A CEO cannot speak their true mind or their true assessment of a situation. They can&#39;t say &#34;wow we&#39;re in trouble here&#34; because then people will jump ship and then the company will be even more in trouble (and the CEO would get sued for breaching Fiduciary Duty)What a CEO says is merely wishful thinking for a goal they want people to follow. They can never speak their true plan. (And of course, it&#39;s all just game theory, a more elaborate version of https://youtu.be/S0qjK3TWZE8)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of a set of poems, Knots, by R.D. Laing, the first of which goes:&gt; They are playing a game&gt; They are playing, at not playing a game&gt; If I show them I see they are, I shall break the rules and they will punish me.&gt; I must play their game, of not seeing I see the game.It&#39;s a lovely collection, and though I haven&#39;t thought about it recently, I think there&#39;s a lot of value in considering these kinds of unspoken self/group contradictions."</p>

This is not a &#34;Linux&#34; or &#34;open source&#34; problem; this is a problem of ignorance and/or insufficient interest on the part traditional (i.e. non-ChromeOS) distros and their users.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Moderna is working on a vaccine targeting the Omicron variant for 2022.[1]The mRNA vaccine technology is &#34;agile&#34;. There&#39;s a workflow from sequencing a virus to generating a candidate vaccine. It only took two days to generate the original COVID-19 vaccine. It&#39;s the clinical testing in small, then large groups that&#39;s the time consuming part.Also, the inhaled vaccines are entering clinical testing.[2] It&#39;s not like we&#39;re stuck with the original vaccines.[1] https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/28/moderna-says-an-omicron-vari...[2] https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/e1637976-5c3f-11ec-90d0-c..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are a few important bits here:First: &#34;The study by Discovery Health, South Africa’s largest health insurer, of 211,000 positive coronavirus cases, of which 78,000 were attributed to omicron, showed that risk of hospital admissions among adults who contracted covid-19 was 29 percent lower than in the initial pandemic wave that emerged in March 2020.&#34;and second: &#34;At the same time, the vaccine may offer 70 percent protection against being hospitalized with omicron, the study found, describing that level of protection as “very good.”&#34;Yes the vaccine does improve outcomes BUT the hospitalization rate for unvaccinated people is still lower with Omicron than previous variants."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I would imagine that a virus would eventually adapt/evolve to a point to where it co-exists harmoniously with the host organism. I&#39;ve heard somewhere that herpes simplex virus used to have terrible symptoms, like genital blisters, but over the years the most common variant has no symptoms, and most people have no idea they have it.... and a huge proportion of human have it.I would imagine all viral contagions would eventually go that route. Because a virus cannot propagate if the host organism goes extinct, or for whatever reason the host organism is itself not fit for survival, or diminished in any way.... anything that might impact virus propagation.I&#39;ve read some where the common cold was probably a pandemic virus originally, and it mutated to a common cold we have today, and we mutually evolved to deal with the common cold. Something like that..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The inimitable Hans Rosling[1] used to call himself a &#34;possibilist&#34;:People often call me an optimist, because I show them the enormous progress they didn&#39;t know about. That makes me angry. I&#39;m not an optimist. That makes me sound naive. I&#39;m a very serious “possibilist”. That&#39;s something I made up. It means someone who neither hopes without reason, nor fears without reason, someone who constantly resists the overdramatic worldview. As a possibilist, I see all this progress, and it fills me with conviction and hope that further progress is possible. This is not optimistic. It is having a clear and reasonable idea about how things are. It is having a worldview that is constructive and useful.           • • •

In his book &#39;Factfulness&#39; (definitely read it), he talks about &#34;bad and better&#34;:Think of the world as a premature baby in an incubator.  The baby’s health status is extremely bad and her breathing, heart rate, and other important signs are tracked constantly so that changes for better or worse can quickly be seen. After a week, she is getting a lot better. On all the main measures, she is improving, but she still has to stay in the incubator because her health is still critical.Does it make sense to say that the infant’s situation is improving? Yes. Absolutely. Does it make sense to say it is bad? Yes, absolutely. Does saying “things are improving” imply that everything is fine, and we should all relax and not worry? No, not at all. Is it helpful to have to choose between bad and improving? Definitely not. It’s both. It’s both bad and better. Better, and bad, at the same time. That is how we must think about the current state of the world.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Rosling"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another good quote for the OP is Miguel De Cervantes, author if Don Quixote: &#34;there is madness in too much sanity, and the greatest madness of all is to see things as they are instead of as they should be&#34;.He would know: Cervantes killed a rival on a duel at 17 and fled to sea.  They were attacked by pirates and he fought well before getting his hand blown off and taken prisoner.  He lived in captivity but befriended his captor, who taught him chess and literacy.  Then he was &#34;rescued&#34; by monks who bought his freedom but placed him on indentured servitude through debt, which he finally escaped by writing one of the early great novels.The point of this story is not that cynics were wrong but that one never would have survived his ordeal.  In a world fit for cynics, you have to be ready for things to go right if you want to escape."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m pretty sure I fall into the definition of a cynic given in the piece&#34;according to cynics, the world operates in a certain way, the elites are always the same, and will always be the same. The cynics think we are always playing the same game that has always been played. For example, a cynic may think that media’s only purpose is to sells your attention to advertisers - like I did here. And often they might be right.&#34;but I too be honest don&#39;t really see the problem with that kind of worldview. I&#39;m not chronically depressed or antagonistic because of it, but I think I&#39;d rather have what I&#39;d consider a realistic and true view of the world as it is rather than anything else.&#34;One of the strongest medicines against cynical mindset which I’ve tried is to do a “no-complain challenge”. I find its effects to be enormous and durable for years. In this challenge, you move a bracelet from one wrist to the other when you catch yourself complaining. The goal is to make it 21 days without having move the wrist. &#34;Before you start prescribing medicine we need to agree that cynicism is an illness first, which is not so easily done. I think the author conflates people who are sort of angry or pessimistic because of their lot in life with his definition of a cynic. I take the cynical view because of what I perceive are fundamental aspects of human nature collectively, not my mood personally. I can beat that challenge without a problem because I rarely complain, or win the lottery tomorrow and it wouldn&#39;t really have an impact of my views on the way the world operates overall."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve found that there&#39;s a weird internal psychology I have with any news relating to Webb.  I&#39;m just as excited and hopeful as everyone else.  But somehow the whole story underscores the perils of singular hope.  It also seems to underscore the inherent issues with massive, carefully planned, &#34;vertically&#34; scaled science projects a la 20th century NASA.  I&#39;ve carved out a little nook in my psyche to cope with the outcome that something goes wrong during the Webb&#39;s incredibly complicated launch process and all those years of effort come to nothing.It&#39;s also made me wonder if there&#39;s a way for humanity to pivot to more &#34;horizontally&#34; scaled science.  I&#39;m imagining a kind of science conducted by aggregating the data collected by many cheap, easily produced instruments instead of a few incredibly fragile, extremely difficult to build contraptions.  I have an intuition that we&#39;ll increasingly run up against practical limitations in undertaking ever more complex projects of this kind in the coming years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Talking about Ariane 5, it&#39;s been interesting reading parts of its history. Particularly:&#34;Ariane 5&#39;s first test flight (Ariane 5 Flight 501) on 4 June 1996 failed, with the rocket self-destructing 37 seconds after launch because of a malfunction in the control software. A data conversion from 64-bit floating point value to 16-bit signed integer value to be stored in a variable representing horizontal bias caused a processor trap (operand error)because the floating point value was too large to be represented by a 16-bit signed integer. The software was originally written for the Ariane 4 where efficiency considerations (the computer running the software had an 80% maximum workload requirement) led to four variables being protected with a handler while three others, including the horizontal bias variable, were left unprotected because it was thought that they were &#34;physically limited or that there was a large margin of safety&#34;. The software, written in Ada, was included in the Ariane 5 through the reuse of an entire Ariane 4 subsystem despite the fact that the particular software containing the bug, which was just a part of the subsystem, was not required by the Ariane 5 because it has a different preparation sequence than the Ariane 4&#34;I wouldn&#39;t want any part on something as mission critical as getting a rocket to deliver something into orbit."</p>

I understand that technically speaking it&#39;s not a good solution, but let&#39;s have something else before killing this.PS: I&#39;ve clicked on this link from a RSS reader (just a simple browser extension... that keeps me posted every morning)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a very happy daily RSS user, but we ought to be upfront about its ginormous deficiencies:- every day I deal with broken links and broken images because my feed reader doesn&#39;t know from which URL it should resolve relative links- there&#39;s no pagination mechanism, or way for a client to ask for &#34;all posts since last Friday&#34;. If you want your feed to always have all posts available, you need to include the entirety of your archive in every feed response.- if I want to follow any link I get kicked back out to a bloated web page- lots of posts include iframes, or content that only makes sense with JS enabled- XMLDespite this, I still love RSS. It&#39;s what we&#39;ve got and we should continue to make the most of it. But it also sucks, and it&#39;s not any surprise that mostly only technical people use it. I think feeds are pretty much doomed to keep breaking and disappearing.
