								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Looks like they&#39;ve acknowledged it on the status page now. https://status.aws.amazon.com/&gt; 8:22 AM PST We are investigating increased error rates for the AWS Management Console.&gt; 8:26 AM PST We are experiencing API and console issues in the US-EAST-1 Region. We have identified root cause and we are actively working towards recovery. This issue is affecting the global console landing page, which is also hosted in US-EAST-1. Customers may be able to access region-specific consoles going to https://console.aws.amazon.com/. So, to access the US-WEST-2 console, try https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked at a company that hired an ex-Amazon engineer to work on some cloud projects.Whenever his projects went down, he fought tooth and nail against any suggestion to update the status page. When forced to update the status page, he&#39;d follow up with an extremely long &#34;post-mortem&#34; document that was really just a long winded explanation about why the outage was someone else&#39;s fault.He later explained that in his department at Amazon, being at fault for an outage was one of the worst things that could happen to you. He wanted to avoid that mark any way possible.YMMV, of course. Amazon is a big company and I&#39;ve had other friends work there in different departments who said this wasn&#39;t common at all. I will always remember the look of sheer panic he had when we insisted that he update the status page to accurately reflect an outage, though."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"OK...So, I&#39;m the tech lead for Cloudflare Workers. In complete honestly, I did not even know we ran some sort of comparison benchmark with Compute@Edge until Fastly complained about it, nor did I know about our ToS clause until Fastly complained about it. I honestly don&#39;t know anything about either beyond what&#39;s publicly visible.But as long as we&#39;re already mud slinging, I&#39;d like to take the opportunity to get a little something off my chest. Fastly has been trumpeting for years that Compute@Edge has 35 microsecond cold starts, or whatever, and repeatedly posting blog posts comparing that against 5 milliseconds for Workers, and implying that they are 150x faster. If you look at the details, it turns out that 35 microsecond time is actually how long they take to start a new request, given that the application is already loaded in memory. A hot start, not a cold start. Whereas Workers&#39; 5ms includes time to load the application from disk (which is the biggest contributor to total time). Our hot start time is also a few microseconds, but that doesn&#39;t seem like an interesting number?We never called this out, it didn&#39;t seem worth arguing over. But excuse me if I&#39;m not impressed by claims of false comparisons...On a serious note, I&#39;ve been saying for decades that benchmarks are almost always meaningless, because different technologies will have different strengths and weaknesses, so you usually can&#39;t tell anything about how your use case will perform unless you actually test that use case.  So, I would encourage everyone to run your own test and don&#39;t just go on other people&#39;s numbers. It&#39;s great that Fastly has opened up C@E for self-service testing so that people can actually try it out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was expecting a point-by-point comparison from Fastly. Instead, this comes off incredibly defensive and evasive, basically boiling down to two irrelevant points:* Rust compiled to WASM is faster than Javascript (ok, but I&#39;m not going to switch my entire stack just to use your CDN)* Fastly performance throttles their free accounts (ok, but not Cloudflare&#39;s fault, and I definitely don&#39;t want to get into your pricing game if you&#39;re going to start offering different tiers of serverless workers... part of Cloudflare&#39;s allure is its simplicity in pricing).They do have two good points:* Benchmarks between CDNs should be done from the same client locations (fine, but why did you then use your own set)* Cloudflare should not prohibit benchmarking of their products (fair)But this whole post read like a feeble attempt at misdirection, and made me distrust Fastly as a company. The complaints about their methodology aren&#39;t solved by using your own, even more flawed, methodology that doesn&#39;t even use the same language. You could&#39;ve just emailed them and asked to work together on an apple-to-apples test instead of creating an even more flawed benchmark."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As mentioned in the article, Cloudflare expressly prohibits benchmarking their services in the tos.I think it&#39;s rather disingenuous for Cloudflare to publish their own benchmarks calling out competitors when they won&#39;t allow anyone to run their own tests and comparisons."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love Cloudflare, but these Image products are a black mark on their reputation.Every point the author says is 100% correct. I&#39;ll add one more point, which ended up making it a total non-starter: you can&#39;t import lots of images because their rate limits are so pernicious. If you have tens of thousands or millions of images, keeping within their single digit per second rate limit, which appears to be totally non-negotiable, makes it impossible to add images at any scale.They have another product called Cloudflare Images which can work from Workers: but here the pricing is almost absurd and from the data they show on their dashboard, they only cache a tiny percentage of the requests. This means you end up paying a lot more than makes sense."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I thought Cloudflare was going to win the image hosting/serving/resizing game based on their original blog post, but that doesn&#39;t seem to be the case.I kept getting frustrated with the complexity and changing costs of solutions out there, so about a year ago I launched https://www.simplefileupload.com. It&#39;s a super easy, flat rate cost solution to quickly allow users to upload images and files. It provides a customizable upload widget and serves files via a CDN and firewall to protect against attacks. It doesn&#39;t have query param image resizing yet, but it&#39;s coming!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thanks for the feedback. I&#39;m on the CF Images product team.
We will allow the download of the original images, it is actually one of the next features coming up. Also we will introduce webhooks and Images Analytics next."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Django has allowed me to enjoy some side entrepreneurship. I have released three products as a solo part time dev that I would never have been able to do in a reasonable time using Java/Spring (my strongest stack). My first project went nowhere, but the second generated 1k+ a month and sold for 50k, and the third one is following a similar trajectory.My advice - keep it simple- function based views- centralize access to the ORM (avoid fat models, use a service layer)- responsive bootstrap template with crispy forms- minimal js- 12 factor type setup - django-environ or similar- be aware of n+1 select problem (I use django debug toolbar but looking into django-zen-queries)- plop it on heroku, AWS lightsail, Digital Ocean or if containerizing use AWS Fargate- avoid celery unless you are at a scale you need it - use django-cron, django-db-queue or similar- use a managed database and managed email serviceI have had zero scalability problems. People say Django is slow but it handled 10k active users on a small EC2 instance without any issues (static stuff served via cloudfront)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Django is the nicest framework I&#39;ve come across! For some context, my favorite overall programming language is Rust. Despite Rust having several web frameworks, I use Python the server due to Django being so nice.In Python, there are micro frameworks like Flask, and whatever new ones claim to be &#34;Blazingly fast!&#34;, async etc. Once you get over the learning curve, Django seems the nicest to use, due to including features like an auto-updating ORM, email, authentication, admin page etc. None of the Rust frameworks, in contrast, come close to feature parity.Django&#39;s feature base is vast, and I admit I don&#39;t understand much of it. You can choose the feature sets you need. The template language is inflexible, but you can smooth this over using JS instead A/R."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We went all in on FastAPI with my team, but we&#39;re hit the issue that the projects of Tiangolo (FastAPI, SQLModel, Typer) seem to be turning pretty much unmaintained : https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/discussions/3970We&#39;ve already been hit by multiple bugs with fixing PR opened, but left to rot, and missing documentation : the &#39;tutorial&#39; documentation is great, but if you want a reference you have to go read the code.I guess that&#39;s the issue when you pick projects maintained by one person, so for my next projects I might get back to something built on stronger grounds, like Django.How is Django this day with modern Python constructs like typing in general and Pydantic models integration ?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Couple of years ago I blogged about how it was developed for  the Apollo program [1] and then I wrote an implementation of different variations of it in Go [2].[1] https://cybernetist.com/2019/01/13/apollo-kalman-filter-and-...[2] https://github.com/milosgajdos/go-estimate"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Michel van Biezen has an excellent video series on Kalman filters:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaCcOwJPytQHe walks you though all the way from the rationale, to a simple algebraic example, to the full blown Linear Algebraic Matrix solution.  It&#39;s really worth watching even just the first couple videos to get a deeper understanding of this very useful technique."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The best exercise I had in our sensing &amp; estimation class was to derive the Kalman filter from &#39;scratch&#39;. It&#39;s actually just the series of steps used to perform a minimization of a convex cost function, where the cost function is the inverse likelihood of the measurements given the data.Someone once joked that all of sensing and estimation (and path planning and optimal control) is just applied convex minimization."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"OK. The reason all this happening is that Bitcoin really did go to the moon. That&#39;s what powers all this speculation. If the price of Bitcoin had been stable for a decade, and it worked reliably, it would be a useful medium of exchange, but nobody would care. This is all about MAKE MONEY FAST.Bitcoin found some early use cases. Drugs first. Then getting money out of China. Money laundering. Tax evasion.  Scams. Bitcoin is the scammers dream - remote, anonymous, irreversible transactions. Much less risk of the mark coming for the scammer with a baseball bat.Then China cracked down on cryptocurrency, shut down all the miners, and arrested a few hundred of them. Financial regulators in the more legit countries started regulating Bitcoin exchanges, so the operators couldn&#39;t just steal the money. Know Your Customer became a thing. In the US, the IRS, FinCen, the FBI, and the SEC all started paying attention to what was happening on blockchains. Cryptocurrency crime was no longer risk-free for the crooks.But by now, sheer momentum kept Bitcoin going up. That&#39;s a powerful force. It&#39;s not forever, though. Check out meme stocks a few years later. Remember, all this stuff is zero-sum. For every winner, there has to be a loser.That&#39;s what provides the engine behind &#34;Web3&#34;, NFTs, DAOs, and whatnot. It&#39;s not the technology."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find both the evangelism of and the hostility towards “Web 3” kind of silly. Obviously there’s some amount of interesting stuff and obviously there’s some amount of tech bro assholes getting rich who “shouldn’t”.Just like ~2008-2012, ~1999-2002, ~1994-1996, ~1982-1986, etc.On the technology side: distributed Byzantine consensus is an open problem with some promising prototypes. It would have very cool use cases: remittance is huge, ENS is fucking cool, Brave/BAT is cool, NFTs for e.g. concert tickets or restaurant reservations or whatever would be cool, IPFS is cool.The technology isn’t there yet. POW doesn’t scale. Ouroboros Praus/Genesis needs a clock oracle (see: Spanner), Tendermint/Algorand/PBFT are too slow (global 3-phase. commit, right). Solana/ICON/etc. are expensive cloud databases. L2 rollups/Lightning/sharding are “kick-the-can” exercises. But it took time to go from the Paxos paper to Chubby as well, maybe someone solves it.Yeah, it’s mostly scams today. But it’s always been mostly scams. Microsoft bundling IE was a scam. Pets.com was a scam. Path was a scam. Uber and AirBnB were (are?) illegal as hell. Third-party cookies powering Google and FB is a scam.When the dust settles some amount of this stuff will have been worked out technically, legally, and financially, and the rest will be “lol do you remember when…”.This time some people will be rich who neither had rich parents nor knew Bay Area royalty, but YC wasn’t always part of the machine either. I’m sure Goldman and YC will eventually embrace those people with open arms.I for one look forward to us collectively getting our knickers untwisted about it so we can go back to rewriting every calculator app on earth in Rust (I kid! Don’t hit me! Doofy Haskell is better than no Haskell!).;)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I completely agree with the author. I&#39;ve been reading a lot about the EVM, and while there&#39;s some interesting technology involved, it feels unlikely to be able to support any worthwhile applications outside of blockchain finance or moving $ around the world[0] (since the code can really only directly reference the blockchain itself).It&#39;s a bit like playing with a programming language in a sandbox that has (1) has no I/O functions[1], and (2) has enormous costs associated with even the most basic of computations. Ok, it&#39;s not like that; it is exactly that.Sure, you could build a crypto toy and convince some suckers to transfer some of their wealth to you, but calling it an app platform or the next evolution of the web is definitely a stretch. I sincerely wish that wasn&#39;t the case (I&#39;d love to find an exception), but that&#39;s what I&#39;ve come to conclude.[0] Don&#39;t get me wrong, there&#39;s tremendous value in being able to move money around the world without the blessing of governments and central banks![1] Any interaction with entities outside the blockchain require oracles, and at that point, you might as well throw away the other benefits of being on a blockchain."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t know if others have experienced it, but I run a monitoring server from Hetzner and have daily issues with IPv6 latency and packet loss (edit: Finland DC).I monitor 3 other IPv6 locations, the monitoring server will very randomly throw alerts, and only from Hetzner. Yet, when I opened a ticket, I was told it was the fault of the other providers, despite the mtr traces showing otherwise, and not having issues outside Hetzner.Hopefully more IPv6 users means that I won&#39;t be the only one impacted by those networking issues. I find IPv6 useful for servers that are not public-facing. They are firewalled of course, but it also means I can access them directly from home without hops or VPN (my home having a static IPv6 address)."</p>
