								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Brilliant approach, really. Never occurred to me to try something like this!Are you affected? Very likely. What can you do about it? Nerf your CPU performance by disabling &#34;turbo boost&#34; or equivalent. Should you do it? Probably not unless you&#39;re particularly vulnerable (journalist, human rights activist, etc.)One thing I found interesting that may get changed later, so I&#39;m documenting it here, is in their FAQ they say:&gt; Why did Intel ask for a long embargo, considering they are not deploying patches?
&gt;
&gt; Ask Intel.So Intel did ask for a long embargo, then apparently did nothing about it. My guess is they investigated &#34;can we actually mitigate this thing with a microcode update?&#34; and arrived at the conclusion after actually trying - or possibly after external influences were exerted (you be the judge) - that no, there&#39;s not much you can really do about this one.Later in the document another FAQ says:&gt; [...] Both Cloudflare and Microsoft deployed the mitigation suggested by De Feo et al. (who, while our paper was under the long Intel embargo, independently re-discovered how to exploit anomalous 0s in SIKE for power side channels).  [...]Which is again telling us that there indeed WAS a long embargo placed on this research by Intel.Only mentioning this here just in case the PR spin doctors threaten the researchers into removing mention of Intel on this one. Which honestly I hope doesn&#39;t happen because my interpretation is that Intel asked for that long embargo so they could investigate really fixing the problem (state agencies have more methods at their disposal and wouldn&#39;t need much time to exert influence over Intel if they decided to). Which speaks well of them IMO. But then again, not everybody&#39;s going to come to that same conclusion which is why I&#39;m slightly concerned those facts may get memory-holed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This paper relies on Turbo P-states, where they measure the oscillation when that is active; it is not measuring general SpeedStep (OS software controlled) as some seem to have taken away from it. Turbo state is the HWP (hardware P-state controlled) layer above SpeedStep; turning off Turbo in the BIOS still fully allows OS controlled SpeedStep P-states to function, it just disables the hardware level bursting P-states above that max listed CPU level for short periods of time. As others have noted, Turbo state can really kill a laptop battery and/or drive up the thermals pretty quick, a lot of folks disable it anyways if they&#39;ve tinkered around before.The abstract writes it as &#34;When frequency boost is disabled, the frequency stays fixed at the base frequency during workload execution, preventing leakage via Hertzbleed. This is not a recommended mitigation strategy as it will very significantly impact performance.&#34; This is a confusing grammatical way to state it, as SpeedStep will still work at the OS layer, you&#39;ll scale min to max &#34;as usual&#34; and just lose temporary hardware boost max+ capability when under stress (full load at P0 state) - not really &#34;fixed&#34; as it were in layperson&#39;s terms. That would be more akin to saying SpeedStep had to be disabled, IMHO.https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.19/admin-guide/pm/intel_p..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hmm, it feels like Intel/AMD are ducking and just hoping that the implications of this are not large.Here&#39;s a video from Intel chatting with the researchers: https://community.intel.com/t5/Blogs/Products-and-Solutions/...The questions are incredibly weak from the interviewers. They first state that it&#39;s not practical because the attack could take many hours, even days. But they don&#39;t describe why a day-long attack is not practical.They then bring the researchers and ask them the same question. The researchers say that the attack is very practical because it only takes.. a few hours or days to execute the attack. Here&#39;s the specific part: https://youtu.be/BiRPr839dSU?t=1476Instead of chatting more about this discrepancy they just ignore it and ask the researches how they feel about their new popularity.From what I can tell from the advisory from Intel, it&#39;s simply that people should understand the attack and mitigate it in software. It&#39;s very vague. The specifics (i.e. a list of example popular programs that are vulnerable) seem entirely missing."</p>

I realize that removal of access will feel sudden and unexpected, and this is not the experience I wanted for you. Given the number of employees who have access to sensitive customer information, it was unfortunately the only practical choice, to ensure not even a single person made a rash decision that harmed the business or themselves.How typical is this? Is he really talking about the hot wallet and/or cold storage?Those claiming that this is a &#34;crypto&#34; sentiment thing should consider the possibility that the front page of HN will be filled with stories like this from all over the economy within one month."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It’s been pretty interesting watching YC backed Coinbase get absolutely crushed by FTX, which has a higher % of crypto trading volume despite having less than 10% of the headcount.Crypto is a zero sum game, and the old Paul Graham essays and other tired VC dogmas really only work in positive sum games. FTX was founded by traders which is valuable when the ultimate purpose of the crypto industry is to separate uninformed people from their money."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think if employees feel slighted by being fired, they&#39;re fooling themselves. The best mindset is that you could be gone tomorrow. It gives you clarity and purpose. It also happens to be the truth.Coinbase was also extremely generous with severance. 12 weeks plus two for every one year at the company, I think. I&#39;ve had the experience of being let go without notice and without severance.Devs seem a little more grizzled this time around, so I think this mindset is slowly becoming the norm. College grads seem skittish, but they always are.People keep pointing to Armstrong&#39;s $110M house like it&#39;s some sort of injustice. If you think billionaires should exist at all, then that&#39;s one of the least-bad injustices imaginable. It&#39;s probably true that no Armstrong, no Coinbase, and 10% of Coinbase is the prize.EDIT: It&#39;s actually 14 weeks: https://blog.coinbase.com/a-message-from-coinbase-ceo-and-co...Three and a half months of dev salary is pretty incredible."</p>

Might be worth taking advantage of this good period to do some relationship strengthening exercises while you can so that when the next downturn happens, you can both understand each other&#39;s and your own feelings better. I&#39;m not talking about random activities like going to the beach but finding a good self-help book or therapist and sitting down together working through it regularly.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I spent 3 years living in one of the co-ops briefly mentioned in the article (&#34;In 2013, the administration took over the student-run anarchist house and painted over the old murals.&#34;). I wouldn&#39;t call it an &#34;anarchist house&#34; but it sure as hell was a lot of fun to live there. I painted some of those murals that are now apparently gone. We built a giant illegal loft in our room to make it two stories (which we would disassemble for a day every year when the fire inspection happened). We did some stupid and illegal shit, sure. But the sense of community was unparalleled. The alumni association owned the house, so we had to deal with all the maintenance. We came back to campus a week before everyone else every year to work on the house. We cooked and cleaned for ourselves. I&#39;ve never since experienced anything close to that same feeling of communal pride. It was a mess, but it was our beautiful mess."</p>

My dweeb chemist parents regularly hosted and attended parties with their dweeb chemist colleauges. My wife and I have hosted 3 parties in the last 17 years.We had to fight for the modicum of freedom our kids had growing up. Our oldest now has a car but his licence forbids him taking friends along.[1]Our youngest built his first model rocket this week, to find it&#39;s only feasible to launch with a club. The nearest club, which used to host monthly launches at Moffett field, is closed until Fall. So it&#39;ll take as long to drive to and from the launch site as to buid a rocket, and the maximum launch cadence is monthly. Not a viable hobby for a 13-year-old, unless it&#39;s your only hobby and your parents help with everything.Churches have disintegrated, workplaces are toast. The loss of &#34;third places&#34; was measured by Putnam.[2] Somebody on twitter suggested companies should have sports teams, aparrently unaware it was quite common until recently.On my first day of work in California in 2001, my boss asked me if I&#39;d tried ecstasy yet.[3] Nowadays you must be mentally ill to take it, under a doctor&#39;s supervision.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Stanford students live in brand new buildings with white walls. We have a $20 million dollar meditation center that nobody uses. But students didn’t ask for any of that. We just wanted a dirty house with friends.From my experience, covid exacerbated this significantly. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s just the universities or a broader cultural shift. And as the article says, the administrators introduced more &#34;community initiatives&#34; to exonerate themselves of gleefully destroying campus life and letting it atrophy for two years straight (while making students pay in person tuition for online school)It feels like in the past couple years we&#39;ve gone from a culture of spontaneity and grassroots initiative to one of bitter obsequiousness that&#39;s obsessed with taking itself seriously. The only way to subvert it is by turning it into one big jokeedit: thanks to OP for posting this magazine, it&#39;s the first thing I&#39;ve seen in a while that actually has something to say"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is so great. The 90s/pre OS-X Apple (the &#34;BuT tHeREs No SOFtWaRe!&#34; and &#34;ApPLe is GoING tO DiiEE&#34; Apple) had a sense of playfulness in their UIs that was largely lost when they became the Apple we know today.The Mac OS classic architecture definitely had some problems with its non-protected memory and cooperative multitasking, but what it _allowed_ were extensions that could really get in there and muck around with things… and I looovvvved the zaniness that provided. To name a few:- ResEdit!
- Extensions that could seriously improve your computer&#39;s performance like RamDoubler or SpeedDoubler
- That extension that made Oscar the grouch climb out of the trash can and sing a little ditty when you emptied the trash
- The talking moose was fun for about 15 minutes, but still, I love the attitude.
- After Dark!
- Easter eggs like that &#34;secret about box&#34; text clipping thing that pulled up the pirate flag flying over the Apple Campus. 
- Playful messaging like &#34;Installing System Morsels&#34;, or Sim City 2000&#39;s &#34;Reticulating Splines&#34;
- Even the iconography was more playful—that little bloated mac icon in the Memory control panel next to Virtual Memory comes to mindI miss the crew of developers, capabilities, and playfulness we lost in transitioning to OSX, but am thrilled that tiny fragments of this playfulness seem to be returning.Welcome back Clarus!

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sure, this is a sweet little hit of nostalgia -- but it&#39;s also symptomatic of just how far Apple&#39;s come (back) with the Mac, and why. It&#39;s clear that we&#39;re way, way over the doldrums of the butterfly keyboard, abandoned Mac Pro, &#34;continues to be a product in our line-up&#34; years. Little things like this, little acknowledgements of the past and the Mac community, suggest to me why: the people in charge of the Mac are now people who _grew up with it_, who love it, and who have that same nostalgia as (some) of us outside Apple.They want the Mac to be great, too! If this was strictly playing on nostalgia it would have been a bit PR feature, or at least called out in WWDC. But instead it&#39;s just dropped in as an easter egg. Such a great sign."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The keen-eyed among you may notice that although, it had a .pdf extension in assetutil info, I’ve given it here as a PNG. I was confused by this too, but upon closer inspection I believe the PNG is what ships with the OS. Although the .car format is not documented, you can still open it up in a hex viewer and learn a bit about what it contains. Looking through it, there appears to be some metadata for each file, followed by the image data itself.I reverse engineered the asset catalog format for a bit recently, hoping to be able to unpack and repack existing ones to create system appearances (themes/skins — these also come as .car files, and you can load one as an NSAppearance object and then apply it to your app/window/view).If it says it&#39;s a PDF, then it must be an actual PDF as a &#34;raw data&#34; rendition. I did successfully extract some with nothing but my own code. But, there are no PNGs present in .car files; as of Monterey, bitmap images use a proprietary undocumented compression format called &#34;deepmap2&#34;. I wasn&#39;t able to exactly reconstruct how it works because my skills of native code reverse engineering are lacking (or am I not using Ghidra correctly to get at least somewhat sensible code out of it?), but I did find the related functions in the vImage framework inside Accelerate.framework."</p>

It costs something at least $250 per user for organization larger than 5 person - even if you&#39;re not an engineer who is ever directly on call. At my previous company, IT had to regularly send surveys to employees to assess if they really needed to have a PagerDuty account. Alerts are a key information in an organization that runs software in production and you shouldn&#39;t have to pay $250 / month just to be able to have some visibility into it.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a Brit that didn’t want Scotland to be independent last time around: good luck to them. Brexit has shown very clearly that Scotland wants to chart a different path to England and IMO they should be allowed to do it.…just be generous to English folks seeking asylum from Tory rule, yeah?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"With hard headed view, I struggle to see that an independent Scotland will be economically able to deal with large cuts to public sector spending that would almost certainly be required. Per capita spending is already higher in Scotland than in the rest of the UK. Scottish companies have debts denominated in pounds. There would almost certainly be capital flight to rUK. Large businesses may relocate. There is no plan for a new currency, which would leave Scotland either with a weaker currency than sterling, or with a currency it has no influence over.The UK is obviously suffering economically because of Brexit - an economic relationship that was built up over 40 years or so. Scotland, England and Wales have been a country since 1707. Just imagine the complication of breaking that. It makes Brexit look like a tiny job. Scotland would need to set up mirrors of institutions completely administered by Westminster at great cost, with a shrinking and aging population which is poorer, less educated and less healthy than the rest of the UK, even despite much of the things influencing that (healthcare, education) being devolved to the Scottish government since 1997.I certainly don’t think it’s impossible. But I think it’s like Irish independence - it took the best part of 70 years for Ireland to economically recover. Over that time there was vast emigration to the UK and the US. Part of that was my own family who moved to the UK in the 1950s because of terrible job prospects in the Republic."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One quite important issue is the border. English and Scottish people will almost certainly never tolerate any kind of friction at that border. We&#39;ve been moving across it seamlessly for centuries, families are mixed, businesses straddle the border, etc. If the Northern Ireland debacle has shown us anything, it&#39;s if Scotland were to leave and then join the EU that border would become an absolute political nightmare. The EU has an absolutist position on border integrity, but locals have an absolutist position of border porosity. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a compromise that both sides could tolerate."</p>
