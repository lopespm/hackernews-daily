								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Arbitration consumer protection attorney here! Nice work, and nice write up.If nothing else, I hope folks will run with your first point. Far too many people are scared of arbitration, and it can be a really powerful tool for situations like this. It’s fairly accessible and straightforward, especially for folks in the HN crowd.One pointer for other folks in the future is to make sure you look into your state’s specific consumer protection law. (Sometimes called UDAP law or deceptive practices act.) Often times, these laws will allow you to recover more than just your out of pocket damages to punish companies that are deceptive.One other way to “enlarge the pie” in situations like this is to hire an attorney. I know, it sounds like I’m shilling for my peers, but hear me out. This same UDAP consumer protection laws let you recover attorneys’ fees as part of a judgment/win. If you’re not an attorney, you simply can’t seek those.So let’s say your claim is $2,000. Under those laws, maybe you can “treble” (triple) your damages if you win. So now your best day is $6,000. And the company knows it.But if that same law says you can get attorneys’ fees too, the company knows that they could be facing a 50k+ judgment at the end (almost entirely comprising attorneys’ fees), and then that often incentivizes earlier, higher settlements. My involvement in cases, and the threat of attorneys’ fees often results in higher settlements than my client would get on their “best day,” and even after paying out my portion. (I typically do these on contingency — I don’t get paid unless you get paid).Lastly, let’s just say I’ve done an arbitration or two with a home warranty company. They don’t make money by paying out claims!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In my experience, lots of companies have more or less automatic denial on requests. This is to filter out those that simply give up on step 1. Then the same companies will, like OP points out, offer some % in reimbursement / whatever to those that bother to appeal the initial denial. It&#39;s a disgusting practice, IMO - but what can you do?A bit OT:But ESPECIALLY the rental market - professional or private - is horrible on this. Before purchasing my home, I had rented 7 different apartments over the years.No mater how thorough I&#39;d be on washing out apartment, or how careful I&#39;d be with it, they would always find something - and claim deductions on the deposit.This worked for the first apartment I rented - after that I got wiser, and took pictures of everything before actually moving in. Better yet, with the landlord or representative as witness. Document everything. I even recorded the phone conversation - informing that the conversation would be recorded, and if that was a problem, we&#39;d take everything in writing.This saved me lots of deposits. Like clockwork, I&#39;d be informed that they found something - sending evidence. I&#39;d reply back with my evidence, and suddenly everything&#39;s OK."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; It went pretty well....&gt; [...] I counter-offered 80% plus arbitration filing fee reimbursement. The next day, they responded back with an acceptance and sent over a release form. Case pretty much closed. I didn’t get 100% back, [...]So author had to jump through hoops and in the end only got a percentage of what was owed. The text is written in the format of a feel-good success story, but the result is the oposite. What is described is a broken system, if the only punishment for the crime is to do what they should have done in the first place then there is no incentive for companies to do the right thing to begin with. Customer protection laws absolutely need a clause for double the reimbursement and I&#39;m shocked that this person&#39;s country (I&#39;m assuming it is the USA) doesn&#39;t have it. Without such a clause it is best for the company to just deny ALL claims and profit out of the people too lazy to go through arbitration."</p>

Some years ago I had an afternoon to kill while visiting San Francisco and Rusty was kind enough to let me stop by and say hello.  A quick 10 minute visit turned into one of the most interesting two hours I&#39;ve spent in my entire life.  Rusty gave me the whole tour of the software interface that runs SomaFM and we had a fascinating discussion about the history of SomaFM in particular and streaming music in general.  Thanks again Rusty!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"SomeFM is such a rarity these days, a reminder of how we believed the Internet was going to be.They take recurring donations. Probably the best way to help them and one of the best investments for me, as keeping it up and running is a way to keep these naive ideas alive.The music is curated and is most excellent (for my taste, of course). I have Groove Salad on speed dial in my HomePods around the house (through TuneIn radio).Thank you Rusty for sticking with it!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really miss Shoutcast/Icecast being such an active part of my life. The quality is way down, and there&#39;s like 1/6th the channels there used to be. For electronica in particular, there was just so much. But there were also so many random niche stations!SomaFM continues to be a great place for highly genre-d music.

					<h3><a href="https://dontwordle.com/">Show HN: Can you lose at Wordle if you tried?</a></h3>
				</div>
				<div class="story__comments">
					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31572258">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hello! I am the creator of Don’t Wordle. Really excited to see this took off today.I thought I would share some background about the game, some of the iterations I went through, and some of the future features I would like to add.Background:
Like many others, I have been playing Wordle daily. Recently, my Wordle win streak hit 99. I was admittedly very careful with my guesses on Day 100, not wanting to ruin my streak. Then I began to wonder…even if I wanted to lose intentionally, could I do it? Obviously, I could make intentionally bad guesses, but that would take the fun out of it. So I decided to build Don’t Wordle.Iterations I have gone through:The first version of the game was simpler and much worse IMO. I did not display the “Valid Words Remaining” at the top, and there was no concept of “Undos&#34;. Initially, I actually displayed the Wordle word at the top throughout the entire game! To be honest, that doesn’t change the difficulty of the game that much. However, given that the spirit of the game is not to guess the Wordle word, it seemed like the right decision to hide it.I created the “Valid Words Remaining” feature when I realized how challenging the game was. I kept getting stuck and wondering whether there were even any words left besides to Wordle word. When I saw how fast the count shrinks, I felt the game was a lot more interesting.I then added the concept of “Undos” when I realized the game was still too challenging. It’s particulary lame if you’re playing the game for the first time and you get eliminated after just 1 or 2 guesses.Current Tech Stack:-Route53 + Cloudfront + S3 + Create React AppUnexpected challenges:1. The animations. I obviously copied all the concepts from the original Wordle, but I failed to appreciate the complexity.2. The nuances of the repeat letter words.3. What makes a Wordle square yellow? The answer is not so simple4. Trying to get www.dontwordle.com and dontwordle.com to take you to the same URL (either www.dontwordle.com or dontwordle.com) and still support TLS and only use the tech I mentioned above. I actually still don’t have it working perfectly. I know of a solution, but it’s overly complicatedFeatures I would like to still add:1. I have heard from multiple people that it’s annoying how you could get the game in an unwinnable state without realizing it. For example, maybe 20 valid words remain, but there is no valid sequence of words remaining to finish the puzzle. While the “Valid Words Remaining” feature is nice, it would also be cool to have a “Valid Solutions Remaining” feature2. I would like to build a brute force solver that you can watch attempt to play the game in real-time. I have built something similar for a crossword puzzle and really enjoyed watching the computer try to fill the grid. I think it would be cool to do that same thing with this game.Question I don’t yet know the answer to:Do any words exist that would not have a single valid solution in this game?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It would be nice if there was a Give Up button. I got down to 30 possible words but could not for the life of me think of what they could be. I was craving that “Ohhhhh!!!!!” feeling when you see what the remaining possible words are."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"After using WordleBot [0] for a few days, it became clear that my last &#34;random&#34; guess was often the only choice left, so from this sense, this anti-wordle  seems impossibly hard.[0] https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/upshot/wordle-bot.h..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have a mildly surprising snippet which I believe they don&#39;t have. It&#39;s about interaction of class and instance attributes with behavior of &#34;X += Y&#34;. Python expands it to &#34;X = X + Y&#34; but only if X implements &#34;+&#34; but not &#34;+=&#34;    class A:
        a = (1,)  # tuples are immutable and don&#39;t have &#34;+=&#34;

    obj = A()
    obj.a += (2,)  # this creates obj.a

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The article is better than the headline.Remember that the reason we use so much land is because that&#39;s the cheapest way to grow food.   We could grow more food on less land by farming more intensively.   We don&#39;t because that would make the food more expensive.   At an extreme, a greenhouse can increase yields 100x but at an increase in costs of 10x."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You can already see this trend in the western world. In our county, we may have rezoned 1/2 of our farmland in the last few decades.It&#39;s just a pity they all turn into housing developments. We should really be setting aside more as green space."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is promising, but it does basically rely on human populations stabilizing fairly soon.  Interestingly the most solid factors for that is women&#39;s education and rights and children&#39;s health care, that correlates most closely with reduced population growth (I mean, not many people would really want to pump out ten kids and watch six to eight of them die of childhood diseases, which was about the pre-industrial norm, given the choice - having two kids is the basic replacement number assuming they survive to adulthood).Hydroponics plus desalination is kind of interesting, as then you could grow some crops on seriously non-arable land, although I don&#39;t recall ever seeing high-protein crops (such as legumes with associated nitrogen-fixing bacteria) grown hydroponically.  In terms of total calories per land area IIRC potatoes are the big winners there, never seen hydroponic potatoes either."</p>

People have all sorts of weird excuses to talk themselves out of billing days --- &#34;what if I only have an hour worth of work to do?&#34; Bill a day. See how easy it is?The last consulting company I built had a minimum billing increment of a fiscal quarter.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"So long story short: after decades of mergers and acquisitions, the only 2 options to get home Internet in Canada is through TV cable (owned by one monopoly) or the phone cable (owned by another monopoly).Monopolies being monopolies are charging the consumers exorbitant prices, making Canada one of the countries with the most expensive Internet.To create some semblance of competition, the 2 companies owning the infrastructure are required to rent it to smaller service providers (although at arbitrary prices effectively pricing them out). The arbitrary pricing was contested by the smaller providers and the regulator attempted to mandate fixed prices for infrastructure access. That was in turn contested by the monopolies, arguing that they were forced to subsidize the smaller providers.That said, I think it would be a much better idea if our government had balls to actually separate infrastructure owners from the service providers, and block further mergers. So multiple end user facing companies would compete for access to the same infrastructure, and the infrastructure owners would compete for servicing the providers, not being able to directly own either of them. Both layers would be have the incentives to offer good service at reasonable prices, while the current incentive for the infrastructure owners is to hamper the small players as much as they can."</p>

There were a rather dependent independent mind you, all their lines were rented.If I want fiber, Bell is my only option. Not the main one, the only one. Their pricing is reasonable if memory serves, but their customer experience is notoriously awful. I will never deal with them again unless I&#39;m absolutely forced to.Anyway, good article, we&#39;re fucked, deregulation brings us misery once more."</p>
