								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s some nuggets of truth in here, but I am disappointed that this article sidesteps what I feel is the most important reason for startup success in 2020: easy and abundant access to cheap capital.- Interest rates are at all time lows, borrowing is cheap- The Fed&#39;s balance sheet is at an all-time high. The economy is flush with cash, particularly the investor / VC class- This excess cash creates an (arguably artificial) wealth effect and drives an appetite for risk- Large unicorn startups that are perpetual money losers continue to operate only because they are effectively subsidized by regular capital raises. Look no further than all the Silicon Valley darlings such as Uber, Netflix, AirBnb, Tesla, and so on. All of them would cease to exist without continued capital injection from secondary share offerings or VC raises- These companies achieve growth and put pressure on the competition by offering their services below the real cost that would be needed to achieve profit, hence driving huge share price growth- This share price growth attracts new investment from the momentum-chasing crowd, increasing appetite for subsequent secondaries, and then the cycle repeatsI don&#39;t mean to be cynical, but it&#39;s hard to see this ending well for some of the nouveau riche. Tech has been a great avenue to riches by offering real innovation in some cases, but the article&#39;s error-by-omission really gives the wrong impression."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m rather disappointed PG would think that the Forbes wealth list could support any kind of conclusion whatsoever. One of the biggest reasons that the top of the list is filled with tech billionaires is that their wealth is relatively transparent, being mostly in the form of stock holdings in publicly traded companies and often directly disclosed. This makes it much easier for Forbes to estimate their net worth with some degree of confidence. Older wealth is often more opaque and diffuse, hidden behind various complex financial structures or stored in assets that are difficult to value or rarely change hands. Whether Forbes is aware of how much wealth there is and in what form, depends largely on the desire of the possessor to make it known. Some would want to disclose (or even inflate) their wealth for ego or branding reasons. Others would likely prefer to remain off the Forbes list altogether. So the Forbes list is a poor starting point even for a discussion soley about the wealthiest people. To draw any kind of inference from it to the broader economy is just downright ridiculous."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;So it&#39;s not 2020 that&#39;s the anomaly here, but 1982. The real question is why so few people had gotten rich from starting companies in 1982...a wave of consolidation was sweeping through the American economyMicrosoft, Oracle, Apple, Bloomberg, etc were all started in the late 70&#39;s/ early 80&#39;s. Their founders are the richest people in the world.Seems like the question he&#39;s asking, though, is why weren&#39;t they obscenely wealthy after only 5 years, but that requires a different thesis than PG&#39;s.Every time I read one of PG&#39;s posts, it seems like he&#39;s working from a narrative that he&#39;s trying to conform facts to."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For those confused, this acquisition is due in large part by Nuance&#39;s dominance in healthcare related products.  From Nuance&#39;s last earnings release[1]:“We are very pleased with the strong start to the fiscal year, as we delivered revenue and EPS above our guidance range expectations,” said Mark Benjamin, Chief Executive Officer at Nuance. “We continued to advance our strategic initiatives, accelerating our cloud transition across our core platforms in Healthcare and focusing on our AI-first approach in Enterprise. In Healthcare, we saw solid performance in our cloud-based offerings, growing cloud revenue 28% year-over-year. In particular, we benefited from strong performance in Dragon Medical &amp; DAX Cloud revenue, which grew 22% year-over-year driven by the ongoing transition of our installed base to Dragon Medical One, as well as traction in international, ambulatory and community hospital markets. Enterprise delivered another record revenue quarter, up slightly from its previous record in Q1&#39;20, driven by particularly strong demand for our Security &amp; Biometrics solutions.&#34;Nuance has deep relationships built with nearly every health system in the US and beyond.  This fits quite well with Microsoft&#39;s corporate focus.  Yes, Nuance also has a lot of IP, but I wouldn&#39;t expect any consumer facing changes (e.g. Cortana) in the near term.[1] https://investors.nuance.com/download/EX%2099.1%20Press%20Re..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think a lot of big acquisitions make &#34;sense,&#34; given the current market.The most successful companies have lots of cash, high share prices, and amazing cash cows. They could borrow for (almost) free, so resources are practically unlimited.  Their R&amp;D is already well funded. Most of their big, growth oriented endeavours are not cash-constrained. There are usually no factories to build or production to scale up.Google tried &#34;20% time.&#34; They tried &#34;let many flowers grow.&#34; Those things seemed ambitious at 2007-scale. In 2021 terms... new flowers need to be S&amp;P 500 companies to represent growth, instead of just clutter. &#34;Meaningful growth,&#34; for Alphabet, is a big number.How else does a MSFT, Google or (especially) FB put $20bn to work? Acquiring &#34;just works.&#34;Of course, there are in-house alternatives. Waymo is an in-house investment by Alphabet that&#39;s bigger than this Nuance acquisition... especially if you consider the $bns Waymo will continue to need until some unknown future date. Self driving is looking more hopeful (certainly to investors) than it was when waymo started.... but waymo is still a dubious investment.Consider that Google could have bought any car company, for about as much as waymo will cost eventually. Car companies have loans, so you could quibble the math... but details.Acquiring is easy. The path of least resistance wins &gt;50% of the time. We have that dynamic here, both in the human/managers sense and in the arbitrage-like incentives in the market currently."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s hard for me to know whether to feel bad for ES in this case. Did they bring it on themselves? Is Amazon too big and a bully?From my perspective, Amazon has made most of its profit price gouging consumers on bandwidth after vendor locking them into their ecosystem, where they bootstrap new services by wrapping open source software with some provisioning scripts, management dashboards and cookie-cutter API / console templates. Indeed, most of this is templated -- AFAIU, for example, each AWS service autogenerates its Boto bindings and parts of its console frontend via code generators. Amazon has really mastered the factory process of churning out new services, and when they find a popular one, they can invest more resources into developing it than the original team ever could.And therein lies the rub. If Amazon is improving the software in a way that the original team couldn&#39;t, it&#39;s hard to say that the community isn&#39;t benefiting. I think what strikes me the wrong way is that Amazon is not doing it for any altruistic reason. In fact, Amazon contributes very little to open source in general, considering how much they take from it. Compare them to Facebook (React, etc) or Google (tons of dev tools) or Microsoft (VSC, TypeScript). What does Amazon have? Firecracker, kind of? And now a fork of ES because that&#39;s the only way they could continue making money off it without violating the license a small startup put in place to stop them?Well, good for Amazon, I suppose, but I find myself instinctively disliking them for this. I&#39;m not sure what the solution is. Hopefully technologies like Kubernetes and Terraform will encourage big customers to become at least cloud-agnostic, if not cloud-independent. At the very least it would be great if Amazon / Google / Microsoft stopped gouging bandwidth at such absurd margins. Or not. Maybe it will be their downfall as startups differentiate along those lines. That would be ironic, coming from the originators of &#34;your margin is my opportunity.&#34;Personally I&#39;m doing my part by not building anything with vendor lock-in. It&#39;s great to be able to deploy to any cloud, if you value either robustness or flexibility."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is there any good that done by Amazon to support OSS? Like ever. They started with cloning MongoDB and now Elastic with actually zero contribution to the community regardless of their insane profits. This is a clear single. Amazon can always clone and redistribute any open source software then lock it in for AWS. If we&#39;ve started to witness declining in OSS, well at least we know now who started the wave."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Another trick that might be more practical for actually debugging is using the object shorthand. For example, instead of...    console.log(x, y);

which contains the information you need, but lacks any useful context, try...    console.log({x, y});

...which will print out like an object, including the key names."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve put over 200 tips like that on my website: https://umaar.com/dev-tips/Each tip has a textual explanation, and an animated gif if you&#39;re a visual learner (I know, I need to scrap gifs and move to regular videos).There&#39;s a lot of tricks there which can hopefully improve your development and debugging workflows. Let me know if there are specific things you&#39;d like to see. A few people have asked for how to find memory leaks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow there are some cool tricks here!In Firefox any objects you pass to console.log are expandable, so you can say console.log(&#34;my hash&#34;, h). It seems to behave the same when you say console.log(&#34;my hash %o&#34;, h).But there is a tricky thing that has really confused me in some debugging efforts: when expanded, the object display is &#34;live&#34;, so it always shows the current properties of the object, not the properties as they were when you printed them. But the unexpanded view shows them as they were. So for example:    h = {foo: &#34;bar&#34;}
    console.log(h)
    ▶ Object { foo: &#34;bar&#34; }
    h.foo = &#34;BAR&#34;

Then you click the triangle and you see:    ▼ {..}
    |   foo: &#34;BAR&#34;
    | ▶ &lt;prototype&gt;: Object { .. }

I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a bug or desired behavior, but watch out for it! In the past I&#39;ve used console.log(JSON.stringify(h)) to capture the full object as-is. I guess turning it back into an object would be even nicer, so you could have a deep copy to navigate."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Now, would the journalists who wrote articles with titles that are a variation of &#34;RMS defended Epstein&#34; [1,2] apologize or at least correct their articles?  Also, now that RMS has explicitly clarified his position on these issues, can the people who leveraged his &#34;silence&#34; and &#34;bad behavior&#34; to oust him from the FSF at least admit that their motive was less about making the free-software movement welcoming and was more about getting rid of RMS?[1]: https://www.thedailybeast.com/famed-mit-computer-scientist-r...
[2]: https://www.vice.com/en/article/9ke3ke/famed-computer-scient..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Minsky defense was not the primary, most important reason RMS can&#39;t serve as an effective, inclusive leader for free software, it was just the one that got the most attention. This does nothing to address the numerous complaints of harassment towards MIT students, the _other_ times he spoke out in implicit support of pedophilia, the public gaffes that are unacceptable as a public representative (e.g. the foot skin eating thing), and the fact that the FSF under Stallman kinda lost to open source anyway and hasn&#39;t really done anything besides virtue signal to others about how pure and ethical they are."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s great, but the problem seems to be RMS&#39;s disruption of development activities. This doesn&#39;t change that. For example:https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2015-01/msg00...Imagine taking the time to publicly explain to an out-of-practice dev why some technical feature is needed, then being accused of a &#34;pressure campaign&#34; that requires the out-of-practice dev to consult privately, &#34;with people I have confidence in.&#34;Gnu devs have an impressive amount of patience and grace to put up with that. But I see a lot of other FOSS devs try to replicate RMS&#39;s unnecessarily aggressive rhetoric. They often shoot themselves in the foot with it, disrespecting and consequently losing valuable contributors who are otherwise aligned philosophically with the project in every way.That kind of disruption is at odds with every value FOSS devs claim to hold-- meritocratic, decentralized, etc. Even Debian put the hammer down when an out-of-practice dev tried to use permissions to disrupt the work of a new dev. Nobody sane and self-respecting should put up with this kind of behavior.Edit: clarification"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Taleb talks about the Lindy effect and some of the surprises in this article can be explained it.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effectThe rough heuristic is: the longer a technology has been around, the longer it will last into the future.That is, it&#39;s NOT the case that every piece of technology lasts roughly the same amount of time, and then is replaced.For example, a chair vs. an iPhone.  Which one will be used further into the future?  Almost certainly a chair.----Land lines have been around a lot longer than fax machines (both in the article), so they will likely outlive fax machines.Will HTML or JavaScript last longer?  Probably HTML, since it came first.What about ASCII or HTML?  Probably ASCII.These have a &#34;dependency stack&#34; issue, but it applies regardless.  And I think that is part of the phenomenon -- low level technologies that are widely adopted take longer to go away.  Plumbing, electrical (AC vs DC), land lines, TCP/IP, BIOS, etc.I can&#39;t find a link now, but there was a recent Kevin Kelly article about finding farming tools from a catalog in the 1800&#39;s still in use.   I think he said that almost EVERY one was still in use, or able to be purchased, which is a nice illustration of the point.  It takes a long time for old tech to die, and arguably it never does."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The 3D TV phase was so odd. It really seemed like an inevitability: there was a technological breakthrough, it was genuinely much better than what came before (the red and blue stuff), it was relatively inexpensive, and on paper it seemed like a strict improvement on the status quo (flat TV).But... somehow, I never actually found myself wanting it that badly at home. And I guess everyone else agreed because one day it just vanished.So few technologies follow a trajectory like that. Usually you either get a success or a failure, where successes only end once they&#39;re replaced by something new and strictly better. But this was truly a fad; it was kind of successful for a minute, and then everybody lost interest."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"His #1 can not and will not ever happen. The radio spectrum is a shared resource. The total information capacity of the usable spectrum, say from 100 KHz to 100 GHz, is massive but most of it has terrible propagation and all of it can only be used once at a time. Massive MIMO helps in dense city cores with lots of independent paths reflecting everywhere but it&#39;s still just one spectrum in practice.Whereas with physical transmission lines, be they cables, fiber optics, or whatever, each run can re-use the entire spectrum."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I noticed as young adult that I didn’t really worry or consciously stress, but my body had somewhat predictable reactions to situations that I would realize, in hindsight, were highly stressful. Those physical reactions sucked, and as they got worse over time, it really concerned me.At some point I was encouraged to go to CBT, which I did, but honestly it made things worse. I became hyper aware of how anxious I was at any moment, and the more I noticed the more it worried me.Years later I tried mindfulness meditation and found that it helped. But also, I finally hit a kind of turning point where I just realized that there was nothing I could really do about anxiety or the physical symptoms that came along with it. I decided to mostly try to quit noticing and thinking about it. And that really helped.I still feel stress and anxiety symptoms sometimes. They still suck. My conscious mind is still the last to recognize what’s going on. But, overall, I feel I can handle a lot more stress now than I could ten years ago without it ruining my quality of life, and more importantly I can recognize the stress, not worry too much about it so I can get through it, and then rest and recuperate (as soon as possible) and recover much quicker than when I was younger.I’ve concluded that the best advice is to learn not to worry about things. Unfortunately that’s easier said than done, and I’m not sure I have any advice on how to learn to do that :/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Eh, a gross oversimplification.Feeling troubled by being anxious in the modern world is a &#34;cerebral&#34; issue. The guy who mistook an innocent animal as a tiger and freaked out because of it didn&#39;t feel bad for feeling anxious for no reason. We do. Because it interferes with our daily functioning / responsibilities in the modern world.Anxiety is also very frequently comorbid with other mental disorders. Especially OCD or OCD like tendencies, depression etc. I am medicated now and feel a lot better but when my anxiety was worse, the chatter of my &#34;conscious&#34; brain murmuring about &#34;what if&#34; scenarios was the worst. My point is, yes, anxiety manifests itself in a physical way, big time, but that is only half the problem. The discomfort with being anxious, constantly thinking about the possibility of having an anxiety attack even if you are not physically anxious &#34;at that time&#34;, evaluating the &#34;what if&#34; scenarios, the constant planning to work around possible issues, all that torture are very cognitive pursuits and they were a lot of a bigger burden on my quality of life than experiencing an anxiety attack now and then."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the advice of focusing on how to turn anxiety symptoms down and moderate physical responses are fine, but it&#39;s kind of missing the point, at least for serious cases of anxiety. I suffered pretty badly from it in my early 20s (apparently typical age for this kind of stuff), and you go very quickly from particular anxiety attacks being the issue, to fear of anxiety itself being the bigger issue.An anxiety/panic attack is physically scary the very first time, but by the tenth time what you&#39;re really afraid of is the loss of control and the anticipation of anxiety. Chronic sleeplessness is often the same way. Dealing with literally sleeping better is one thing, but at some point the real issue becomes the mental concern with sleep itself.Dealing with physical anxiety symptoms is good, but if you&#39;re mentally anxious your first thought after dealing with an anxiety attack by breathing deeply is &#34;okay, but what if it doesn&#39;t work the next time?&#34;. It&#39;s that mental attitude that I think many people have trouble dealing with."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"On a side note, I think this style tweak makes it more readable:    [ x&#34;$var&#34; = x&#34;val&#34; ]

My eye doesn&#39;t have to separate &#34;xval&#34; into &#34;x&#34; and &#34;val&#34;, so it&#39;s more obvious that the value being compared against is &#34;val&#34;.(It behaves the same way since the shell allows quoting to start in the middle.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As usual, the problem is that Sh &amp; co. use in-band control, especially when talking to utilities. Just a mess of text being passed around, of which every program must make sense on its own—but this happening in shell&#39;s own functions takes the cake.Moreover, similar problems are inherited by some programs that try to do shell-like commands but put their own syntax in the way. E.g. Ansible, where YAML, JSON, module call DSL and Jinja are all mixed on top of the commands so you can bump into any of them."</p>
