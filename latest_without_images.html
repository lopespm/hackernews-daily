If you want to read them all, you need to click &#34;X more comments&#34; at the bottom of each page, or like this:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32179563&amp;p=2https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32179563&amp;p=3I just mention this because for a thread this large, it is unusually good. (And yes, we&#39;re still going to solve this problem and then there won&#39;t be any more of these annoying notices.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You know how, during a big programming project, you have to keep the devs from going &#34;this codebase has a lot of technical debt, let&#39;s rebuild the whole thing using Rust and Kubernetes and Deno and move the hosting to Azure and switch databases and use microservices and...&#34;?Designers are exactly the same way. Just as technical fiddling is fun and interesting, making new designs from scratch is just as fun and interesting. And, just as fixing bugs is tedious and boring, tweaking designs is tedious and boring.I&#39;ve been on both sides for a lot of years, and I have to keep a sharp eye on myself to keep from spinning my wheels on distractions.Even the Pope had to keep Michelangelo focused on the Sistine Chapel and not wander off to work on his tomb."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recently left a boutique agency of 5 years and I can definitely resonate with this one. Our agency aimed to catch big fish, and we did, but since they are hard to land we&#39;d pick up small jobs in the meantime, just like the project that you&#39;re describing here. In my perspective, this isn&#39;t someone deliberately ripping you off. I imagine they intended to ship at the cost they quoted, but the team didn&#39;t adjust their working style to match your price point.All the variations of the logo and design mocks are clearly overkill for a $15k project. The design team had time to fill and wanted to provide lots of options for you to pick from, as they typically would on a larger project. Those variations are an expectation for $100k clients, and you got the $100k customer treatment, but unfortunately not at a discount.The reality is, small jobs like this are effectively make-work projects for an agency. They typically don&#39;t pay enough to be an effective use of time for the agency, but are a way to stay in the black between higher value projects. Small customers become &#34;nuisance&#34; customers as soon as a something better is landed. The team members being swapped out as they are needed elsewhere and newly joining team members then need to re-contextualize and regain momentum, all on your dime.Your takeaway is correct, don&#39;t be a small fish for an agency. If they&#39;re busy they won&#39;t take your work, and if do show interest, they are desperate for work."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"More anecdotal evidence: a few years back I wanted to get out of the work situation I was in. I looked around, had some interviews, had some offers. None of the postings had salary ranges, as is common where I live.My eyes, however, were set on a specific small company because I liked their product. The process was long and involved multiple meetings, a take-home problem, and stretched over 2 or so months. I was upfront about what my salary expectations were (wasn&#39;t looking for a raise, just a lateral move). They said we discuss salary when you meet the founders, i.e. the last step before getting hired, but they also didn&#39;t tell me that my range was way off.Turns out I had played this 9 week game and turned down other offers just to be severely low-balled by them. Maybe they saw that I really wanted the position and thought they could get away with a low offer.Obviously, I rejected their offer on the spot. I also promised myself to never, _ever_, be fooled like that again. We talk money before I invest any significant amount of time or I walk."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We just went through a large hiring cycle. We posted two versions for every job posting- one with salary ranges and one without.The ads performed equally well in regard to total responses with the better candidates responding to the ones without salary ranges.And... before you say, perhaps your salary ranges were bad, they weren&#39;t. Our salary offerings are very aggressive to the developer&#39;s benefit. In my opinion, salary is a sign of respect from you employer.If your primary reason for responding to an ad is based upon salary you are not going to be happy where you work. I promise. Of the top reasons people are happy at work, salary is way down on the list. [0] It is important, it makes it possible to pay bills, but it isn&#39;t what makes people happy.Meaning, if you are looking for a place you will enjoy working, do not start with salary.[0]https://www.forbes.com/sites/jacobmorgan/2014/12/15/the-top-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My former employer had a lot of trouble hiring and getting applicants even though we paid very high wages. They asked for my help. Naturally, they hadn&#39;t posted the salary range. I changed up the listing to talk about what we provided as a company for the employee and why we were such a great place to work and included our high salaries. We immediately had trouble keeping up with the number of applicants.If you pay well, they will come."</p>

However if thousands of people die in thousands different places, it is ignored and considered a fact of life.When a plane or train crashes, we stop everything and redesign the entire network to prevent this from happening again.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; It is widely recognized that there is an epidemic of suicides among current and former military personnel, especially those who have been on active duty in a combat theater... There were 3,481 combat deaths in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Since 9/11, there have been over 30,000 military suicides. Over 20 soldiers a day take their own lives.Pet peeve: while I really like the general point of the article, I wish the author had actually provided statistics that support the claim they are making here. 30k suicides sounds like a lot, but what&#39;s the base rate in the general population? The numbers provided don&#39;t actually tell you whether the rate of military suicides is higher than civilian ones, and that kind of undermines the point. To be concrete I&#39;m looking for something like &#34;the base rate of suicide is X% chance per year, whereas amongst soldiers it&#39;s Y% chance per year, suggesting a risk factor of (Y-X)% caused by military service.&#34;A quick search finds some research (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_military_veteran....) that suggests the rate of suicide among veterans is 1.5x the base rate, which is substantial. Using those numbers suggests that 10k of those suicides quoted above were specifically attributable to military service (and 20k would be &#34;baseline civilian risk of suicide&#34;)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Never owned a car of my own until two years ago. Our car has been hit three times in the last two years. Once totaled on the high way (another drivers fault) and twice while parked. Roughly 50K in damages across the two cars and 3 months in the shop doing repairs. We spent 20K on a new car after the old one was totaled and insurance paid out a fraction of what a similar car would cost. We&#39;ve paid close to 2K in deductibles, way too much for car insurance from a company that doesnt give a shit about us, and close to 1k on car cameras and backup batteries.Thankfully we havnt been hurt but we got lucky. When the car was totaled it was in heavy traffic going 40+ mph and caused a 4 car pile up. I know people who have died in accidents or had their kids die. My immediate family was incredible lucky to not be killed by a drunk driver in a very bad accident early on in my life.Driving sucks."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It’s impossible to overstate how funny the shenanigans get when you combine a technologically incompetent legacy big Co. with one of these big professional services firms.The IT consulting firm will tell you they have experience with literally everything. They’ll dig up a case study from one of their 400 offices somewhere, claiming to be experts on whatever the topic is. Meanwhile, in actuality, your project will be staffed with a team of 24 year old kids where this is their first assignment. And it doesn’t matter anyways, because the people who worked on the original case study are long gone and would never communicate with other offices even if still around.Meanwhile at the big company, you’ll have the opposite problem. A team of people with decades of experience, but who don’t really know anything about anything other than how to make their corporate machine not fire them. They’ll think they know what they want, and will confidently tell you…but in actuality, these people have zero understanding of technology or even how their business runs. And who can blame them, they’ve spent a 30 year career not doing or risking anything specifically, so its hard to learn how anything works with no feedback loop.It then becomes a delicate dance, can the consulting team learn how to do the thing they sold the client fast enough, before the client does their best to try to ruin the project out of sheer hubris and incompetence.This case is famous for being one where the dance went so bad it became a meme."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Content Management – Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) was the tool of choice to update and revise the content that appears on the website.&#34;If you want to blow a massive development budget AEM is a great choice; otherwise I&#39;d advise you to pick a different content system.This decision alone probably sunk multiple millions of dollars.The platform license alone for their operating scale was probably a half million or a million.  What you get with that license is... the world&#39;s most complex and difficult content management system, that you now have to develop your whole platform around.  Since it&#39;s so difficult to learn and work with you basically need a full time AEM specialist team, which again blows your budget up potentially in the range of millions of dollars, and then continues to burn strong every time you need any kind of update."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"HAMT: Hash Array Mapped Trie.  This data structure makes efficient immutable data possible.  You can update a list of a million items, and keep a reference to the original list, by changing 3 or 4 references and some bytes.This should replace copy-on-write for scripting languages.  I really want to see it in a JS spec soon.  There are libraries that can do it, but they add translation penalties and extra steps.  I’d complain less if I could use Clojurescript professionally, because it and Clojure are built around them.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_array_mapped_trie"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The union-find data structure / algorithm is useful and a lot of fun.The goal is a data structure where you can perform operations like &#34;a and b are in the same set&#34;, &#34;b and c are in the same set&#34; and then get answers to questions like &#34;are a and c in the same set?&#34; (yes, in this example.)The implementation starts out pretty obvious - a tree where every element either points at itself or some thing it was merged with. To check if two elements are in the same set, check if they have the same parent. Without analyzing it, it sounds like you&#39;ll average findRoot() performance of O(log(n)), worst-case O(n).There are a couple of simple optimizations you can do to this structure, the type of things that seem like they shouldn&#39;t end up affecting asymptotic runtime all that much. The first is that, whenever you find a root, you can re-parent all the nodes you visited on the way to that root, so they&#39;ll all be quicker to look up next time. The other is that you keep track of the size of sets, and always make the larger set be the parent of the smaller.And neither of those actually do anything impressive alone, but if you use both, the algorithm suddenly becomes incredibly fast, with the slowest-growing (non-constant) complexity I&#39;ve ever heard of: O(the inverse of the Ackermann function(n)). Or, for any reasonable N, O(4 or less)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Cache-Oblivious Data Structures: https://cs.au.dk/~gerth/MassiveData02/notes/demaine.pdfA vaguely related notion is that naive analysis of big-O complexity in typical CS texts ignores over the increasing latency/cost of data access as the data size grows. This can&#39;t be ignored, no matter how much we would like to hand-wave it away, because physics gets in the way.A way to think about it is that a CPU core is like a central point with &#34;rings&#34; of data arranged around it in a more-or-less a flat plane. The L1 cache is a tiny ring, then L2 is a bit further out physically and has a larger area, then L3 is even bigger and further away, etc... all the way out to permanent storage that&#39;s potentially across the building somewhere in a disk array.In essence, as data size &#39;n&#39; grows, the random access time grows as sqrt(n), because that&#39;s the radius of the growing circle with area &#39;n&#39;.Hence, a lot of algorithms that on paper have identical performance don&#39;t in reality, because one of the two may have an extra sqrt(n) factor in there.This is why streaming and array-based data structures and algorithms tend to be faster than random-access, even if the latter is theoretically more efficient. So for example merge join is faster than nested loop join, even though they have the same performance in theory."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I started reading the article I thought the title was a bit click-baity for Science. But then I noticed that the theory it refers to was not the amyloid hypothesis itself, but the toxic oligomer hypothesis that emerged later. That theory is pretty much the main potential explanation on why every single drug targeting Aβ failed that still keeps Aβ fibrils relevant. It&#39;s a very convenient theory because it keeps the main original observations about the fibrils relevant while explaining why therapies that target them don&#39;t work.One part that is really important that is mentioned in the middle of the article is that these systems are very difficult to handle, and it&#39;s almost impossible to make many of them nicely reproducible. Fibril and oligomer formation depends a lot on the environment and reacts to tiny differences.I find this kind of fraud deeply frustrating, there is so much wasted effort in the wake of faked high-profile results."</p>

How could this guy responsible for this mess?And if what he published was wrong, why this was discovered only 18 later if thousands scientists are working in the field?My understanding is that there is a need to find a scapegoat for the amyloid-β and pointing to an obscure guy is in the interest of many big fish.[0] https://www.statnews.com/2019/05/21/alzheimers-disease-amylo..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; I believe the reason cat gets interrupted when we press Ctrl+C is that the Linux kernel on the server side receives this \x03 character, recognizes that it means “interrupt”, and then sends a SIGINT to the process that owns the pseudoterminal’s process group. So it’s handled in the kernel and not in userspace.Also interestingly, the use of \x03 for this purpose is a default, but it&#39;s not hardcoded. You can change it with the stty command.For example, if you runstty intr &#39;^X&#39;then your interrupt character sequence will be Ctrl+X instead of Ctrl+C (!).In order to make this change, the stty program actually has to call into the kernel with an ioctl call (TCSETS or a related ioctl, for &#34;terminal control set settings&#34;).You can learn more about this ioctl on Linux in the ioctl_tty(2) man page, and you can see the various settings that can be changed this way withstty -a(It&#39;s a little bit confusing which things are handled by the readline library and which things are handled by the kernel, as the kernel&#39;s ability to support some rudimentary line-editing features on an interactive terminal long predates libraries like readline. I think readline might actually disable kernel interpretation of some of these control characters when it starts accepting input, and then re-enable them when it stops, but I&#39;ve never looked into that.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The client sends l and then immediately receives an l sent back. I guess the idea here is that the client is really dumb – it doesn’t know that when I type an l, I want an l to be echoed back to the screen. It has to be told explicitly by the server process to display it.Of course the client may be really dumb! Here is a 1930s teletype used as a Linux terminal:https://youtu.be/2XLZ4Z8LpEE?t=656If you would not do it that way, you would run into all kinds of synchronicity problems. How could you be sure that, after rapidly making 50 keystrokes, every keystroke was received by the other end, in that order?"</p>

Here’s an old chart from the 60s that explains it:https://programesecure.com/ascii-values-table-generator-in-c...Unfortunately if you just see the character codes with the decimal, hex, and octal next to them this logic is obscured.

Go look at the small business initiatives by each branch of the U.S. military; many are now posting lists of open contracts that you can bid on for an incredible array of things.Browse through those lists and find something you can build.I really believe the U.S. military is in the midst of a large scale transfer of military spending from traditional large defense contractors to smaller, innovative companies. The Air Force has even opened its own venture capital arm and is actively investing in small businesses. Most, if not every, branch in the military publicly posts contracts for small businesses to bid on.I think Anduril is a great example of the possibilities in the &#34;new&#34; defense space.What&#39;s interesting is this shift is very reminiscent of military manufacturing in Japan during World War 2; much of the manufacturing was actually done by small businesses of &lt; 30 employees in &#34;garages&#34; scattered around the country instead of very large factories. That was one of the reasons American bombing by Superfortresses was so ineffective at first, and one of the reasons incendiary bombs began being used.Happy to provide more detail on this. I&#39;ve been thinking about this space for awhile."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used to be the education director at a makerspace and now run a 3D printing company selling small plastic parts and teaching entrepreneurs how to start small manufacturing businesses at home.Few thoughts:- Focus on your hobbies and other industries you know well. What problems exist? Where can you make things better? Are there problems people mention over and over again?- CAD modeling is often THE fundamental skill needed for people to bring their ideas to market. You can make CAD models that look almost real using software you can get for free. This allows you to work backwards, first determining if there&#39;s a market, and also working out many of the design flaws before making somethingIf you&#39;re just excited to make stuff, and want to get your hands on something, you can do all kinds of things in a tight space.- 3D printers are small and provide many automated opportunities
- Laser cutters are dead simple to set up and use to make real products and are easy to automate. 
- CNC machines can be had for under 5k and are super powerful
- Portable MIG welders have a small footprint and welding tends to be in high demand
- Leather working tends to be high perceived value though automation is limited
- Soldering and electronics repair requires little space but again, automation is limitedI&#39;ve got loads of other ideas too but I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s good for now. My contact information is in my profile if you&#39;d like to talk more."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I started making jet ski tread mats out of astro turf in my garage last year. Dead simple to cut, margin is super high ($60 for a standard set of three on ~$8 worth of material), and time spent per unit from roll to package is something like 15-20 minutes. It was fun and made about $30k over the summer months but I stopped when I moved back to the west coast.I could have handled the whole operation in a spare bedroom if I didn&#39;t have a garage, and there are plenty of areas where I could have dropped the time required or the cost. I never bought the turf in bulk and I used household scissors to cut from a template so buying a roll and cutting with something more effective may have netted me more. Niche leisure products in spend-y verticals typically do well."</p>
