Second, just because you can, doesn&#39;t mean you should :)I think it&#39;s art, so be careful about adding more.  The minimalism is beautiful.  Just a bunch of moving lights, but they capture the feel of night driving! If you add everything mentioned as upgrades, it will be a simulation.  An impressive engineering feat, but (I think) less as a work of art.I wonder, what does someone who&#39;s never ridden/driven in a car at night &#39;feel&#39; when they see this?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Reminds me of a passion project I started in high school that went completely viral and took on a life of its own. Wrote a small script for my friends to check their AP scores a few days early. Required high schoolers giving clear text access to their entire CollegeBoard account so I could log on and scrape their scores. Somehow it got posted to Reddit and from that year on, grew wildly. Got to almost 2 million students checking their score in its peak year. It was immensely fun while it lasted (ran for about 7 years) and honestly I miss the thrill of it. CollegeBoard now releases all scores on the same day so the site is pretty much useless now. Definitely always looking to chase the thrill of that score release day again though.Congrats on a successful end to a fun high school project! Stories like this are always fun to read."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Epic stuff, and I think this experience may well be more valuable than the homework you avoided. Basically you did harder homework in order to avoid easier homework.The problem is letting other people use it; of course it&#39;s nice to help people, and it&#39;s altruistic to do so for free, but some of those people might actually need this homework to learn, and you may have deprived them of that. (Although I also think watching a video and doing some multiple choice questions is the laziest low-effort homework assignment there is, and the damage may not have been all that big.) But you used logic and programming to work around a math problem, which are roughly in the same field, so I think that&#39;s fair.A slightly similar situation: my previous job was at a bank, and banks over here are bound by all sorts of ethics and rules, and are required to regularly train all their employees in balancing the interests of customers, society, and the bank. This bank did that by gamifying it: we had an app where we had to answer all sorts of ethical questions and make sure our score in the app was over 70% at the end of every month.A coworker used our testing framework to access the app, answer questions randomly like you did, and store the correct answer to use next time. It apparently worked very well, but using tech to avoid ethics questions is quite a different issue than yours. (He shared it with me when he left, and I tried it, but it didn&#39;t work for me.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I was in university, I scraped an internal job postings site for students to find internships. The site was terrible- each job description would load in a pop-up window controlled by Javascript, and loading a second description would override the first. It was also really slow and had limited filtering. My version could load job descriptions in new tabs, presented the table on a single page, and you could mark jobs that you weren&#39;t interested in or had already applied to.The university didn&#39;t take kindly to that. They accused me of trying to take down the co-op system and threatened to sue me for copyright infringement. Since I linked into their system for job descriptions, I was able to show that the data I actually had (company, title, location) wasn&#39;t creative work and therefore not copyrightable. I also had some friends in the university faculty and staff who spoke up for me, since I had reported security vulnerabilities in the past, indicating that I wasn&#39;t acting with malicious intent. In the end, I just had to take a business ethics course, which I probably would have taken anyway."</p>

Software I am thankful for.. there is a fair amount of such.Anki - Software, that helped me build up habit, and made learning language an easier taskEmacs - Wonderful text editor, made interacting with system a bliss.Nix/NixOS - Distro, that made updates a painless, and fearless task. I love it.ZFS - Filesystem that I love, for it has many wonderful features, and they all just work. (Also cute compression)Wine + DXVK/VKD3D - Thanks to this, I was able to completely drop windows partition, and go full Linux.LaTeX - Thanks to it, I could have cute workflow for writing documents (And yesterday, wrote CV with its&#39; help :D)Calibre - Man.. what a behemot of book software. Makes anything ebook related painlessCommon Lisp(SBCL) and Haskell(GHC) - Very interesting 
languages, with very wonderful features. I love them both.Cool retro term - For playing roguelikes, lets me experience them in very retro, retro way.Obviously, ublock origin, makes browsing web not a nightmare.Aseprite - wonderful pixelart software.There is more, but... I will stop there, to make the comment.. not too long."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The fish shell, makes using the shell feel almost painless.Hammerspoon, I use it to automatically switch audio devices based on context, so every call uses the best microphone currently available, window management via keystrokes, limiting media keys to Spotify, tons of other things. Indispensable.Arduino, I don&#39;t think I would be able to tinker with microcontrollers as much if I had to write C and use obscure toolchains directly.Solvespace, a limited but usable free CAD for simple parts to be 3d printed. Wish there was a real contender to the commercial ones though, or a free tier that doesn&#39;t smell like it&#39;s going away any time. Still very thankful that SolveSpace exists.The Scala 3 compiler and the VSCode plugin for v3. Absolutely love the language and the experience is so much better than with IntelliJ, haven&#39;t had as much fun writing code in ages.This will be a bit controversial, but Kubernetes, because if people use it via GKE, EKS etc. then I won&#39;t have to learn their organically grown solution to the same dozen-or-so operations problems, and I have yet to see one that isn&#39;t a hot mess in some way or other. Also anything running on top of Kubernetes won&#39;t be built the very old-fashioned vi-edits-on-server way, great for sanity.Various modern messenger apps (Telegram, Whatsapp, Instagram&#39;s direct messages, ...) because I would hear a lot less from some highly cherished and very non-technical people in my life without these incredibly slick and fun and convenient apps. As one who&#39;s old enough to remember being dependent on landlines and payphones and letters, this still feels like a miracle."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Python - It (still) makes writing software enjoyable for me.Type annotations: Started using them this year and it allows my editor to give me all sorts of hints about things I&#39;m doing wrong.Typer / Click: I&#39;ve been writing a bunch of CLIs this year and Typer and Click make this really fun.Wezterm: Went all in on this terminal 3-4 months ago and it&#39;s really great!  In particular I like the &#34;copy mode&#34; features and it&#39;s &#34;tmux+mosh&#34; abilities.LunarVim: Been using it for ~9 months, and it gives me all the advanced developer features I felt like I was missing in my various attempts at a custom vim setup, without the pain.sway / i3wm: On my 4th year using it and it just fits my workflow so well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"They&#39;re right, recently I&#39;ve installed some Windows update for my parents and I had to reject like 5 suggested changes - installing Office trial, switching default browser to Edge yet again, and more.But this goes way beyond the browsers - I&#39;ve never explicitly installed Keychain on my iphone and yet it shows as an option next to 1password every time I fill in a password field. Google calendar asks me to install an app every time I open a web version on my phone, my work laptop has 1 active notification in system settings for a year because I didn&#39;t enable iCloud backup.I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s the solution here. I stick to the apps I use because I know what I&#39;m doing, but so many users will just click &#34;yes&#34; when shown a pop-up. On the other hand, the built-in integrations provide value (e.g. it&#39;s better that people use and save random passwords in Keychain than using the same one everywhere). I feel it&#39;s always a cat-and-mouse game where the big tech is punished after they&#39;ve already gained a lot, so they win anyway."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Without commenting on the claims, it&#39;s interesting to consider how times have changed. Microsoft originally lost an antitrust lawsuit [1] over little more than tying Internet Explorer into their OS and not readily including alternatives. They not only lost that case, but the initial judgement was that the company was to be broken up.Microsoft started spending dramatically more money on &#34;lobbying&#34; following that.[1] - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft_Cor...."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the next frontiers as a barrier to browser switching will be &#34;software&#34;-backed WebAuthn/FIDO2/&#34;passkeys&#34;.If you look at the APIs available on MacOS/iOS at present [0], and how WebAuthn works, you need to &#34;trust&#34; the client-side software to correctly identify the site origin (i.e. protocol, domain, port) and pass it to a physical security key. In the case of a software token, you need to restrict which app(s) can pass this information through to the system carrying out authentication.The end result right now, as I can see it, is that if you sign up to a website using a &#34;passkey&#34; via Safari (for example), there is no real supported workflow that isn&#39;t site-specific, for migrating to a new browser - you are effectively beholden to Apple&#39;s keychain for getting you back into that site.If you want to enrol a new device (say an Android phone using its own software implementation of WebAuthn), you would need to find a way to sign into your old account (which requires your MacOS/iOS passkey to log in), then enrol your Android device (which is a separate physical device). You&#39;ll likely get stuck here.An expert user could add a physical FIDO2 token to their account from the old device (Safari), and use that as the authenticator to log in on the new device, but this is significant friction for a non-technical user.While moving users away from passwords might make sense, I do think we&#39;ll see these &#34;passwordless&#34; authentication mechanisms become the next major point of friction in user browser choice. Even if you can implement WebAuthn in your rival browser, unless you get access to the system key store, you won&#39;t be able to let users sign in. That will prevent them switching.[0] https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/supporting-a..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think you partly may just be biased by happening to notice ads more if they fit the topic you sent to your wife or being lenient in deciding if ads meet the categorization. And if you dwell on an ad because it seems to match, you may get more similar ads.Here is how I think you could design a more robust (but less fun) experiment:- Come up with a bunch of topics, write them down on slips of paper, put the paper into a hat- Each Monday, draw three topics from the hat, send some WhatsApp messages about the first, Messenger messages about the second, and don’t discuss the third. Don’t put the topics back in the hat.- If you see any ads relating to one of the topics, screenshot them and save screenshots to eg your computer with a bit of the topic- Separately, record which topic went to which platform- After doing this for a while, go through the screenshots and (each of you and your wife or ideally other people) give a rating for how well the ad matches the topic. To avoid bias, you shouldn’t know which app saw the topic.- Now work out average ratings / the distribution across the three products (WhatsApp vs Messenger vs none) and compare"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"(wrt some comments in this thread)Is it so hard to believe that Meta is snooping on WhatsApp conversations? Meta, a company of unprecedented size that was built over monetizing your private data? A company who&#39;s been caught in plenty of scandals (like Cambridge Analytic) about this exact sort of thing (violating their users&#39; privacy)?Someone from this community, which generally means educated, tech-literate and sensitive to these topics shares a perfectly plausible observation, of something that has been experienced as well by plenty of other folks, me included; and then some people come and try to make up the most convoluted explanations (candy boxes from Kazakhstan just happened to be trending that specific day, nothing to see here, move along!) to this phenomena and try to shift the blame away from Meta. Why do you do this? Are you Meta employees? A PR agency they hired?It&#39;s just baffling. Apparently some people DO want to be abused.Plot twist: we all get ads about candy boxes from KZ now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who has actually worked on end to end encryption at Meta, I can tell you I am not aware of anything where the company reads your WhatsApp messages - either in transit or device. The company takes fairly serious measures to ensure it cannot even accidentally infer such contents.I don&#39;t know what is happening in this specific case. Perhaps the ads came from some other similar search queries. Perhaps they came from the keyboard intercepting what was typed. Or perhaps something else that I can&#39;t think of. But I&#39;m nearly certain it did not come from meta intercepting the contents of your messages.It&#39;s hard to convince people at this point because many have lost trust in Meta as a company, and I understand that. But I still find it stunning that so many people are making so many false claims without any actual knowledge to back it up."</p>

Thank you for your work, and I&#39;m sorry if my comments in the preview HN thread came off as overly hostile, because given the original comments you made about MV3, I couldn&#39;t imagine this sort of outcome. I hope that you or someone else still works to release an MV3-compatible &#34;Full site permissions&#34; version of uBlock as well, since I think there are a lot of potential options for improvement by using declarativeNetRequestFeedback, and it&#39;s certainly more convenient to not have to opt-in. And I&#39;m still worried that without an MV3-compatible version of full uBlock Origin, users are still going to assume that &#34;MV3 means that ad blockers are broken&#34;."</p>

Turns out you can have that screen but you can&#39;t ask a question on that screen or offer a way to dismiss and not get the system dialog. That was news to me since I had seen countless &#34;Do you want to enable push notifications (yes|no)?&#34; screens in top apps but that rule has changed and no longer allows you to pre-ask. I complied but the very next day I opened an app from a billion dollar company and I got a pre-ask that I was able to dismiss without popping the system dialog. wtf...Why am I expected to bend over backwards for app review when these serial abusers get a free pass (no ban AND they can do things smaller apps get slapped down for)?I know the answer is &#34;money&#34; but I fucking hate it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A little while back I recall some pundit describing Facebook as believing that this kind of data was theirs. Not “theirs for the taking”, but literally if they could find a way to obtain it, they considered it their right to have it. Like it was baked into the culture of the company. The more I read about Facebook’s practices, the more it rings true."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If an app needs a webview, it should always strive to open that view in an embedded Safari webview (called an SFSafariViewController) or link to the view in the user&#39;s own choice of browser. 
The app is prevented from seeing ‘inside’ this view.Sometimes an app needs to control some aspect of the external view - for instance listen to some Js event, or inject authorization - and this can be for totally legitimate reasons in the flow of the app. Then the application needs to use another type of embedded webview called a WKWebView, which by definition allows the app to see into the user&#39;s interactions in the embedded browser.Most developers and apps use these for totally necessary reasons - but Facebook is deviously abusing this functionality.Some of the posters in this thread are blaming Apple for Facebook&#39;s evil behavior, but a lot of totally legitimate functionality that needs this type of app/browser communication would be impossible without the ability to enable it for genuine and well-founded reasons."</p>
