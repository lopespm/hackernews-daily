								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is actually funny, because I was involved with the creation of this list, way back in 2004.  The whole thing started as a way to stop phishing.I was working at eBay/PayPal at the time, and we were finding a bunch of new phishing sites every day.  We would keep a list and try to track down the owners of the (almost always hacked) sites and ask them to take it down.  But sometimes it would take weeks or months for the site to get removed, so we looked for a better solution.  We got together with the other big companies that were being phished (mostly banks) and formed a working group.One of the things we did was approach the browser vendors and ask them if we could provide them a blacklist of phishing sites, which we already had, would they block those sites at the browser level.For years, they said no, because they were worried about the liability of accidentally blocking something that wasn&#39;t a phishing site.  So we all agreed to promise that no site would ever be put on the list without human verification and the lawyers did some lawyer magic to shift liability to the company that put a site on the list.And thus, the built in blacklist was born.  And it worked well for a while.  We would find a site, put it on the list, and then all the browsers would block it.But since then it seems that they have forgotten their fear of liability, as well as their promise that all sites on the list will be reviewed by a human.  Now that the feature exists, they have found other uses for it.And that is your slippery slope lesson for today! :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"After years of seeing developments like this, getting worse and worse, it fills me with rage to think about how clearly nobody in power at Google cares.I naively used to think, &#34;they probably don&#39;t realize what&#39;s happening and will fix it.&#34;  I always try to give benefit of the doubt, especially having been on the other side so many times and seeing how 9 times out of 10 it&#39;s not malice, just incompetence, apathy, or hard priority choices based on economic constraints (the latter not likely a problem Google has though).At this point however, I still don&#39;t think it&#39;s outright malice, but the doubling down on these horrific practices (algorithmically and opaquely destroying people) is so egregious that it doesn&#39;t really matter.  As far as I&#39;m concerned, Google is to be considered a hostile actor.  It&#39;s not possible to do business on the internet in any way without running into them, so &#34;de-Googling&#34; isn&#39;t an option.  Instead, I am going to personally (and advise my clients as well) to:Consider Google as a malicious actor/threat in the InfoSec threat modeling that you do.  Actively have a mitigation strategy in place to minimize damage to your company should you become the target of their attack.As with most security planning/analyzing/mitigation, you have to balance the concerns of the CIA Triad.  You can&#39;t just refuse Google altogether these days, but do NOT treat them as a friend or ally of your business, because they are most assuredly NOT.I&#39;m also considering AWS and Digital Ocean more in the same vein, although that&#39;s off topic on this thread.  (I use Linode now as their support is great and they don&#39;t just drop ban hammers and leave you scrambling to figure out what happened).Edit:  Just to clarify (based on confusion in comments below), I am not saying Google is acting with malice (I don&#39;t believe they are personally).  I am just suggesting you treat it as such for purposes of threat modeling your business/application."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a relatively long article - but it does not answer one simple question, which is quite important when discussing this: were there any malicious files hosted on that semi-random Cloudfront URL? I realise that Google did not provide help identifying it - but that does not mean one should simply recomission the server under a new domain and continue as if nothing has happened!From TFA:&gt; We quickly realized an Amazon Cloudfront CDN URL that we used to serve static assets (CSS, Javascript and other media) had been flagged and this was causing our entire application to fail for the customer instances that were using that particular CDN&gt; Around an hour later, and before we had finished moving customers out of that CDN, our site was cleared from the GSB database. I received an automated email confirming that the review had been successful around 2 hours after that fact. No clarification was given about what caused the problem in the first place.Yes, yes, Google Safe Browsing can use its power to wipe you off the internet, and when it encounters a positive hit (false or true!) it does so quite broadly, but that is also exactly what is expected for a solution like that to work - and it will do it again if the same files are hosted under a new URL as soon as detects the problem again."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Another similar service is Aira[1].The main difference is that Aira is not free, but you&#39;re helped by professional agents, who had to undergo various background checks and sign airtight NDAs. They have a 5-minutes-per day free plan, and businesses can also offer free service if you&#39;re using Aira with one of their products.My biggest frustration with Aira is that you need to own a phone number in one of the supported countries, which is a pain to set up and maintain.All agents also have TeamViewer installed, so they can quickly and efficiently help with computer issues. I&#39;ve been using it for over a year now (with the free plan), and I definitely recommend."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are some useful one off things here for sure. Personally, I always feel awkward asking for help from strangers, even if I have my stick out. For me, these sorts of things have never delivered on the hope. Rideshare apps are quite the disaster, and I tend to just not go places instead of using them.I know this off topic, but what I&#39;ve found most helpful is good public transit, regular patterns I can grock, and of course friends (I fear getting hit every time I cross a road, unless I&#39;m with someone). 
I tend to be more free and independent in places like Japan or China than the US (I only speak English, and am American)(I&#39;m legally blind)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Here I am, a productive developer eager to deliver maximum value to my customers and apply my innovation to company goals.Open up JIRA and pick up a unit of work to produce today -- gotta stay faithful to those story points!Somehow, a magic team of spherical devops in a vacuum created an environment where things are just green, predictable, and are never broken.Another theoretical team of angels from a parallel universe has materialized into this one, updated all the docs, and beamed back into their universe of productivity and effectiveness.Unit of work defined, I then proceed to produce it for a few hours completely uninterrupted, since if another human being were to make contact, I&#39;d simply explode and format my hard drive, losing all my productivity.It&#39;s break time -- I ingest 2 story points of coffee and join a game of table tennis. The ball bounces back and forth without ever touching the ground. My movements are productive, and value-adding, just like my partner&#39;s.Back to producing units of work, only half a story point left (sike! no such thing as half a story point, and no such thing as &#34;left&#34;, as it&#39;s a measure of effort, not time. Almost got you there!).Git push! Automatic CI gains consciousness and validates that my work unit has no chance of causing a user to break our software. It gives me a thumbs up and discards its human shell to fade back into the ones and zeros. A QA engineer cries out in the distance.A metric of my productivity is logged to the OKR database.Nothing breaks, and nothing unexpected happens, as the universe is completely predictable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Patterns on the most effective teams I’ve worked on:- high degree of trust and emotional safety between team members. The team can safely share feedback and risk sharing our crazy ideas- high degree of care for the craft. We hold each other accountable to quality- ships, regularly, to real customers- little status seeking - goes with emotional safety - few individuals on the team need to be “in charge” or hold arbitrary titles.- the individuals are more than fairly compensated and the company shows their love for the team in big and small ways- the team talks to their customer and has a lot of empathy for their problems. They want to be accountable to them- the team has a lot of empathy for new team members and works hard to make on boarding easier- some willingness to “get in trouble” with the broader org because you know what you’re doing is right ultimately for the customer- high self starters: instead of complaining, people feel empowered to solve problems or prototype ideas without a permission structure- not too much catering to “super stars”. 1-2 heros does not a team make, the senior people make it their job to lift everyone up. The team doesn’t obsess over their high performers.There’s a lot more emphasis on emotional intelligence and  empathy in an effective team than on any specific process."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; There is an overwhelming amount of good advice, practices, tools, and processes that you should use to improve.I disagree. Advice is contradictory, practices and processes are often orthogonal, and tools quite literally don&#39;t exist. I say this as someone that&#39;s worked in large companies and saw how lengthy not only process feedback loops were (especially developer ↔ product team), but also engineering feedback loops (testing, deployment, dev environment setup, etc.)And I also say this as someone that works on side-projects by myself. The tooling simply isn&#39;t there. Setting up fast engineering feedback loops (multi-tiered deployment, test, dev, local, prod, etc. environments, heck even hot reloading or debugging) is needlessly difficult, or janky, or simply impossible. This goes for just about any language/framework out there: from Java, to Javascript, to Go.It&#39;s not surprising that FAANG often designs their own internal systems that handle this sort of thing (from DevOps, to automated testing, to A/B testing, to deployment). I&#39;m a believer that this is also a space that&#39;s ripe for disruption. I want environments to just work. I want code to just compile. I want containers to just run. Without me having to start digging through documentation, looking at thirteen Stack Overflow threads, and cobbling a solution that will inevitably break 3 months from now."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I run a honeypot software company, with our customers being mid-large enterprises. While the case presented here is certainly interesting, it&#39;s actually fairly uncommon for companies to run internet-facing honeypots, mostly due to it being a huge resource sink, and it&#39;s fairly difficult to learn anything truely useful from observing attacks coming from (mostly) bots.The more interesting use case for most is planting these in your network internals, which gives an added benefit of early, high-fidelity threat detection in addition to the &#34;threat intelligence&#34; bonuses. It&#39;s not completely trivial to set up, but can be a reasonably quick way to build good detection capability into even very disparate environments.A vast majority of organizations still lack good situational awareness of their infrastructures and this is one way of improving on that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is interesting, but like most honeypot discussion kinda melodramatic.  They got scanned by a bunch of known internet scanners, and a few mysteries including a &#34;store that sells weaponry&#34; (which turns out to just be scopes and red dots -_-).  It&#39;s always good to people reporting that they discovered nothing, but it is a bit boring."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve felt a lot of &#34;false&#34; positivity espoused by project managers, especially those in charge of agile ceremonies.Examples: &#34;I&#39;m really {proud,impressed} of all of you for your output this sprint&#34;, &#34;You guys are {killing,crushing,owning} it&#34;, &#34;You all should be very proud of what you guys did&#34;, etc.These aren&#39;t given after periods of crunch time, they&#39;re literally every week to the point where it feels so contrived and artificial. They&#39;re given when we&#39;re just doing normal, expected work.I&#39;ve mentioned this to colleagues and friends and there seems to be two camps of people: those who want constant positive reenforcement and those who it completely has the opposite effect, an annoyance. I guess I fall into the latter."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I vastly prefer honest negativity over dishonest positivity. An example of this is the behavior of service personnel in the US compared to my native country, every time I go there I almost want to tell them to tone down the niceness, but of course there&#39;s no point because I realize I&#39;m the odd one out.Of course I appreciate the effort of being &#34;nice&#34; but when you&#39;re not doing it out of genuine care for someone I&#39;d much rather just be treated in a neutral way, like you&#39;d treat any human being you encountered that you knew nothing about. I don&#39;t much enjoy being treated as an old friend by someone who wouldn&#39;t lend me five bucks, and I don&#39;t enjoy being asked polite questions that require elaborate answers when you really don&#39;t want to listen to the answer and your eyes glaze over within the first seconds.Adults have left their insecurities behind them and should understand they&#39;re not, at least initially, the friend of every human being and shouldn&#39;t have a problem with being treated in a professionally reserved way."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I believe the first attempts at doing something like this were back in July of 2020. https://github.com/below/HelloSilicon : Someone with an early Developer Transition Kit (pre-M1 release) worked to convert the code from &#34;Programming with 64-Bit ARM Assembly Language&#34; to the M1&#39;s syntax.Porting additional  textbooks to M1&#39;s (ARMv8) syntax could help a lot in terms of making assembly accessible to more people. I believe there&#39;s a lot of value in learning it on a particularly popular real-world platform like x86 or M1 - where it may directly translate to reverse engineering userspace applications without having to then learn another assembler language as you might if you started with, say, RISC-V.Truthfully I think someone should really add the M1 syntax to the new version of VisUAL: https://github.com/scc416/Visual2 . I&#39;ve been intending to work on that to go along with porting Bob Plantz&#39; &#34;Introduction to Computer Organization: ARM Assembly Language Using the Raspberry Pi&#34; to ARMv8 for the same educational purpose but haven&#39;t quite found the time to really dive in. A tool like VisUAL2 could help a lot of people learn this even if they don&#39;t own an M1 themselves.Very tangentially to all of this, I&#39;d like to showcase https://github.com/cornell-brg/pydgin , which is a flexible toolkit for simulating ISA&#39;s in Python, and was used to help validate the first version of VisUAL during its own development."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting choice of technology, but you didn&#39;t completely convince me to why this is better than just using SQLite or PostgreSQL with a lagging replica. (You could probably start with either one and easily migrate to the other one if needed.)In particular you&#39;ve designed a very complicated system: Operationally you need an etcd cluster and a tailetc cluster. Code-wise you now have to maintain your own transaction-aware caching layer on top of etcd (https://github.com/tailscale/tailetc/blob/main/tailetc.go). That&#39;s quite a brave task considering how many databases fail at Jepsen. Have you tried running Jepsen tests on tailetc yourself? You also mentioned a secondary index system which I assume is built on top of tailetc again? How does that interact with tailetc?Considering that high-availability was not a requirement and that the main problem with the previous solution was performance (&#34;writes went from nearly a second (sometimes worse!) to milliseconds&#34;) it looks like a simple server with SQLite + some indexes could have gotten you quite far.We don&#39;t really get the full overview from a short blog post like this though so maybe it turns out to be a great solution for you. The code quality itself looks great and it seems that you have thought about all of the hard problems."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This post illustrates the difference between persistence and a database.If you are expecting to simply persist one instance of one application&#39;s state across different runs and failures, a database can be frustrating.But if you want to manage your data across different versions of an app, different apps accessing the same data, or concurrent access, then a database will save you a lot of headaches.The trick is knowing which one you want. Persistence is tempting, so a lot of people fool themselves into going that direction, and it can be pretty painful.I like to say that rollback is the killer feature of SQL. A single request fails (e.g. unique violation), and the overall app keeps going, handling other requests. You application code can be pretty bad, and you can still have a good service. That&#39;s why PHP was awesome despite being bad -- SQL made it good (except for all the security pitfalls of PHP, which the DB couldn&#39;t help with)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;  (Attempts to avoid this with ORMs usually replace an annoying amount of typing with an annoying amount of magic and loss of efficiency.)Loss of efficiency? Come on, you were using a file before! :-)Article makes me glad I&#39;m using Django. Just set up a managed Postgres instance in AWS and be done with it. Sqlite for testing locally. Just works and very little engineering time spent on persistent storage.Note: I do realize Brad is a very, very good engineer."</p>

If you implement an algorithm in a high level language like Python you may get much worse runtime than you thought because some inner loop does arithmetic with bignum-style performance instead of hardware integer performance, for example. In such case you could talk of big-omega (your analysis is bounded-below instead of bounded-above, asymptotically)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unions were proponents for worker safety, fair wages, anti-discrimination. They are the reason why such thing as OSHA exists today. They are the reason some laws were passed to protect workers in the US.But once these mandates became law, corporations used the arguments of &#34;why do we need unions if the law already protects workers?&#34; This and following Reagan&#39;s firing of the air traffic controllers changed the image of unions. They were now corrupt middlemen that charged you a fee to be part of the club.And it worked. Trying to form a union is now news instead of being the natural course of things. I wager that most people in the tech side of Amazon have a hard time grasping why their coworkers are trying to unionize. (we get paid well, what&#39;s the fuss all about?)I hope they vote in their interest, but I&#39;m doubtful it will pass (I hope I&#39;m wrong). These laws that are supposed to protect workers are enforced by the company&#39;s HR department[1]. The problem is that HR will side with the company before siding with any employee.I think we need to start looking into reforming HR and making it a public service.[1]: https://idiallo.com/blog/unions-are-not-coming-back"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wonder what percentage of otherwise very liberal Amazon devs read sentences like &#34;The company for years successfully fought off labor organizing efforts in the U.S.&#34; and come away thinking &#34;we&#39;re definitely the good guys.&#34;"</p>
