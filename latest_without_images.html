								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I want to share my own reactions to the name change since this is a really interesting topic. For context, I&#39;m an African American, so many of my ancestors were slaves.  - The first time it occurred to me that &#34;master&#34; in this context could offend anyone was when GitHub changed the name (and broke my workflow).
  - My immediate reaction was, &#34;this change is by white people for white people,&#34; where &#34;white&#34; means anyone who isn&#39;t black.
  - My next reaction was, &#34;they may be changing the name for the wrong reasons, but the change is brilliant.&#34;

Let me explain a little more. Whether motivated purely by virtue signaling or by more genuine intentions, changing the name doesn&#39;t fix any of the problems that black people face. The article explains this well.What&#39;s powerful about this name change is that it pushes us to alter a habit, in my case one embedded deeply in my fingers, something that I do every day without realizing that I&#39;m doing it. Thus it is a useful reminder of the implicit bias that contributes to the lack of diversity in tech. Never mind that the old name was harmless, the change brings repeated awareness to an important topic, and it reaches a the developer community in a targeted way.So, next time you are annoyed that you have to fix a script or you accidentally type master when you needed to type main, please just take a deep breath, change the name, and remember to reflect upon whether you have are subconscious habits or biases that work against diversity in tech."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m a black American and agree with everything that this person in London wrote.It is also a common criticism of the American “left”, and is entirely accurate.For everyone perplexed about black Americans and other people of color walking away from the left, its because you/they don&#39;t see us as equals that can be bothered by the exact same things that other Americans can be bothered by: being told what to think, watching people be vicariously offended without asking if context in question is offensive, and the obsession with signaling instead of meaningful action."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Though I initially sympathized with the name change from master to main (cause I don&#39;t care what it is called), I am now more of the opinion that this kind of window-dressing might actually be harmful as it distracts from addressing the root cause. It is a bit complicated as the name change in itself is not bad, but given the context, and that it distracts from addressing real issues it actually is.Same thing with plastic recycling, in and of itself it is better than landfill, but as it allows us to feel good and look away from the real problem (plastic is cheap because most impacts are externalized) the recycling of plastic contributes more to the problem than to the solution. I know people who traveled around the world about once a year, own a big house and altogether have a pretty big impact that could easily be reduced, but they do recycle plastic and think of themselves as somewhat environmentally responsible.For the record, I do recycle plastic."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very pleased that Audacity is still actively developed. I said it before but I think this can&#39;t be overstated:Audacity may had some quirks over the years but it&#39;s still one of the most (if not the most) accessible tool for audio editing by non-professionals with an adequate feature set. It&#39;s used by community radio stations all over the world since it&#39;s easy to teach and cross-platform while being free."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fantastic. Audacity keeps it simple and does it well, if there was ever a hall of fame of applications, Audacity deserves a spot. Heck, if I were to distribute any kind of &#34;creative suite&#34;, I would always include Audacity, no matter what operating system I was targeting. It is a near essential tool for working with audio, daily, or every now and then.The genius of the application is that it does not try to be more than a waveform editor. Oftentimes, no matter if you are new to audio production or a veteran audio technician, you just need to edit some sound, and Audacity lets you get it done in a easy enough way for newbies, and in a complex enough way for veterans.Maintainers of projects like these should carry themselves with pride. Projects that stand the test of time and continue to deliver exactly what you needed is what makes the IT-world go around."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m pretty sure all of the songs I recorded in high school are gone forever, since I only backed up the Audacity files and not the entire folder. Perhaps this is for the best, but either way I&#39;m glad future emo teens will have an easier time preserving their work."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well done! This looks impressive and really useful. I’ve been looking for a lightweight sprite / spark lib for a while. Clients always, for some reason, are very impressed by little charts in a table row, doing this witha normal size chart lib kills page performance. I was literally including very basic html indicators in a presentation today and client where really impressed! This really solves that issue!And even more. Really great that you van manipulate the elements as css. Most chart libs I’ve dealt with makes non-trivial customization impossible.I’ll probably be building this in as Lowdefy blocks[1].Just curious, did you consider just branding it as sparks.css / sprites.css or something? Going the spark / sprite route just sets the expectations a lot lower imo. Although congrats, you are really close to fully functional charts here! Really interested to see how far this can go.[1] - https://lowdefy.com"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Cool!
I&#39;ll have to take the opportunity to mention my own charts.css[0]. It got some interest on HN last year [1] and I unfortunately dropped the ball and didn&#39;t make any revisions based on the good feedback I got. As people pointed out, I tried to give it a &#34;cute&#34; name using unicode which unfortunately makes it harder to search for.This version (OP&#39;s) is way more polished and almost certainly more widely useful. But mine had the features of (a) being generated from markdown and (b) defaulting to a list presentation of the data under different styles so the data remained accessible.Having more charting options that don&#39;t require javascript to do simple things is a good thing.[0] https://rbitr.github.io/ChartS.css/

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What&#39;s also not being said here is that ~99% of apps on Google Play don&#39;t make money this way either.Due to a combination of Android user&#39;s reluctance to spend money on apps at all and the rampant piracy that Android&#39;s open model makes trivially easy, most developers only way to make money is through in-app advertising, which this change obviously makes no difference to.Google Play is mostly a pyramid scheme. Developer&#39;s can only make money from showing ads and at the same time can only get downloads if they place ads on other people&#39;s apps. And Google just happens to own all the mobile ad companies.This 15% cut ends up &#34;costing&#34; Google virtually nothing.And as for Google &#34;helping developers build sustainable businesses&#34;, the only times they&#39;ve ever reached out to me were to offer me the opportunity to have someone help me spend thousands of dollars a month on mobile ads. Never, for example, to actually take down all the scam apps that use my app&#39;s name, icon and screenshots."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Worth remembering that as good as it is that Google is reducing it&#39;s abusive taxation on third party developers, the primary reason they&#39;re doing this is to try to quiet the majority of developers asking for stronger government regulations against this taxation without actually reducing their profit much, since the large companies which bring in the majority of revenue still have to pay full price.Basically, they&#39;re hoping that this will stop some app developers from demanding the right to use third party payment processors, which would likely be used many of the larger &gt;$1 million revenue publishers.The Android Police article about this cites an example from iOS, that &#34;On Apple&#39;s App Store, the 98% of developers who qualified for a lower revenue share rate were responsible for less than 5% of Apple&#39;s total collected revenue&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Further evidence that developer pressure and legal pressure on smartphone platforms work, that they aren&#39;t a waste of time.Prolonged campaigns for better terms can make a tangible difference, and we should be encouraged by this result to advocate for even better terms. It turns out that when they have real pressure, it is possible for Google and Apple to come up with better terms.Keep in mind that the reason Google is being sued for antitrust isn&#39;t because it was taking 30% -- it&#39;s because it forced manufactures not to install or bundle any 3rd party stores by threatening to remove access to the Play store if any competing storefronts were enabled by default on consumer devices. So this doesn&#39;t change the original complaint, but it&#39;s still a very big win for smaller developers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I looked and looked and looked and for the life of me could not see the excessive gradients that he was talking about in the image captions.

Properly this time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"EGA Monkey Island is similarly beautiful.I feel EGA forced artists to work within the limitations of the available color palette, and good artists created awesome stuff (like shown in this case). Once they had VGA, some artists rushed to use every color gradient they could get away with, and this ruined their art till they got the hang of it.Something similar happened with the transition from pixel art to 3D games -- games were 3D because they had to, whether necessary or not. And many suffered from it. (Arguably, many still do!)Of course, I hold the extremist opinion that even some CGA (4 colors!) games were beautiful in their own way. I don&#39;t think more is always better, a lesson that seems to be lost on some game developers..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lots of rose colored glasses here.Yes, looking back on the EGA graphics, there is definitely a level of skill and stylization that I took for granted at the time and have a certain nostalgia for, but when the VGA versions of these games came out they were all mind-blowing and you just kind of had to be there - no one was selecting the EGA option if they had a VGA card.I remember the VGA version of Indiana Jones in particular being awesome in VGA, on a CRT, live in motion."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; We will discover new jobs–we always do after a technological revolutionCGP grey put this well&gt; Imagine a pair of horses in the early 1900s talking about technology. One worries all these new mechanical muscles (cars etc) will make horses unnecessary. The other horse reminds him that everything so far has made their lives easier - remember all that farm work? Remember running coast-to-coast delivering mail? Remember riding into battle? All terrible! These new city jobs are pretty cushy, and with so many humans in the cities there will be more jobs for horses than ever. Even if this car thingy takes off, he might say, there will be new jobs for horses we can&#39;t imagine.&gt; But you know what happened. There are still working horses, but nothing like before. The horse population peaked in 1915 - from that point on it was nothing but down.&gt; There&#39;s no law of economics that says that better technology makes more better jobs for horses. It sounds shockingly dumb to even say that out loud. But swap horses for humans and suddenly people think it sounds about right.&#34;Humans need not apply&#34; - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In the next five years, computer programs that can think will read legal documents and give medical advice.Aside from the other points, taking &#34;AI&#34; as it exists in it&#39;s present form (deep neural networks and related) as specifically the bringer of unlimited wealth certainly puffs up the various &#34;AI companies&#34; notably OpenAI (It should be noted that OpenAI&#39;s most famous product, GPT-3, can generate strings that sound a lot like legal or medical advice but it so far &#34;demonstrates non-understanding on a regular basis&#34;. Don&#39;t follow it&#39;s advice to kill yourself, for example).It really should be said that deep learning, in particular, is still just one technology that&#39;s very good at some things, kind of impressive but not functional at other things, and just unable to do other things (actual understanding of biology, for example, seems well beyond them). I don&#39;t think this situation has changed since deep learning began it&#39;s hype cycle (which isn&#39;t to say it&#39;s &#34;nothing&#34;, it just doesn&#39;t seem like to bring us &#34;everything&#34;, a scenario the article literally sketches).Automation has proceeded apace, automation in general has brought us enough resources right now to give minimal comfort to most people in the planet (as people have noted).But automation has generally succeeded in situations where everything is controlled - ie, factories. Self-driving cars are forever five years away given the 5% or 1% or whatever level of unpredictable variable involved. Progress on robots that can interact well with either humans or &#34;the messy real world&#34; even in very limited terms has been painfully slow and I expect this to continue."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; If everyone owns a slice of American value creation, everyone will want America to do better: collective equity in innovation and in the success of the country will align our incentives.I kind of doubt that. At Google we&#39;re paid in part with shares of GOOG, but at Google&#39;s scale that&#39;s just treated as cash compensation. At my level, nothing I do affects the stock price, and most Googlers feel this way.Sure, I want Google to do well, and I want America to do well too. Both of them doing well benefits me. But it doesn&#39;t really encourage me to do something different day-to-day."</p>

So when he says:&#34;I believe a well-diversified portfolio of non-debt and non-dollar assets along with a short cash position is preferable to a traditional stock/bond mix that is heavily skewed to US dollars. I also believe that assets in the mature developed reserve currency countries will underperform the Asian (including Chinese) emerging countries’ markets.&#34;It&#39;s not his avuncular advice.

But using certain sectors of the bond market as a savings and retirement mechanism can be quite effective. Consider US tax-free municipal bonds (munies). They are safe, with defaults at a miniscule percentage of corporate bonds. And many are backed with third party insurance against defaults. Their returns are multiples of US Treasuries, CDs, money markets and savings accounts. And all distributions are tax exempt with the exception of any capital gains. Not very exciting. Sort of like watching grass grow. But it grows and grows. My own investments in this area are with: https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/overview/...edit: And by investing in munies you&#39;re also investing in US infrastructure. Munies fund all that stuff. Bridges, fire stations, schools, roads, water treatment plants, ports, electrical grids, etc, etc, etc. Might even make you feel like a good citizen..."</p>
