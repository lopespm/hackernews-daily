It deserves much better than the tedious flamewar that this topic has routinely been converging to, so let&#39;s give it a go.If you&#39;re going to comment, please focus on specific, interesting things in the article that you&#39;re curious about.Please don&#39;t post generic, shallow, obvious, indignant, and/or dismissive comments—those are repetitive and predictable, we&#39;ve had more than enough of them, they&#39;re tedious, not what this site is for, and we don&#39;t need more.https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html"</p>

For example, a web3 chat app announcement I saw yesterday [1].

Feels like the &#34;distributed web&#34; portion of it has just been an over-exaggeration all along."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love syncthing as much as the next guy on here, but this article feels very much like &#34;why doesn&#39;t this square peg fit my round hole?!&#34; Dropbox (and iCloud) are meant more for cloud file storage than pure device-to-device synce. I couldn&#39;t go to a less tech savvy friend and say, &#34;Oh, you use Dropbox for backups? Here, use syncthing instead!&#34; For one, most people don&#39;t have multiple computers they want to keep in sync, and even if they do it&#39;s unlikely that those multiple computers have overlapping periods of being online, which syncthing will need to keep back ups!The author&#39;s baffling reaction to iCloud and Dropbox&#39;s warning just makes my point. Those warnings are super clear to people who use those services for backup - remove this file and it won&#39;t be backed up, hence not available elsewhere. That isn&#39;t those platforms begging for attention (???). Remove those warnings and see how many normies complain to Apple/Dropbox that they didn&#39;t know removing a file from their synced folder meant it wouldn&#39;t be synced anymore. This also applies to the bizarre complaint about cloud storage space limits - of course you need storage space on the service if those files have to live elsewhere!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been using Syncthing for about a year now, with multiple computers, and it&#39;s fantastic.Dropbox has become a real pain over the years (I&#39;ve also been a paid Dropbox customer for a long time):* adding bloat and features that I don&#39;t want or need* constantly nagging me for upgrades* lying that the admin password is required (it isn&#39;t)* consuming large amounts of CPU when anything changes anywhere in the filesystemIf Dropbox had a subscription plan where I could pay to get just the basic file sync functionality, with no nagging, no prompting, and optimized CPU usage, I would be happy to hand over my money. But it seems the company is run by the marketing team now.I highly recommend syncthing as a very, very capable replacement."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hey everyone, glad you all are enjoying the project!To address some of the points I&#39;m seeing, it&#39;s not perfect right now, which is why we&#39;ve considered this a beta release. In particular, there are some issues around name coverage abroad and around engineered features (dams, canals, etc.). A lot of known issues are documented at the top of this page: https://ksonda.github.io/global-river-runner/. Ultimately, we made as much progress as we could, including a lot of manual name suggestions before launching, and decided to publish the tool in beta, with an understanding that we&#39;d take suggestions and otherwise work to improve the tool/data over time.To the points about the distance the paths are starting from a click, it does round coordinates to some extent. As much as I&#39;d like to be more exact, we&#39;re stuck with a limited number of &#34;flowlines&#34; in our dataset and it will look for the closest one, which isn&#39;t always as close as we&#39;d like. It&#39;s most useful for understanding watersheds in broad strokes, but often falls a little short when it comes to the novelty of literally tracing from your address.For both specificity and some of the canal issues, the US-only version of this tool is better than this one (https://river-runner.samlearner.com/) with the obvious limitation that the paths are only within the US.If you have any issues/feedback/suggestions regarding the UI and have a minute, would really appreciate if you&#39;re able to submit them as issues in the project repo on Github: https://github.com/sdl60660/river-runner If you&#39;re experiencing routing/naming issues, you can submit issues in this repo: https://github.com/ksonda/global-river-runnerAgain, thanks for giving the project a look! You can check out some of my other work here: https://www.samlearner.com/ or on my Github (https://github.com/sdl60660).I&#39;d also like to shout out other other people who worked to make this happen: Dave Blodgett (https://github.com/dblodgett-usgs), Kyle Onda (https://github.com/ksonda), and Ben Webb (https://github.com/webb-ben)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t recall what book I was reading that suggested than a civilization based on ecological awareness should be built around watersheds.Maybe half the borders in the world are ridge lines (a natural watershed boundary), while the rest are bodies of water. That means that the consequences of what goes into that water are split between me and perhaps 20 other states/nations. That sort of cross-border negotiation has a lot more friction involved with it.The watershed society would have jurisdictions nested around streams, tributaries, and rivers. I think if you sited your seats of power where your watershed meets the next higher jurisdiction, we probably would have a lot fewer industries running effluent pipes directly into our rivers, because the stuff the mayor is letting into their stream is running past the governor&#39;s house on its way to the president&#39;s."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is there a way to turn off the auto play of the fly through after you click, without having to click pause each time? I&#39;m more interest in just clicking around and seeing how the route changes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;I do tasks on three timescales: they either get done immediately, after a shamefully massive delay, or not at all. There’s little in-between.To anyone relating: that&#39;s an ADHD symptom.It falls under the umbrella of Executive Dysfunction[1].I have been beating myself up for it all my life, and turns out there are many things that work differently for people with ADHD - and many things that help (from medication[2] to social techniques, like body doubling[3]).Here&#39;s how ADHD looks for me: https://romankogan.net/adhd/ -- if you find yourself scrolling and nodding, maybe get it checked it out, OK?[1] https://romankogan.net/adhd/#Executive%20Dysfunction[2] https://romankogan.net/adhd/#Medication[3] https://romankogan.net/adhd/#Body%20Double"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I spent about a third of 2021 more or less consumed by this phenomenon. In my case it was triggered by job searching: I quit my existing position, intending to do a leisurely search over a few months... and then avoided nearly everything related to the job search for over four months. (While still experiencing a ton of stress as a result of constant anxiety and guilt about it.) Once I actually started, I landed an amazing new position within two months.The thing that made the difference for me was directly and consistently involving my girlfriend. All she did most of the time was sit in the same room as me, working on her own stuff, but some combination of being unable to completely avoid working while she was there, having her there to vent anxiety to, and being able to make commitments to her rather than myself made an enormous amount of difference.I&#39;m not thrilled with myself for the procrastination I did in the first place, but I&#39;m taking it as a hard-won lesson: doing difficult things can be vastly easier if you have someone you trust as support and confidant."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had this issue with my first software job right out of college. I was unproductive for weeks, just due to culture shock and (shamefully) malaise. The procrastination snowballed. Luckily a fellow engineer eventually noticed, sat down with me, and recognized exactly what was going on. In the kindest way possible, he sat down behind me and basically made me finally start my next project. He stayed there with me for the rest of the day, answering and asking questions to keep my progress going. It had quite an impact on me. Having another person involved and actively care about my work went a long way."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;The film also notes that the United States has laws against propagandizing the U.S. public, which might make such a disclosure a confession of a crime. I would add that since 1976, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights has required that “Any propaganda for war shall be prohibited by law.”That changed in 2013:&gt;The U.S. government&#39;s mammoth broadcasting arm has begun the &#34;unleashing of thousands of hours per week of government-funded radio and TV programs for domestic U.S. consumption,&#34; John Hudson of Foreign Policy reported on Sunday.&gt;The content arrives with the enactment of the Smith-Mundt Modernization Act of 2012, sponsored by Rep. Mac Thornberry (R- Texas) and Rep. Adam Smith (D- Wash.), which was inserted into the 2013 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).&gt;The reform effectively nullifies the Smith-Mundt Act of 1948, which was amended in 1985 specifically to prohibit U.S. organizations from using information &#34;to influence public opinion in the United States.&#34;&gt;The new law enables U.S. government programming such as Voice of America (VoA) — an outlet created in 1942 to promote a positive understanding of the U.S. abroad — t0 broadcast directly to domestic audiences for the first time.https://www.businessinsider.com/us-domestic-propaganda-offic..."</p>

It&#39;s kind of ruined movies that involves the military or military equipment for me, since it can be really obvious when creators toe the line for the military.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Excerpt of email reply from Nathan Myhrvold is mostly correct:&gt;The new Java applications are NOT credible threats to traditional PC software any time soon. [...] Cool new technology always expands rapidly into NEW ares (where there is a vacuum).Java&#39;s hype of Write-Once-Run-Anywhere to kill Microsoft Windows didn&#39;t happen on client desktop apps like many expected.  Desktop apps are still C++ and some newer apps are Javascript(Electron).  Yes, there are a few niche desktop apps using Java like JetBrains IDEs but history has shown that Java made more market penetration on server-side code.  The 1990s dot coms like Ebay and Amazon were early users of Java on their servers.  I read that Google uses Java on the web servers to generate the results page.  (To be clear, I think Google uses C++ for the crawlers to build the index and the algorithms for search engine ranking.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think Gates was losing sleep because he had come to expect to win everywhere all the time. Myrhvold’s reply (in a lower tweet) is a gentle way of saying that Microsoft doesn’t have to, to succeed as a company.I think as a company finds continuous, outsized success, there is a risk for a leader’s mindset to get warped and resistant to anything but outsized success. Anything less than domination looks like a problem, an anomaly that must be found and destroyed.I think it might explain some otherwise indefensible behavior, like HP spying on their board, or all the shady stuff that Uber was doing, or even MS’s own anti-competitive behavior.I think leaders have to get shocked out of this mindset or just removed. Gates was shocked by MS’s conviction and stepped down. Ballmer and Kalanick were pressured to resign by investors. Both MS and Uber have benefited from new leadership that lowered the temperature and refocused the company.I also think it explains why Facebook is the way it is now.  There doesn’t seem to be such pressure points available for Zuckerberg though."</p>

https://www.baeldung.com/java-16-new-features,
https://www.baeldung.com/java-17-new-featuresIt is pretty impressive how Java keeps up to date over decades! I think in the long run it is very wise to be conservative over new language features. For example the work von &#34;green threads&#34; (project Loom) is a really good, fundamental approach with backwards compatiblity and there are some voices on the web thinking that such an approach is more clever then introducing &#34;async&#34; to the language (C#, Python, etc). I really appreciate how careful the engineering is and how they don&#39;t shy away from putting years into some topics."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Part of the reason it had taken so long is because I put a substantial amount of work into a part of the project that&#39;s no longer necessary due to changing requirements, which I don&#39;t think I could have forseen.One of the things that I&#39;ve experienced with new grad junior devs is that there&#39;s an adjustment needed to change from academic working to business working. In academia, usually the professor gives an assignment and you have to go off and figure it out, without bothering the professor, no matter what. In business, it&#39;s much better to &#39;bother the professor&#39; regularly and check in affirmatively on whether the assignment has changed, or to tell the manager about challenges that arise to re-plan together. As a junior employee, you&#39;re not going to know the full business context of what makes sense, and checking in can save weeks of time that would otherwise be spent off on your own.Not sure if that&#39;s the case here, but certainly something you could consider going forwards to prevent similar situations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This boss telling you that they felt the project should have been done a long time ago: I wonder who that comment benefits? Feels like no one. You get bummed, they give late feedback without a lot of constructive aspects to it.I am trying to think of one way it was useful to tell you that, but I can’t.Seems like you should feel justified in not being a fan of working under this person. What you do with that is hard to say. Sounds like you got to work on a cool project and got to mostly solo it. That’s pretty great for a junior."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The first meeting where your manager just abandoned you and you ended up talking to your manager&#39;s boss is totally inappropriate. Being so new to the job basically all the responsibility is with your direct manager and her boss is wrong to dump on you without your manager present.I&#39;d give it another chance though, sounds like the work is fun and maybe you can communicate your concerns to your direct manager."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"If all of this was planned (and I’m not saying it is), that would have been very clever. It would work like this:1. You “accidentally forget” to disable the feature in hardware. Given how competitive the market is, motherboard manufacturers can be relied upon to enable it in their “1337 OVERCLOCKZ” mode. No conspiracy is needed.2. You “tolerate” this practice just long enough to win the critical initial wave of reviews and benchmarks. Interested buyers will look at those charts for years to come.3. And when you finally do turn the feature off to protect the market for your server chips, you can plausibly claim that you had explicitly forbidden using this configuration from the very beginning. None of this is your fault..Edit/Addendum: Just to clarify my actual opinion, of course an honest mistake is more likely, at least for step 1. Very few “evil schemes” exist in reality because people aren’t all that clever (and all that evil). But the possibility is interesting to speculate on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Much ado about nothing, IMHO.AVX-512 isn&#39;t advertised by Intel as a 12th gen desktop CPU feature and doesn&#39;t provide any advantages for most desktop users anyway.Sure, there&#39;s niche applications like some particular PS3 emulator, but I don&#39;t share the author&#39;s opinion w.r.t. to performance and efficiency in desktop use."</p>
