								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lots of folks here arguing that the focus on TikTok is unfair, given the data collection practices of domestic corps like Facebook.  From a privacy point of view, this argument is well-founded, but I think it&#39;s tangential to the argument TFA is making, which is: this data collection done by a foreign government and exploited for surveillance or espionage is a national security risk.I get it.  We want corps to stop hoovering up our data because they can use it to manipulate us with advertising, and they can mishandle it such that other bad actors can exploit it.  I&#39;m with you, this is a valid concern that we should address.  But I think TikTok&#39;s specific case warrants additional concern because it&#39;s all that, plus it puts a geopolitical adversary in control of the data, countless devices, and a media channel central to the current cultural zeitgeist.I don&#39;t think it&#39;s reasonable to wait for general regulation of social media corps while TikTok continues to do its thing, particularly if targeted action against TikTok is politically viable.Edit: typo"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This seems an intractable mess.- Our phone hardware and operating systems are intrinsically insecure.- There is no practical/effective data gathering regulation (and I&#39;m not sure
   it&#39;s possible to craft any without destroying innovation)- All social media companies are doing it, leading to jeers of &#34;hypocrisy!&#34;- All governments play the same games, reducing the arguments to
   &#34;Whose side are you on?&#34; That&#39;s effectively meaningless in a
   globalised world. The consequence is more nationalism and an ever
   more fragmented splinternet.- The only proposed solutions amount to more authoritarian,
   controlling and regulatory responses.What can we do?There is a solution. Stop protecting these companies. Burn down
WIPO. Tear up practically all &#34;intellectual property&#34; laws. Revoke
millions of patents. Repeal all DCMA type laws regarding reverse
engineering. Kick trademark and brand protection law to the curb.The real problem is gargantuan monolithic, captive audiences that
exist because incumbent monopolies enjoy protectionist measures that
amount to a giant international trade racket.Creating a real market that forces radical interoperability would
solve many of the problems we see today. Who would care about TiKToK
or Facebook if they were one of 500,000 small &#34;Social Apps&#34; that
connected to a standardised international network.Hell, we could even give it a catchy name, like &#34;The Internet&#34;."</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32156009">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been a software dev since the 90s and at this point, I&#39;ve learned to basically do things like audit trails and soft deletion by default, unless there&#39;s some reason not to.Somebody always wants to undelete something, or examine it to see why it was deleted, or see who changed something, or blah blah blah. It helps the business, it helps you as developer by giving you debug information as well as helping you to cover your ass when you are blamed for some data loss bug that was really user error.Soft deletion has obvious drawbacks but is usually far less work than implementing equivalent functionality out-of-stream, with verbose logging or some such.Retrofitting your app and adding soft deletion and audit trails after the fact is usually an order of magnitude more work. Can always add it pre-launch and leave it turned off.If performance is a concern, this is usually something that can be mitigated. You can e.g. have a reaper job that runs daily and hard-deletes everything that was soft-deleted more than n days ago, or whatever."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Views are a simple solution to this problem.  Pretty much all moderns RDBMSs support updatable views, so creating views over your tables with a simple WHERE deleted_at IS NULL solves the majority of the author&#39;s problems, including (IIRC) foreign key issues, assuming the deletes are done appropriately.I feel like a lot of developers underutilize the capabilities of the massively advanced database engines they code against. Sure, concerns about splitting logic between the DB and app layers are valid, but there are fairly well developed techniques for keeping DB and app states, logic and schemas aligned via migrations and partitioning and whatnot."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is nobody using log tables? Pretty much every time I touch something in my db, there&#39;s a log call that records who did it, when, IP, URL and a (JSON) snapshot of the changed record, which in a pinch can be used for undelete.It&#39;s surprisingly manageable. I mean, yes, it&#39;s definitely the largest table in the db, but:1. it&#39;s well worth it2. most of the stuff in it isn&#39;t the main scenario above (a human does something and I record the change) but various automated processes I also want to track, like API calls. which leads to:3. it&#39;s easy to prune - both in time period kept, and by selectively deleting the automated stuff earlierBut it mostly helps by localizing things. It&#39;s just one meta-data log table, and everything related to logging actions is there. Not very elegant to keep adding fluff fields to every table, like &#34;add_date&#34; or &#34;deleted_at&#34;. When I decided I want to also track the URL of the request I had to change things in just one place, and now I have it for every action everywhere.Note: don&#39;t fall into the &#34;everything is a nail&#34; mistake. Some other dedicated log tables may be necessary, for high-volume or distinct stuff. I also have a mail_log, a sms_log and a separate table for events coming from mobile users (like location history)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I will just add to the chorus here:* I graduated as a Computer Engineer.* Worked as EE/EEE entire career (currently almost 14 years).* Half of my class of EEs and CEs went into other careers immediately after graduation because money was better.* 10 years later my best conservative estimate (based on sampling from friends from my year) is that at least another quarter has left because money.* I have mainly worked in companies that make embedded devices, which is a market that is supposed to be exploding. So I should be getting paid better right? Have always been paid worse than my SE peers even though there&#39;s x5 - x10 as many of them.* Know lots of SEs who moved from EE because money was better (chief complaint from them is that SE is easier but they don&#39;t care because job less stressful and again more money).* Have never met an SE moving into EE.* I am now at a junction point in my career where I will either: Leave EE completely and work in something else (probably SE or IT), start my own EE business, consult in compliance of EE products (had one gig for a while and it paid well). Why? because money.And I don&#39;t want fast cars or huge houses or any of that absurdity (although A house would be nice). Just living comfortably would be nice. Having the salaries of my SE and CS friends would be amazing.To those commenters who say that you need to be bright to be an EE, it is very flattering, but I am obviously not very bright :D(edit: formatting because, again, not very bright :) )"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I moved into IT from &#34;formal&#34; engineering and its always frustrated me that a job that involves working on extremely expensive engines using upper level college math gets paid almost nothing compared to people who change colors on a webpage every once in a while. I&#39;ve been on floors where multi-million dollar pieces of equipment are used to produce parts with obscene levels of precision being used by expert machinists making 80k a year who risk their own personal safety making these parts.I have EE friends with master degrees who design PCBs that are printed millions of times that struggle to afford rent.It makes no sense. Why is web software so easy to make money in? Why do we value hard engineering so little?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My friend is an EE that I went to school with. He&#39;s very bright and definitely sharper and harder working than me.
I went to school for Chemistry and switched to DevOps - which are the not the highest paid of SEs.
I make 1.5x what he does. I help run a package tracking dashboard. He ensures power systems for millions of people work flawlessly in all conditions. He&#39;s looking to quit the industry because its so hopeless."</p>

					<h3><a href="https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang">Carbon Language: An experimental successor to C++</a></h3>

				<div class="story__comments">
					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32151609">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you are like me and wondering &#34;What makes carbon different from Rust or Zig?    1. The ability to interoperate with a wide variety of code, such as classes/structs and templates, not just free functions.

    2. A willingness to expose the idioms of C++ into Carbon code, and the other way around, when necessary to maximize performance of the interoperability layer.

    3. The use of wrappers and generic programming, including templates, to minimize or eliminate runtime overhead.

In otherwords, what carbon can do that Rust can&#39;t do, is take a C++ class with a `foo` method and call that method.  Or create a class with a `foo` method and call that method from C++.  Probably one of the biggest hurdles to get over in C++ interopt.  Most don&#39;t do that, instead you&#39;d make a C function binding and struct and move data/invoke functions through that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s not immediately obvious from this page and GitHub org, but this is a Google led project. It&#39;s led by Chandler and the c++ toolchain team. I have no idea of it&#39;s endgoals or how open to non-Google ideas it will be."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the end of the safety document:&gt; Overall, Carbon is making a compromise around safety in order to give a path for C++ to evolve. C++ developers must be comfortable migrating their codebases, and able to do so in a largely automated manner. In order to achieve automated migration, Carbon cannot require fundamental redesigns of migrated C++ code. While a migration tool could in theory mark all migrated code as unsafe, Carbon should use a safety strategy that degrades gracefully and offers improvements for C++ code, whether migrated or not.&gt; That does not mean Carbon will never adopt guaranteed safety by default, only that performance and migration of C++ code takes priority, and any design will need to be considered in the context of other goals. It should still be possible to adopt guaranteed safety later, although it will require identifying a migration path.That&#39;s very interesting and pragmatic. It would be interesting if they can eventually come up with the same level of safety guarantees via a different path than Rust&#39;s borrow checker.-------------Since one of their goals is to automatically translate modern C++ to Carbon, I do wonder how well that is going to work in general.I definitely welcome an alternative to C++ that would be easier to read and understand. That would be a benefit to the world."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Which machine language is the microcode written in?Is it even possible to fully decode that language with publicly available information/tools?Given that microcode is an internal mechanism of CPUs, I would expect its language to be impossible to decode for regular people because there is zero knowledge on how it works?And even if there is some knowledge on it, won&#39;t Intel change the machine language around a lot among CPU generations because the lack of public usage means it can be changed constantly, thus rendering the existing knowledge useless quickly?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Kudos for MinIO team for spending THREE YEARS trying to resolve this. Shame that they had to resort to a public naming and shaming but sometimes corporate entities are tone deaf.Now this is exposed the next question is if Nutanix Objects is just a MinIO wrapper then what value are they even proving here?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Strange. You spent THREE YEARS in discussion with Nutanix and still say&gt; we believe they may also be in violation of the GNU AGPL v3 versions of MinIO.`may also be`? you are not even 100% sure whether they are using your AGPL v3 version? I have no clue, what the heck you were discussing for 3 years.Moving from Apache-2.0 to AGPLv3 is a clear trap for those who use Minio as part of their commercial offering. With AGPLV3 one need to &#34;disclose your source code&#34; where as its not required with Apache-2.If you started your &#34;Open source&#34; project with AGPL it is a different thing but to start the project under Apache-2 and few years later introducing AGPLv3 is kind of lame and unethical, IMHO.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The client knows nothing about the API end points associated with this data, except via URLs and hypermedia controls (links and forms) discoverable within the HTML itself. If the state of the resource changes such that the allowable actions available on that resource change (for example, if the account goes into overdraft) then the HTML response would change to show the new set of actions available.If the client knows nothing about the meaning of the responses, it cannot do  anything with them but show  them to a human for interpretation. This would suggest a restful api is not made for system-to-system communication, but requires human mediation at every step of the way, which is precisely not how api’s are used. In short, this definition of restful api’s can’t be right, because it suggests restful interfaces aren’t api’s at all. Once a programmer adds code to parse the responses and extract meaningful data, treating the restful interface as an api, the tight coupling between client and server reappears."</p>

Hypermedia is just an expansion on what text means to include temporal anchors within a media stream; most researchers have dropped the distinction.&gt; Hypertext does not need to be HTML on a browser. Machines can follow links when they understand the data format and relationship types.So, to me, a proper format is something like...id: 1234url: http://.../1234name: foodepartment: http://.../department/5555projects: http://.../projects/?user_id=1234This is hypertext in the sense that I can jump around (even in a browser that renders the urls clickable) to other resources related to this resource."</p>
