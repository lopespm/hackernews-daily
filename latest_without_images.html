								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have a few qualms with this API:1. For a Linux user, you can already build such a system yourself quite trivially by getting an FTP account, mounting it locally with curlftpfs, using SVN or CVS on the mounted filesystem, and copying all the Owen Wilson &#34;Wow&#34; audio (.ogg) files.2. It doesn&#39;t actually replace a USB drive full of Owen Wilson &#34;Wow&#34; clips. Most people I know e-mail &#34;Wow&#34;s to themselves or host them somewhere online to be able to listen to them, but they still carry a USB drive in case there are connectivity problems. This does not solve the connectivity issue.3. It does not seem very &#34;viral&#34; or income-generating. I know this is premature at this point, but without charging users for the service, is it reasonable to expect to make money off of this?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In the 1800s, scholars who knew a lot of languages (including, often, several modern and ancient European languages, and increasingly also Sanskrit) started to notice some amazing patterns about similarities in words among all of these languages, including languages from very far apart and that had no visible connection at all from the point of view of their present-day speakers.As these patterns were explored, they were found to be even more systematic and pervasive than they had appeared. In some cases, one sound would systematically change into another sound from language A to language B.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimm%27s_lawThese patterns helped reveal historical connections between most languages of Europe, Central Asia, and South Asia, showing that those languages had descended from the same ancient sources. (Note that this isn&#39;t true of 100% of languages in this region -- there are other unrelated families that turned up -- but it&#39;s true of a significant majority.)https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_languagesThe languages that turned out to be related this way included the Germanic family (like German, English, Dutch, and the Scandinavian languages), the Romance family (like French, Spanish, Portuguese, Romanian, and Catalan), the Celtic family (like Irish and Welsh), the Slavic family (like Russian, Bulgarian, and Ukrainian), and also Farsi and all the Central Asian languages related to it, and Hindi/Urdu and all the South Asian languages related to it. Oh, and Greek.If I tried to list all the languages and language families that were linked up to this family tree, we would probably be here all day, because they go on and on. Just under half the people in the whole world have one or another of them as a native language today!These languages changed quickly enough in history that most people no longer noticed, or remembered, that most of them were related to one another, yet slowly enough that it&#39;s been feasible to deduce an enormous amount of information about the history of particular languages and particular words, once many of the rules and patterns had been identified.A Grimm&#39;s Law example is that the h sound in Germanic languages usually corresponds to the k sound in Romance languages (note that this can be stated much more technically and accurately). So, it turns out that &#34;hundred&#34; and &#34;cent&#34;/&#34;cento&#34;/&#34;centum&#34; actually share the same origin. And &#34;heart&#34; and &#34;cœur&#34;/&#34;corazón&#34;/&#34;καρδία&#34; (origin of &#34;cardiac&#34;) (also &#34;cordial&#34;; the root in Latin sounds like &#34;cord-&#34;). And &#34;who&#34; and &#34;que&#34;/&#34;quoi&#34;/&#34;qui&#34; (and similarly for other wh- questions in English and qu- questions in Romance, which were originally hw- sounds in English and kw- sounds in Latin).Some other examples are t to d (&#34;ten&#34; and &#34;decem&#34;/&#34;diez&#34;/&#34;dez&#34;, plus some of the examples above that have a t in English), and f to p (&#34;foot&#34; and the Latin and Greek words from which we get &#34;pedestrian&#34; and &#34;podiatrist&#34;, and Romance &#34;pied&#34;/&#34;pie&#34;/&#34;pé&#34;; and don&#39;t forget about &#34;father&#34; and &#34;padre&#34;/&#34;pater&#34;/...).Those are just a couple of the phenomena that people noticed in the 1800s; while the exact development of these patterns gets much more complicated, they&#39;ve proven to work over and over and over, for hundreds of languages and hundreds of thousands of words!(... Also, the Grimm from Grimm&#39;s Law is one of the Brothers Grimm, from Grimm&#39;s Fairytales!)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve described this on HN before; forgive me if you&#39;ve already seen it.I have chronic migraine. It sounds worse than it is; I rarely suffer attacks anymore, and when I do, they&#39;re usually mostly harmless, as in the case I&#39;ll describe below.Contrary to popular belief, migraine is not a headache. It&#39;s something a little more like an epileptic seizure. Intense headaches are one common symptom, but there are a lot of others.One common symptom of migraine is called *scintillating scotoma*. A scotoma is a blind or blank spot in the visual field. A scintillating scotoma caused by migraine is an area of the visual field that is temporarily replaced by a vivid visual aura. Its appearance is commonly the first symptom of a migraine attack, and is often followed by more unpleasant symptoms.I&#39;ve seen scintillating scotoma many times over the years. A few years ago I was reading and enjoying a good book, and my scotoma appeared. It was a humdinger: roughly triangular prisms of white light with utterly black zebra stripes moving along them kaleidoscope-style. It took up the lower left middle of my visual field, pulsing and radiating and turning, covering the book in my hand.I was disappointed. I didn&#39;t want to stop reading. I was enjoying the book. So I decided to keep reading until the scotoma made it impossible to continue.It never did.It became so vivid that I couldn&#39;t see my hand at all, but I still had no trouble reading the book. I even started reading it aloud without any difficulty.After a few minutes the scotoma faded. In that instance, it was not followed by any other symptoms (that&#39;s happened more and more frequently over the years since probably my forties).I could now see the book again, and could confirm that what I had been reading was indeed what was on the page.I thought about how to explain my experience. The best hypothesis I&#39;ve come up with so far is that the neurological process of seeing and the neurological process of being consciously aware of what I&#39;m seeing are not the same thing. They&#39;re independent processes. The scotoma prevented me from subjectively experiencing seeing the book, but did not prevent me from actually seeing it, nor from correctly interpreting what I was seeing.This experience (and one two other odd experiences) has led me to adopt the working hypothesis that many of our cognitive experiences are more complicated than we tend to assume, and that they&#39;re often made up of several more or less independent processes. We usually benefit if related processes pretty much work together, so they pretty much do. Because they do, we experience them all together as a single experience, but that&#39;s an illusion that unravels if circumstances screw up their synchronization.I hope someone finds that as interesting as I do."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In drug development, a lot of the engineering goes into making sure the pharmaceutical compound -- having been developed -- actually reaches the target area of the body. If the compound is a relatively large particle that needs to get into the blood stream, a nasal spray might result in the compound being deposited at the bottom of a person&#39;s lungs without ever getting absorbed. If stomach acids break the chemical down then digestion might not be a feasible approach. Intravenous might work but shots are scary, or worse the medication may need to be administered in low doses over a long period of time, requiring an IV catheter.For a pill that can be digested, often it will be the case that the pharmaceutical compound needs a lot of buffer space, sugar or something else to prevent it from being absorbed too quickly. So if a pill says &#34;Do not break in half&#34; or &#34;Do not chew&#34;, this is because doing these things increased the pill&#39;s surface area and the rate that the drug gets absorbed, when optimal rate of absorption has already been calculated."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In a similar vein, I have found success using request interception [1] for some websites where the HTML and API authentication scheme is unstable, but the API responses themselves are stable.If you can drive the browser using simple operations like keyboard commands, you can get the underlying data reliably by listening for matching &#39;response&#39; events and handling the data as it comes in.[1] https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/main/docs/api.md..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very interesting. Can&#39;t wait to give it a shot.I personally use a combination of xpath, basic math and regex, so this class/id security solution isn&#39;t a major deterrent. Couple of times, I did find it to be an hassle to scrape data embedded in iframes, and I can see the heap snapshots treat iframes differently.Also, if a website takes the extra steps to block web scrapers, identification of elements is never the main problem. It is always IP bans and other security measures.After all that, I do look forward using something like this and making a switch to nodejs based solution soon. But if you are trying web scraping at scale, reverse engineering should always be your first choice. Not only it enables you a faster solution, it is more ethical (IMO) as you are minimizing your impact to it&#39;s resources. Rendering full website resources is always my last choice."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Awesome, I wonder if there is a possibility to create a chrome extension that works like &#39;Vue devttools&#39; and show the heap and changes in real-time and maybe allow editing.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"About 14 years ago, I also tried to tackle the public conversation troll problem and created a forum that got quite a bit of traction. While Radiopaper takes the carrot approach (&#34;write things people want to engage with&#34;), I took the stick approach: &#34;anyone can ban anyone else for a non-trivial amount of time, but you must reply to their post, and people will see that you banned them.&#34;It was a probabilistic method to filtering out the trolls, and it worked well. Trolls wanted to ban, but they themselves became the more-frequent targets of bans. Eventually, they would get frustrated with the bans and leave. The people that remained, stayed civil to not become a clear target of a ban. There would be brief chaotic behavior, but it never lasted. Cooler heads always prevailed.Radiopaper mentions that there is a lot of room for exploration in this space, to try different models for creating emergent social behavior and productive conversations. I hope we see more of it!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A common discussion &#34;technique&#34; on reddit is to block the person you&#39;re arguing with right after your last message, when you feel you&#39;re done with the conversation. That way they will never be able to reply and you always get the last word. Unfortunately this feels like an amplification of that. However, I guess the dynamics will prevent the frustrating feeling when that&#39;s the game you&#39;re singing up for.Intriguing idea anyway. Looking forward to seeing how it pans out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The key mechanism that makes Radiopaper different from other social networks, and more resistant to trolling and abuse, is that messages are not published until the counterparty replies or accepts your comment.My mind is blown at how simple and elegant this solution is!Great work there."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Before this gets sensationalized more than it has, let’s consider that cognitive ability also plays a heavy roll in learning to play music. There may be some net synergistic effect music playing has on other cognitive function but the brain is also effected heavily when listening to music. I suspect there is not a link between musical training and cognitive  abilities but they are the result of having a brain that can function well in whatever it does."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Random story time:My dad put above average pressure on me to learn piano as a kid. I got somewhere between decent to quite good but never a prodigy or anything (could read almost any piece of moderately difficult sheet music and play on sight, never really got into writing my own music).When I was in early high school I made an argument that I wanted to quit and he said it would be up to me but that I would regret it later in life. I ignored him, gave up piano, and now 100% without a doubt wish I could go back in time and stick with it.Still, I&#39;m grateful I got the opportunity to learn music, as now it&#39;s a huge part of my life (tinker on guitar, always on the hunt for new artists to listen to, etc).I have my own kids now, and it&#39;s fun watching them get interested in the instruments we&#39;ve got around the house, but I&#39;m also trying to figure out how to navigate the right amount of influence I should try and put on them to focus on music themselves."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This has been talked about for decades, and it&#39;s always the same story: expose your child to music, or have them learn to play an instrument, because it&#39;ll make them smarter![0]  Why can&#39;t we for once say that if you expose your child to music, and give them an opportunity to learn an instrument, they&#39;ll be more able to enjoy and understand music, and have a skill that can give them joy through their entire life?  Not everything has to be about intelligence and success; some things can just be about pleasure and joy.[0] I know I&#39;m somewhat mischaracterizing this article, but that&#39;s what the mainstream press makes of it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Nicely succinct explanation of this stance. As someone who agrees, I like this bit:&#34;One of the most promising and new developments in recent years has been a renewed interest in building decentralized systems of all types. Many people are looking into building a system of decentralized identity and giving that control back to the users.&#34;IE, decentralization is great, but blockchain type concensus building is rarely needed or useful in such systems imo."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"NIST&#39;s Blockchain Technology Overview is a good explainer:* https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8202/finalSee especially Figure 6 (&#34;p. 42&#34;, 53 of the PDF), which is a flow chart to help you decide on whether blockchain may match one&#39;s use case. Extracted:* https://imgur.com/a/RlUj9EdGenerally you need the conditions of needing both (i) append-only log and (ii) distributed/decentralized before considering blockchain &#39;technology&#39;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the more under-appreciated aspects of blockchains is how they&#39;ve made public key encryption more accessible to mainstream users. For the first time in history, millions of people have setup and maintain custody of their own key pairs. These users have learned the importance of securing those keys and have a convenient way to sign or verify signatures using their crypto wallets.Not everything needs a blockchain, but consumer tools for generating and verifying cryptographic signatures would have never reached the same level of adoption as they have w/o the incentives that blockchains provide."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One feature a few of us toyed with for years that I&#39;d love to see tried seriously someday (or does it already exist?) would be intelligent tag trees or maps that stuff could be plugged into, ideally that could also be shared and mixed too. More specific tags would have parent/child/sibling relationships with more generic tags, and a single tag would then pull in all the others as far as searching. So for example if I have a photo of one of my cats, and I tag it Cat Name having set that up, &#34;calico&#34; or &#34;tabby&#34;, breed, plain old &#34;cat&#34; and anything else associated with the specific tag would all be hits. And up the stack, if I tag a picture &#34;calico&#34; it should show up under the &#34;cat&#34; tag as well automatically with no further effort. Conditionals could be incorporated too, like if there is a character who in a series has long hair, tagging &#34;short hair&#34; could automatically pull in &#34;alternative hairstyle&#34;.My big problem with typical tagging is that it&#39;s a lot of grunt work to be comprehensive. AI can help but has its own issues. While getting the UI/UX right would take some work, a universal system-wide multi-dimensional tag map could allow a lot more metadata a lot more easily. Even more so with sharing, communities could curate tag maps around areas of interest and one could stay synced with tag maps of &#34;aircraft&#34; or &#34;trees&#34; or the like which would bring in lots of technical depth to explore in a distributed fashion. Eventually maybe community AI recognition models could be an optional part of that too to help identify specific given subjects (and one would be free to then not have other kinds of things identified or shared)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I remember buying my first Moleskine notebook in college. It was my first exposure to &#34;fashionable office supplies&#34;, a foreign concept to me growing up. It was a super nice object. In fact it was so nice, I didn&#39;t want to use it to just take notes in class, because what a waste. I also didn&#39;t want to use it to  just scribble personal notes and todo lists in, because what a waste. In the end, I never wrote anything in that notebook at all: what a waste.Now I tend to view fashionable office supplies as productivity fetish items. It&#39;s easy to geek out on that stuff, but does a better notebook make me more productive? Seems to make me less productive, if history is an indicator.Yeah, I will occasionally find myself reading reviews of immaculately designed mechanical pencils, or minutely engineered Japanese scissors. But I try not to lose sight of the advantages cheap, lousy stuff has too: disposable, easy to replace, low barrier to use. These qualities are also valuable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; &#34;They aren’t a record of my thinking process. They are my thinking process.&#34;This exactly! I think with pen and notebook. I also think without pen and notebook, such as during my driving and running. Without notebooks, I often find myself think in circles and having hard time to recall what I just realized a short moment ago. With pen and notebook, it is more relaxed. Often I don&#39;t revisit my notebooks. So the notebooks are mainly serving as a thinking aids than to serve as a database. Replacing them with digital sounds nice, but in reality it is just a distraction. Having the record to go back to is a short term benefit; the few pages of notes that I do end up revisit often quickly become part of paper or presentations, or tweets and moments, or more often, prototype code. I have accumulated a drawer of used notebooks. They only have sentimental values. And they have more sentimental values in paper forms than in digital forms.PS: my current favorite notebook is this one https://www.amazon.com/Universal-Sugarcane-Notebook-College-...
A hard cover and thick ring has become a necessity for me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some years ago, I was on the margins of notebook enthusiasm, but never went all-in, because I quickly discovered that while I really enjoyed the physicality of notebooks, I came to dislike their pre-digital limitations. I still prefer the free-form capability to mix text and drawing and color and scribbles that pen or pencil on paper offers, but I then scan the finished pages into the computer.As a result, my favorite notebook is now a pad of A4 paper with a good weight, ruled, and perforated so I can easily detach pages and feed them through the scanner.Content warning for the following paragraph.I then destroy the originals."</p>

I actually enjoyed learning tidbits about the author, in particular their mention of https://how.complexsystems.fail/.Reading this boosted my confidence in Slack&#39;s teams, which should ultimately be the objective of a release like this. It&#39;s not pure PR nor a gruff legally-obligated disclosure.It helps that I wasn&#39;t really affected by this incident."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Now a more philosoraptor style comment: I see Mcrib is a service built to
quickly detect and replace memcached&#39;s. I treat memcached in infrastructure as
a very stable service. Meaning it is infrequently necessary to upgrade it, and
it will generally not fail on its own. If it does it will be highly infrequent
compared to services with higher churn or more complexity/dependencies. This
means if they&#39;re failing often enough that you need to rapidly detect and
replace them you have a more fundamental problem.From a structural standpoint I think my technical comment can be useful. If
things really are failing this much A) you should figure out why and slow that
down. B) if you have a generally stable system and understand the typical rate
of failure, you can add tripwires into Mcrib to avoid over-culling services
and loudly raise alarms. Then C) you can improve technical reliability with
redundancy/extstore/etc.I&#39;ve also seen plenty of times where folks have a dependency of a service
determine if that service is usable, which I disagree with quite strongly.
Consul being down on a node should trigger something to consider if the
service is dead. It&#39;s important both for reliability (don&#39;t kill perfectly
working things because you end up having to design around it), and for
maintainability as you&#39;ve now made people afraid of upgrading Consul or other
co-dependent services. Other similar failures are single-point-of-testing
availability checking where instead you probably want two points of truth
before shooting a service.Now you risk people being afraid of upgrading probably anything, which means
they will work around it, abstract it, or needlessly replace it with something
they feel safer managing. The latter is at best a waste of time, at worst a
time bomb until you find out what conditions this new thing breaks under.This isn&#39;t advocating that you design without assuming anything can fail
anywhere at any time; just pointing out that how often a service _should_ fail
is extremely useful information when designing systems and designing fail
safes, alerts, monitoring, etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hi! I&#39;d like to offer some hopefully useful information if any Slack folks end
up reading this, or anyone else with a similar infrastructure. I&#39;ll start with
some tech and make a separate philosophical comment.Also caveat: I have no deep view into Slack&#39;s infrastructure so anything I say
here may not even be relevant. YMMV.First some self promotion: https://github.com/memcached/memcached/wiki/Proxy
memcached itself is shipping router/proxy software. Mcrouter is difficult to
manage and unsupported. This proxy is community developed, more
flexible, likely faster, and will support more native features of memcached.
We&#39;re currently in a stabilization round ensuring it won&#39;t eat pets but all of
the basic features have been in for a while. Documentation and example
libraries are still needed but community feedback help speed those up
tremendously (or any kind of question/help request).It&#39;s not clear to me why memcached is being managed like this; mcrouter seems
to only be used to abstract the configuration from the clients. It has a lot
of features for redundant pools and so on. Especially with what sounds like
globally immutable data and the threat of cascading failures during rolling
upgrades it sounds like it would be very helpful here.If cost or pool sizes are the main reasons why the structure is flat, using
Extstore (https://github.com/memcached/memcached/wiki/Extstore) can likely
help. Even if object value sizes are in the realm of 500 bytes, using flash
storage can still greatly reduce the amount of RAM necessary or reduce the
pool size (granted the network can still keep up) with nearly identical
performance. Extstore takes a lot of tradeoffs (ie; keeping keys in RAM) to
ensure most operations don&#39;t actually write to flash or double-read.
Extstore&#39;s in use in tons of places and everyone&#39;s immediately addicted.Finally, the Meta Protocol
(https://github.com/memcached/memcached/wiki/MetaCommands) can help with
stampeding herds to help keep DB load from exploding without adding excess
network roundtrips under normal conditions. I&#39;ve seen lots of workarounds
people build but this protocol extension gives a lot of flexibility you can
use to help survive degraded states: anti-stampeding herd, serve-stale, better
counter semantics, and so on."</p>
