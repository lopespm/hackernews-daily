								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Best description of the hack I have found yet. The hack is on the solana side not the ethereum side of the bridge https://twitter.com/kelvinfichter/status/1489041221947375616*edit: another good thread https://twitter.com/samczsun/status/1489044939732406275"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;It&#39;s interesting that this commit was made ~9 hours ago and the exploit happened a few hours after that.Where do you find employees, even $500K/year ones, you would trust not to pick up $300m just sitting there in the open for the taking?Hey team we need to patch this bug allowing anyone to drain all the funds of our company, get right on it while I browse Taycan options to match my wristwatch color."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This highlights an incentive issue and a paradigm issue in the blockchain space. There is a strong incentive to get new protocols up and running and even though users are technically responsible as they can audit the code, most users, of course, are not qualified to do so, and stand to make more from exploiting any vulnerabilities they find than they are pointing for them out.The issue of paradigm is just how poorly suited EVM is as a smart contract language. It is too hard to manage the complexity of bytecode with memory managed on chain and in contract code. When small errors have huge consequences and there are no second chances, EVM is and should be pointed out to be one of the worst standards Ethereum has brought to crypto.When it comes to high stakes programming and especially in a space where new programs are written quickly and often, its almost objectively obvious that functional styles with more guard rails is the better choice. Nothing running on chain needs an infinite loop or many other fancy features one typically expects from a programming language - restrictions and readability in smart contract code are more important to computational chains than seat-belts are to automobiles, but the network effect is slowing the space down.Edit: Some people have pointed out this was an issue with Solana contracts, which run on Rust - so I was wrong to use this as an example for half of my point, but still believe the point stands. Even Rust IMO is not tied down enough for contract code, but the fact that it can happen on Rust which is loads better then EVM for bug catching I think proves the point a bit more if anything."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Most people don&#39;t love fiddling with settings. People love when software does what they need, and some of them will be willing to fiddle with settings if they have to. Settings are a cost the user pays (just like data entry, loading times, hard drive space, loss of privacy, ads, or the monetary price of the software) in order to get the value. If good defaults mean most users don&#39;t have to muck with settings, great, your software is now more valuable. But the only thing worse than having to tweak a setting to get your functionality is not being able to get your functionality at all."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I was an engineer on Microsoft Office, users would often request features that the product already had. It was great that their problem was quickly fixed (just point them to the right setting), but it shows the lack of discoverability that happens when the list of settings gets long and you have to dig for them. If you can do the right thing automatically and avoid having a setting, that is an improvement.My other observation was that everybody said Office had too many features and then asked for two more."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That is is even a question shows how broken this entire field is, and is everything I hate about modern software development.It really should not be the goal of &#34;design&#34; to try to create &#34;one experience fits all,&#34; because when you do that you create the lowest common denominator, the dumbest experience possible.If you care at all about allowing grownups to do grownup things with their software; if you care that people should be allowed to push themselves to their own technical and mental limits in order to get things done in a good way for them at all, then yes, you need to allow for things like &#34;settings.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve done this in Portugal, but on a smaller scale and pretty much with only my own labor. I purchased 6 hectares (15 acres) for mid-5-figures.I&#39;ve built an A-frame studio house for around €10k (excl tools), and installed a 5kw solar system for about another €10k. The house has air conditioning and underfloor heating (water-based, heated using wood from the land).I&#39;ve also brought a 50-year-old tractor and started a rural ISP.AMA, I guess?House: https://www.dropbox.com/s/sx8hj9s4u7n6ef9/My%20house.jpg?dl=...ISP: https://gardunha.net/en/-----Just to add some thoughts that the questions below prompted.I&#39;ve realised that I really enjoy infrastructure projects. I get to be sat in my little house and phone up huge telecommunication companies and ask for things. Our provider lit up 250km of fibre to our local single-track train station. I get to do lots of stuff where I think, &#34;errr.... am I allowed to do this?&#34;, and I love it.The large providers are skeptical at first, but once they realise you are registered with the national telecoms regulator they realise that you&#39;re actually serious and get onboard. They were bemused, but they went with it. I think they actually found it nice to work with a mom-and-pop organisation for a change."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"First comment from my partner was “I don’t know if this is the Parasite house of an Apple Store” :-).But really, so many weird decisions here that make no sense: why would you put your kid’s bed next to your bedroom in a new build? Why the bathrooms next to the bedrooms for your kid? Why cement floors and no floor heating? How did you end up at 400A/96kw of service (my car charges slower than that!). Why not building a indoor pool instead of a outdoor one? Feels a lot like your architect and contractors saw you had too much tech money and not enough common sense.That, and the fake pretending to care about the environment when you live in the middle of nowhere and have a heated outdoor pool with 96kw of service in Canada is just astounding!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Beautiful house and there was a day I would have been extremely jealous but...I live in Oregon and in 2020 chose to (was not officially in an evac zone but the smoke was awful) evacuate when the horrible Beachie Creek and Lionshead [0] fires ripped through the Santiam Canyon. Houses that my wife and I had looked at possibly purchasing were torched, as well as some of the most pristine ancient forest I&#39;ve seen [1].My outlook about living in the forest drastically changed after these events. The Beachie Creek fire reached 130,000 acres overnight at a growth rate of 2.77 acres per SECOND. [2].You couldn&#39;t pay me enough money to live in a forest at this point. It&#39;s just too damn dangerous. Also, the flat roof seems problematic. Everyone I know in the PNW who has owned a flat roof has had issues with it due to pooling water. That far north, I imagine snow accumulation would also be a really big problem in terms of stress on the roof.[0] - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiam_Fire[1] - https://www.opb.org/article/2021/09/02/oregon-field-guide-op...[2] - https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/7001/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Home Assistant[1] is the best approach I&#39;ve found for this. It&#39;s pretty amazing but has a pretty steep learning curve (although they&#39;re getting better and better at this). The real power of HA is the rich integration ecosystem[2], the Community Store[3], and that it runs locally (more reliable and much faster for things like motion sensors, etc).It expresses everything from every integration as an entity in various device classes so as long as some random tech is supported by an integration you can group them seamlessly. For example - I have Z-wave based motion detectors but I can control Hue lights and Wemo switches for motion detection - but only if I&#39;m home as reported by the zone feature in their iOS companion application.Their supervisor/docker based install for Raspberry Pi is pretty slick[4]. Write an image to disk as you usually would and you get a bare-bones OS with Home Assistant running in docker. Then there are additional docker-based add-ons you can install for stuff like MQTT, Z-Wave, Let&#39;s Encrypt, SSH access, nginx, and more. All managed in the web ui. Pretty cool.[1] https://www.home-assistant.io/[2] https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/[3] https://hacs.xyz/[4] https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/raspberrypi"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Better yet, run your home on Dell/HP micro computers that get decommissioned by enterprises/hospitals/big-orgs every 3 years. Find them on Offerup or FB or Craigslist market place for $100-$200.These are built solid with metal enclosures, fan cooled, UL certified PSU, ~7k CPUbenchmark.net. Usually i5 6thGen Intel CPU, 8GB-16GB RAM and have REAL storage(SSD) and M.2 NVMe. If you are lucky you might find vPro version with remote management.Currently running a HP G2 bought on Offerup for $70 with i5-6600T, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD running Ubuntu server with HomeAssistant VM and few containers. It idles at 7w, with &lt;2% CPU for my work load.I tried Raspberry Pi with HomeAssistant with it&#39;s piss poor antique storage solution, it idled at 5W, it went straight back to store."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unless it magically cleans and tidies everything I really don&#39;t see the appeal of home automation. Pressing a switch is far more convenient to me when walking into a room than fishing out a smartphone - whether it be through a raspberry pi or otherwise. Same with central heating, I rarely need to adjust it and I don&#39;t see the appeal of messing around with some integrated interface, i&#39;d rather an old fashioned radiator dial or an independent reliable digital central heating timer I might have to tweak for 2 mins once a year.None of these things are analogous to the TV remote control, there&#39;s a reason why we haven&#39;t seen similar precursors such as radiator switches on extension cords, we don&#39;t need to constantly adjust these things at high frequency... and when we do, we are literally walking past it (light switch).&lt;/rant&gt;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Quick story: I was the CFO for a company that sold to a private equity group (PEG). I took over as the CEO as the founders retired, leaving me to deal with the PEG. It quickly became apparent that the PEG managers looked at everything through the lens of an Excel spreadsheet.  These guys were brilliant attorneys and analysts but lacked experience building businesses and managing teams.    Ultimately, they couldn’t add much value in terms of operations or strategy, but they were great at financial modeling/quantitative analysis and forcing us to justify expenses.  That may sound good at first—eliminating wasteful spending—but it ultimately led to the gradual erosion of the company culture and employee loyalty.  It’s easy to cut benefits and pay given that many workers lack the leverage to do anything about it, while it’s much harder to reduce hard costs like materials and equipment.  That meant employees just kept getting squeezed, and it was surprisingly difficult to quantify the impact that terminating an employee or cutting benefits would have on morale/culture/performance.The moral of the story is that people with analyst mindsets play an essential role in our economy, but sometimes giving those people power over large organizations can have disastrous consequences.  There truly is a disconnect between measurement and understanding."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Surprised not to see Goodhart&#39;s Law[0] referenced here - &#34;When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure&#34;. Not the same concept, but a related one (as is the Cobra Effect[1], of which the poppy-field burning is an example)[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart&#39;s_law

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I believe the McNamara Fallacy is a real thing, although I would say Goodhart&#39;s Law expresses the more fundamental issue.  But, the examples they give (Vietnam and Afghanistan wars) are bad examples, because in both cases the issue was primarily not that the U.S. military was relying too much on quantitative metrics, but rather that it was being asked to do a job which militaries are not good at.In neither case, despite what many deniers and apologists proclaim, was the war &#34;winnable&#34; by the military, because in both cases the primary problem was that the government of the nation in question did not have the respect (and thus support) of its people.  There is no strategy that an outside military can use, which will fix this, because it&#39;s not a military problem, and a military has the wrong personnel, the wrong training, and thus the wrong institutional mindset.It is as if you sent the Red Cross in to defeat the Viet Cong or the Taliban, and then concluded that the reason they failed was that they were measuring numbers of hospital beds and counting how much medical equipment they needed.  It was the political leadership, who decided this was a job for a military to perform, that was the root problem.  McNamara&#39;s metrics were neither here nor there."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is exciting! I&#39;ve met with people from AdaCore and Ferrous systems (individually) several times and they&#39;re all serious, competent and motivated.I&#39;m curious what kinds of software they want to (eventually) verify, my PhD thesis is developing a verification tool for Rust (https://github.com/xldenis/creusot) and I&#39;m always on the look out for case studies to push me forward.The road to formally verified Rust is still long but in my unbiased opinion looking quite bright, especially compared to other languages like C. 
Ownership typing really, really simplifies verification."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ferrous&#39;s embedded Rust tooling is outstanding. Ie its [Knurling App template](https://github.com/knurling-rs/app-template), and associated Probe-run, Deft, and flip-link.These make flashing and debugging Rust embedded very easy - easier than any embedded toolchain I&#39;ve seen besides Arduino."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a very interesting move from AdaCore. I&#39;ve been a vocal advocate of Ada as a general purpose programming language for a little while. I hope that this helps expose the language to a wider audience, and gives the wider programming community cause to reappraise Ada from a modern perspective.
