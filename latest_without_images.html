We&#39;re here to sell ads.&#34;It&#39;s not about dark patterns, that&#39;s just a second-order effect. It was never about dark patterns.This is the implied agreement. You understand it, or you don&#39;t. And if you don&#39;t, I guess you haven&#39;t been on the web in the past decade or something.What? You thought it was fair that a company spends millions in technical infrastructure and staffing so you can sit at home and spend your time looking at cats for free? No, they have your attention and they&#39;re going to connect you to organizations who will pay for it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reddit is full of these patterns in order to drive users from mobile web to app. Reddit mobile web really sets the bar for user-hostile UI in my opinion."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love instagram.  It&#39;s the best social media site.  Last time I checked, I couldn&#39;t even make an account from my desktop computer.  I&#39;m not gonna even try to install their app on my G-free phone.When a friends sends me a link to Instagram, I know that I don&#39;t need to click on it -- the thumbnail contains all the information that I&#39;d ever see without creating an account.  When news articles consist of a bunch of embedded Instagram crap, it doesn&#39;t even load on vanilla firefox.  That&#39;s cool, those stories are usually celebrity gossip that I don&#39;t actually want to read but got baited into clicking on.It&#39;s my favorite social media site, because their hooks just bounce straight off me.Thanks, Instagram, for the consistent signalling.  I never wanted to be your friend anyway."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It is sadly part of a dark pattern called &#34;stickiness&#34;. You can dress it up as functionally useful or even important but ultimately it is about companies wanting to create enough of a dependency that you have to continue using them, which is anti-competitive.Gone are the days where you bought something from a shop with no stickiness other than good service brought you back. Now there are far too many Marketing Managers who see stickiness as a win, even though the win is only to the supplier and not to the customer.It is similar to those web sites who ask you whether you want &#34;notifications&#34; from them in your OS! Nope."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Microsoft has been using this dark pattern for a while now.Around 1-2 years ago, I upgraded MS Office on my Windows laptop. It asked me for my username/password-- which I didnt think strange, as I assumed it needed it to upgrade.And thats when I got a message &#34;Good news! Your Windows machine now uses your Microsoft to login.&#34;W.T.F.I was never asked, never warned, just tricked into replacing my local login with an online one.Took me 10-20 minutes of Googling to get my original setting back.I have now turned off ALL updates for Windows-- it is my backup machine, for a few programs that only run on Windows.Every update on Windows scared me (and still does), as I dont know what dark pattern they will try this time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a candidate for an even better reason:I have no reason to believe that Microsoft will not pull a Google and start spuriously locking people out of their accounts (as happens every few months on HN), which may then prevent me from logging in to my own computer.In fact, I&#39;ve already been locked out of my Microsoft account for &#34;suspicious activity&#34; (which was literally just purchasing Minecraft) and was required to enter a phone number to unlock it. Literal theft - I was compelled to either give up additional personal information or lose access to the software I paid for."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My guess as to why it&#39;s successful is that it&#39;s always been moderately priced and Huy Fong is recognized as the originator of the &#34;Americanized Sriracha&#34; sauces.If a company tries to sell a cheaper version - then it feels like a cheap knock-off. And as everybody can afford to buy the original, why wouldn&#39;t you?If a company tried to sell a more expensive premium product in flashier packaging - then it would feel inauthentic. What are you paying more for?Plus whilst they&#39;ve not paid for advertising, they&#39;ve performed an excellent job of ensuring I&#39;m aware of their history. I&#39;ve no idea of the history of say Tabasco or Franks - but I&#39;ve many times heard the history of this plucky little immigrant founded company (and this thread is just a continuation). Maybe the key is to just have a likable story - and let others tell it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The part that strikes me is that they still have the same 10 distributors since the 80&#39;s.The &#34;local Chinese restaurant&#34; is a much more franchised thing than most people are aware of, and those 10 distributors meant it already ended up throughout the country and allowed everyone to try it for free. This is likely the secret to it&#39;s success.The only similar product I can think of is Mountain Dew Baja Blast. Though it did get some advertising, by automatically being available in every Taco Bell it became a minor craze. It&#39;s not an easily reproducible concept though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;No trademark&#34; is misleading. They have trademarks. Without them I expect exact clones would take their sales. The bottle and logo are quite distinctive and trademarked. The thing they didn&#39;t trademark is the name Sriracha."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I recommend the excellent video by Youtuber Tom Scott &#34;YouTube&#39;s Copyright System Isn&#39;t Broken. The World&#39;s Is.&#34; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jwo5qc78QUWhile I agree with the OP in broad strokes  (they clearly have the right to post and profit off their performance), I find that the vast majority of comments on Youtube&#39;s copyright claim system fail to even acknowledge major aspects of the problem.  Perhaps Youtube&#39;s practical monopoly does it a disservice here, and it&#39;s hard to separate &#34;big self publishing video platform&#34; problems with Youtube specific problems.Without a system like YT currently has, it would get absolutely sued into oblivion by rightful copyright complaints.  This is in many ways is a problem of copyright law not being designed with modern technology in mind.  I think a good first step would be a way for copyright owners to be punished for broadly overreaching with their claims."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve said that in a comment about a similar article recently, and it needs to be repeated here:  Google is actually helping big players to harass small groups into submission.  And they are using their copyright system as a weapon.  But nobody questions the sloppy execution of that self-declared law enforcement.  I guess they are deliberately trying what they can get away with, to set the ground for future harassment."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Bloomberg article with existing discussion: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27651730"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I thought it was worth clarifying exactly what has happened here, since neither the BBC nor the FT articles make it particularly clear.The entity that the FCA has acted against is Binance Markets Limited (BML) which the parent Binance Group acquired earlier this year, in part because of its existing registration with the FCA which allowed it to carry out a limited range of regulated activities in the UK.The FCA has now placed restrictions on BML which remove its ability to carry out those regulated activities -- however BML was not actually doing any business in the UK so the effect of this is limited.The FCA also issued a consumer warning which, among other other things, reiterated that no entities in Binance Group are registered with the FCA and therefore cannot carry out regulated activity in the UK. Again, the impact of this is limited since the entity that you interact with when using the Binance.com website is not based in the UK, and the FCA does not have jurisdiction over it.A possibly outcome is that Binance will be a bit more circumspect about offering derivatives trading to UK retail because they want to build a more substantial UK business in the future. We saw this with Bybit a while ago, where they do not allow UK retail to use their website (although they have an exception for sophisticated investors, who can self-certify as an eligible counterparty and continue to trade on Bybit). I wouldn&#39;t be surprised to see this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; While the FCA does not regulate crypto-currencies, it does regulate cryptoassets. Firms must be authorised [...]to advertise or sell such products in the UK.&gt; This means that people in the UK are not allowed to use Binance&#39;s services to speculate, or bet&gt; However, they are still allowed to use the website to purchase and sell crypto-currencies, which is not regulatedSo, all is well, just don&#39;t bet, speculate. Just buy and sell?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My 3 year old daughter was recently diagnosed Type 1. Soon after her diagnosis I discovered a heap of articles about the Open Insulin Foundation. I was even on their website 24 hours ago. However, for the life of me I can&#39;t find anything &#34;open&#34; about the Open Insulin Foundation.Could someone please point me in the right direction where I can read anything with more substance than a news article quoting an interview?EDIT: Just to clarify. We&#39;re extremely fortunate that we&#39;re in Australia. Insulin is affordable/subsidised here, my daughter&#39;s CGM (and sensors) are free, and anything else we need is heavily subsidised too. I&#39;ve no intention of biohacking anything to do with my daughter&#39;s Type 1.I&#39;m  asking the above mostly because I&#39;m curious. Admittedly I find it a bit scary that I know so little about the manufacturing of something that is 100% vital to my daughter&#39;s survival. I&#39;d like to know more."</p>
