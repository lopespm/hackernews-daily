That would be a lot less fun.[1] https://fly.io/docs/about/pricing/Edit: They mentioned they waive charges as a result of attacks: https://community.fly.io/t/about-rate-limiting/156/4"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"OpenResty (Nginx + LuaJIT) can help you limit the damage of unsophisticated DDoS attacks like these. I keep a count of the requests-per-second I&#39;m getting in each nginx worker. I also set a special cookie for every response from the upstream (it could literally be foo=bar). When the RPS goes approve a certain threshold, if the special cookie is not present, I serve a static HTML page (bypassing the upstream) that sets the cookie and reloads the page (Nginx can do 20K+ RPS without breaking a sweat). In my experience, these fly by DDoS attacks never use cookies, so legitimate users can get through, but the bots are blocked.Of course, if you get hit with something slightly more targeted, this defense is worthless."</p>

Of course, modules can help a ton, and there&#39;s a lot of tools available these days to procedurally generate the hard parts. Still, many of those didn&#39;t exist until recently, for the most part. This guy had to have spent countless hours on his own building out this world.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I graduated my bootcamp in 2015 and had a jr developer job with a 50% pay bump within 6 weeks. I had a college degree but in a non-technical field and 0 experience coding before I started the program. In my cohort of ~20 people all but 1 had found gainful employment as software developers within a year, most within 3-6 months.I completely agree that the value of a bootcamp is having a community to encourage you through the process, everything they teach you can be found online. I also went to a bootcamp that had a good reputation around my city so I think it was legitimizing for someone with no experience and no stories of coding for fun as a teenager.Even back then hackernews was full of people saying how flooded the market was with bootcampers.4 years later I grinded leetcode and got a job at a FANG and essentially 6x&#39;d my income from 4 years earlier before I could code. I eventually left that job because I was miserable but thats a whole other story.Now with 7 years of experience I leave the bootcamp off my resume because of the stigma. I took the specific degree program off my linkedIn and just put &#34;bachelors of science&#34; and let people assume what they want. If anyone asks I just say I&#39;m self taught.Point is, it&#39;s 100% possible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used to teach at these so called coding bootcamps and I know it can be hard for students psychologically. I still remember the day when the best student there came up to me towards the end of the 6 month bootcamp and showed me his final bootcamp project with a lot of disappointment. I asked him why was he disappointed as he had actually built something nice with react and firebase. He pointed me towards his friend&#39;s(who was at a Uni.) assignment project which was built over the weekend and was basically a minimal working version of a react like library.He asked me why wasn&#39;t he able to do that and why wasn&#39;t he taught this at the bootcamp. I knew what his friend did in a weekend was probably a culmination of 3-4 years of rigourous learning of computer science concepts that he acquired at the Uni.Among bootcamp students, There is this constant unhealthy comparison going on in their minds with the people who graduated from a Uni., this is even after years of working in the industry. what doesn&#39;t help is, Apart from a few exceptions(students and companies), the way most recruiters and HRs treat them isn&#39;t something to talk about and the pay difference is visible.Also, It isn&#39;t easy for them to catch up. You had the privilege of being able to afford to study for 4 years while it is not the same story for most people at/from the bootcamps. To add to this, They also feel left out when you discuss about your days at the Uni or are discussing some computer science concepts.If you have a colleague or someone around who is self taught or from a bootcamp, be a bit more kind and explain or refer them to reading material on concepts in a subtle way, it doesn&#39;t take much to make them feel included."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; But the main advantage of the bootcamp to me was not technical, it was the network. Apart from providing a friend group which will likely end up in referrals down the road, the best bootcamps will introduce you to companies and have relationships with them.I’d love to understand this in detail. When I was at Amazon, we didn’t take boot camp grads very seriously, and in recent years the company only looked into this to increase diversity hiring, specifically boot camps oriented towards either women or the LGBT community.I’m convinced there’s massive upside in bringing in more talent - people who learn in their own time or through boot camps. Unfortunately, senior leadership disagreed and preferred to bring in talent from India and other countries because their visa status gave us considerable leverage."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Seems like a great idea. When you look at many ML frameworks half the code and learning overhead is data schlepping code and table like structures that &#34;reinvent&#34; the schema that already exists inside a database. Not to mention, there can be security concerns from dumping large amounts of data out of the primary store (how are you going to GDPR delete that stuff later on?). So why not use it natively where the data already is?For anything substantive it seems like a bad idea to run this on your primary store since the last thing you want to do is eat up precious CPU and RAM needed by your OLTP database. But in a data warehouse or similar replicated setup, it seems like a really neat idea."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is really cool, running ML workloads on top of SQL is a very practical way of doing ML for a lot of businesses. Many companies don&#39;t have the fancy ML workloads like you see at OpenAI, they just have a SQL database with some data that could greatly help their business with some simple ML models trained on it. This looks like a nice way to do it. A slightly different approach that I&#39;ve been working on involves hooking data warehouses up to Pachyderm [0] so you can do offline training on it. Not as good for online stuff as this, but for longer running batch style jobs it works really well.[0] http://github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is great! FYI for those who haven&#39;t seen, BigQuery can also run statistical learning methods directly on your data as part of the query. Really cool to see ML going this direction."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; One interviewer who had studied my work asked &#34;How many staff report to you?&#34; &#34;None.&#34; He kept returning to this question. I got the feeling that he didn&#39;t actually believe it, and thought if he asked enough times I&#39;d confess to having a team.My experience with this in interview loops is that it&#39;s less about admiring a persons technical abilities, but more a checkbox question to determine whether a person fits into a certain role model that companies have set up. At most FAANGs, interviews will expect that you mention you are being the tech lead of a team (5-10 engineers) at a (L|E)6 role, even if one isn&#39;t a manager. At (L|E)7, it will be 50+ engineers. As a regular engineer, one would probably have an issue getting hired at a high seniority level without answering the question the right way.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Great post. This one always brings a smile to my face:&gt; Every component is crash-onlyI was part of the team that developed a distributed, five-9&#39;s control system for an industry where downtime costs millions per minute and comes with a federal investigation if long enough. On top of that, the industry is made up of competitors that explicitly distrust each other, so all components had to be truly distributed, with no central coordination for anything.Given the requirements we decided to explicitly adopt a crash-only approach. Between idempotent operations, horizontal scaling, and fast restart times, we could make failing components not impact SLAs (and we had testing to ensure it).Once it gets out into the field (which because of how risk adverse this industry is, is measured in years), it turns out they really did not like software crashing. They interpreted crashing as bad quality, and no amount of &#34;we do it on purpose to ensure correctness&#34; was going to make them happy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I enjoyed reading that a lot.&gt; The main advantage of distributed transactions is that they make distributed systems look less distributed by choosing CP, but that inherently trades off availability!This is true, but I suspect that its slightly missing the important thing about transactions. A transaction is an operation that takes the database from one Consistent (ACID &#34;C&#34;, you can think about it as &#34;legal under the business logic&#34;) state to another Consistent state. Linearizability (CAP &#34;C&#34;) isn&#39;t enough to do that, because often changes in databases require &#34;take from Bob and give to Alice&#34;, or &#34;check Bob and Alice&#39;s balance and add the order&#34;, neither of which fit well into Linearizability&#39;s single-key definition of the world. Allowing developers to think about a stream of operations that moves the databases from one legal state to another is super powerful. The whole point is that it provides an abstraction that hides concurrency (ACID &#34;I&#34;) and partial failure (ACID &#34;A&#34;). Saving developers from reasoning about those is a big win!&gt; I should also note that while Distributed Transactions might be a useful tool in building idempotency, simply wrapping a non idempotent operation (e.g. “add 1 to X”) in a transaction does not make it idempotent.The OP is right that this isn&#39;t a panacea, especially where those transactions aren&#39;t idempotent. But transactions are a mechanism to implement idempotence (&#34;insert order number 10 if it isn&#39;t there already&#34;), and idempotence and ACID &#34;C&#34; can be really hard to achieve without transactions (or at least &#34;I&#34; and &#34;A&#34;).Transactions, CRDTs, and the CALM theorem are linked too. You can definitely have transactions in systems that aren&#39;t CAP &#34;C&#34; consistent, and still have them do legal things. The CALM theorem lays out one way to think about those, and CRDTs are a kind of object-oriented embodiment of that theory."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This was a great post and covers many day to day topics that practitioners tend to hand wave over, especially as distributed systems are becoming more pervasive. Dare I say even some of the statements are becoming cliches.The section on distributed transactions could have a little more nuance. Particularly the example about the counter where I suspect any system offering transactions also has a CAS operation. Additionally the benefit of a transaction system is that you can offer bounded counters where as an AP or “strong” EC (CRDTs) system cannot."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Yes, the US is a country that cannot process its own waste so it ships it overseas just to be rid of it. The solution is not to raise money and send it to the Philippines to build landfills. The solution is to actually recycle plastic, build circular supply chains, and use biodegradable materials as much as possible.If humans are to stay on this planet, in the long term we cannot just keep piling up garbage in landfills and building on top of it. Eventually, in hundreds or thousands of years we will have to remediate that land. Its going to be a lot better if we just make our waste as recyclable as possible in the first place.The author is recommending a half measure based on the assumption that the US cannot fix its own problems. They are also implying a false equivalency: banning single use plastics is not the same as recycling plastic. A more equivalent comparison might be the tradeoffs between plastic bottles for soda, water, or oils and glass or metal containers.  It is also true that plastic straws are a much smaller problem then other usages of plastic such as bottles or event fishing gear and even bags.Yet there is nothing inherently wrong with reducing plastic usage. Doing so is smart and will be important for the health and well being of future generations -- human and nonhuman -- of life on earth."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Plastic gets a bad wrap. But it&#39;s a pretty dang efficient material. It takes so little energy and material to make something very functional and resilient. I know that CO2 analyses of the replacements to plastic bags and straws has not been very kind to them.I find it commendable to encourage people to consumer less stuff, but the war on plastic straws has been a huge step back - it&#39;s done relatively little to actually help, but has imposed huge and everyday annoyances on everyone. These should be the exact opposite goals of environmental reforms when there are much lower hanging fruits available."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author is conflating two separate issues.Their main point is at the end:&gt; Banning plastic straws is stupid.They&#39;re probably right that throwing out plastic straws is better than throwing them in the recycling, assuming that plastic straws can&#39;t be efficiently recycled.  That being said, many US recycling utilities typically sort the recycling on shore, and plastics that are too small to be efficiently identified and recycled (such as straws and loose bottle caps) will just be sent to the landfill regardless. How recycling is processed differs a lot across the country, so it&#39;s hard to make generalizations.But that doesn&#39;t support their final conclusion about whether plastic straws should be banned.  The author doesn&#39;t give a reason, but implicitly that they think paper straws suck, and must suck.  Which a lot of the ones today do. But it&#39;s an odd hill  to die on, given that basically all straws before 1960 were made of paper.  Their ire should probably be directed at the establishments they frequent for buying cheap and terrible paper straws instead of spending a bit more to get good quality paper straws.  Such companies probably want to get you pissed off by paper straws to demand that your government remind the ban so they can go back to using cheaper plastic straws."</p>
