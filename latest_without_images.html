								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is the problem with &#34;no politics at work&#34;: work has political salience. Politics concerns regulation of the world and work happens in the world.Whenever an executive starts complaining[1] about how politics is impacting their workplace I see management incompetence. Politics exists. It exists for everyone. If your company is having an unusually difficult time getting work done in a given political environment, the conditions that are causing that probably have more to do with the company environment than politics writ large.Prohibition is always a largely ineffective policy. People have feelings about the world. If you can&#39;t find a way to make space for those feelings somehow they will make their own space, often at the least convenient moment.[1] Most recently this was Kraken CEO Jesse Powell"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Crypto&#39;s biggest friction point imo has been that people are used to interacting [primarily with centralized services. Average people don&#39;t want to manage their own crypto wallet because they aren&#39;t used to being the sole person responsible for managing things like that. They don&#39;t want all their money to be tied to a single computer, or QR code, or device, they want it tied to an account held by a big company, where all they have to do is prove who they are to access their stuff. 
Because of this habit it feels like decentralized services will always end up as a collection of siloed centralized services. And with centralized services you get things like this data selling. Unless there&#39;s a paradigm shift in how non-technical people interact with decentralized services things like this are going to keep happening. That said, they&#39;re saying they&#39;re only providing publicly available data to ICE, but if it&#39;s publicly available and non-identifiable, why does ICE even need it, and why wouldn&#39;t they be able to get it themselves? (I&#39;m actually asking, if you know I&#39;d love to hear)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The link should be changed to https://theintercept.com/2022/06/29/crypto-coinbase-tracer-i.... Current Coindesk article is a poor rehash of the Intercept article, which is a lot more clear. The key question remains unanswered, but the original article at least points that out:&gt; The contract also provides, provocatively, “Historical geo tracking data,” though it’s unclear what exactly this data consists of or from where it’s sourced.No idea how geo tracking data can be “fully sourced from online, publicly available data”."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Worked there from 2008-2013. So early-ish employee here. I still have a chunk of shares from the original ESOP program. Saying that for full disclosure because I&#39;m biased and this feels like a hit piece to me.When I worked there, they disclosed all financials in our internal Confluence site. There was a policy of full transparency with the employees. The owners (Mike and Scott) had impressive business discipline. They were profitable every quarter. They had many many opportunities to get vc money and go wild. When they finally took VC money, It was a modest amount ($60M I think) and the purpose was explained to us as setting up an ESOP program and putting Atlassian on the path to go public.A year or two later, Doug Berman, the founder of Great Plains software became chairman of the Atlassian board. He gave a presentation to all of the employees at the Sydney office. One thing that stood out was that he said, it&#39;s actually bad to be profitable when you&#39;re growing. I&#39;m paraphrasing here but he essentially said, you&#39;re leaving growth on the table. His thesis was growth is more important than profits.So whether you agree with that or not, that is obviously the idea they are operating on rather than uncontrolled spending and helicopter dropping stock on employees heads out of desperation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Somehow I&#39;m not surprised.A few days ago[0] I was writing a Jira ticket after hitting the &#34;Create&#34; button and I wrote the description (the body of the ticket) for ~30 minutes. I switched the ticket type from A to B (no epics involved) and it wiped out the entire description. All I did was select a different item in a select drop down box provided by the form&#39;s UI.There was no warning it would clear the description and no draft saved. I lost 30 minutes of work.I normally manually copy textareas every few minutes on any Atlassian page because I don&#39;t trust their site (to be fair I do this for most sites too) but in the above case I had just copied a link reference which overwrote my clipboard. At the time I also didn&#39;t have a multi-clipboard tool installed since it was using a company issued machine that I don&#39;t have tricked out yet.[0]: https://twitter.com/nickjanetakis/status/1540353527859466246"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; If it is, as you claim, permissible to train the model (and allow users to generate code based on that model) on any code whatsoever and not be bound by any licensing terms, why did you choose to only train Copilot&#39;s model on FOSS? For example, why are your Microsoft Windows and Office codebases not in your training set?This is my favorite question about Copilot ever."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a leader of a FOSS project that is on github, and migrated off of sourceforge because SVN and email patches were not scaling - I&#39;m a bit confused by this article.Co-pilot has issues, ergo github is going the way of sourceforge, and so now we must abandon github? Do I have that reasoning correct?We need to:- migrate the bug queue- have all links in commit history break- application integration with githib for bug reporting be removed- update documentation- find a new website host (and no longer github.io)- find a new CI/CD (we were already burned by travis, github workflows are nice)- teach our user contributors to actually use git! There has been a lot of heartache from them that they have to use the pencil icon on a web ui to edit config files, now we have to take them back to using a git GUI client! We were on github before that blessed pencil icon feature came out, there was no end to the wailing about how unapproachable the process was (super frustrating when users see they have to do something.. frustrating for us because our users wanted to just email is stuff so we could then do the uploading to git work)- lose all PR history- migrate project tracking- find a new place to host release artifacts- update our website to use a new distribution URL (the website scrapes github api to get latest version for download link; it&#39;s nice never updating website as we do releases on every merge)- figure out and migrate repository permissions. (We have a hundred repositories of user generated plugin content, everything about migrating that would be a lot of work and missing important features)- lose our search ranking and rebuild our SEOWhat else to add to this pile.. and all because co-pilot smells?? Meanwhile all of that work is busy work, and not at all feature-pare. That kind of migration would take a long time, seems like that pivot without good reason is the worst kind of churn.  Convince me this article is not a temper tantrum about copilot..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This isn&#39;t very compelling to me.SourceForge went bad ... and everyone left.  That doesn&#39;t seem like a bad thing and there&#39;s no reason for me to think any given site / service will or won&#39;t go bad too.  I expect that for any number of reasons I might need to move from one site to the next.The rest too is kinda hollow to me.  The fact that they&#39;re for profit doesn&#39;t upset me.  I figured they wanted to make a profit when I signed up even ... not sure how that would surprise anyone now.Co-pilot, I personally don&#39;t feel there is a compelling reason to leave github due to that either.Maybe I&#39;m not versed enough in some of this but as a rando dev I&#39;m just not having any problems on github these days ...I&#39;m not saying the author is wrong or right or that I&#39;m right or wrong, just that I&#39;m not finding that article very convincing."</p>

					<h3><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-62000742">Supreme Court limits EPA’s power to cut emissions</a></h3>
				</div>
				<div class="story__comments">
					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31932808">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Headlines about Supreme Court cases are almost uniformly misleading, because they suggest the Court is making decisions on policy issues rather than legal issues.The very first words of the opinion, on p. 2, make clear that the legal issue before the Court is very different: https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/20-1530_n758.pdfThe Clean Air Act does not purport to give the EPA blanket regulatory authority over anything involving emissions into the air. It has detailed provisions focused on reducing the amount of toxic pollutants, in particular through the use of control (scrubbing) technologies. This case concerns whether the EPA can use its power to impose control technologies on power plants, to force the industry to use a particular mix of power generation sources (solar, gas, etc.). The Court decided that the statute did not confer on the EPA the power to do that.  The relevant discussion begins on page 16.This decision gives legs to something that has been called the &#34;major questions doctrine.&#34; The gist of that doctrine is that an agency can&#39;t stretch some pre-existing grant of Congressional authority to create sweeping regulations addressing a major new problem. As applied here, that means that the EPA can&#39;t rely on authority delegated by Congress to, for example, tell coal plants what kind of scrubbers they have to use, to tackle climate change. pp. 17-19."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What’s interesting about this ruling (if you listened to the oral arguments and read the ruling) is that it appears to undercut the ability for any executive agency to make a rule, under them claim that congress cannot delegate its powers.So the FAA can’t determine and then require that aircraft have transponders.  Congress has to do this.If they continue down this path it will be chaos."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I agree with &#34;congress cannot delegate it&#39;s powers&#34; to a certain extent.Negative example: The BATF has a splendid history of literally doing nothing except putting it&#39;s critics behind bars, while solving 0 actual crime and preventing any sort of mass tradgedies.Positive example: The FAA has done an incredible job making air-travel safer than car travel. I have a feeling that a lot of the higher-ups are former engineers and have been able to put politics and red/blue crap aside for a common mission.Mixed example: The FCC has done a great job on spectrum allocation. They&#39;ve done a shitty job when on broadband and content regulation, with it quickly becoming politicalized and more concern about red/blue.Good example: The FDA has done a great job in regulating the industry for their namesake: food and drugs. We have unprecedented levels of safety in both despite not having a complete knowledge of how all drugs work (biology is just complex with a lot of hidden downstream after-effects).Poor example: The NRC has pretty much just said &#34;No&#34; to fucking everything in nuclear. No progress has been made. We should have 3-5 reactors (on average) in every state. Instead we&#39;re still running 50 year old designs (not _necessarily bad_ but not great either) when we could have Generation III+ with passive failure modes.That brings me to the EPA. I think they&#39;ve done a lot of good: energy efficiency ultimately benefits the consumer in nearly every case. I have an air conditioner that kicks out a splendid 58degree air stream in the summer heat and extraordinarily low energy consumption levels. The EPA has successfully sued countless corporations and created superfund sights when they just dump industrial waste without a plan to handle it.Unfortunately, as red/blue politics get involved in an agency, everyone loses. And the finger pointing begins. As such, the only &#34;way out&#34; may be to say delegate it to Congress. I&#39;m not sure where we go from here."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Back in the 80s, a book was passed around the office that listed Japanese swear words and insults. Their take on insults was very creative and funny. Naturally, we all used them on each other, until management finally stepped in to put a stop to it.

Seversky was patenting and flying ionocraft in the 1960s [2], hobbyists have been building them for decades under the name &#34;lifter&#34;, and a self-contained device that carries its own power supply was developed by Ethan Krauss in 2006.MIT&#39;s device may be the first ionocraft to use wings for lift, however. The previous devices behaved more like helicopters than airplanes, and did not need wings to stay aloft.&#34;[0] https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0707-9[1] https://pubpeer.com/publications/020C19C112F2605CEC4B34CA320...[2] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GijJmIz1G7U"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been birding over the pandemic and learning about how they fly. Watching them, it starts to become clear just how skilled and efficient they are.This tech demo is amazing, but my mind immediately compares it to things like the ruby-throated hummingbird migration, in which a 5 gram bird[0] flies 500+ MILES nonstop over open water, on maybe 2 grams of fat storage.Then they feed by hovering so accurately that they can reliably thread a 1/8&#34; beak into a moving 1/4&#34; target.They can do this directly into 20 mph headwinds [0]. Also in rainstorms where they are constantly getting pelted with their bodyweight in wet missiles every few seconds.They can also fly 30mph in level flight, which in body lengths / second is ~4x times faster than an SR-71.[0] US nickels weigh 5 grams, for comparison.[1] https://www.kqed.org/science/28759/what-happens-when-you-put..."</p>

He filed a patent for an &#34;ionocraft&#34; in 1959.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From my limited experience with the Unity engine, I would guess that it has been built with a colossal technical debt that is almost intractable.The foundations were technically weak and they started the reengineering process (DOTS) a bit late.I&#39;ve seen that before, with PalmOS and other tech stacks that were hacked together and kind of worked for a while until the competition caught up.The zombie state can last a few years, but I am pretty sure there are cases where the whole thing can be saved with herculean effort."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Throwaway account for reasons that will become obvious.I know someone who was able to work with JR at EA at a very high level, and who was familiar with internal goings-on at Unity a few years ago. His assessment of JR&#39;s leadership style was that he thought competition between executives was a good thing, and the result was a lot of mistrust and chaos.I&#39;m not sure the specifics of how this played out at EA, but what I do know is that during his tenure, there were a number of poorly-executed moves towards expanding franchises (Dead Space 3, Medal of Honor: Warfighter, Army of Two: The Devil&#39;s Cartel), adding live service components to games that didn&#39;t benefit (SimCity), pivots to free-to-play that failed (Plants Vs Zombies 2, Bejeweled Skies, Dungeon Keeper), rushed releases meant to fill schedules (Dragon Age 2), and several massive acquisitions at hugely inflated prices that were almost total wastes of money (Playfish, PopCap).There were many internal groups battling for control: Multiple product management teams who wanted to influence monetization strategy across mobile games, several small studios who were able to release games with little to no oversight (an HTML5/JS web game team that made a Command and Conquer game, and another team that made several Dragon Age Flash games), and the ill-fated initiative to turn BioWare into a huge umbrella label that lasted about a year before SWTOR came out and then Ray and Greg were basically forced into retirement.Lots of really messy stuff.From the folks I&#39;ve talked to who work at Unity, it&#39;s pretty chaotic there too. And why wouldn&#39;t it be? They doubled headcount in a short period of time, are tackling a ton of different markets, they&#39;ve pushed and then deprecated or removed support for a multiplayer solution, analytics service, a UI rewrite, and probably more I&#39;m forgetting. Then there are the &#34;this is the new hotness&#34; features that STILL AREN&#39;T FINISHED even two, three, four, or more years after they were announced, like the two competing and incompatible rendering pipelines, ECS, and more. And I&#39;ve been told that the reason that longstanding bugs in major features like 2D sprites and physics take so long to be fixed is that each of those major features only has one, maybe two people working on it.No wonder things are rocky at Unity."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi all, author here. Besides the tech of Mimic 3 itself, I&#39;m interested in training voices in as many (human) languages as possible. All it takes is one person willing to donate a dataset for everyone to benefit!...well, that and a bunch of stuff with phonemes. But I&#39;ll do that part :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Does anyone know just how much of the total functionality of Mycroft is actually running on the Raspberry Pi?  I asked this question four years ago on Reddit (I&#39;ll paste the response below) and now I wonder if things have changed, particularly with regard to speech to text.There are several ‘layers’ to a voice assistant;Wake Word - that detects when you are speaking to the device. This is local to the device and we use PocketSphinx.Speech to text - that detects what you say to determine Intents - we currently use a cloud service for thisIntent matching - this is done locally using our own open source software - Adapt and PadatiousSkills - Intents then match to Skills. Some Skills require internet connectivity.Text to Speech - We use our own software called Mimic for this, it’s local to the device."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been dying to replace my Echos with an open source smart speaker but half of them use AWS or Azure for test to speech and speech synthesis so really all you are in control of is the software that runs on the device itself. So this is a coo step in the right direction."</p>
