								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I generally enjoy my AirPods. They are occasionally quirky, but most of the time they really do “just work” for me. The annoyances are annoying when they happen, though.The strangest part is that the annoyances aren’t getting any better over time. At first I assumed that they were growing pains of an early product launch. Yet now we’re years into the AirPods experience and they continue to be just as quirky as when I first got them.Apple seems so hot or cold on fixing their own bugs. Certain bugs get rapidly patched in the next iOS or Mac software release. Other bugs languish for what feels like forever. Do Apple execs just not use AirPods? Are they using a different configuration or hardware combination that doesn’t have these bugs? Have they just trained themselves to overlook the bugs because the workarounds have become a reflex? I can’t imagine working at any tech company where one of the flagship products had such a high rate of annoyances without having a lot of engineers diverted to replicating, diagnosing, and fixing it ASAP."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s weird to me how many people are like &#34;yeah but every other bluetooth is worse&#34;. I have Airpod Pros and experienced every one of these issues and many more on the regular with them, but my several years old now Bose QC 35II never have any of these problems, still last like 5 times as long on battery after years of recharge cycles, interact better with two simultaneously connected devices, have better signal range before dropping out, and I can control the damned volume without trying a dozen times to get Siri to wake the fuck up because airpods have no built-in volume controls and Siri&#39;s voice activation is worse than terrible.The Airpods are set to connect automatically to my macbook when I wear them AND THEY DON&#39;T. EVER. And then calls on my iPhone will stupidly decide to connect and route audio to airpods that I&#39;m not even wearing while they are just sitting on my desk when the phone was literally moments before using the handset speaker for a video. Know what bluetooth device does not have these problems? You guessed it, the one not made by Apple. Like...come on.I really want to like airpods, but they&#39;re just not good."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s a few more:- Airpods sometimes do not charge when in the case. Usually need to pull it out and put back in again.- Knowing what airpod(s) and case are charging. The UI on the phone, the open the case sliding window, the widgets, and the case light itself are not very useful.- Spatial audio working on some apps but you&#39;re not usually aware if it&#39;s on until you tilt an ear one way to confirm.- Out of ear detection sometimes doesn&#39;t work well and will drain the respective airpod.- No preference list of what devices should have precedence over others. Especially when working on 2+ devices.- Hand-off calls is a weird UX. Why would I answer a phone on my iPhone by default when it&#39;s clear I have airpods connected and being used?- The transparency / noise cancelling dance. Not sure if there&#39;s a preference, but it feels random which one is on by default. Always do a double check at the gym or when running as outside noise sounds loud.Still the best headphones and experience in my opinion and have enabled me to achieve a hell of a lot more because of them. Easily worth the price for how much I use them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; It costs $10,000 USD to build one of these&gt; The ten thousandth one costs $15As a software engineer, I&#39;m used to being able to build essentially whatever I want, with the only cost being my time. I&#39;m often unpleasantly reminded that software is an outlier in that regard and as soon as physical items are concerned, especially hardware, it turns out that manufacturing even a simple thing is prohibitively expensive if it&#39;s done at a small scale."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is nice. This is a simple, straightforward design, and a reasonably convenient form factor.Two biggest limitations are RAM and wireless interfaces, or rather lack thereof. This thing has less RAM than my router (admittedly a $70 box), and has neither WiFi nor BT. It does not seem to have many GPIO pins, too.With the amount of RAM installed, it&#39;s mostly a handheld terminal, and maybe a handheld console with emulators for old games.While this is admirable as a proof of concept, I suspect that moving the price point up to, say, $30 could give a much more useful and hacker-friendly device.I greatly appreciate the split keyboard and the replaceable NiMH batteries, though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In China we buy second-hand Redmi 2 for 60RMB each (roughly $9.5). Can be bought in quantities. Fully functional with 2GB RAM+16GB eMMC, and battery, touchscreen, WiFi, Bluetooth, camera, and even 4G support. It&#39;s not built from scratch like this one, but if you are just looking for something cheap, then this price is insane."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have never understood people who mourn the death of the &#34;old&#34; internet because I do not feel I have lost it. Particular communities come and go, as they always have, but I have found that the I can find the same sorts of gathering places for the same kinds of people I always have - in about the same numbers too.The thing that has changed is that a huge swath of new people have come online and, though some of what brought them online is wider access to connectivity, a lot of what brought them online are new kinds of communities. They showed up for social media and most of them just aren&#39;t that interested in the things that made up the &#34;old&#34; internet.I put &#34;old&#34; in quotes because people have kept and maintained the parts they love. You can still play MUDs, you can still visit BBSes, people still run Hotline servers[1]! Many of these communities have changed because the world has changed: lots of people who played MUDs in 1990 have moved on to other online games, but lots have not! Critically - tools have continued to be developed. You can use IRCCloud (and be told it makes you a bad IRC&#39;er), you can play MUDs on your phone, etc. These communities have changed with the times and improved for it.My sense is that the absolute number of people who are involved in these communities has dropped, but not actually by that much? Maybe half as many people play MUDs now as they did at the peak - but it&#39;s a steady half. I think of it like the communities around vinyl or around film photography: less central than they once were, but healthy and vital.I am really glad that people who were not online at all during their peak are discovering these older forms. We have kept them for good reasons. But don&#39;t call it a comeback, they have been here for years.[1] https://hotline.fandom.com/wiki/Clients"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I sure hope that&#39;s right. It was the best feeling in the world to stand up an Apache server on my Amiga, and later my little FreeBSD server, and see my friends viewing the website I was hosting on my dialup connection. It wasn&#39;t pretty, it wasn&#39;t elegant, and it certainly wasn&#39;t fast, but it was mine. I made that. From installing the server to writing the HTML, I owned that service from end to end and had completely freedom to do whatever I wanted with it.That&#39;s what I want the Internet to look like for my younger family and friends. It&#39;ll probably never happen exactly this way, but I can picture someone running an IPv6-only service on their phone to impress their friends. I know what their smile would look like because that was once my smile, too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like this article doesn&#39;t address the reason why people moved away from the &#34;old&#34; Internet --- most people only care about their _content_ not the particular technology that backs it.In the old times, you could only host content if you were really good with the technology. The people who had websites were people who knew how to set up and run a web server, and to compose the HTML content that was being served. Similarly, communities who ran BBS forums, mailing lists, IRC, etc. all needed at least some people who could set up and manage the technology for them.Centralized services (Web 2.0) changed that. Now all of a sudden you didn&#39;t need to run your server --- you could just type some text and click some buttons to put up a blog on a shared service (myspace? blogger? wordpress.com?). You didn&#39;t need to run your own forum or mailing list or chat rooms, you could just put your community on an existing service that provided that (Google groups, FB/Whatsapp/&lt;insert your IM&gt; Chat). Need a forum? You have reddit. What is Twitter if not just a collection of mailing lists that you can openly subscribe to but not post on? Centralization allowed the vast majority of people to do what they wanted to do while &#34;outsourcing&#34; the technology part to somebody else, because most people don&#39;t care about the technology they care about their content.The problem with the modern decentralized web (3.0?) is that we haven&#39;t focused on solving the real problem --- making it easy to manipulate _content_. If anything, setting up a Web 3.0 presence is _harder_ than it was on a centralized service, and as long as it remains harder, the new &#34;old&#34; Internet will always be a niche."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; I feel like I&#39;m encountering more and more sites and articles where I can&#39;t seem to find the date.It seems to me that its become standard practice on marketing type blogs for corporate websites to remove the date from their posts. I think its because (from personal experience) the company will go though a burst of &#34;blog productivity&#34; create a load of content but then not touch it for years, they don&#39;t want that content to look out of date or their website to look stagnant.Removing the date from their posts, or any other content, hides how old it is and therefore obscures how active they are at crating new content.Most companies try to use their blogs to attract new customers, a new customer may visit their website once or twice and will never see the blog again, it&#39;s not important that they do. They don&#39;t want it to look stale.As a counter example, an interesting thread from yesterday [0] was about how CloudFlare use their blog not as a marketing tool but for technical content and attracting employees. They very regulally use their blog, and so keep the date on it showing how fresh it is.0: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30070422"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Anecdote: On of the best friends of my oldest daughter moved to a new rented flat recently. When I saw the address for a playdate, I recognised it and said to my daughter &#34;I think you went to a birthday party at this address when you were 3-5 years old when another of your friends must have lived here&#34;. To corroborate this, I looked up the calendar on my phone, where I&#39;m pretty organised about putting dates and locations of events. However, at that point I discovered that Google Calendar only keeps 2 years of history!So modern technology is literally erasing our pasts. Not just calendar entries, but messaging systems (people used to keep handwritten letters for decades), and possibly even photos (if we&#39;re not careful about preserving them).Edit: See my clarification of the 2 years in comment https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30084620 below. I still think the point remains - we do not own or value our digital data in the same way as physical objects, and there is a much heightened risk of that data disappearing as a result, either by the owners of the platforms the data is stored on archiving the data or by us not valuing it enough to preserve exports and backups through long periods of time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google&#39;s search quality has taken a serious nosedive in the last couple of years - the last 6 months in particular.I think they implemented some new form of search term widening which is far too strong, so the results you want are often buried among pages and pages of results for the general category of things that you searched for rather than close matches for your keywords. Combined with the recency bias that other people have talked about and you end up with a lot less useful search for precise searching.This coincides with a large increase in the number of surveys that my partner has been getting through the Google Rewards program that ask whether or not a recently used search term gave relevant results. Obviously that&#39;s just anecdotal, but it does feel like there are substantial changes in the algorithm, and not necessarily for the better."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Many site owners find that the titles they carefully craft almost all get rewritten.Yeah, I&#39;m with Google on this one. I don&#39;t see many reasons why a site owner would spend extraordinary amounts of time to &#34;carefully craft&#34; page titles other than SEO and optimizing for clickbaitness. As a user, I&#39;m fine with Google counteracting this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google has a guide on this :)https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/appearanc..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Takeaway: to dramatically decrease the chance of Google rewriting your title, matching the H1 to the title tag seems to be an effective strategy.Of course it should be mentioned this wont last if it becomes popular. Historically every time an SEO trick gets popular, the rules are adjusted. Even having this article on the front page of HN might be enough to see Google react by rethinking how (or whether) tags in titles affect the title rewrites."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have a different conclusion. The article mentions that the car would have cost her 3 months of income. That doesn&#39;t sound too much and is roughly about the same what people pay for cars today, maybe even more.The reason she thought about the car as a luxury and not a necessity is that then the society wasn&#39;t dependent on cars like we do today. They travelled less, worked closer to home, milkman brought milk to home and grocery shopping could be done closer to home as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting that he compares everything that is hard to compare but ignores one thing that would be very easy - rental pricing. You had to pay it then and you have to pay it now.&#34;four bedrooms, two sitting rooms, and a “nice outlook on green.” The rent was £90 for a year.&#34;According to one CPI calculator (https://www.in2013dollars.com) &#34;£90 in 1919 is equivalent in purchasing power to about £4,951.54 today&#34; and &#34;£700 in 1919 is equivalent in purchasing power to about £38,511.97 today&#34;.Google search also reveals that average yearly wage in London in 1920 was £205 and average wage in London in 2021 was £53,700 so £700 income in 1919 was 3.5 times the average which in 2021 would be £187,950 (quite a bit more than &#34;equivalent in purchasing power to about £38,511.97 today&#34;).A quick web search for 4 bedroom apartment (not sure about sitting rooms) in London shows that rent is between £2,000 and £8,000 per month - let&#39;s say £5,000 for a nice one like what Christie&#39;s sounds like which is £60,000 per year.
They paid £90/£700 = 13% of their (3.5 the average) annual income for rent and now the equivalent rent would be £60,000/£187,950 = 32% of the 3.5 the average annual income.Even just comparing the plain average income, person in 1919 could rent the same apartment and still have £205 - £90 = £115 to live on for the year (which seems possible considering maid lived on £36 per year but in 2021 the average income leaves you £53,700 - £60,000 = £6,300 short on the rent alone.So ignoring the tvs, computers, holidays, cars, healthcare and all the things that we cannot compare and comparing what we can, it is obvious that just to live in 2021 we need more money that what we are making and so it is easy to see how most people feel that the living standards have gone down."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interestingly enough, I&#39;m typing this in Singapore, where in 2022 it&#39;s quite common to have a &#34;maid&#34; (helper/domestic worker, in the current local lingo), but no car.Singapore imports domestic workers for poor neighbouring countries like the Philippines and Myanmar, which keeps wages very low, on the order of US$450/month, not too far off Christie&#39;s inflation-adjusted US$220/month.  Even the fully loaded cost with government levies, insurance, food &amp; board etc is on the order of $1000/month, considerably cheaper than most other childcare options, particularly if like most Singaporeans both parents work longer hours.By comparison, Singapore strictly limits the number of cars on the road, auctioning permits called &#34;Certificates of Entitlement&#34; to the highest bidder and imposing around 100% taxes on the cars themselves.  As a result, a plain vanilla Toyota Corolla costs US$120,000 all in.  What&#39;s more, half of that is the COE cost, which is valid for only 10 years, meaning the value of the car depreciates by around $10,000 every year.  Add in petrol, servicing, parking etc, and having a live-in helper to run errands and drop off kids etc starts to look quite affordable in comparison."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wonder how this will play out globally as nationwide is just one nation and not Worldwide.Certainly be interesting how this plays out and did have a quick dig too see if the EU is, or has anything in the pipeline, though nothing jumping out.As for my country (UK), I did find this - https://www.gov.uk/government/case-studies/online-sellers-pr...So this is a story that will ripple and certainly, thanks to Washington states work, there is a smoking gun.Will Amazon proactively get on top of this Worldwide in other countries will be most telling.But one aspect of companies doing wrong by consumers and respective authorities fining them that always irks me - the consumers who suffered and paid the price never get a slice of those fines.  That and fines of large companies has in all effect, become a revenue stream for respective government&#39;s with the consumer getting justice in name only and the government&#39;s coining it, in effect at the expense of the consumers.  Be those consumers of suffered such bad company practices, or future customers who will be paying indirectly for such fines.After all, will they force Amazon to dig in and compensate effected/impacted consumers of such price-fixing?   That would be nice.  Equally, be nice if Amazon in good faith did the right thing by those impacted.  One can but dream and hope."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing everyone is getting hung up on is the fact that Amazon isn&#39;t wholesaling the dongle. The contract isn&#39;t a wholesale deal, meaning if your widget doesn&#39;t sell, it&#39;s sitting on your balance sheet, not on Amazon&#39;s balance sheet. It would be like if Costco instead of buying 1000 legos, just stocked legos in it&#39;s warehouse, then paid Lego company everytime a single unit sold. 
Then they figured out how to make their own legos through a different supplier, they fixed the original Lego price $5 more expensive then the store brand legos. Now Legos sell for $30 a box and Kirkland Legos sell for $25 a box, same exact product, just a few bucks cheaper. Oh and lego couldn&#39;t drop the price from 30 to 20 to compete....That&#39;s what Amazon has done. Price fixing and control of the competitors inventory. Damn bastards."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In case others were as confused as i was about this&#34;While they’re often confused, Sold by Amazon and Fulfilled by Amazon are two different things.    With SBA, Amazon prices your products and owns any transactions that take place. When an item sells, they pass the proceeds on to you for allowing them to sell your product.

    With FBA, you price your products and own the transactions. It is a service where Amazon handles the order fulfillment process for your products.&#34;

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m the author of esbuild. I think this is a very smart, practical choice and is one of the approaches that has the best chance of succeeding (the other being a semi-automated porting tool instead of a purely manual port). I&#39;m very excited to see someone take this approach. This is how I would do it if I were to do it. Web developers around the world are hoping this works out :)The hard part about this project isn&#39;t doing the port but keeping up with the constant changes from the TypeScript team, especially if the TypeScript team isn&#39;t invested in helping you out. Staying as close as possible to the source language like this will be a big win there.One of the big benefits of a native language like Go aside from lack of a JIT is the ability to easily add shared-memory parallelism. I haven&#39;t studied the TypeScript compiler internals so I&#39;m not sure how easy it is to parallelize their type checker. However, I assume that it would be relatively straightforward to parallelize the parsing of JavaScript files, so I&#39;d hope for at least be a big speedup there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of when people try to make a new Ruby implementation. They get the basics down and think &#34;this isn&#39;t so bad! I can do this!&#34;. Fast forward a few months and they&#39;re stuck on some nasty little edge case around eval and method_missing that they need to run Rails. Or some weird aspect of C extensions.TypeScript&#39;s compiler is an unholy, unsound mess, because JavaScript is an unholy, unsound mess. Sure the basics of type checking structs and variables is somewhat easy. But what about conditional types? What about weird generic constraints? What about indexing types? There&#39;s some really confusing stuff going on underneath the hood.It&#39;s also a mess that *does not have a spec*. Even if you somehow manage to  make a type checker that implements most of the features, there&#39;s no way to ensure it has 1 to 1 parity with TypeScript. Plus that parity can be broken at any point.The only way I could see this happening is if the author somehow convinced Anders Hejlsberg or a significant portion of the TypeScript team to work on this new implementation. I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s gonna happen."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; tsc depends on shared mutability and has a cyclical mutable reference.
 Rust is designed to prevent this behavior.
Having two references to the same data (shared mutability)
 is undefined behavior in Rust.This problem has numerous solutions in Rust - (A)Rc, RefCell etc. I don&#39;t understand how this caused the author of the article to stop considering Rust."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Something from the NYT mailing list yesterday:&gt; The Covid vaccines are remarkably effective at preventing serious illness. If you’re vaccinated, your chances of getting severely sick are extremely low. Even among people 65 and older, the combination of the vaccines’ effectiveness and the Omicron variant’s relative mildness means that Covid now appears to present less danger than a normal flu.&gt; For the unvaccinated, however, Covid is worse than any other common virus. It has killed more than 865,000 Americans, the vast majority unvaccinated. In the weeks before vaccines became widely available, Covid was the country’s No. 1 cause of death, above even cancer and heart disease.At this point if an adult in the US is unvaccinated it is (1) almost certainly by choice (there are some people who cannot get it for medical reasons but they make up only a very tiny fraction of the unvaccinated), and (2) it is very unlikely that any evidence or logical arguments will chance their minds.With COVID becoming endemic everyone is going to get antibodies, with the only choice being whether you get your first antibodies by vaccination or by getting COVID.The only question really then is how fast do we want the unvaccinated to do the getting antibodies by getting COVID thing. The faster they get it, the faster we can be as done with COVID as we are ever going to be.I&#39;d say the answer to that should be determined by the hospital capacity. If a region has sufficient hospital capacity that it would not be overwhelmed by the increase in COVID cases among the unvaccinated go ahead and lift most restrictions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The media&#39;s binary separation of populations into vax and unvax is a false dichotomy. More causal factors would be represented by:  1. Covid-recovered 
  2. Vaccinated
  3. Partly-vaccinated (&lt; 14 days after 2nd shot)
  4. Covid-naive + Unvaccinated

CDC reporting bundles #3 and #4.  UK reports all 4 categories separately.#1 was already a high percentage in 2021 and is now higher due to Omicron.Edit: CDC estimated pre-Omicron #1 as 146 million people (as of Oct 2021), https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/burd..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m vaccinated and boostered by my own choice. My problem with mandates is where does it end? Why this mandate and not other mandates? Who gets to decide that?"</p>
