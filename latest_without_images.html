								<p class="story__comment_others">"A few months ago I agreed with her entirely. Tether is an unbacked fraud and NFTs are being front-run [1, 2]. The mid-level marketing Ponzi vibe is crazy. The latency of applications on the blockchain is atrocious. But more recently after learning from and interacting with people building in the space my assessment changed. There is an interesting intersection between tech, communities, and economics.  There exists a transparency in the open-source code of smart contracts that will disrupt the current gatekeepers like the internet did.Certainly, there are problems, but some things will live beyond the crash that is coming and change things in ways no one can be sure of. The internet started in the 1960s and was opened up commercially in 1989.[3] It feels like we are somewhere between 1995 and 2000. The energy feels similar with people trying to shove old paradigms into a new world, vaporware companies, and insane investments. I don’t think we’ve seen the top and it will likely make the crash of 2001 look small by comparison. I may be wrong, but if I’m not, it still is early.[1] https://bitfinexed.medium.com/tether-is-setting-a-new-standa...

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The central problem in this entire debate is two groups talking past each other. The skeptics say &#34;what is it for?&#34; expecting a detailed answer, and the response from crypto enthusiasts is vague and high level; most of what I hear is heavy on words like &#34;revolutionize&#34; and &#34;decentralize&#34; but very, very short on specifics. Or I get argument by analogy to other technologies.If I heard a single use case where blockchain technology actually created real value in the world, and was better than other alternatives, I&#39;d listen. But it has to create real value, based on the real world and not some fantastical notion of what money is or governments are for.I think we skeptics want a grounded narrative, and we&#39;re stuck hearing a thesis statement and nothing to back it up."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So first off: Very cool. Amazingly polished, and self-hosting! Especially since it looks to be an actually-independent project with POSIX as an optional compat layer.I feel like the features that are unique are mostly in 3 groups:1. Features that shouldn&#39;t be unique to this system. Tabbed windows have occasionally happened on other systems, and probably should become more common, and there&#39;s no reason it shouldn&#39;t work on other systems. I hope this inspires other people to copy;)2. Features that only work if you have really tight integration or different primitives than most OSs are using. Programs updating file name when you rename from the file manager, or the file manager showing when files are open... might be possible to graft on to other systems, but it&#39;d be a right pain. Even systems like MacOS are going to struggle - the whole OS is under one company that could do cross-functional stuff like that, but any time it touches applications you need external developers to support it and that may or may not work out.3. Features that are possible, but nobody else does it because it&#39;s impractical - possibly only impractical from their starting points, though.  Showing total size of subdirectories is expensive on ex. Linux because you have to walk every file recursively. I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re just eating the cost because they haven&#39;t hit a case where it matters, or if their system actually makes it cheap (I could easily imagine a filesystem that moved the calculation cost up front)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Love it, feels like browsing the web about 20 years ago. (Or a few bad websites now…)So this is an example of Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)[0]. It is a metric (coined and named by Google) which indicates how much “movement” there is during the initial render of a page, caused by reflowing the layout. Ideally you have very little or none of it for better UX. I believe it can have an impact on organic search ranking and potentially ad rank.The most common cause is images included without width and height attributes, therefore the page has to reflow after the image has been downloaded.Other things that can cause it are multiple css files overriding each other and loading slowly, or JavaScript effecting the layout after it has loaded.You can use Google Lighthouse [1] to measure this (and other things) on a site.0: https://web.dev/cls/1: https://web.dev/measure/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"An extremely useful hidden gem in Rich is its `inspect` function [1].When called on an object, it pretty prints a list of its public attributes (though you can also request private and dunder attributes) [2]. It can also be called on a class or function; it&#39;ll then pretty print the docstrings, parameters with types, methods, etc. It&#39;s great for debugging and for starting to code with libraries you&#39;re not familiar with, don&#39;t have comprehensive documentation, or have some dynamic aspect.In a similar vein, `objexplore` [3] is another library that lets you dive into an object&#39;s nested attributes to understand how it&#39;s laid out.In interactive debugging sessions I often find these to be more useful than the IDE&#39;s features which provide similar functionality.[1] https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/init.html#ri...[2] https://i2.paste.pics/798cff2903f6b3351289a24c839d4f44.png[3] https://github.com/kylepollina/objexplore"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This looks really cool, but after I first learned about Automatic Content Recognition and all the ridiculous anti-privacy things these smart TVs do, I adopted a policy: A TV is a big dumb monitor, that&#39;s it, and it never ever gets internet access. So, for better or for worse, all of my TV needs go through an Apple TV, and I block Apple&#39;s 17.0.0.0/8 for that client just in case it wants to get a little too chatty about my habits with Apple. YouTube is AFAIK the only thing on there that&#39;s able to spy on me, mitigated to some extent I hope with pi hole, and 90% of the time I&#39;m in plex or an IPTV client."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It would be nice if there were proper open source distros for TVs. Hopefully the GPL lawsuit against Vizio will get source code and install info, so that distros can run on them, perhaps with Kodi as the UI. It also hopes to set the precedent that anyone can sue over GPL violations, not just the copyright holder, which could help increase the available TVs that can have an open source distros, through further lawsuits by other folks.https://sfconservancy.org/copyleft-compliance/vizio.html"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To anyone considering switching to an induction hob and hearing anecdotal stories of how some people don’t think they are “as hot” or “slower” than gas. I guarantee these are all related to the pans being used. It is of upmost importance that you get a really good set of pans “designed” for induction.We have found “tri-ply” stainless steel pans work really well, better than on gas. Cast iron is also brilliant, I inherited loads of them. We have aluminium none stick frying pans with solid stainless steel bases, they work well.Aluminium pans without a solid steel base are absolutely crap on induction - even the ones that say they work. Avoid them.If you have any pans with a slightly curved base they won’t work. And you will have to get a Wok with a flat bottom designed specifically for induction.Make sure you read reviews before you purchase any new pans, and if you are changing your hob to an induction one be prepared for replacing your pans - budget to spend more on them than the hob even.We are absolutely converted to induction, love it and will never go back. Planning to one day get rid of the gas boiler too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My wife and I decided to switch to induction after the NYT article on this topic a few months ago.Not only did we have a gas stove that was probably spiking NO2 levels when we actually used it; we also seemed to have a gas leak. It was not a big one, just a faint smell, but it was hard to pin down. A plumber concluded the connection between the range and the pipe wasn&#39;t the problem. No specific part of the range smelled stronger than the rest of it. For all we knew, it might be a hole in a pipe. So we wanted to make gas stop flowing through our unit (a condo within a three-family home, very normal here in Cambridge, Massachusetts) altogether.We contacted an appliance company about switching to induction. To prepare, they told us, we would first need to upgrade the range power outlet to 40 amps, and cap off the gas pipe behind the range.The electrical work cost $1800. It could have been much more; we were lucky our circuit breaker was positioned such that they only needed to make two openings in our walls. (They suggested we put little hatch doors in those spots to make future work easier.)We asked our plumber to not only cap off the gas pipe behind the range, but also put in a valve in the basement, such that gas flow could be shut off to our unit, but also easily turned back on if a future owner wants to reverse what we did. We did this rather than turn off our gas altogether, because we have a gas water heater and still needed gas available there. The plumbing work cost about $300 I think.To make cooking stay as close as possible to being how great and fast it is with gas, we chose a range with an induction stove: The LG LSE4616ST, which cost $3000.We were lucky to be able to afford this change for our health. Of course, it would have cost a lot less if we hadn&#39;t cared about induction, but still multiple thousands of dollars.We should be subsidizing conversions like this."</p>

I stumbled on it a while back and started using it and thought this can be my go-to styles for tit-bits of websites that I do for landing pages, family websites etc. However, this is pretty opinionated (including some animations) and I had to abandon it. But I remained inspired by its simplicity and forked my own[1] broke it down. I broke it down to the most basic, but then can be built on top of it -- progressively get a website &#34;designed&#34; far enough but not further.If you are into these simple classes, check out Drop-in Minimal CSS[2] and choose the one that fits your need.Simple.css is from an interesting guy, Kev Quirk[3], whose 512kb[4] website was on Hackernews a while back (don&#39;t recollect if it was a story or a comment). Hi Kev, if you are around.If you are spinning up a simple website with classless styles, perhaps it is a good idea to add a print styles and I like Gutenberg[5] for that.1. https://oinam.github.io/oinam-jekyll/2. https://dohliam.github.io/dropin-minimal-css/3. https://kevq.uk/about/4. https://512kb.club5. https://github.com/BafS/Gutenberg"</p>

 * It&#39;s hard to turn a notebook into an assertive test.
 * Converting a notebook function into a python module basically involves cutting and pasting from the notebook into a .py file.These must be common issues for anyone working in this area.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Excited about this and have been a big fan of iPython since when I started coding in Python well over a decade ago. Might be a little while for switching to v8 due to the minimum 3.8+ version requirement for Python (which I totally understand from an ease of maintenance and forward looking mindset for the iPython projet). I use it all the time as my go-to REPL in Pycharm. Thanks to the team for all the work on it!As an aside, I really wish the VSCode team did more to integrate iPython REPL more seamlessly into VSCode as that is one of the big blockers for me to using VSCode for anything Python related."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Jupyter notebooks are a favorite among our data scientists. However, we have gone back to plain python scripts for our bigger projects due to a simple reason - one must keep alive the notebook page while running lengthy experiments on a remote server. Due to some rogue windows updates we had a couple of destroyed experiments, which (as these things go), happened at a very inopportune moment.OTOH for quick experiments notebooks are great, although I feel like the more modern the GUI the farther back we go in terms of experience. The latest updates to visual studio code&#39;s Jupyter extension for example have turned this into a thoroughly frustrating experience for the visually impaired - gray-on-gray-on-gray text and even more gray and transparent thin lines that are supposed to clearly mark where a cell ends and where the output begins. Unfortunately no amount of fiddling with the color scheme could fix these &#39;design&#39; choices..."</p>
