								<p class="story__comment_others">"Kinda on a related note I found myself needing to make a bunch of these sorts of scraped feeds. The problem for me was the lack of date parsing support which I sorely needed (and it doesn&#39;t appear like this option supports it either)I ended up writing my own CLI tool that similarly supports CSS selectors for feed generation: https://github.com/dayzerosec/feedgenI did write it specifically for my use-case so there are some &#34;warts&#34; on it like custom generators for HackerOne and Google&#39;s Monorail bug tracker. But perhaps someone else might benefit from its ability to create slightly more complicated RSS, Atom, or JSON feeds.Example config with date parsing: https://github.com/dayzerosec/feedgen/blob/main/configs/bish..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very cool to see a team of 25 students put this together and get prototypes made. I wish opportunities like these were available back in my college days.The headline is getting slightly ahead of the actual performance. Reaching Cortex-A76 performance is their goal after many more iterations. Their current implementation is not there yet, but that shouldn&#39;t detract from the magnitude of their achievement and their contribution to the open-source world:&gt; This culminated with an 8-core prototype built based on Yanqihu (雁栖湖) architecture using TSMC’s 28nm process with the processor running up to 1.2 or 1.3 GHz that should be taped out this month. But plans have been made to tape out a new prototype based on Nanhu (南湖) by the end of the year, using SMIC’s 14nm process allowing up to 2 GHz frequency, and further iterations of the architecture will aim at rivaling Arm’s Cortex-A76 processor.RISC-V is an exciting development in the SoC world. We&#39;re starting to see some of HiFive&#39;s boards trickle out into the wild. The performance is good, but it&#39;s not quite as groundbreaking as many of the headlines make it out to be. The most exciting part of all of this is that ARM has more competition and we get to see some open-source contributions like this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"MicroMagic is pretty interesting to me in the RISC-V space: https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/12/new-risc-v-cpu-claim...They are getting perf-per-watt numbers that are ahead of everyone...albeit with a single core and no real 3rd party verification.Some of the group had worked on Sparc at Sun, and they had previously sold themselves to Juniper for $260M, then regrouped some time afterwards."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t know whether it is possible with chip development or not. But I really hope that this project will enable numerous amount of derivative chips just as Linux kernel allows multiple distro. That means IoT/GPU/CPU/etc chips need not to start from scratch. In addition, having similar foundations might help fabs manufacture those chips swiftly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a good write up.  Many years ago I decided to code/program a log based db, to see how far can I go.  It was supposed to be Light-weight (Berkley DB was the inspiration). It had a working stream to file for all changes, and a compaction thread in the background.What I learned...  creating the main/basic features of non-relational database (log based), is easy... but it is the edge cases that hit you hard and dealing with them creates about 90% of the code.It was a fun exercise from which I learned a lot."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a good tutorial.The problem of out-of-order data becomes more challenging as ingest throughput requirements increase if your storage representation must guarantee a strict total order. In high-throughput designs this is often handled by relaxing the strict total ordering requirement for how the data is represented in storage. As long as the time-series has an approximate total order at ingest time, there are many techniques for inexpensively reconstructing a strict total order at query time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don’t hear much about it these days, but circa 2004 when I was going into computer science I had multiple teachers and a guidance counselor warn me that all the jobs would be going to India and tell me I should pursue something else. This seemed to be very much the prevailing wisdom of the time. I pursued it anyway as it was my passion.I was one of five students in my program that had been a huge multi-campus program only a couple years earlier. We were the last cohort before the college discontinued the program entirely, and I was the only one to graduate. What I found  however for maybe five years after graduation was a insanely high demand for developers.There was genuinely a generation that was so strongly discouraged from becoming developers that there were very few. Seems to me like the folklorists have largely missed this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My biggest issue with education is the whole &#34;study this, get a job doing that&#34; idea. It&#39;s plainly wrong, and it sucks in people who drink the koolaid and think there&#39;s an easy route to work.Very little is learned in college that is necessary for general employment. By general I mean just about everything that isn&#39;t licensed, like being a doctor.What college does is it throws a bunch of hard but irrelevant subjects at you that you slog through, so that you learn how to learn stuff. The best demonstration of this is in subjects that are scientific mathematical, because there&#39;s very deep trees of knowledge there that you have to trace, and there&#39;s relatively few ways to use common sense and cultural experience to answer questions.This is why there are so many devs with no &#34;relevant&#34; degree. If you can sort through the mess of learning a stack, you can do the job. If you need to know some particular CS thing, you will find it and learn it yourself. There&#39;s no magic dust in any class, it&#39;s all publicly known information that&#39;s been digested by many many people before us, and these days you can find umpteen explanations for just about anything online for free.The thing that sorts people is the ability to persevere through technical issues. You&#39;ll find a lot of people in this world are for some reason unable to deal with the mess. This is not a condemnation, I realise everyone has their own situation, economically and personally."</p>

People talked about how exciting it had been.  “But how many disk drives will companies ever want, really?”In 1982 the MIT EECS department was trying to encourage students to pick other majors.*   By ‘84 they didn’t need to.* posters in the Infinite Corridor that read, “Course 6 got you down?

					<h3><a href="https://juliareda.eu/2021/07/github-copilot-is-not-infringing-your-copyright/">GitHub Copilot is not infringing copyright</a></h3>
				</div>
				<div class="story__comments">
					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27736650">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I disagree with this article. GitHub Copilot is indeed infringing copyright and not only in a grey zone, but in a very clear black and white fashion that our corporate taskmasters (Microsoft included) have defended as infringement.The legal debate around copyright infringement has always centered around the rights granted by the owner vs the rights appropriated by the user, with the owner&#39;s wants superseding user needs/wants. Any open-source code available on Github is controlled by the copyright notice of the owner granting specific rights to users. Copilot is a commercial product, therefore, Github can only use code that the owners make available for commercial use. Every other instance of code used is a case of copyright infringement, a clear case by Microsoft&#39;s own definition of copyright infringement [1][2].Github (and by extension Microsoft) is gambling on the fact that their license agreement granting them a license to the code in exchange for access to the platform supersedes the individual copyright notices attached to each repo. This is a fine line to walk and will likely not survive in a court of law. They are betting on deep lawyer pockets to see them through this, but are more likely than not to lose this battle. I suspect we will see how this plays out in the coming months.[1] https://www.microsoft.com/info/Cloud.html[2] https://github.com/contact/dmca"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Julia Reda&#39;s analysis depends on the factual claim in this key passage:&gt; In a few cases, Copilot also reproduces short snippets from the training datasets, according to GitHub’s FAQ.&gt; This line of reasoning is dangerous in two respects: On the one hand, it suggests that even reproducing the smallest excerpts of protected works constitutes copyright infringement. This is not the case. Such use is only relevant under copyright law if the excerpt used is in turn original and unique enough to reach the threshold of originality.That analysis may have been reasonable when the post was first written, but subsequent examples seem to show Copilot reproducing far more than the &#34;smallest excerpts&#34; of existing code.  For example, the excerpt from the Quake source code[0] appears to easily meet the standard of originality.[0]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27710287"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; On the other hand, the argument that the outputs of GitHub Copilot are derivative works of the training data is based on the assumption that a machine can produce works. This assumption is wrong and counterproductive. Copyright law has only ever applied to intellectual creations – where there is no creator, there is no work. This means that machine-generated code like that of GitHub Copilot is not a work under copyright law at all, so it is not a derivative work either. The output of a machine simply does not qualify for copyright protection – it is in the public domain. That is good news for the open movement and not something that needs fixing.This is very good news. This line of thought implies that we can legally feed all proprietary code into GitHub Copilot in order to teach it all the patented and secret tricks of the companies we can see (since data mining is not copyright infrigement) in order to have it print those secrets back when we ask it to (so they become public domain)./s"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Am I the only one who thinks this is kind of petty? It&#39;s not like Audacity is trying to read your email (or even rip off your tracks). The telemetry I&#39;m reading about is literally:1. error reporting - the user has to click a button to share crash logs. It&#39;s basically a macro to help the user create a support ticket.2. version checking - no PII information being kept, literally just helping the developer get an idea of what versions they need to be supporting--you do want them to support the version you&#39;re running, right? Well, if not, you can turn it off.What&#39;s the big deal?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wish we could add telemetry to the rr debugger without risking this sort of blowback. We have no idea how many people are using rr, and how much, so when we talk to hardware vendors and other groups we depend on, we have no leverage. This is a real problem.It would be a big boost to free software if some org like Freedesktop had a standard telemetry library, data collection policy, data collection and publication service, and a distro-wide master switch to opt into data collection, and it was socially acceptable to use that framework."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here is the problem I see:1. Users enjoy product for free.2. Users pretty much never tell maintainers what is going wrong for them: no messages (much less proper bug reports), no contributions in any way!3. Something invariably goes wrong for users that do the above.4. Users immediately hit social media and try to tar the entire project, developer/company reputation, whatever.  “Zero stars”, doesn’t work in their use case.  You have surely seen these “reviews” before, and mindless tweets.THIS is why I am torn on telemetry to some degree.  IF you demand no auto-feedback in the name of privacy, THEN you should help out voluntarily OR not use free software!  Yet software maintainers can’t count on this at all.  They risk being hanged in the public square for every bug."</p>

					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27727133">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For those unfamiliar with Strong Towns, here’s a best-effort summary of what they do:Strong Towns is a non-partisan non-profit that advocates for governments to build financially solvent towns. Many cities are perpetually broke because they owe more money in maintenance burden (fixing roads, pipes, etc) than they bring in through tax revenue.This happens because towns in North America tend to build out large neighborhoods all at once (think: suburbia). At the start, the developers pay for all the infrastructure, and then “give” it to the city to maintain.At first, everything seems fine. The city gets plenty of new tax revenue! But come 20 or 30 years later, it turns out that the tax revenue of the new development is not enough to replace the roads, fix the pipes, and so on.And so to pay for the repairs, the city then builds yet another neighborhood in the same strategy to collect the initial tax revenue and use it to pay for the repairs of the previous neighborhood. It’s effectively a Ponzi scheme (as referenced in the article).The gist is that many low-density spread-out suburban neighborhoods with expensive infrastructure are a huge cost center for a city. And since most North American cities build this way, we have a lot of cities that are “functionally bankrupt” or will be soon.If you&#39;re a systems thinker who lives in a town that can&#39;t seem to fix it&#39;s potholes, you may want to check out the book they&#39;ve published with the same name: &#34;Strong Towns&#34;.(Adapted from a previous Strong Towns post)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Not Just Bikes [1,2,3] YouTube channel also has an excellent series of videos based on work from Strong Towns.  I link to these videos whenever a friend asks why I chose to leave the United States. :)[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfQUOHlAocY
[2] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORzNZUeUHAM
[3] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCOdQsZa15o"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This ‘Ponzi scheme’ (bond issuance) is the most efficient funding mechanism by far, and is proven to work sustainably within limits.That limit is the marginal point where the expenditure equals the net asset value gain resultant from it, such as real estate prices. How can you know this limit? You can’t, but the bond market can guess at it.Let’s say that you have a nice picket fence suburb with no police department and lots of robberies. You float a bond for your first police officer (not that this will help, but, run with it…). People buy it for nearly the risk-free rate. Why? Because they know that they will get paid back by the next bond, which will also get funded. Now the cop floats a bond for a Lamborghini. The demand is much lower, and the interest is unsustainable, so it doesn’t get funded.Now here’s where it goes wrong. The mayor sees that nobody wants to pay for the Lambo, and solves the problem by packaging it up with everything else. This works for the first Lambo, but they want 10 Lambos, so the bond interest rate is unsustainable.So what now? Taxes. They put a bunch of taxes on the residents, and then tell the investors that the Lambo bond will now get paid by tax revenues, which they have ultimate authority over. Now the calculus is different. The value of the expenditures is almost irrelevant. The only thing that matters is the marginal point where an additional dollar in tax reduces the net asset value by the inverse of the tax rate (e.g. $1 in tax revenue at 1% =&gt; $100 value destroyed). Notice we’re no longer talking about increasing values by large multiples, but destroying value by large multiples.Now the Lambo bond goes out supported by tax revenues. The casual observer might note that the people of the town are now paying the bond holders for their right to exist on the land that they ‘own’. The major innovation from feudalism is that now the peasants actually pay for the land up-front too, and they pay for any improvements on it, and then higher rent for the improved property.But that’s only an illusion of sustainability created by forceful extraction of resources. It’s like a strip-mining operation on middle class wealth. Profits are great until the resource runs out. So what is the solution there? Growth. Bring in more people to extract resources from. This is a requirement of the extractive funding model.Market forces create sustainable economies. Any use of force distorts away from sustainability, toward finite extraction, and extractive models require expansion."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"So.. I can see that this ML model is generating some code exactly same as the original dataset, which definiately a problem. A defect model, sure. 
Beside that, I cannot understand why the overall idea, using open-source project to train a ML model that generates code would ever be a problem. We human beings are learning as the model, we read others code, books, articles, design patterns... and it becomes part of us. Even the private code, I mean like you join a company, you read their codebase, methodology and it becomes something yours. Copyrights generally not allow you to &#34;copy&#34; the original, but you can still synthesize your own code -- cutting, combination, creating based on whatever you have learnt. 
The method of how a ML model works is differ from human brain for sure, but I cannot see why this would be a problem, or why an organic would become something superior that what they do is a creation and a ML mode is scraping your code. What is the difference here????And also recently we saw GPT that generates articles, waifulabs that generates ... waifus... to be honest I cannot perceive the difference since all of them are &#34;learning&#34; (in a mechanical way of human created knowledge."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a genuine question about this whole thing with Copilot:A similar product, TabNine, has been around for years. It does essentially the exact same thing as Copilot, it’s trained on essentially the same dataset, and it gets mentioned in just about every thread on here that talks about AI code generation. (It’s a really cool product btw and I’ve been using and loving it for years).  According to their website they have over 1M active users.Why is this suddenly a huge big deal and why is everyone suddenly freaking out about Copilot?  Is it because it’s GitHub and Microsoft and OpenAI behind Copilot vs some small startup you’ve never heard of?  Is it just that the people freaking out weren’t paying attention and didn’t realize this service already existed?"</p>
