								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I bought it last night and played for about 5 hours and can&#39;t wait for my work day to end today to get back into it.Overall, I&#39;m pretty happy with it.  Factory building with a dash of colony sim mechanics.  My only criticism is that the tutorial is a bit lacking and basically info-dumps a lot of &#34;what&#34; without a lot of &#34;why&#34;.  If I didn&#39;t have experience with other factory building games, I&#39;d probably be completely lost.  It&#39;d be nice if the game guided you more through the first couple tech tiers.It was also a bit frustrating at first with how expensive conveyer belts are, but then I had a light-bulb moment where I accepted that this is not Factorio/DSP/Satisfactory, and that I don&#39;t NEED conveyer belts everywhere.  In the early game, trucks are cheap and can easily handle the load until I&#39;ve got steady production of Construction Parts II.The Recipe window is REALLY nice.  I love it!  It makes planning so easy!  My only request would be to make it so you can click on a product and have it take you to the recipes involving it.I also really like the design choice to not have to lay power lines everywhere.  In other factory games, it&#39;s such a chore and not at all a fun mechanic.Looking forward to seeing how the game evolves over time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oh the Czechs, also know as the factory game makers from now on.Just kidding. Great game. Congratulations for successful release! It is tough sometimes quitting a well paid job and making what you love. Been there. Wish you success!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I recently attended an automotive dealership conference where I was being pitched for a product that would let me know if my customers were at rival dealerships. I poked and prodded to understand if these were legitimate claims or just marketing hype. They revealed that they purchased location data from app developers. I was shocked and surprised -- I don&#39;t know why I was because this should have been expected. It really enlightened me on the exploitation and misuse of data by crappy apps."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those of you who don&#39;t know who/what &#34;Tim Horton&#39;s&#34; is allow me to educate and enlighten.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_HortonsIt&#39;s a &#39;fast food/coffee&#39; chain that really was made popular by a recurring skit on a TV show called:  Royal Canadian Air Farce (Sketch based usually heavy on the political satire)The skit had 3 people sitting around a table drinking coffee and cracking jokes about current-events and mostly political fiascos.  It was this lampooning of &#39;typical Canadian behaviour&#39; of art imitating life that caused more people to show up and start hanging out at the corner coffee shop.  In my small home town (40,000 people) there were maybe 3 shops (aka Timmies).  During this boom to it&#39;s popularity that number increased by atleast 10.  They made their doughnuts in-house every morning, and the coffee was tolerated as being acceptable.As the franchise grew in popularity it became something of a joke and expectation that a person could find a Timmies on nearly every block, and you would never need to drive more then 10 minutes to get to the closest one.Throughout it&#39;s financial hardships and ownership changes there has been a lot of complaints that &#34;The coffee isn&#39;t as good as it used to be.&#34; And rumours that McDonalds (with it&#39;s McCafee push) bought Timmies old supplier of beans.Now the food is no longer made in store, and my impression is that the coffee is worse.  There have been other cost-cutting measures like making the popular contest &#34;Roll up the Rim&#34; (where a person could unroll the lip of the cup of coffee to reveal a prize from free confections, to money and a car); becoming an APP-only prize (more like a lottery style jackpot then a winning cup).In total, I am not surprised.  Their quality has gone downhill, and the treatment of staff is horrendous."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I assume every app that has location permission does this. I can&#39;t imagine google doesn&#39;t, or the phone company. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s right (and even less right that apparently google will provide this information to law enforcement). I just think the only practical thing to do is assume you are being tracked and don&#39;t install apps unless you&#39;re ok with the tradeoff.The flip side of this, is why would I ever install a Tim Hortons app, why do I think they are offering an app, and what possible meaningful benefit (even assuming I went there regularly) would I drive from having an app?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I increasingly believe that Facebook’s pivot to Meta will end up going down as one of the biggest misses in the history of business. The metaverse is a real idea yes - but strapping a phone to your face and walking through your coffee table isn’t it. Especially not with a mediocre centralized FB owned “virtual world” where they inflict heavy taxes and content moderation. Facebook has neglected its core businesses for years and seems to have real trouble shipping hardware with reasonable spending.Now they’re scrambling to ship an iPhone alternative to get out from under Apple policy, but it really seems like they’re on constant defense now and have a very tough lift to actually get something truly mass market. I would be shocked if Apple, Microsoft or Google were irrelevant in 2030, but it is really possible (if not yet necessarily probable) that Facebook/Meta might actually just not exist in the same kind of way anymore then.When they first announced the rebrand I actually thought it could be genius and that there’s no way they could have been doing it without a really well considered, heavily backstopped plan… but epic strategic miscalculation seems to be going around a lot this year."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hadn&#39;t seen this before today, but NY Times claims that around a year ago (after the Jan 6th insurrection), Zuckerberg and Sandberg started to go their separate ways.https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/08/business/mark-zuckerberg-...&#34;The pair continued their twice-weekly meetings, but Mr. Zuckerberg took over more of the areas once under her purview. He made the final call on issues surrounding Mr. Trump’s spread of hate speech and dangerous misinformation, decisions Ms. Sandberg often lobbied against or told allies she felt uncomfortable with. Mr. Zuckerberg oversaw efforts in Washington to fend off regulations and had forged a friendly relationship with Mr. Trump.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Sitting by Mark’s side for these 14 years has been the honor and privilege of a lifetime. [...] In the critical moments of my life, in the highest highs and in the depths of true lows, I have never had to turn to Mark, because he was already there.&#34;If this is an accurate reflection of her experience, I don&#39;t expect it&#39;s a side of Mark Zuckerberg most of us imagine exists."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This looks great, and I would have loved to see this when I was in the lab.When the software industry says to you: &#34;We will nearly triple your salary, you don&#39;t have to work weekends, and you also don&#39;t have to feed the mice on a Sunday night.&#34;You will 100% take this deal.I was a 10yr+ academic tool maker in biochemistry, built cutting edge microscopes, hardware, and image analysis software. My lab was successful in our field. I got some papers out of the deal. I also saw things that no human had seen before in a microscope. I worked with very interesting people from around the world. The work in academia is great. You&#39;re moving the needle, new data, new failures. These are the perks. It is also highly possible that you have complete creative control of your project. I did, and it was amazing. Custom designed UIs to streamline our experiments, derived from watching students use the system to do their work. A decathalon of software design.Some reality: Your PI and organization will never compensate you the way the software industry will. In pay, expectations, and benefits. When you&#39;re over 30, and you don&#39;t technically have a real 401k, you are still paying your student loans that you needed to get into this field, and you&#39;re still in the same shitty apartment, something has to give.Comparison is the thief of joy, and when you see your cohort of computer science graduates your joy will be stolen :). It&#39;s good, honest work. A short tour of duty would be useful, and can teach you the difference between splitting the atom and splitting the check.Academia, at least in bioscience, is still very much an ivory tower. You don&#39;t have enough letters after your name to matter, and you will likely be a pet instead of a peer.Don&#39;t stay underwater for too long. Life is short. :D"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well, then science needs to do more to create an environment where software engineers would want to be an RSE.From my experience &#34;science&#34; does not appreciate RSEs, the compensation is bad, the freedom is bad, and you get all of the big company bureaucracy from the University.It&#39;s just a bad environment and to top it off, even if you have a PhD many will see you as &#34;less than.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve worked at a top research university for the past 15 years as a research software engineer. Many of these comments have some truth but a lot are definitely not universally true.Poor compensation: Yup, I&#39;ll cop to that. I could be making way more in &#34;industry&#34; but I make enough to live and I don&#39;t build ad-ware and do take pride in my work.Being a PhD but little respect: I actually have the opposite experience. I&#39;m not a PhD, I don&#39;t even have a Masters. But I can write decent software and I get respect and recognition from my PIs and other top-tier faculty that we&#39;ve collaborated with. I feel like I&#39;ve gotten just as much respect with my humble BS in Comp Sci from a state school than if I got a MS/PhD.Micromanagement: I have the total opposite experience. I&#39;ve worked with the same group for a long time, maybe that changes things. We apply for and receive grants to work on projects. We make high-level assertions for what we will do during the course of the grant and our PI gives us lots of lee-way to meet the goals of the grant in whatever technical way gets results, is FAIR, and open. Granted, I may have just lucked out here."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Kinda related, here&#39;s a few ffmpeg commands i&#39;ve probably spent many hours getting to work just right recently (and they might not even the right way to do these things), perhaps someone will find it helpful. All of these are on a macbook.- play facetime camera (or any avfoundation camera, like a capture card) to mpv  ffmpeg -f avfoundation -video_size 1920x1080  -framerate 30 -drop_late_frames true -i &#34;FaceTime HD Camera&#34; -c:v rawvideo -f matroska -r 30 - | mpv -profile=low-latency -untimed -

- play raw video stream from the usb camlink capture card  ffmpeg -f avfoundation -video_size 3840x2160 -framerate 23.98 -pixel_format uyvy422 -drop_late_frames true  -i &#34;Cam Link 4K&#34; -c:v rawvideo -f matroska - | mpv -profile=low-latency -untimed -

- Capture video, and do live HVEC hardware encoding on apple hardware and save result. Control quality with q variable. q=85 is around 250Mb/s:  ffmpeg -f avfoundation -video_size 3840x2160 -framerate 23.98 -i &#34;Cam Link 4K&#34; -c:v hevc_videotoolbox -q:v 85 -r 23.98 -tag:v hvc1 &lt;filename&gt;_x265.mp4

- Use named pipe with mkfifo to play a stream. Sometimes this produces less input lag than other methods.  mkfifo /tmp/fifo1
  cat /tmp/fifo1 | mpv -profile=low-latency -untimed -
  ffmpeg -f avfoundation -video_size 1920x1080  -framerate 30 -drop_late_frames true -i &#34;FaceTime HD Camera&#34; -c:v rawvideo -f matroska -r 30 - &gt; /tmp/fifo1"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"  &gt;   1) internal users: mainly developers by providing CI/CD
  &gt;   2) external users: end users
  &gt;
  &gt; Nowadays we call people that do 1) DevOps and people that do
  &gt; 2) SREs (so one could argue that the role of sys admins just
  &gt; got more specialized).

Both are called sysadmins.SRE is a specialized software engineering role -- you&#39;d hire SREs if you wanted to create something like Kubernetes in-house, or do extensive customization of an existing solution. If you hire an SRE to do sysadmin work, they&#39;ll be bored and you&#39;ll be drastically overpaying.DevOps is the idea that there shouldn&#39;t be separate &#34;dev&#34; and &#34;ops&#34; organizations, but instead that operational load of running in-house software should be borne primarily by the developers of that software. DevOps can be considered in the same category as Scrum or Agile, a way of organizing the distribution and prioritization of tasks between members of an engineering org.---With this in mind, the question could be reframed as: if projects such as Kubernetes are changing the nature of sysadmin work, why has that caused more sysadmin jobs to exist?I think a general answer is that it&#39;s reduced the cost associated with running distributed software, so there are more niches where hiring someone to babysit a few hundred VMs is profitable compared to a team of mainframe operators."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Kubernetes is a Google scale solution.  Lots of teams said “hey if Google does it then it must be good!”…but forgot that they didn’t have the scale.  It caught on so much that for whatever reason it’s now the horrendous default.  I’ve worked on at least 3 consulting projects that incorporated K8s and it slowed everything down and took way too much time, and we got nothing in return - because those projects only needed several instances, and not dozens or hundreds.If you need less than 8 instances to do host your product, run far away anytime anyone mentions k8s"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reading the comments here validates my experience. When K8s was pitched as a way to make this all run smoothly, I thought, &#34;Great! I&#39;ll write my code, specify what gets deployed and how many times, and it&#39;ll Just Work(tm).&#34; I built a service which had one driver node and three workers. Nothing big. It deployed Dask to parallelize some compute. The workload was typically ~30 seconds of burst compute with some pretty minor data transfer between pods. Really straightforward, IMO.Holy smokes, did that thing blow up. A pod would go down, get stuck in some weird state (I don&#39;t recall what anymore), and K8s would spin a new one up. Okay, so it was running, but with ever-increasing zombie pods. Whatever. Then one pod would get in such a bad state that I had to nuke all pods. Fortunately, K8s was always able to re-create them once I deleted them. But I was literally deleting all my pods maybe six or seven times per day in order to keep the service up.Ultimately, I rewrote the whole thing with a simplified architecture, and I vowed to keep clear of K8s for as long as possible. What a mess."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The tool is useful, but let down by Wikipedia images not being linked to the relevant Wikidata ID. I selected just the red circles (no photo). About half of these already have photos in the Wikipedia article that isn&#39;t linked to the Wikidata ID. Adding the image attribute to the Wikidata fixes it and the red dot disappears about 60 seconds later.So before you head out with your camera, perhaps do some linking first. What&#39;s left surprises me with articles with no photo, which I would have thought someone would have done by now. So I&#39;ll be the first!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A word on Creative Common licenses:Wikipedia only considers CC0, CC-BY and CC-BY-SA licenses free enough for the image to be included without any issues. With these licenses, you could also add images to Wikipedia that are not your own, which would greatly speed up coverage.I&#39;m specifically mentioning this because some CC licenses seem permissive, but are not permissive enough for Wikipedia. A key example of this is iNaturalist, which contains millions of photos of all kinds of species that would be useful to add to Wikipedia articles.Their default license is CC-BY-NC. Most photographers on that platform just leave it to that default unaware or not interested in licensing in the first place. Some might be aware of this default license and think they&#39;re being permissive and generous, making possible exactly sharing across services like Wikipedia.Unfortunately, no. It&#39;s a painful mismatch as many of those photographers would likely be perfectly fine with the image being used in that context, but the Wikipedia license requirements prevent this.Similarly, even a license containing an attribution requirement (which is morally perfectly reasonable) is problematic. You find a photo from user &#34;anon2522&#34; on platform X that last posted 8 years ago. The attribution information is really soft and fragile, it doesn&#39;t really link to an actual person and the little information you have may disappear at any time.Bottom line, if you&#39;re truly creating an image &#34;for the good of the world&#34;, CC0 is highly recommended. You can still attribute yourself in EXIF or as a small stamp on the photo itself."</p>

I dug out a month&#39;s worth of access logs for the site, carefully filtered them, and then eyeballed all of the tens of thousands of remaining lines, and again, nothing unusual. No sign whatsoever that the site had ever distributed any malware.There were signs that the site had been probed a number of times by one or a few bad actors, a bit more than just the usual background scanning. Best guess was that, having failed to take the site down through direct means, somebody filed some fraudulent reports against it.DigitalOcean also received a report on the site, and that&#39;s where the difference in handling the issue really became apparent. I sent essentially the same response to both DO and CF. DO sent back a quick, &#34;thanks for taking a look at it, we&#39;re not going to take any action at this time, have a nice day&#34; response.Cloudflare on the other hand pre-emptively took the site down and then took a while to reply at all. When they did, the reply was extremely opaque: &#34;this report has been processed&#34;. Like, okay... and?I had by that time already routed the site off of Cloudflare and had it back online, so the impact was minimal, but now that I know what it&#39;s like to deal with this category of issue at Cloudflare, I have to ensure that it&#39;s always easy to take anything off of Cloudflare. I love Cloudflare generally, so this is really disappointing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can’t believe how lightheartedly you are taking this.
(edit: I guess your initial reaction when the domain was reinstated was probably a bit of euphoria).This faceless corporation simply took away your property without explanation or warning, and didn’t even feel any obligation to explain why.For many people the consequences might have been losing their own or even their family’s source of income.Their behavior was despicable and callous.When did these tech companies start thinking they were all-powerful and above the law like this?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Anyone saying &#34;Good riddance! Go enjoy your life without Facebook!&#34; is missing the point. Please read this bit from the article:&gt; Thing is I’m a Mum of two who has just moved to a new area. Facebook groups have offered me support and community, and Mums I’ve met in local playgrounds have added me as a friend so we can use messenger to plan playdates. Without these apps sadly my little social life becomes a lot lonelier, and harder.This is the pernicious effect of Facebook&#39;s dominance among social networks added to their policy of poor support. It&#39;s not really an &#34;optional&#34; social network if large swathes of your social circle have started using it for essential life functions, it&#39;s more like a utility and should be regulated like one. And no, telling all the mums at the playground about how Facebook&#39;s ban policies are bad and we should all use the Fediverse instead is not going to work for the average person. If anything, it&#39;s more likely to mark you down as one of those weird parents to avoid.It wouldn&#39;t be good for your power company to have the option of arbitrarily cutting you off as a customer, and never giving you a chance to get back your power. Similarly, we should regulate Facebook to the point where they are exposed to genuine regulatory consequences for disrupting people&#39;s lives."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s not just hackers you need to worry about.I joined Facebook in 2020 - immediately secured, 2FA switched on and all the settings reviewed.I lost the account in 2021 after I made the world&#39;s dullest post about the 12V system in a Nissan Leaf. In a Leaf car group. An automatic system determined my post breached community standards and required me to verify my account to continue using it.Fiiine, OK, I upload my driving licence. And it won&#39;t accept the upload. I try JPEG, PNG, different sizes, different browsers, different computers. Nothing seems to stick and after a certain number of attempts it says I have to wait a week to try again. After as couple of rounds of this the expiry deadline passes and my account is gone.I created another without hassle (and still treat FB as the contact method of last resort), but was still surprised at how easily they nuked a genuine user doing ordinary things."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Increasing we automate processes, have programs do the work humans once did.It&#39;s extremely helpful and productive, but it has a darker side. The processes are rigid because machines are rigid, and the designers cater to the 99% cases.But then the 1% happens, and you&#39;re left out in the cold.In the old world of humans and paper, as wasteful as it was, it was easy for exceptions to be made if the clerk was willing, and if they weren&#39;t you&#39;d find another clerk, or a clerks supervisor. The processes tended towards being flexible.But today, you increasingly don&#39;t interact with any humans, or if you do don&#39;t be surprised if, in your unusual case, they say &#34;the computer won&#39;t let me&#34;.As governments move more and more towards digitization, and embrace machine learning, I expect similar stories might unfold - only it won&#39;t be with an opt in social media website."</p>
