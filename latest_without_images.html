								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We have this kind of censorship in India as well, even the in weirdly innocous places. In James Bond movies, and I think Gone Girl as well, scenes were by zooming into character&#39;s faces or just straight cuts.This is probably the only reason I maintain a US iTunes accounts (used to have to buy gift cards from sketchy sites online to keep this going, but I recently discovered that my Indian Amex card works fine with a US address).Also trivia for those who are wondering how cuts are made, at least for cinema content: all video and audio assets are usually sent to theatres in full, but there&#39;s an XML file called the CPL (composition playlist) that specifies which file is played from which to which frame / timestamp in what sequence. Pure cuts or audio censorship can be handled by just adding an entry to skip the relevant frames or timestamp, or by specifying a censor beep as the audio track for a particular time range.https://cinepedia.com/packaging/composition/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The solution to this is, of course, piracy. I&#39;m glad people like those on /r/DataHoarder preserve media in their complete forms so I don&#39;t have to watch them censored.A recent example is Community which has an episode of a character dressing as a dark elf, and the joke is that another character  assumes it&#39;s blackface, even though it&#39;s not. Well, networks and streaming services now removed it and unless you have the original discs, you simply can&#39;t watch that episode.Unless, of course, you pirate it, which is how I watched it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can see how this might backfire. You notice a censored jump and start to feel the itch of curiosity as to what it concealed. I had to watch several of the censored scenes whereas I would have never just randomly watched clips of the show.Also, love the presentation on this page."</p>

I was an engineer, designer and PM. I&#39;d built teams and products, but I&#39;d never built a company.YC gave me a shot, a community, knowhow, and the ability to access capital, talent, and customers.YC changed my life. I want it to help a lot more people achieve their dreams and goals. It did for me, beyond my wildest dreams."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember when everyone switched from myspace to facebook. At the time, I wondered why people like fb more because the pages were more boring and standardized. At the end of the day, whoever claimed &#34;we got tired of the flashy effects&#34; were just themselves tired of the flashy effects. Somehow the boring people convinced designers that boring was more &#34;professional&#34; or something like that and the designers just changed everything and forced that change on most users. It&#39;s just another example of how I don&#39;t really believe everything is &#34;market driven&#34; but suppliers (in this case, designers) really can force changes of habit and consumption on users unilaterally if they have enough market share."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi Daniel,Congratulations on the launch!I received an email from HN user telling me about this post because a while back I was running &#39;HN to Kindle&#39; service[0] and since Amazon enabled 2FA for bulk emails even for approved email ids I lost motivation to run it further and instead made the core application open-source[1].Since you&#39;re sending HN item individually, I&#39;m not sure whether you&#39;ll face the 2FA block but do monitor whether your users are getting your emails delivered by connecting with them.Your website&#39;s presentation is way better than mine, Perhaps because you&#39;ve put JS to good use. Feel free to use my code to implement other features like classification according to chosen topics if you&#39;d like it.[0] https://web.archive.org/web/20220216140431/https://hntokindl...[1] https://github.com/abishekmuthian/hntoebook"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hi DanielFirst, I love what you&#39;ve done here, and why - congratulations on making it this far!A few suggestions:1) An independent web route is important, but you could lower the friction even further with browser plugins.  Like you, for general articles I use push-to-kindle[0] which only needs two clicks - no copy/paste, etc.2) Have you also thought about including a copy of the original article  - so that in a single download, there&#39;s the article followed by the HN discussion, all accessible from the document&#39;s index?3) I could see this developing further as a productivity tool via subscription - maybe I set up an account with you and then receive a digest of the day&#39;s top-10 (or 20, whatever) articles and discussions.  Or a weekly digest? Might be a powerful way to divert people away from the regular distraction of HN, but still allow consumption.Good luck :)[0] https://www.fivefilters.org/push-to-kindle/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just signed up for a year to try it out. A few things: 1) The way you get the kindle email address is slick, but some people might get squicked out from a privacy standpoint because you are scraping information from a logged in Amazon account. Perhaps present an obvious option for the user to input the kindle email address. 2) There is no share functionality with the iOS app - I understand that there is an extension in safari itself, but I should be able to pass the app via the share button - this is how all these kind of services do this (P2K, Share to Kindle, Evernote, Joplin, Dropbox, Day One - etc.) You are the first service to use a safari extension to share webpages that I have come across. The upside of using the share functionality, is that any browser can access your service - not just safari users. 3) Cleaning up documents on the Kindle is a PIA. Consider bundling - or giving the option to bundle them into a &#34;book&#34;. Maybe two options - add to my periodic (weekly/daily) &#34;book&#34; and another option to send an article immediately. 4) Most people are not going to spend 50 bucks for an annual subscription to try something out for a bit - consider offering monthly subscriptions. Hope this helps!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If that idea of your lifetime not being enough is stressing you out, Dr David Burns&#39; work on cognitive behavioural therapy might help. Saying you want to be an expert in many things because you are interested in many things could be papering over some deeper anxiety-driven motivations around &#39;not being good enough&#39; or &#39;not being worthy of respect&#39; or &#39;needing to prove yourself to someone&#39; or &#39;not wanting to be a nobody&#39; or &#39;wanting to avoid the bullying you used to get&#39; or etc. The Feeling Good podcast[1] is a good audio introduction and has many examples, his book Feeling Great is more of a self-help style written introduction.The important question is not &#34;what should I work on?&#34; or &#34;how should I decide and prioritise?&#34;, it is something more like &#34;I have thought processes, they model imaginary futures and guide me away from predicted harm. Why do I have an imaginary future of not being enough of an expert and feel suffering in the present? Where did that thought come from and what is it doing for me, and do I want to keep it?&#34;.You can go with the desire for expertise part, &#34;why do I need to be an expert in many things?&#34; - whose respect are you trying to earn? Whose criticism are you trying to avoid? Who are you trying to avoid being like? What emotional disaster is that trying to protect you from? Or the other side, &#34;what is so bad if I am not an expert in many things on my deathbed?&#34;, what&#39;s imagined social or emotional harm is that warning me of?[1] https://feelinggood.com/list-of-feeling-good-podcasts/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I let my natural curiosity guide me. I used to beat myself up about not being one of those people who have a singular purpose, someone who focuses deeply in one area, but found solace in Susan Fowler&#39;s blog post:&#34;All of the really great people of the past and of the present always have some singular destiny. Somehow they know exactly what they love, they find it when they&#39;re young, and they spend their entire lives doing that one thing. Their destiny, their singular passion becomes their entire life, and they love every minute of it. It&#39;s their calling, it&#39;s what they were born to do, and it&#39;s beautiful.&#34;...&#34;People tell me I can&#39;t do all the things I want to do, and they are of course wrong, because I can and I do and I will. But I still can&#39;t ever reach my greatest, deepest, most secret goal, the goal I left off that list: to have a singular passion. Maybe that&#39;s ok. Maybe my life will always be about running toward that unattainable goal, trying and loving everything I find along the way. And maybe at the end, when I have to give an account of my life, I&#39;ll say that I never was anything, but I was everything.&#34;Source: https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2017/5/21/life-without-a-d..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Four Thousand Weeks is a good book that touches on this. It begins with the premise that most people have infinite desires, and all people have finite time, and it&#39;s unlikely you will accomplish even 1% of all of your dreams in your finite life. It then talks about how that&#39;s okay, because what we choose to spend our time and attention on is what makes us unique and interesting, and explores some ways to prioritize the things that are most important to youm so that you actually do those things."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I do a small trick that seems to work wonders (at least for me).I don&#39;t limit myself at all. When I want to do any activity that seems to be dopamine-fuelling (emails, HN, Reddit, Stripe, other metrics, even company Intercom), I just have to set a timer to certain duration. I can reset, snooze, or extend durations however I want. No rules. Just the action of setting a timer.Oddly it has made myself way more conscious and intentional. Resulting in almost no actual distractions when I do want to focus. Technical tricks (blocking apps, websites, or DNS) are unfortunately too gimmicky because it&#39;s so easy to bypass. And personally I had no results with those."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s worth remembering that what works for John Carmack may not work for you.You may have more distractions in life or job that you cannot get rid of.Your baseline innate ability to focus may be very different.You may have less experience training the skills required to focus.Watching how successful people do things can provide useful inspiration for things to try, but you have to apply your own critical thinking and find what works for you."</p>

License the source explicitly for non commercial use only, then offer a commercial use licensed product (plus support, usually) for a fee. If there is a big community of hobbyists in the relevant field who do the same thing in their dayjob, I think this works well.Edit: A more open source version of this is to GPL the source and offer a more commercial friendly licensed product for a fee.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a concept sitting in &lt;that folder with all the ideas&gt; that is pretty high on my list of &#34;man, I want to make this happen&#34; but would need a team to execute on.The idea is to integrate the kickstarter model with github&#39;s issues (specifically, feature requests).  You run an open-source project and people can submit feature requests that come with a fundraising campaign.When someone wants the software to do something new (support a new platform, implement an interface, etc) they draft a campaign a la kickstarter, someone who can contribute to the project negotiates with the drafter pricing, targets, and stretch goals.Past this point, it&#39;s the drafter&#39;s responsibility to do the marketing for the campaign and raise funds.  Once the target $ amount is hit, it&#39;s on the person who picked up the contract to get the work done.There are, of course, a ton of details to work out, and executing on this is going to be resource-intense on a number of vectors that aren&#39;t necessarily technical (legal, finance, hosting costs).  Also, I suck at UI.  The business itself would naturally be a non-profit.addendum:  I also have a day job that I have no intention of leaving, so factor that in to time-to-completion."</p>
