								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Thanks so much for posting this, I love the spirit of it. I&#39;m passionate about my sobriety journey. I just got home from a dinner party of ex coworkers and friends. Being the only one not drinking is hard for me and a huge change. I used to lead the charge with booze, it was the thing that took my crushing anxiety away. It made everything more fun. Well, that can only last so long when you abuse it so much and it fucks up your life.I successfully made it through tonight and will hopefully have many more successful nights. Love and strength to anyone else out there in a similar boat."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hello from Astana, Kazakhstan. I just spent wonderful night playing World of Warcraft, coding some lua addon for it and tinkering with VPS. It&#39;s Sunday&#39;s morning and I&#39;m going to prepare more coffee. Now I need to endure till the evening so I can actually attend work at Monday with proper schedule. At work I&#39;m working on creating an ECG device which hopefully will be useful and cheap for local hospitals. And some other projects which are more boring.Have a good day or night or whatever time you&#39;re happening to have around."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My father passed away about 3 weeks ago, and the current thing that I am passionate about is setting myself up to be and stay doing things that would make him proud and honor his memoryWhen I say I was close with my dad, that doesnt even scratch the surface. Im 24, and I can think of maybe three weeks worth of days across my entire life where I didnt talk to him (and most of those were solo camping without cell service). Me and that man would do everything together, talk every day, share ideas, the works.I dont want his death to be the end of my relationship with my dad, so I am currently making changes in myself that he would want to see: less soda, more exercise, more social interactions, keeping up on my health conditions more, etc. As well as doing things that I think honor his idea: trying to catalogue all of the family assets like pictures, audio recordings, letters, stories; making sure that I am not holding on to crap, and then actively protecting the good stuff I am holding on to; living every day in a way that I think is on par with his high but reasonable expectations of me as if he were still here.I hope that as long as I live I never stop missing him or living as if he is always watching. At the end of the day, I think possibly his greatest wish for me would be to live in a way that would always make him proud, because the things he would be proud of me for are both things that I can be proud of myself for, and things that EVERYONE should be proud of."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The &#34;affinity cursor&#34; is a really lovely innovation. Most HTML/DOM/contenteditable based rich text editors end up adding support for virtual cursors that enable you to have the insertion cursor somewhere that the native browser cursor hasn&#39;t got support for (next to a floating image, end of a table row). Effectively this is what this is doing.Internally the inline formatting will be marked as tags in a rage, exactly like html. Essentially there is a possible cursor position both inside and outside a formatting tag, but both appear as the same visual location on the screen. This is such a lovely way to indicate the difference.So with this code:  Something &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt;

There are two cursor positions that are visually the same place:  Something |&lt;b&gt;|bold&lt;/b&gt;
            ^   ^

Most editors &#34;jump&#34; over one of those positions to hide the implementation detail from users. This idea exposes it with a little tail on the cursor."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m Bike&#39;s developer. Thanks everyone for the comments.While I have the eyeballs I hope you don&#39;t mind me asking...I&#39;m in process of adding autocomplete to Bike. Problem is that I generally find macOS autocomplete painful and unpredictable. I both disable it and have many typos. I&#39;m not talking so much about the suggestions, but about the surrounding UI.I&#39;m looking for ideas/links for how to make autocomplete better and more predictable. I know Mac apps, I do know much else. What are your favorite autocomplete implementations past or present? If you could have a &#34;fixed&#34; macOS autocompletion what would it look like?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very nice. I love these little innovations, it’s exactly the type of design ideas that makes me want to try an app.I wonder if it’s an intentional easter egg that the keyboard shortcuts in the popover spell out “bischl”… which is more than a little reminiscent of “bicycle”. (Could improve it by replacing “h” for “highlight” with “y” for “yellow”: “bisycl”.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The claim: reduces CO₂e emissions by up to 80%*The asterisk: water boiling phase excludedWhen I boil pasta, I use full heat to get the water boiling, drop in the pasta, then let it come back up to a boil, then drop the temperature as low as possible to keep a slow boil going--about medium-low.Guesstimating that the boil takes about as long as the time to cook the pasta, I&#39;d say that the pasta cooking portion only takes up about 1/3 of the energy of the total (cold pot to cooked pasta).The 80% savings only covers the pasta cooking phase, so overall, it&#39;s only saving 4/15 or 27% (roughly). If you use a lot more water, then that initial boil time further reduces your savings."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"According to Kenji, you don&#39;t even need boiling water to cook pasta:https://www.seriouseats.com/how-to-cook-pasta-salt-water-boi...https://www.seriouseats.com/tips-for-better-easier-pasta&#34;Want to get even more crazy efficient? Try soaking pasta in water as your prep your other ingredients. By the time your sauce is ready, you can just add the pasta (along with some of its soaking liquid) to the pan and, with a minute or so of cooking, your meal will be ready to go. One less pot to clean and a pretty satisfying magic trick to boot. Still skeptical? Here&#39;s the science to back it all up. The one exception here is fresh pasta—because it contains eggs, it needs to cook in boiling water to set properly.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Backpackers have been using this technique to save fuel - I&#39;ve got a cozy for my cookpot.I also remember seeing this on one of the Victorian Farm shows - it was something like a pot roast brought to a boil in the morning, then put in a well insulated container to sit for the day.Edit: Whoa, I just clicked through to &#34;The Product&#34; section, and it&#39;s an open source design using an Arduino. Super cool!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Long-time Vim/NeoVim user here...about 20 or so years with it being my daily driver for the last 8. As soon as I found Helix, I was unsure whether it would become my new editor, but I&#39;ve been using it every day for a few months and haven&#39;t really looked back. The only thing I still use Vim for is `vimdiff` with Git, but I don&#39;t think I need to, just been lazy about configuring Helix to do the same thing.Helix does everything I need, nothing I don&#39;t, and I don&#39;t have to learn a bunch of esoteric syntax. It&#39;s a great editor for people new to the world of shell editing, and I highly suggest trying it out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing I really liked about it was the UI experience where as soon as you typed the first character of some sequence it started showing you all the other option starting with the same character. (Try pressing space or Ctr-w in Normal mode)
It made the whole thing far more explorable and I really thought it was a good experience although clearly not yet on par with something as fully mature as vim (but also with far less technical baggage).The first thing I did on my vim setup was installing an extension which gave me very similar command completions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a huge fan of Helix, use it everyday. LSP works out of the box(if you install it with a package manager, otherwise you need to do a bit of config) .My configuration file has 5 lines or so, great defaults. No need for overly complicated configuration, or installing dozens of plugins, etc.. Did I mentioned is crazy fast? Opens in ms, and everything feels very snappy. The only thing I noticed, when I use it with tmux, the colorscheme get reverted, dunno if that is a tmux issue or not. But in general, great editor, thanks to the authors."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It seems to me yet another confirmation that there is no man (or woman) for all seasons and all situations.Musk looks like the disorganized mess he&#39;s making at Twitter, the kind of &#34;visionary&#34; we&#39;ve all had to work with and who has sucked the will to live out of us: unreasonable expectations, constant changes of trajectory, the feeling that one well-spent night or one too many drinks for them would make our lives heaven or hell.Zuck is spending billions on a bet that, frankly, seems like nothing more than a nerd&#39;s dream. I am cautious in my observation, and I think it is a caution shared by many, for who could have predicted the adoption of the automobile, the personal computer, the internet, the smartphone, social media?
And so much leeway is given to this case as well, forgetting that other supposed &#34;manifest destinies&#34; of technology, such as flying cars and robotic sex dolls, have gone by the wayside partly because of technical limitations and partly because, in the end, no one cares about them, either for now or forever.But we have seen the same ups and downs in many historical figures, the Churchills, the Napoleons, the Einsteins, who, after proving themselves to be brilliant as well as favored by the stars, failed to repeat later what gave them notoriety, success and admiration. Perhaps they ran out of luck, perhaps no one had the courage to tell them that it was time for retirement."</p>

Insanity."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I still, after all these years, hold the belief that facebook failed to innovate because the engineering interview is based on memorization. Having worked with those types of engineers, they can absolutely build exactly what is needed. But abstract and engaging product vision does not come easily with them. Outsourcing that capability to an attractive and charismatic product manager can never close that gap."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Having worked with a lot of instrumentation and control stuff, I really, really like RS-232. It just works. I made the mistake on one project to go all USB, and it was a complete nightmare. Basically, anything you can think of went wrong, from USB controllers maxing out on number of devices (despite the number of devices being a mere fraction of the allowed devices in the USB spec), devices causing other devices not to work if on the same hub, devices disconnecting, etc. I couldn&#39;t even get manufacturers to tell me how many USB devices their USB controller supported. I often had to use tools like USB Device Tree Viewer (https://www.uwe-sieber.de/usbtreeview_e.html) to understand what was going on. There was another USB debug tool that I used that I&#39;ve forgotten the name of (maybe USBDeview). And if USB devices disconnect, the only way to guarantee getting back to them is to restart the OS process, which makes your software very fragile. Same thing with cameras with USB vs something like Camera Link. A camera&#39;s USB driver crashing would make you restart your entire program, making it very hard to build systems. Camera Link, another serial protocol, also just works.RS-232 and RS-485 are just so reliable. The higher voltage of +/-12V makes it more resilient to noise, and the protocols are just simple. It isn&#39;t the fastest around, but it can still be pretty fast depending on how the protocols are implemented."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yesterday I was configuring a usb to serial converter to communicate with a CNC controller (over RS232). However I was unable to transmit any data and so I brought the oscilloscope to see what was happening. I disconnected my converter and connected the oscilloscope and all the data was there and my oscilloscope had no problems decoding it with the same parameters i had used with my usb converter. Confused, I disconnected my scope and connected my converter back up again, but sill nothing. After a few times back an fourth I ended up connecting my scope up while the converter was still connected and crucially I also had a cat /dev/ttyUSB0 running and as expected the data was right there at the scope, but to my big surprise it was also there in my terminal! I then tried to disconnect my scope resulting in no more data being sent to my laptop.The only explanation I could think of was a faulty ground connection. The scope was grounded through the wall socket same as the CNC and thus had the same ground potential. My laptop on the other hand was running on battery and only shared ground with the CNC through RS232 pin 5 (signal ground). However it seems this pin was not correctly connected on the CNC side and thus I was unable to transmit any data. Experimenting a bit I tried to connect ground to the connector shield instead and everything worked perfectly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of my proudest hacker moments was also one of 
my first: debugging a noisy console session whose transport was RS232.Long story short (it was 30 years ago so I also can’t remember the precise diagnosis) there was corruption on the line in that sometimes when you typed a space it would come out as something random.  Few other characters were corrupted as often, if at all.  It was almost always spaces that were showing up as random other characters.My observation was that space was encoded as 00000 — all low, the printed character  most susceptible to line noise — and that something wasn’t grounded.  Smarter people took my observation, figured out what was wrong, and soon all was fixed.  It felt like, for the first time, I understood the system with a depth I’d not had before.  It was cool.Oh, and playing DOOM for the first time over RS232, too.  Another precious memory indeed!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I know lines of code as a measure of productivity has been criticized to death here and elsewhere but today I went and did some analysis on past two years of my team members contributions and saw the team members that I know they are productive are modifying code a ton more than others. It can be subtraction of code too but overall more changes correlated with my perception of their contributions. My perception is pretty informed because I&#39;m their manager and I know this team and this code base very well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That was almost exactly what happened to me a couple of years ago. The company hired a terrible guy with an architect title. What he did was some really simple 3rd party integration sending some transaction details to an accounting provider. Instead of reading from db, he decided to intercept those before saving to db coz some of those were not saved at all (only a problem for accounting, but most of the customers did not use accounting providers anyway). So, he spent over a year on that and moved on to another project. I took the project over and lots of complaints from beta testing customers. My manager and I spoke to him about it and never get anywhere. &#34;Look, I can spend another year on this, and it might never really work. How about let me scrap his sh*t and start over?&#34; I proposed. Months later, green light I got. So I deleted all his code solely for that part, around 5k lines and replaced with merely ~300 lines, never had an issue since then. Soon we hired a new Product Lead, the first thing he did was asking how many lines code we wrote in the past year. Errr, okay, so I pulled out stats from source control. Ouch, it was minus ~3k lines."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Allow me to play devil&#39;s advocate for a moment:Most good writers will tell you that shorter is almost always better. You want to express your thoughts in the most succinct way possible. Review your own writing to remove as much as you can, then hand your draft off to an editor who&#39;ll try to cut even more.And yet, many writers are still paid by the word, and many book contracts still specify target page counts. Because even though shorter is better, the shortest possible length of a given text still serves as a rough measure of that text&#39;s breath and complexity.Is code any different?Yes, paying or evaluating programmers by lines of code is going to lead to misaligned incentives. However, I&#39;m not convinced the dynamic is any worse than for prose. Bill Atkinson spent a week removing extraneous code from QuickDraw; an author might spend a week cutting extraneous subplots from a novel. Word count is still a useful metric for the author.Perhaps the difference is that non-writers tend to be more familiar with the writing process than non-programmers are with coding. If an author was working on revising a novel, no one would ask them how many words they&#39;d written that week.Or maybe word count measurements are in fact making everyone&#39;s prose worse and we should do away with them too."</p>
