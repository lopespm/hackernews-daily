Surely these curation and archivist domain experts record this stuff. I&#39;ve casually asked a few times, but no leads.--My partner likes to create master copies. Portrait, still life.I&#39;ve ordered fine art prints of dozens of originals. Always frustrating. I just get one of every option (matte, gloss, each type of medium). And let my partner pick the one that seems to match most closely. (Then I give away the extras as &#39;just because&#39; gifts, which people seem to like.)"</p>

If you start the sentence with: &#34;A 5+ year government IT project that cost over 100 million-&#34; I already know how the story ends.How do we improve this common scenario? What are the root causes?The common themes are:1. Lack of technical project competence at the decision maker level.2. Scope creep. Where the one true system has to do everything.3. A &#39;one-pass&#39; approach where everything is expected to be delivered as a working system at the end of the project.Even fixing two of these gives us a solid shot at a successful project."</p>

The fact that employees lose stock options when they unionize isn&#39;t so much a threat as it is a fact about how unions work because historically unions are against any kind of incentive or merit pay so they refuse options as compensation.  It is a fact that UAW hasn&#39;t negotiated options as part of the pay for it&#39;s members at any of the other companies where it represents workers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I use https://nearlyfreespeech.net for my static site.It isn&#39;t free -- it is pretty cheap -- but it has a lot going for it. It requires no custom tooling -- I upload via rsync. This makes it trivial to migrate to a new provider if necessary.I develop my site locally, then rsync it up. I have a custom domain pointed at the site, and also a custom .htaccess, so I have a good amount of control over the site. I do things like serve html without the .html filetype in the url; e.g. https://zck.org/emacsconf2020 is stored on the server as emacsconf2020.html . (I do this so Emacs recognizes the files as html, but keeps the urls clean).It&#39;s a nice tool if you want to get a little involved in your setup, without getting wrapped up in proprietary tooling. It does charge for what you use, so it&#39;s not a great site if you are going to host Blu-ray images that get downloaded from everyone on HN."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve tried Github pages, Netlify, and Cloudflare Pages. Moved last night to the latter.Github pages is fine, but the extra gh-pages branch is kind of annoying. It&#39;s fairly clear (for obvious reasons) that they mainly think about Jekyll users, though I had a Hugo blog there for a while.Netlify sounds great, but in practice I ran into an annoying issue that I couldn&#39;t resolve where I had to rerun every automatic build.  This probably isn&#39;t really their fault but the forums didn&#39;t work.Cloudflare Pages kind of just worked out of the box, and since I was already using it for my DNS, changing where the domain pointed took a few seconds.I&#39;d suspect, if you corrected for how many issues were particular to me, I&#39;d say Cloudflare Pages ~ Netlify &gt; Github Pages. I&#39;m kind of surprised the latter charges you for custom domains; I do have to say there&#39;s more documentation for Github than any of the others."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hosting a personal blog on old / cheap hardware at home and accepting some downtime now and then should be a trade-of worth making for most. An interconnected web of documents served from personal computers residing under a desk or in a basement – it is a beautiful thing.We nerds often seem to fall into the trap of over-engineering things, like, spending a lot of time building personal stuff that can scale into the infinity – only to end up never having more than 10 concurrent visitors at any given time.By accepting and embracing the intermittent and slightly unstable nature of serving websites from our homes, we can take back much of the in(ter)dependence and hacky, quirky fun that many of us fondly remember from the 90&#39;s and 2000&#39;s.Setting up a webserver on a Pi and serving it from home can be a fun project, not necessarily trivial for everyone, but definitely within reach for most technically inclined people.Might be among the cheapest, easiest AND fun ways to host a static site :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s not just Qualcomm it&#39;s closed source driver blobs in general.Even if your CPU might still be supported your other hardware might not. A common offender is camera drivers as far as I know and while you sometimes can still make the camera work it often comes with noticeable decreased quality (as the special patent encumbered closed source image post processing sausage is missing).Besides that potential but as far as I know less likely  offenders include the modem.Ironically both might be integrated into the SoC which then massively increases the chance for problems."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s mind-boggling to me that Qualcomm only guarantees 2-3 years of support for their chipset. Compare that to the PC processor space, how much does AMD/Intel provide? 10 years? More?Somehow people seem to be running on 15 year-old Thinkpads without a problem, yet a $1000 phone apparently can&#39;t scrape by for more than three years due to vendor support?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Congratulations to Fairphone. This sounds like a massive task especially for such a small team. I run a Fairphone 3 and I couldn&#39;t be happier. Sure it was on the pricy side but it&#39;s served me well, takes great photos, has survived numerous drops (the phone protector shipped with it is great), looks cool,strikes up interesting conversations now and then, and will apparently have Android updates well into the future. Fairphone&#39;s a great company shipping a great product. Well worth the investment!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t think that this is the answer to &#34;only google can crawl the web&#34;. This is a huge archive suitable for making a web search engine maybe.What if you want to make a simple link previewer? An abstract crawler for scientific articles? Most websites are behind cloudflare which will block/captcha you, but happily whitelist only google &amp; major social sites. Tha answer is measures that bring the web back to basics, not this over-SEOed bot infested ecosystem. FANGS succeeded in sucking out all the information of the web, but they suck at creating protocols that are interoperable (even twitter now needs its own tags!).Incidentally, maybe the next search engine should use a push-system , where websites will ping to it whenever they have updates. If the engine has unique features, it might be actually seen as a measure to reduce the loads from bots."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good resource, admirable intention, great that it simply exists. Good sized index.I see a lot of people subscribe to the idea of this being the feeder to alternative search engines.I&#39;d guess part of the problem with doing things this way is the &#39;crawl priority&#39; of what the search engine thinks are the next best pages to crawl, it&#39;s totally out of their hands or at least, they&#39;d still need to crawl on top of the Common Crawl data.The recent UK CMA report into monopolies in online advertising estimated Google&#39;s index to be around 500-600 billion pages in size and Bing&#39;s to be 100-200 billion pages in size [0]. Of course, what you define as a &#39;page&#39; is subjective given URL canonicals and page similarity.At the very least, the common crawl gets around crawl rate limiting problems by being one massive download.Would be interesting to know if there&#39;s an appreciable % of site owners blocking it, though going on past data (there is some data in the UK CMA about this also), it&#39;s not a huge issue.[0] https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5efc57ed3a6f4...

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article seems to be saying that it&#39;s reasonable to expect that google should avoid reporting or fixing security vulnerabilities being actively exploited by the US government, and this isn&#39;t something that should make other counties consider Google to be working as an agent for the US government and therefore deserving of being blocked or sanctioned.By the same token should we we also consider it reasonable for companies Huawei to avoid fixing security vulnerabilities being exploited by governments like China and not consider them to be deserving of having importation of their products blocked on this basis?I don&#39;t think other countries would necessarily want to use google products if they are intentionally leaving security vulnerabilities open, so maybe it is better that all companies fix all security vulnerabilities they find?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a lot of words to say that Google found and caused the patching of security exploits in consumer devices such as Safari, iPhones and Android phones.And the users of the exploits were a state actor that was friendly to the USA.Which is effectively saying that wanting vulnerable software is a patriotic thing.Especially calling it a &#34;counter terrorism&#34; operation. Where did the author of the article get that information from?It seems like a hit piece."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To me, this is not a difficult decision or a debate.Allowing vulnerabilities to remain open/undisclosed because your government approves of them... for one thing, they aren&#39;t only useable by your government/allies, you don&#39;t know who else knows about them.Our government&#39;s approach of finding security vulnerabilities and keeping them for their own use (instead of responsibly reporting them to get fixed) puts all our security in danger. There isn&#39;t much we can do about that (except, well, try to use our &#34;democracy&#34; to get the government to behave differently).But in USA at least, private citizens can&#39;t generally be compelled to cooperate.If engineers at a private company find a vulnerability, it should be responsibly dealt with to fix it. No matter who else knows about it or may be taking advantage of it.I think it is unethical for a software engineer to do or go along with anything else."</p>
