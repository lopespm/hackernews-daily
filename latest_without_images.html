					<h3><a href="https://nomdebebe.app/">Show HN: My wife is pregnant; naturally I made a baby-name app to prepare</a></h3>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This will be our second kid, and at least for us figuring out a name that we both love is hard. There are literally tons of baby-name apps out there, most of them more fully-featured and polished than Nom de Bébé and you should probably use one of those. However a lot of them include a disturbing amount of tracking or for any number of reasons just didn&#39;t work for my wife and I (bugs, subscriptions, lack of names, etc). So in continuing the tradition of &#34;An app can be a home-cooked meal&#34; [1], I built my own for us to use. You&#39;re welcome to use it too.[1]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22332629"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My baby naming days are long in my past. I have two daughters of 14 and 12. Their names where a real challenge. My wife and I lost our first child. It would have been a boy. We had chosen for the name Roan. We where of course devastated. A part of me was also very sad for loosing the name. If the second would also be a boy we could no longer give it this beautiful name. We knew the second would become a girl and we wanted to include the name Roan in it. After really long puzzling we came to the name: Norah. It contains all letters or Roan and an added H. Something for her specifically. When we had our third we wanted to do this again. Norah was already at the daycare by then and played a lot with a child called Roos. Somehow we liked the combination but it did not contain all the letters or Roan. After some thinking we settled on Rosanne and we call her Roos (that&#39;s Rose in English). So her name does contain all the letters of Roan and extra.I like the idea but I am unable to have any more kidsCongrats one your pregnancy and I wish you the best of luck."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s something about picking the names for your kids that is just so fun and special. For those of you for whom this app may be relevant, I hope you have even half as much fun as my wife and I did picking names.Ever since my wife was little, she had a particular name chosen for her son. So when we got pregnant, we already knew what the boy name would be. But we had fun coming up with a girl name, and that fun was both serious fun imagining a world in which we&#39;d have a Megan or a Lily or a Lydia or whatever, and it was also very playful and ridiculous. We would one-up each other with what we thought were ridiculous names that just don&#39;t make sense (given our language, culture, etc.).So then our son was born, and she got her wish for the name she&#39;s always wanted. Then when we got pregnant again, we got to go through the fun a second time around. One day, when my dad was over and was playing with our toddler, my wife and I were joking about silly names. &#34;What about X if it&#39;s a girl? What about Y if it&#39;s a boy?&#34; I got a call that night from my mom, very concerned.&#34;Have... have you decided on baby names? ... What did you decide?&#34; I told her the two names we had (seriously) decided on. &#34;Oh. Your father thought he heard some very bizarre names that you were thinking about.&#34; We had to explain our little game to her so she understood the situation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Pfizer’s phase 2/3 trial randomized non-hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients who were at high risk of progressing to severe illness to receive placebo or Paxlovid, a combination of the protease inhibitors  PF-07321332 and ritonavir. The efficacy analysis is based on 1,219 patients.One noteworthy feature is the newness of this drug:&gt; PF-07321332 was developed from scratch during the current pandemic. It’s a reversible covalent inhibitor that reacts with one of the main protease’s cysteine residues. Owen [director of medicinal chemistry at Pfizer] also discussed the chemistry involved in scaling up the compound. The first 7 mg of the compound were synthesized in late July 2020. Encouraged by the early biological data, the Pfizer team aimed to scale up the synthesis. By late October, they’d made 100 g of the compound. Just two weeks later, the chemists had scaled up the synthesis to more than 1 kg. Owen said 210 researchers had worked on the project.https://cen.acs.org/acs-news/acs-meeting-news/Pfizer-unveils...Less than two years from lab to clinic is highly unusual. If approved, I believe this would be the fastest lab-to-approval for a small molecule drug in the history of the FDA."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think it’s hard to overstate what a big deal this is for science. This is a completely novel molecule that appears effective as an antiviral. This would a huge achievement for the field of drug design, and will hopefully lead to all kinds of great medicine."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; As a protease inhibitor, Paxlovid is free from the theoretical DNA-alteration risk tied to the mechanism of action of Merck’s molnupiravir.This is the line I was looking for. Not that I know how protease inhibitor works, but looks more like a traditional anti-viral approach v.s. the potentially DNA altering molnupiravir."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the under appreciated legal precedents set a couple years ago was the Ohio V AmEx anti trust case. The case predicated against AmEx’s merchant contract forbidding merchants to steer customers away from using their Amex card. This was a common practice for many years, especially at restaurants since AmEx charged restaurants 6%.The Supreme Court ruled that amex was able to keep the anti-steering provision in merchant contracts because they defined credit cards as a two sided market, and the harm to customers couldn’t be proven. In essence, the Supreme Court set a precedent that in any 2 sided market, in order for something to be considered anti competitive, a high bar needed to be met: the government must show that both sides of a 2 sided market be harmed in order for something to be anti competitive.Had the ruling been the other way, almost every industry would have been impacted- Uber, App Stores, Advertising…etc are all 2 sided markets.In essence, Credit cards have had a huge impact to our lives this century for reasons that are not appreciated enough."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; It’s often forgotten, but prior to credit cards, many Main Street retailers like e.g. pharmacies maintained hundreds or thousands of credit accounts for customers individually, necessitating their own back offices, accounting, and collections headache.This article is a great history of how the modern credit card came into being https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/magazine/19..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Debit cards are a very similar product with enough under-the-hood differences that they deserve their own moment in the sun. In particular, due to a quirk of U.S. interchange regulation, they basically fund most of the fintech industryBasically, the Durbin Amendment caps interchange on debit cards at a far, far lower rate than credit cards; they also have different networks (not MC or Visa) that can be run at least for in person transactions. However, the limit does not apply to banks with less than $10 billion in assets.This is why some online banks can offer lower fees and sometimes even debit cash back (1% is the most I&#39;ve seen though, so not competitive with credit). But its also why ever fintech under the sun pushes debit cards so heavily--the debit card is issued by a (small, non Durbin-covered) partner bank who then shares revenue with the fintech company.At the end of the day, credit cards are still significant better for customers. You can have multiple cards with different benefits while keeping all your money in one place, and you can prevent overdrafts because you don&#39;t have random subscriptions taking out unpredictable amounts of money in the middle of the night and causing a check to bounce the next day. You are no longer obsessing over &#34;early payday&#34; features or ACH speeds.Credit cards also provide a nice hack to allow cash deposit for those with only online banks--you can often use a big bank&#39;s ATM to make a payment towards the credit card, allowing you to get rid of ordinary amounts of cash."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Helion hasn&#39;t published the triple product results for their latest Trenta reactor, but for the previous Venti they achieved a triple product of ~10^19 keV.s/m^3 at an ion temperature of 2 keV. The Trenta reactor has achieved an ion temperature of 9 keV. For D-T fusion, you need a triple product of about 3x10^21 kev.s/m^3 at 10 keV. For the D-He reaction that helion intends to use, they need to achieve a similar triple product at 50 keV. So it looks like they&#39;re still 2-3 orders of magnitude off from where they need to be to achieve ignition. Their neutron production rate is comparable to industrial fusors at ~10^11 n/s, which while useful as neutron sources are nowhere near producing net power. Compare this with tokamaks that have achieved a triple product around 1.5x10^21 keV.s/m^3, or about half of what they need to achieve ignition.While it&#39;s possible that helion has made improvements to ion density and confinement allowing them to achieve a significantly higher triple product and close the gap to power production, I see no reason why a company looking for investment would hide such a result, especially while putting out press releases celebrating other milestones. I doubt they&#39;re anywhere near the point where an economical plant could even be considered, though I&#39;d love to be proven wrong."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is the type of investing one (at least me) dreams of doing if you&#39;re fortunate enough to get to $B+ in net worth. Sam knows enough people who knows how this tech works to get a read on quality / achievability, and if he gets it right (however challenging/unlikely), it means incredible things. If it doesn&#39;t work, whatever -- at least he&#39;s shooting at something interesting. And talk about something intellectually interesting to be involved with -- it must be a collection of great minds at this company."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The DoE is complicit in this as well (from the original article):&gt; In the letter to teachers, Education Commissioner Margie Vandeven said “an individual took the records of at least three educators, unencrypted the source code from the webpage, and viewed the social security number (SSN) of those specific educators.”&gt; But in the press release, DESE called the person who discovered the vulnerability a “hacker” and said that individual “took the records of at least three educators”This squares perfectly with my own experience. As a middle schooler I had several interactions with my school system&#39;s IT department where they baselessly accused me of hacking and malicious intent; I responsibly disclosed a method of bypassing their web content filter and they responded by going through my roaming profile and leveling charges at me of &#34;remotely hacking computer systems&#34; because of a screenshot of a terminal emulator they found. I was a good kid with a perfect disciplinary record. In retrospect it was a series of incompetent staffers covering for their inability by bullying a child.The US needs to stop using public facilities (schools, the military, etc) as white-collar welfare and hire more people that actually care. Ignorance is forgivable but when combined with a steadfast opposition to personal growth it becomes malicious. It&#39;d be better for society to fire clowns like these and administer them unemployment than to have them crowd out those that actually give a shit.*EDIT: To clarify for anybody that would read the above as &#34;government workers don&#39;t care&#34;: there are plenty that do. I break bread with them and want them to be able to do their jobs unimpeded by the ones that _don&#39;t_."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Previous thread from 3 weeks ago: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28867562Recent developments:- The CS professor whose expert opinion was quoted by the newspaper article is demanding an apology and legal expenses from the state, alleging that the governor defamed and violated his free speech rights.- The governor&#39;s political fundraising committee is running ads making this a &#34;fake news&#34; issue.The email that the reporter sent, in advance of publishing the article revealing the state education website&#39;s data leakage:&gt; “I recently discovered a significant exposure of the sensitive data of more than 100,000 teachers on a DESE website,” Renaud wrote to the agency’s communications chief, Mallory McGowin. “At this point I am confident what I found is a genuine vulnerability — I have confirmed with three teachers from different districts that their data was exposed. I also have consulted an UMSL cybersecurity researcher who verified my findings. The P-D plans to publish a story about this sensitive data exposure, but we wanted to inform DESE first so that you would have a chance to mitigate the problem.”&gt; Renaud shared his timeline for publishing the story and asked for interviews with officials from DESE and the Missouri Office of Administration’s Information Technology Services Division. In a second email sent about 45 minutes later, he described the steps he’d taken in finding and confirming the vulnerability."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The governor&#39;s stance is just posture. &#34;We take these matters seriously&#34;.It reminds me of that time, a few years after I was out of college and into a job. My professor contacted me to demo my class project to her students. To give them an idea of what they can do with web development. Her assistant told me that they couldn&#39;t figure out how to run it.Of course, I took a day off from work, opened back up my school project, fixed the annoying bug. The web page required IIS to run so I could make Ajax requests. I decided to hardcode the data in json instead. So I went to school to present my project.The professor was double clicking the file and it wasn&#39;t displaying properly. I inserted my USB stick, and ran it from there instead. The coral reef restaurant website appeared on the big screen. I explained that I had to make some changes so it would work locally. Before, I was using a web server.&#34;Web server?&#34; she shouted. &#34;You are not allowed to use a web server. So you guys cheated!&#34;At first, I thought she was just kidding. I explained that Chapter 12 specifically asks to boot up IIS in order to make use of Ajax. During my time, the rest of the class stopped at chapter 10. I completed the entire book because I was just in love with learning JavaScript. So unless you get to chapter 12, you don&#39;t learn about Ajax.&#34;I&#39;ll have to report you. They board might revoke your grade. Not just you but all your group.&#34;You can only imagine how pale I became. But I understood what was happening. She had tried to run the project multiple times and failed. She couldn&#39;t debug it or figure out the issue. To save face in front of the class, she accused me of having cheated. This is the exact thing the Missourians officials are doing.No, at the end of the day my grades were not revokes. Plus I had dropped out of college and was working in the field for a few couple years already. But it goes to show you the length people would go just to save face."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I used to lead Sys Eng for a FTSE 100 company. Our data was valuable but only for a short amount of time. We were constantly scraped which cost us in hosting etc. We even seen competitors use our figures (good ones used it to offset their prices, bad ones just used it straight).
As the article suggest, we couldn&#39;t block mobile operator IPs,  some had over 100k customers behind them. Forcing the users to login did little as the scrapers just created accounts. 
We had a few approaches that minimised the scraping:Rate Limiting by login,Limiting data to know workflows
...But our most fruitful effort was when we removed limits and started giving &#34;bad&#34; data. By bad I mean alter the price up or down by a small percentage. This hit them in the pocket but again, wasn&#39;t a golden bullet. If the customer made a transaction on the altered figure we we informed them and took it at the correct price.It&#39;s a cool problem to tackle but it is just an arms race."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s somewhat refreshing that the underlying bug isn&#39;t from some C or C++ utility, but instead a Perl program using eval: https://github.com/exiftool/exiftool/blob/11.70/lib/Image/Ex... Another instance of &#34;avoid eval as much as possible&#34; for languages that have it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like this article could have been far more useful with the following points being explicitly mentioned, or at least summarized:  - the problem appeared in GitLab 11.9.0
  - the problem seems to have been fixed in GitLab 13.8.8
  - the vulnerability uses ExifTool, so to exploit it, a user needs to be able to upload images
  - if an update is not (yet) possible, DjVu format file uploads can be blocked to avert this vulnerability
  - this vulnerability isn&#39;t relevant for GitLab instances that just have 1 user, or are not publicly accessible on the Internet

Now, i&#39;m not saying that the above is entirely true, but after reading something like the above, one should be able to figure out how to best act:  - if you have a public GitLab instance with open registrations, consider updating it immediately (with backups in place, of course)
  - if you have a private GitLab instance with many users in your own corporate network (that somehow isn&#39;t updated yet) - this is a good reason to put updating it into your agenda today, even if your users aren&#39;t necessarily hostile
  - if you have a private GitLab instance or one with registrations closed (e.g. you&#39;re the only user or people that you trust use it), mark this down and update whenever possible, however it&#39;s probably not necessary right this moment

Of course, i can&#39;t say the above with 100% confidence, because the article itself lacks this actionable information to aid in decisionmaking and so i&#39;m left to piece things together on my own, because of which i could be wrong.On an unrelated note, DjVu is a pretty interesting file format, though sadly i&#39;ve only seen it be used very sparsely, on some Russian forums for tractor manuals or something: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DjVu"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;..Bowling said he discovered a way to abuse how ExifTool handles uploads for DjVu file format used for scanned documents to gain control over the entire underlying GitLab web server&#34;Ah, the good old &#34;File upload vulnerability&#34;. File uploads remain one of the hardest problems to solve when it comes to security."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s encouraging seeing all the work going into making tagged unions a natural part of TS. I&#39;ve tried to introduce them multiple times, and have been shot down by my team on every attempt. I think they still come across as &#34;hacky,&#34; and more JS-minded people who are totally cool validating with if-else everywhere still can&#39;t appreciate the benefits of annotating data in this manner. I hope TS eventually arrives at a standard, low impact way to create and manipulate such structures; maybe more people will be on board then. It looks like we&#39;re moving in the right direction."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very nice!The very, very related thing I found myself wishing I had just today is the ability to destructure discriminated union fields which only exist on one component type of the union.As an example, with the following type system:    type Output = OutputExists | OutputDoesntExist;
    interface OutputExists { exists: true, url: string };
    interface OutputDoesntExist { exists: false };

The ability to destructure like:    const f = ({ exists, url }: Output) =&gt; {}

Such that, at the time of destructuring:    exists: true | false
    url: string | undefined

I believe, with this PR, if we re-structured the types above to:    interface OutputDoesntExist { exists: false, url: undefined };

That destructuring would be possible, with all the control flow analysis necessary to make it useful. Today, even that wouldn&#39;t be possible, so definitely excited for this change.But, I&#39;m curious if anyone knows if this change can extend to situations where a field isn&#39;t even defined in one of the unions, and the compiler can just insert an undefined type for those fields. Or, maybe this would have some unresolveable side-effects I&#39;m not considering."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing I&#39;m wondering: with all the bells and whistles and insanely complex things TS now supports, why does it still fail to catch seemingly simple mistakes?For instance, it&#39;s sooo easy to write a React component taking in another component as a prop and some props for that other component, to rendering it. But somehow lose the type safety of the props being passed in. Like, you write some generics and the compiler stops complaining inside your component. But if you go back out and then try to pass some weird props instead, it doesn&#39;t care. I feel it&#39;s too easy to write code that looks tyoe safe but subtly isn&#39;t."</p>
