								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think Firefox news is what I comment most on here. I don&#39;t know why. Well I guess I do. Web browsers, javascript etc is front and center here - which somewhat means the digital world. All my friends use Chrome, and think I&#39;m weird. I think _they_ are. They care about human rights, at least I think they do. But, having Google, an ad company, dictate how our window to the digital world looks like, is now _way worse_ than what Microsoft with IE6 ever did. They had their share, but nothing compared to this. At least Microsoft was just a software company.If a class of people on a forum such as this with so many brilliant minds cannot even be bothered with the values of open source and how this pertains to democracy and human values I really don&#39;t see how any other part of our species could. &#34;Chromium scrolls 5% better on my machine so who cares about Firefox&#34;. I see these comments all the time here. Even in this thread.Firefox. Linux. Postgresql. Wikipedia. Xmms! The WORLD WIDE WEB! Imaging if Google invented hypertext and not CERN (funny how Google made their initial fortunes). AMP would be the least of your worries. Imagine if Amazon &#34;invented&#34; Wikipedia. All of these open source projects are just mindblowingly awesome. They help people. Me. You.But who cares right? Certainly not the lot with money in the 80/90s that didn&#39;t understand how or why this would be important. Which is why all these amazing things happened. Now they do of course. So none of this anymore.Which is why I think humanity is doomed to succumb to our newfound overlords. The Big Four. Five? Six? Seven? Who cares really. A handful.I wish people, especially like what this place definitely represents, would stand up more (including me!). Teach people, politicians, your parents, your siblings, your kids. We understand tech and it&#39;s implications. We understand how big tech is now stifling everything. Good luck training a neural network that competes with 50 billion uploaded photos. Facebook, Amazon. Google. Microsoft.But noone will - &#34;it doesn&#39;t matter&#34;. But make no mistake. It does matter. And humanity is just sitting here. It&#39;s like we&#39;re heading for this High Class Great Filter.Good thing I&#39;ll be dead before all this comes to full fruition.(Sorry for the rant - hope it was still relevant and on point, and I really encourage discussion here!)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I noticed in the comments below how somebody mentioning Firefox&#39;s limited market share was heavily downvoted.I&#39;m a Firefox user since forever, and will keep using it. I also want Mozilla to win, and strongly empathize with their engineers whom are trying to make the best of it.That said, I think the reality check should not be avoided. There is no good in do-good software without reach.Based on statcounter, Firefox&#39;s market share went from a 2009 peak (32%) to a mere 3.29% as we speak. Just in the last year alone, it bleeds market share from 4.25% to 3.29%.So it keeps bleeding market share, 12 years in a row. The reason it&#39;s still losing market share likely is due to the mobile market still growing in size, whilst Firefox has no presence there: 0.48%.I have access to a handful of web properties, one of which very large and global (billions of page views). In our dashboards, Firefox does not even exist. It&#39;s not in the top 10. Above it are Chromium clones most have never heard of.So to the &#34;ordinary&#34; world, those without a particular stake in open source, it&#39;s a dead browser. It&#39;s even smaller than weird regional browsers that most businesses wouldn&#39;t explicitly support.(note that &#34;support&#34; is overstated as most web tech works just fine out of the box in Firefox)Besides the ordinary world, the grip on the developer community is also lost. Increasingly, I&#39;m seeing developers coding up demos and experiments that break in Firefox, it&#39;s not even considered at all, where just a few years ago it was a developer-default browser.It&#39;s an extremely harsh reality check. Effectively Apple, an enemy of the open web, is our only savior against a full Chromium monopoly. Apple actively sabotaging and blocking the progress of the web, is our &#34;hope&#34;. How bad can it get?Anyway, I&#39;m sorry to bring this up, in particular in a release announcement. I bring it up because I believe impact is central to the discussion and trumps any feature and any engineering. If the crash is not reversed somehow, it is inevitable that very hard questions have to be answered.It&#39;s not what I would want. I hope an independent implementation will keep existing forever."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Background updates! Hooray! That may sound like a basic table stakes feature but honestly it&#39;s a huge improvement. And a lot of other apps do a terrible job of it, particularly on Windows. It&#39;s remarkable how many apps require 8, 10 mouse clicks and a restart to install a minor update. Firefox didn&#39;t require any clicks but the nag / need to restart was a nuisance.Actually now that I type that I wonder what has changed. I guess the upgrade appears to happen faster because it was done before the restart? I assume Firefox itself still has to be restarted for the update to be effective.(No problem on a Windows system; the OS reboots itself so often Firefox is guaranteed to before too long :-P)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was responsible for Stripe&#39;s API abstractions, including webhooks and /events, for a number of years. Some interesting tidbits:Many large customers eventually had some issue with webhooks that required intervention. Stripe retries webhooks that fail for up to 3 days: I remember $large_customer coming back from a 3 day weekend and discovering that they had pushed bad code and failed to process some webhooks. We&#39;d often get requests to retry all failed webhooks in a time period. The best customers would have infrastructure to do this themselves off of /v1/events, though this was unfortunately rare.The biggest challenges with webhooks:- Delivery: some customer timing out connections for 30s causing the queues to get backed up (Stripe was much smaller back then).- Versioning: synchronous API requests can use a version specified in the request, but webhooks, by virtue of rendering the object and showing its changed values (there was a `previous_attributes` hash), need to be rendered to a specific version. This made upgrading API versions hard for customers.There was constant discussion about building some non-webhook pathway for events, but they all have challenges and webhooks + /v1/events were both simple enough for smaller customers and workable for larger customers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a hill I find myself frequently fighting (and losing on): webhooks are terrible to maintain, because they start from the premise &#34;this never breaks&#34; and thats about where development in an organization stops.The only event API I ever want is notifications there&#39;s new data, and then an interface by which I can query all new data which has arrived by some sort of index marker - because this is fundamentally reliable. It means whatever happens to my system, I can reliably recover missed events, skipped events, or rebuild from previous events.And this is in fact exactly how something like Kafka actually works! Complete with first-class support for compacting queues to produce valid &#34;summarized&#34; starting points.Any streaming system essentially should never start as a streaming system - it should start as a slow-path pull-based system, and have a fast-path push system added on top of it if needed - because then you&#39;ve built your recovery path already, rather then what happens way too often which is just &#34;oh yeah, we&#39;ll develop that when it breaks&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Zulip&#39;s API is built on roughly this design pattern:* https://zulip.com/api/real-time-events* https://zulip.com/api/register-queue* https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subsystems/events-sys...We use this same long-polling based /events API interface for all official clients (web, mobile, terminal), our interactive bots ecosystem (https://zulip.com/api/running-bots), and many integrations (E.g. bridges with IRC/Matrix/etc.).We also offer webhooks, because some platforms like Heroku or AWS Lambda make it much easier to accept incoming HTTP requests than do longpolling, but the events system has always felt like a nicer programming model.(Zulip&#39;s events system was inspired by separate ~2012 conversations I had with the Meteor and Quora founders about the best way to do live updates in a web application)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was 2nd employee at a unicorn startup and have been on a work-hiatus for almost a year.  Now, I live amongst Amish people in the country.My biggest insight has been a mindset change.  Previously my underlying approach to life looked like: &#34;I will do X which will enable me to do Y so that I can finally do Z.&#34; I now approach my days with &#34;What will make me happy?&#34;  This is an experiment I&#39;m performing.  A structured life feels safe and orderly - but what if living life and letting things unfold more &#39;organically&#39; is better?It is a weird/uncomfortable shift because I can&#39;t predict what is coming.  As an example, turns out I really enjoy building dams.  A couple months ago I would not have been able to tell you that I&#39;d be building a dam.I have no idea what it is that drives my own interests or affinities, but now instead of attempting to manipulate them for whatever X, Y, or Z goal... I just roll with wherever they take me.  And they always seem ready to take me somewhere.My point is: In a life without work (in my experience) stuff will come up.  Follow what arises, see where it goes.  It certainly feels better."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is one of the biggest missing pieces in internet FIRE discussions. So much of the FIRE discourse is about not working that many don’t realize that they’re going to be extremely bored with 16 hours to fill every day. Worse, their friends are all busy with their lives.It’s actually a common failure point of FIRE post-mittens that didn’t work out. Especially with couples, where it’s more likely that at least one person will realize that maybe jobs, and the sense of purpose and social life that comes with them, aren’t so bad.The other big issue is that people underestimate their spending in a post-work FIRE lifestyle. It’s tempting to subtract out costs like commuting and work clothes and assume your costs will go down. In practice, if you plan on traveling and spending more time on hobbies your costs are likely to go up."</p>

Some have become desertified, perhaps some of which is our fault (eg. Mediterranean deforestation).

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This sounds cool from a tech-nerd perspective, but of course it all is pretty futile if we don&#39;t get emissions under control. The video says 10 gigatons/yr by 2050. Our 2019 emissions were ~36 gigatons. I.e. even if capture is successful, it needs to be accompanied by aggressive emissions reductions for us to even get to neutral, let alone reversing damage.I&#39;m guessing Musk had some thought process around the expected marginal impact of funding this vs more on energy storage vs energy production. And perhaps capture/sequestration is under-explored.But I wonder what could be achieved with $100M of funds directed at research to intentionally changing and shifting culture towards consuming stuff with smaller footprints? Tesla made some people want an electric car really badly. For some, very small houses are becoming attractive. But so far this stuff mostly arises from ad-hoc marketing efforts around particular brands, products, influencers. What if we need systematic memetic engineering, to make lower energy consumption actually feel desirable?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I switched my primary dev environment to NixOS in a graphical VM on macOS towards the end of 2020 and I love it: https://twitter.com/mitchellh/status/1346136404682625024?s=2...Previously, I used Nix on Mac (as this blog post suggests) but I had enough “gotchas” with Nix on Mac that I decided to go full NixOS.For those who ask why a VM or why I keep Mac around at all: I like macOS for everything else besides dev work. I use iMessages heavily, I like the Mac App ecosystem such as calendars, mail clients, etc. This gives me the best of both worlds.I usually run this on an iMac Pro but also have a MacBook Pro. It runs great on either. It’s also really nice with Nix to update one machine and the other is just one command away from being equivalent.I recognize this is a “weird” setup but wanted to point it out since it seems relevant to this post."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To others who might be interested in trying Nix instead of Homebrew:There is a `brew install` equivalent in vanilla Nix -- `nix-env` provides an imperative interface pretty similiar to `brew`.`nix-darwin` is a third-party thing that tries to give you a NixOS-like experience on macOS. It&#39;s not necessary if you&#39;re only interested in replacing Homebrew. You can have `shell.nix` files and ad-hoc environments without replacing your entire system configuration.Vanilla Nix is very well isolated, and you can try it side by side with Homebrew to see how you like it -- one of the nice side effects of Nix-installed software being independent from the rest of your system is that, well, you can install whatever you want without breaking the Homebrew equivalents. For example instead of putting binaries in `/usr/local/bin`, Nix creates a directory of symlinks to files in `/nix/store`, and you can add that directory to your `PATH` if you wish.I switched to Nix a few months ago and have found it... fun. It&#39;s not something I would recommend if you want things to just work, but if you&#39;re curious about Nix, you can learn quite a lot about it from the comfort of your MacBook.I wrote a little about this experience here, including how to map common `brew` commands into their `nix-env` equivalents: https://ianthehenry.com/posts/how-to-learn-nix/switching-fro...(Warning: it&#39;s more of a rambling diary entry than a blog post.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you read https://haystack-books.s3.amazonaws.com/Study+to+understand+..., you’ll seeQ1. To what extent, if any, do the following statements apply to you?I feel burnt out from work.On a four-point scale, that scores 21%, 35%, 28%, 17%.So, they took everyone except those who said they didn’t feel burnt out at all, and got 83%.I think asking for feelings of burnout exaggerates the issue of being burnt out by a huge factor.For me, burnout means not only being tired of your job, but also inability to ‘burn’ outside work. I don’t even see how you can be that moderately, but over a quarter of respondents reported that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wonder if software presents a unique situation as we generally make a pretty decent salary and to transition to a new career involves a pretty significant pay cut. So some developers become trapped in jobs they hate with golden handcuffs. I really don&#39;t enjoy software development at all, but at this stage, to even think about doing something else would result in a massive pay cut. I did it once when I was younger, quit software and started a new career with a 55% pay cut. Liked the new work and did it for 5 years. Then I had kids and needed more money so I returned to software, since then I just exist in a constant state of burnout."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"How much of the workload is just the dev shortage/insufficient staffing?I am currently the only dev on my team because of departures (there should be 4). Now, it is not really all that in production yet so it hasn&#39;t required late nights or waking up at odd hours, but it does linger in my mind that this could be a big issue if it grew a lot and my team didn&#39;t. I would hate to support it alone.A friend of mine is missing two people on his team at another company. It means that they had to shove the interns into the support rotation to have full coverage of their app. They are hiring too, but as things stand, interns are staying up in the night deal with production errors and they are waking each other up as well, they are interns and don&#39;t know what they are doing.Software seems like something that needs a sufficiently sized team after a certain point and nearly every team I know of anywhere is short people at the moment, even at FAANGs."</p>

If you scroll down, he writes:&gt; The Chair [of the Columbia Film program] reached out and said he was confident that we could work out an arrangement to get my degree. But he insisted that I fly out to NYC immediately for an in-person meeting. So I spent a fortune on a last-minute flight in order to hear his proposal.&gt; But instead of telling me what I need to do to satisfy the requirements to get my degree, the Chair began pitching me his idea for a TV pilot. In excruciating scene-by-scene detail. I nodded along, waiting to get back to the terms of me getting my degree.&gt; But to my horror... I slowly begin to realize this IS the deal. He made it pretty clear if I wanted my degree, I needed to help him sell his tv pilot. Yep, the Chair of Columbia’s prestigious graduate film program tried to shake me down in order to jump-start his own stalled out career."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Columbia has a pretty questionable record with other masters programs in creative fields. The school is exploiting the Ivy brand, the NYC location and talent, and legions of students desperate to stand out in highly competitive creative fields. For instance, a 10-month MS in Journalism is $116k (including living expenses) while a 12-month M.S. in data journalism is $160k (https://journalism.columbia.edu/cost-attendance).Yes, studying under true experts in NYC is a wonderful experience for people in film, theater, journalism, writing, the arts, etc. But there should be no expectation that a very expensive degree will lead to high-paying jobs in those fields. The fact that every year Columbia is setting up all of these new grads with hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt and little hope of repaying it in those professions is downright predatory.The WSJ article that prompted the original Twitter thread is worth reading. A few graduates have managed to find low-paying, entry-level jobs in the film industry that pay under $50k per year, and probably did not require a master&#39;s degree. One of the grads they talked with is working at the local TJ Maxx ... the same job he had as a teenager.Via one of the WSJ reporters who worked on the report:At least 43% of the people who recently took out loans for master’s degrees at elite private universities hadn’t paid down any of their original debt or were behind on payments roughly two years after graduation.It’s not just arts degrees. Other high debt, low-earning master’s programs: NYU publishing (debt: $116k, earnings: $42k), Northwestern speech-language pathology (debt: $148k, earnings: $60k), USC marriage and family counseling (debt: $124k, earnings: $50k).All this is made possible by Grad Plus, the no-limit federal student loan program. Created in 2005, it’s now the fastest growing program. Based on partial data from the 2021 school year, grad students were on track to borrow as much as undergrads for the first time.https://twitter.com/anfuller/status/1413160574205284352"</p>

Physicists tend to enjoy knowledge sharing.You can generally exit at any time and immediately transition into lucrative careers in, for example, tech and finance.It has it&#39;s downsides, but for how whimsical it is, it&#39;s a pretty soft landing if you decide you want out."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Besides the size, are there any practical advantages over ESP8266 NodeMCU boards that you can buy on Aliexpress for $2.50? The specs are solid, but the price tag of $25 seems a bit excessive. I&#39;m not big on microcontrollers, must be missing something."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Show HN is for sharing your own work: https://news.ycombinator.com/showhn.html.It looks like this is someone else&#39;s work, so I&#39;ve taken Show HN out of the title now. If I got that wrong and you&#39;re the creator of this project, let us know and we&#39;ll be happy to put this back in the Show HN category."</p>
