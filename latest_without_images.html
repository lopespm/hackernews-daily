								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Perhaps the main issue is that the guy has a point, nobody want’s to see an uncle.The majority of “influencers” are young women, and only a minority would want to follow a 50 year old uncle. I don’t think there’s much we can do about it, it’s human nature. It does however limit the diversity and world views people are exposed to and sometimes it’s nice to see the world through the eyes of a 50 year Japanese biker."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What really worries me about the DeepFakes stuff is not so much the fakes -- I&#39;m worried about that, but that&#39;s been written about to death -- but that now it adds plausible deniability to anyone caught on camera doing anything.If we had video footage of, say, a politician doing something clearly illegal on camera, then it&#39;s simply the word of the politician against the word of the source -- the latter of whom may need to remain anonymous.That said... the other way around is still the more dangerous, I guess. If, say, a US adversary creates a great-looking video of the US president doing/saying something really heinous, that has the potential to inflame the world long before the truth can get its boots on."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Thing I keep seeing and don&#39;t understand is &#34;Legitimate interest&#34; as a separate thing to consent.&#34;You opted out of our cookies, but we&#39;re going to say we need them anyway, but you can still opt out of that&#34;.It&#39;s somewhere between underhand and downright disturbing (&#34;our interests override your lack of consent&#34;? Eww)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Somewhat related, I got a new computer this week, and had to boot into windows so I could partition the HD to install linux. This was the first time in 15 years I have booted into a brand new &#34;consumer&#34; windows install (it was windows 10 pro). The &#34;setup&#34; was basically just 10 minutes of them asking in different ways if they could collect my personal data, track my location, send back telemetry etc. Office 365 is the same. I find some new thing every day that I have to opt out of to prevent them stealing my and my business data. Its like they have given up on trying to improve their products (which are basically stable) and shifted into finding more ways to steal data. As much as I dislike google for this, I realize I&#39;m the product there, with Microsoft I thought I was paying to get business tools, not to be spied on. (To be fair, I then installed ubuntu which also wanted to send my data back to canonical)Another example, I bought a car recently that defaults to stealing my personal information and sending it to the manufacturer. I had to call, and provide more information to them, to opt out (and I can only assume they are still stealing information they have deemed critical in some way)Anyway, I&#39;m reminded of all of this because I think the obfuscated cookie consents are just one facet of how hostile consumer tech has become to users. Aided by complex and ambiguous regulations, companies are able to stay within the letter of the law while making it impossible to just be left alone with your purchase and not be tracked and marketed to.If there is a regulatory solution, it has to focus on clarity and spirit, not on just more rules. I&#39;m not aware of an example of something like this working elsewhere.One idea is a heavy tax on advertising. I&#39;ve argued before that there is a lot in common between environmental pollution and the effects of advertising on the public value of the internet, and I would say this extends to tech generally. Charge a 25-40% tax on ad revenue, and make it less economic for companies to pollute."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m reading the book The Divide at the moment. It makes the argument that it takes time and the right conditions to build up an industry - infrastructure needs to be built, education and a skilled labor pool with the necessary know-how as well. To begin with, a fledgling industry in a developing country cannot compete with those of already industrialized countries - these are already so effective that they can undercut newcomers before they have time to become competitive. So the book argues that when developing countries are pressured into free trade agreements (for example by making aid dependent on this), these countries are also forced into a position where they get stuck at the low end of the production value chain, selling raw materials, while buying processed goods from others (often the same role they were forcibly assigned when they were colonies). So much like we allow children time to learn in school before we expect them to compete in the job market, we should allow developing countries to employ protectionistic policies like tariffs, in order to protect and build up their fledgling industries nationally, before fully entering the world market in a couple decades when they are ready."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think it’s good to see raw producers start working up market to make their own chocolate. I think a Ghanaian chocolate brand actually owned by Ghanaians and made for export would market very well.It’s interesting to me how much tasty and interesting stuff in Africa has not been marketed internationally and there’s lots of room for them to grow and develop.For example, fonio [0], is a grain native to west Africa that I’ve never seen in the US but was eaten every day when I was there, as common as rice. It’s gluten-free and could be the next quinoa and a great opportunity to develop a new brand and export finished products rather than just commodities.One of the big opportunities of all this digitization, I think, is that it’s now easier for remote locations to get more value out of their commodities than just exporting raw and having someone else add most of the value.I’m surprised the Swiss aren’t trying to do more joint ventures to develop chocolate making capabilities in Ghana."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really hope Ivory Coast will join Ghana on this, as they did for the LID bonus case. Together they account for over 2/3 of cocoa production. So, they can pretty much reshape the cocoa/chocolate market and break out of colonialistic trade agreements for the benefit of their people."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wish Apple would give Docker some love like Microsoft does. Using Docker with WSL is a breeze, and it runs so much better than MacOS.
And as an advantage you get access to Linux package managers which are so much better than brew. Brew is good, but Linux package managers like pacman and apt are so much better. Having a proper Linux distribution open in one window while I play &#39;Call of Duty&#39; in another, is one reason why I&#39;ve moved to Windows again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love Docker, but I gave up on using it on Mac. I put a lot of effort into fighting it, but ultimately, it seems some of the issues are just too fundamental. I like to call the Docker-for-Mac experience the MacBook Airplane. At some point, your fans will start spinning, your productivity will crash, and you&#39;ll spend the next three hours sifting through open GitHub issues from 2017 where everyone is still complaining about the same problems.I&#39;m all in on VSCode Remote SSH development now. It works extremely well, I barely even notice I&#39;m not programming on my own computer, and my laptop no longer sounds like a passenger jet taking off. It was very easy to setup. Our stack is still very Docker heavy, but using the containers on a remote machine makes it much more tolerable to work with."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Some container disk I/O is much slower than expected. See docker/for-mac#5389. Disk flushes are particularly slow due to the need to guarantee data is written to stable storage on the host.Huh. This could be problematic given that Docker disk performance on macOS was already dreadful on intel machines. I would love to see Apple give this some attention."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am self taught, I worked as a lawyer for six years and four of those were spent prepping for a career change - self-teaching comp sci and software dev in the evenings, then working as a volunteer a few years in. (I come from an engineering family and should have just done it from the start, but oh well.)I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s still on the platform, but about a year into my self studying I took a series of courses on edX that used this system. I think it was called Systematic Program Design, but I could be misremembering. Anyways, the courses were incredible. I completely credit them with beginning to turn me from a coder into a software dev. The system they provide just locked into my brain like it had always been there.I almost didn&#39;t take it because it used Racket, and I questioned its general applicability for that reason. I&#39;m so glad I pushed those concerns aside, because in addition to introducing me to software design principles, it introduced me to Lisp in a way that also completely changed my thinking about what programming itself could be.I&#39;ve now been a paid dev for 2.5 years. I don&#39;t really explicitly use the system from the course in my daily work, but the knowledge contained within it has molded my entire understanding of the field.The course literally changed my life."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My undergrad intro class used this. At the time I found it patronizing and silly and artificially limiting, having coded before (the design recipe, the different &#34;levels&#34; of scheme).But I saw some of the wisdom in the approach when I later tutored the class. People would try to rush into coding problems without doing real analysis of what the cases would be, and had a foggy notion of different parts of program having a &#34;contract&#34;. HTDP and the design recipe makes that muscle memory for beginners which is pretty nifty."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My uncle spent some time in prison in the late 80&#39;s and early 90&#39;s and was able to learn FoxPro while there.  In addition to it being hard to find work having a criminal record, by the time he got out, everybody was transitioning away from FoxPro.As is too often the case, the lure of money from selling drugs combined with not being able to find work meant he returned to prison.  He got out again in the early-mid 2000&#39;s and this time around, there were no courses offered for study.  When he got out that time, he didn&#39;t even know how to use the TV remote.One day, history will look back on how we treat our prisoners with immense shame.  Instead of trying to rehabilitate them, we leave them to rot, and politicians never shy away from an opportunity to make the lives of prisoners more miserable, lest they risk being called &#34;soft&#34; on crime."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really think the point is not how long it might take someone to learn how to use tools, but the impacts of prison. I work with these folks through my company to help them become employed upon release.A few things, it is astounding but believable that when people are released they enter a world that is entirely unknown to them. Not only technology but their relationships and neighborhoods are completely different.In addition,They have no reliable way of getting back on their feet. They usually have zero money, no housing and no job - and there is why you have high recidivism rates. Not only that, but no one wants to hire justice involved individuals, even though significant tax credits are available for doing so - Walmart for example, takes extreme advantage of these.The training programs in prisons will train someone up to a certification, but fall short of letting them get that certification. People have completed their GED maybe 5 times inside serving sentences at different times because doing so can reduce their sentence, it doesn’t help them in any other way.Without the ability to access training for in demand skills, many of these individuals get temp service jobs as flagged for construction for example. Doesn’t make sense to me that we want to rehab people yet minimal opportunities inside are provided to break the cycle.Realize this. People serve a sent and then they are eligible for parole. Many people opt to serve their parole inside, rather than outside. I’ve been told they feel it is easier inside than out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m sure many people here have experienced frustration helping older relatives or friends use computers.  Recently though, I realized, that computers are just way too hard to use.In our pursuit to avoid cryptic black screens with command prompts, a user must now understand that their computer has Windows with all of its menus and functions, a browser window with all of its menus and functions, running a webapp, with all of its menus and functions.  Whenever functionality bleeds into other layers (&#34;how do I print this pdf file&#34;), it is a huge hassle trying to explain &#34;oh, it&#39;s not that print button, its this other print button&#34;.It makes me sad to think that people prefer their &#34;appliance computers&#34; (phones, tablets, chromebooks) over real computers, but I can hardly blame them."</p>
