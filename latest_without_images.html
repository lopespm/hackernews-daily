								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; “If there is the infrastructure, if there is the channel by which police can request footage without a warrant or consent of the user, under what circumstances they get it is out of our control. I worry that because it’s decided by the police and by somebody at Ring, there will be temptation to use that for increasingly less urgent situations.”Many people (I would argue anybody with common sense) predicted Ring would get used as a surveillance tool. This quote correctly states the nearly-inevitable next step, which will also be ignored."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"IMO the primary utility of Ring is for Amazon to surveil their delivery contractors, without a doorbell cam it’s trivial for a delivery person to set the package on the porch, photograph it as “proof of delivery”, and then walk away with said package.So the deterrent effect is good for the consumer in that it prevents theft, and good for Amazon because they can contract out to just about anyone to deliver packages, no trust required (or, “trust but verify”)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My next door neighbor (we share a wall) had their bicycles stolen twice, so they installed Ring (floodlight) cameras in both the backyard and the front porch. After a year, the cameras have yielded no added security, or caught any &#34;bad guys&#34; as far as I can tell and from what they told me.What I realized, is they use it to keep track of their kids, funny cat videos that trigger the recording, and most importantly, as a 2 way radio to talk or listen to the kids. That last point, well, I found out they can also listen to my conversations an my kids.I asked them to point their front porch camera so that it doesn&#39;t record my front driveway, just theirs. and they lost their shit. They confirmed they record audio and video. They asked if there was a problem. I said no problem with them. I&#39;m not comfortable with the audio/video recording me or my friends conversations if company comes over to talk to me on my porch or driveway.I really didn&#39;t need to tell them anything, it&#39;s self evident why someone wants a camera point away. Needless to say, after I asked them in the winter, one of them refuses to speak to me and crosses the street and avoids me.These people use surveillance to supervise their kids, and don&#39;t care about the fact that their neighbors (me) could be recorded, and they could be hacked or footage access by random people, because Amazon isn&#39;t exactly the king of privacy.I believe these cameras haven&#39;t decreased crime. They also don&#39;t really add more security. It&#39;s a shame though they are everywhere, with disregard for privacy right on people&#39;s property. So yes, I&#39;m biased. I have no love for Ring."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This period has been very special because of the 401k, which is itself part of the growth story of the corporate legal structure. I think this is coming to an end. Corporate boards and officers no longer represent the best long-term interests of the companies and shareholders they represent. It’s also a very precarious legal status as an arbitrary judicial ruling can make or break a company. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the corporate bubble is based on arbitrary tax codes that both advantage corporations and push worker savings into the stock market.Even if these conditions continue unabated, the cash flows from working class into the stock market will eventually hit equilibrium with capital extraction from the owner class. If the extractions return to the same markets, then things stay in equilibrium. They won’t, however, because the tax advantaged assets are different for them. They may seek hyper-volatility, or government bond shelters, but will generally avoid the assets on the working class tax treadmill.There are fundamentals to financial assets that have nothing to do with “number go up”, and these will ultimately dictate reality, with the caveat that “the markets will remain irrational longer than you will remain solvent”.  Rationals get wrecked too, except every once in a while when one gets lucky on their timing and makes so much money that they become a hero and we make movies about them. We cheer because it gives us hope that our intuition will serve us too. Unlikely.This is all to say that such charts are using an inductive hypothesis to predict an inherently anti-inductive phenomenon. People tithe and sacrifice to their church for a promise of rewards in the afterlife. The stonk religion is the same; well worth the price for your peace of mind. True or not, you’d be a mess without it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Having all lines normalized so they start from a common point at x = 0 would be helpful. That would allow reading the total returns as percentage of the initial (1987) investment and compare them.Similarly in the drawdown chart, if it starts at 1987, it makes no sense to start the dollar at -81%. If I am looking at a chart from 1987 to 2022, I want to see how the dollar did compared to other assets in that time period."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If the goal is to demonstrate relative performance over time, wouldn&#39;t it be useful to use a normalization such that all lines either start at the same point (e.g. simulating investing X amount) or ending at the same point (showing requirement to get to X final amount)?"</p>

The exploit can extract kernel memory from AMD CPUs with a bandwidth of 3.9 kB per second.&gt; The researchers said that it’s capable of locating and leaking a Linux computer’s root password hash from physical memory in about 28 minutes when running the Intel CPUs and in about 6 minutes for AMD CPUs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In today&#39;s arms race of exploits, you need to operate and prepare your interactions with computers with a defined threat scenario. This is never-ending.&gt; Linux creator Linus Torvalds famously rejected such warnings, arguing that such exploits weren’t practical.And I would certainly agree with Linus, here&#39;s why:&gt; Retbleed can leak kernel memory from Intel CPUs at about 219 bytes per second and with 98 percent accuracy.Retbleed adds more credence to this idea of impractical-yet-technically-feasible exploits; where do you draw the line? Do you choose to be vulnerable to this 219 bytes per second leak at the cost of 28% CPU overhead? I would imagine, one could toggle on or off the mitigations they&#39;d want with the implications provided in the future via modifying BIOS settings."</p>

Basically every other tool I tried worked better.However, Slack isn&#39;t that much better. It still gaslights Firefox users and tells them their browser is not supported. What a nice way to put it, that after friggin&#39; years, they still have not managed to implement voice chat in a standard conform way. Discord and others have had this for years! Only Slack and Teams (in browser) seem to have incapable development teams behind them, who are comfortable with gaslighting unsuspecting users into using Chromium-based browsers, furthering web mono-culture.There are so many issues with Teams, that I am wondering, what they are even working on. Surely they cannot be bugfixing all day, if so many bugs remain after years. We&#39;ve had 2-3 years of pandemic now. What the heck are they doing!? They could have made the business. Instead they shove this broken thing down our throats and time will come, when people will just run away screaming, just like they did with Skype. Another business opportunity of MS ruined by bad quality software output.Stuff like that should get banned immediately, before it can harm the web any more, than it already has."</p>

Note that this technique is valid for specifying only static SSID passwords (i.e. PSK); dynamic user credentials (i.e. Enterprise/802.1x) cannot be encoded in this manner.The format of the encoded string is:  WIFI:S:&lt;SSID&gt;;T:&lt;WPA|WEP|&gt;;P:&lt;password&gt;;H:&lt;true|false|&gt;;

Order of fields does not matter. Special characters &#34;&#34;&#34; (quotation mark), &#34;;&#34; (semicolon), &#34;,&#34; (comma), &#34;:&#34; (colon) and &#34;\&#34; (backslash) should be escaped with a backslash (&#34;\&#34;) as in MECARD encoding.

One of the coolest things Eiffel sorta did was use contracts to infer tests.

I don&#39;t mean one of the purely no-code products, but like a literal &#34;create a new page, drag a button, then double click it to hop into the code for a new route and a new component and go straight into the onclick handler&#34;.Maybe that&#39;s harder than I can imagine, or it exists and just isn&#39;t a very good idea in practice (how would you even do responsive?) so it&#39;s not that popular.VB was a garbage language by modern standards but I always liked that they gave you a visual builder, but didn&#39;t try to hide the coding from you too much."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Depending on if you count it as a serious programming language, Racket has pretty much all the contract stuff. It has dedicated syntax for contracts, tight integration with the module system, and contract-random-generate attempts to generate a value satisfying a contract so writing an auto fuzzer wouldn&#39;t be too hard. In fact, I think Racket&#39;s system predates Clojure since there was the 2002 paper &#34;Contracts for Higher-Order Functions&#34; discussing it and Clojure first appeared in 2007.The only reason I would ever use Clojure instead of Racket would be if I needed to work with the JVM ecosystem or the browser via Clojurescript (which are compelling reasons).Totally agree about a good calculator language."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Sounds like the same anti competitive behavior that MS was punished for two decades ago. Making it a requirement to only boot software approved by them excludes a whole range of competitors from using the same hardware. Making that a condition for OEMs to even get a license is the problem here.Lenovo is otherwise known for supporting Linux on their laptops. And yes I know you can jump through hoops and fiddle with scary (for ordinary users) bios options to &#34;fix&#34; this. The point is that you shouldn&#39;t have to and this is a bit too convenient for MS to keep competitors off laptops.Basically, what is needed here is a neutral certificate authority not controlled by a single company with a reasonable process for independent operating systems to get a certificate.I recently ran into this trying to boot linux on my old imac. Ubuntu actually works but forget about arch, manjaro, and a whole lot of other distributions. Imacs have no off-switch for secure boot that I know off."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"CP/M was the popular operating system that IBM wanted to license for their skunkworks Personal Computer project. But the founder of Digital Research, the company that developed CP/M, was more interested that day in going flying his plane than meeting with corporate men in navy suits. (This may be apocryphal.)IBM turned instead to their second choice, a small company that was supplying BASIC interpreters to many 8-bit micros. The company didn’t actually have a suitable disk operating system product, but the founder knew someone who did. He made a deal to license the source code for a fixed fee and no limitations on redistribution. And that’s how Bill Gates acquired MS-DOS for $50k."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"HP should open OS/8 and RT-11, the two big influences on CP/M.  OS/8 is kind of remarkable, running on a system arguably less powerful than the first 8-bit home computers (I would say they are closer to PIC microcontrollers, but with more RAM):https://www.pdp8online.com/os/os8/index.shtmlPDP-8 memory is heavily paged.  There are 128 word pages- direct addresses can only reach within the current page, and literals (immediate data including addresses to other pages) have to be allocated out of this current page along with the instructions.  Second, there are 4K-word fields.  So you need to use far jumps and returns to access outside the current field.  This is just like PIC microcontroller pages.OS/8 reserved only two pages for itself.  Things like the command interpreter were swapped out to disk or DECTape.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DECtapeIf the application needed device drivers, it got to choose which pages the drivers would occupy- meaning the device drivers had to be written as position independent code.  Also I think each driver was limited to two pages.."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In high school in 1980 we had Commodore PETs. They had no tangible OS, just a BASIC interpreter in ROM. There was an easter egg that made it say Microsoft or wasn&#39;t it spelled MicroSoft? Either way a company nobody had ever heard of.CP/M had the aura of being something for real pros. Read some journal articles and it looked really complicated. But without suitable hardware I had never any chance to touch it.In 1983 I went to university where beginner courses happened on VAX/VMS and my definition of &#34;pro&#34; got shifted."</p>
