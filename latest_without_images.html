								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I talk to colleagues in tech about unions I hear a lot of misconceptions, seemingly based in stereotypes about what unions are for and who they serve. People often seem to think of unions as being purely blue-collar operations, and this just isn&#39;t true.For example, I&#39;ve had people tell me that they don&#39;t support unions in tech because they&#39;ll be &#34;paid less&#34;, or less competent engineers will be promoted faster.And it&#39;s strange, because the other major industry in California - the film industry - is heavily unionised, and you just don&#39;t see that happening there. You have vocally supportive multi-millionaire card-carrying members of the Screen Actors Guild, the Writers Guild, and the Directors Guild to name a few. None of these unions are limiting the work their members are carrying out.This is because those unions are serving a very different purpose to the stereotypical union some engineers seem to fear. SAG, the DGA, and the WGA aren&#39;t guaranteeing hours or limiting pay: they&#39;re simply trying to curb abuse in what it a very abusive industry, and putting in place procedures to protect members and resolve grievances.And they don&#39;t always get it right, and I don&#39;t pretend that Hollywood is a perfect utopia of worker relations, but I think it&#39;s pretty undeniable that the industry is a much better place with the unions around."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Don&#39;t think we&#39;ve ever seen Hollywood in the modern era without unions, so not sure how you can claim it&#39;s &#34;undeniable&#34; the industry is better off. We basically have no clue if it&#39;s better off or not.Unions are intended for industries where a worker doesn&#39;t have a marketplace of options as there is a single or just a few employers (e.g. Hollywood, teachers, coal mining towns, hospital staff, etc.). Unionizing at Google makes no sense, as there are thousands of tech companies hiring engineers in the valley -- engineers can &#34;collectively bargain&#34; with Google by simply leaving and working somewhere &#34;better&#34;.The reality is that Google is an easy place to work relative to how much people get paid. People don&#39;t want to leave a cushy job for one where they would have to work harder for their money, so instead, they are trying other means to have their cake and eat it too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It seems incredibly significant that only 230 people are officially involved with these plans to unionize. As of 2019, Google had nearly 120,000 employees.[0] That seems quite small, relatively speaking.Legally (I think, just learning about this now), to form a union, a majority of workers must show their willingness to form a union. Alternatively, to choose an existing union to join, an election with 30% of the workers support is required.[1]So with that said, am I reading this right? Does this group of 230 people need to find at least ~40,000 more people for this to be a valid effort to form/join a legal union?[0]https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/02/google-employee-growth-2001-...[1]https://www.legalmatch.com/law-library/article/how-to-form-a..."</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25633483">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Back when I worked at Marvell Semiconductor (circa 2005), we made laser printer ASICs for HP. We did a lot of dithering in hardware. We had a hardware block that did error diffusion, we had a hardware block that did regular diffusion. We also had a hardware block that did Blue Noise. I was responsible for implementing the firmware that drove those printers&#39; scan/copy path: scan an image in monochrome, run through the dither hardware to create the bit pattern fed to the laser engine.No one could explain to me how to use the blue noise block. I couldn&#39;t understand what the blue noise block was doing. This is the first article that explained, in terms I could understand, how blue noise dithering works.I can die happy. Thank you."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is such a well-written article: it describes the impetus, it is researched, it has great examples both as code and as output, and it piques interest. In the late 1990&#39;s I contracted with an embedded software company to optimize a dithering algorithm for 8-bit MCUs that was used in most laser printers &amp; copiers, and this paper is a really good overview."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you don&#39;t mind, I&#39;ll plug a little innovation of my own: mixing ordered and error diffusion dithering. The idea behind it is actually pretty simple: technically all forms of dithering use a threshold map, we just don&#39;t tend to think of it when it&#39;s one flat threshold for the entire image. So there is nothing stopping us from decoupling the threshold map from the rest of the dithering algorithm, meaning it&#39;s trivial to combine error diffusion with more complex threshold maps:https://observablehq.com/@jobleonard/ordered-error-diffusion...(For the record, I picked a default example that highlighted a &#34;hybrid&#34; dither with a very dramatic difference from its &#34;parents&#34; instead of the prettiest result)Interestingly, and perhaps not surprisingly, a variable threshold map interacts with the error diffusion itself, making it amplify local contrast and recover some fine detail in shadows and highlights (although also possibly overdoing it and crushing the image again).What&#39;s also somewhat interesting (to me at least) that this is really simple to implement: take any error diffusion dithering kernel and make it use the threshold map from ordered dithering. In principle it should have been possible to use them on any old hardware that can handle error diffusion dithering."</p>

Matrix is woefully immature, and suffers from a lot of issues, but I think is closer to being a functional Slack/Discord alternative. XMPP is much more mature, and works very well for chat, but doesn&#39;t have a nice package that does all the Slack stuff--at least not that I&#39;m aware of. I&#39;d love to be proven wrong there.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Definitely beautiful and would love for something simple and clean to eat LinkedIn&#39;s lunch.I don&#39;t have much to add in addition to everyone else except this: I am really disturbed by the common meme of faces-inside-circles. Why do we need faces? It just distracts from the content. I love the idea of being able to link former colleagues together - that&#39;s neat - but I&#39;m very anti-face and  there are any number of ways to do it that does not involve people&#39;s pictures.Edit: Wow this got a lot of upvotes. So, I&#39;ll continue for a sec: There is so, so much conscious and unconscious judgment and game playing with pictures, I don&#39;t even know where to start. Let&#39;s leave this to be simple, clean and beautiful without the faces."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Tech recruiter here.Pros:+ Very beautifully designed project+ Super readabilityBig, easy to fix negative:Force people to add months to the years! You only asks the year when someone started in &#34;Work Experience&#34;. If I read &#34;2012-2013&#34; I can&#39;t tell if someone has been at a place ~12 months or ~1 month. This information is very important.Also, please calculate the durations to allow readers to grasp tenure faster. Sometimes people need to skim through 200 CVs per day, so every inch of improvement is a big deal. Check how Linkedin does it: &#34;May 2012 - June 2012, 1 year 1 month&#34;Here a video where I improve some CVs, maybe that helps to make the product better: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haQ4rtEjhJQ"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a good start, but I&#39;m not a huge fan of this the way it is now.First, the font is tiny for my old eyes.  Not all of us, especially hiring managers, are still in their 20s and can read these tiny fonts. I measured it with a ruler and the text is 1mm tall.  Also, the font is gray on white, which is pretty but hard to read. In contrast, Linkedin is three times bigger and black on white, much easier to read.Second, after looking at the example, I have almost no idea what you&#39;ve done.  All I see are job titles.  I don&#39;t see any accomplishments or even job duties.  It looks like I could add those things when I create my own profile, but having them missing on the example isn&#39;t a good look.Third, the face circles.  I see face circles under each job, but they aren&#39;t clickable nor are there tooltips.  I have no idea what those are.  I assume they&#39;re other people who worked at the same place?  Maybe connections of yours who have worked at the same place?  That&#39;s a cool idea, but it needs to be more discoverable.  At the very least a tooltip would be good.Overall, when I&#39;m looking at a professional profile, I&#39;m usually doing it because I want to hire or work with someone.  The main information I want to know is 1) Do we have anyone in common I can ask about you?  2) What did you accomplish at your previous workplaces or otherwise?  3) Have you worked anywhere that I recognize and when, so I can ask my other friends who worked there if they know you?The face circles accomplish #1, so that&#39;s great.  #2 looks possible, but the design seems to minimize the accomplishments, as opposed to Linkedin which sort of puts it in your face.  And #3 seems to be covered but again the design minimizes the information I want most.I would say a good place to start would be asking yourself, &#34;Why does Linkedin look the way it does?&#34;.  A lot of their design comes from customer feedback, and their main customers are recruiters and hiring managers.  Steal their good stuff and leave their dark patterns behind."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Reading the judgement the key points are on pages 116 onwards and the extradition is denied under section 91(3) of the EA 2003 which reads:&gt; The condition is that the physical or mental condition of the person is such that it would be unjust or oppressive to extradite him.The judge states:&gt; it is my judgment that there is a real risk that he will  be kept in the near isolated conditions imposed by the  harshest SAMs (special administrative measures) regime, both pre-trial and post-trialAnd goes on to contrast with the conditions at HMP Belmarsh:&gt; many of the protective factors currently in place at HMP Belmarsh would be removed by these conditions. Mr. Assange’s health improved on being removed from relative isolation in healthcare. He has been able to access the support of family and friends. He has had access to a Samaritans phone line. He has benefited from a trusting relationship with the prison In-Reach psychologist. By contrast, a SAMs regime would severely restrict his contact with all other human beings, including other prisoners, staff and his family. In detention subject to SAMs, he would have absolutely no communication with other prisoners, even through the walls of his cell, and time out of his cell would be spent alone.These conditions sound barbaric to me and I&#39;d go as far to describe them as torture. Amnesty International do a better job of outlining the problems with this regime than I can: https://www.amnestyusa.org/reports/entombed-isolation-in-the...Frankly I don&#39;t understand why the UK continues to maintain an extradition treaty with a country which clearly has a poor record on human rights and fails to maintain a justice system that meets the UN&#39;s Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners.She concludes:&gt; I am satisfied that, in these harsh conditions, Mr. Assange’s mental health would deteriorate causing him to commit suicide with the “single minded determination” of his autism spectrum disorder.&gt; I order the discharge  of Julian Paul Assange, pursuant  to section 91(3) of the EA 2003Whilst a victory nonetheless for Assange, it is unfortunate that the entire judgement seems to come down to this point alone. Let&#39;s hope it is not overturned."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If there&#39;s anything to learn from Assange and Snowden:1. Our western &#34;liberal&#34; democracies stop being liberal when the government gets angry at you at a personal level.2. With enough propaganda, you can make people believe anything, even that Snowden is a &#34;traitor&#34; to the US.3. Politically vociferous people (the mob) don&#39;t give a shit about you unless you&#39;re instrumental to support the cause du jour"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I actually don&#39;t think this is such great news for him.Extradition was specifically blocked on the grounds of a particular regime he might be subjected to (to be fair, probably the only legal grounds on which he had any chance of succeeding). That leaves the US with a way out if they want to proceed with the extradition - guarantee a different set of circumstances.If the judge had found on more substantive grounds, those would have been much more resistant to that. For instance, all the claims based on language in the extradition treaty and other international agreements failed and they failed for pretty fundamental legal reasons. English courts only have regard for domestic law and it is for parliament to pass laws consistent with the treaties that have been signed, therefore claims based on treaty language won&#39;t work.That means that none of the claims on the political nature of his activities were upheld and those would have provided a much more robust and durable bar to extradition."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some truly impressive results. I&#39;ll pick my usual point here when a fancy new (generative) model comes out, and I&#39;m sure some of the other commenters have alluded to this. The examples shown are likely from a set of well-defined (read: lots of data, high bias) input classes for the model. What would be really interesting is how the model generalizes to /object concepts/ that have yet to be seen, and which have abstract relationships to the examples it has seen. Another commenter here mentioned &#34;red square on green square&#34; working, but &#34;large cube on small cube&#34;, not working. Humans are able to infer and understand such abstract concepts with very few examples, and this is something AI isn&#39;t as close to as it might seem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wish this was available as a tool for people to use! It&#39;s neat to see their list of pregenerated examples, but it would be more interesting to be able to try things out. Personally, I get a better sense of the powers and limitations of a technology when I can brainstorm some functionality I might want, and then see how close I can come to creating it. Perhaps at some point someone will make an open source version."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In spite of the close architectural resemblance with the VQVAE2, it definitely pushes the text-to-image synthesis domain forward. I&#39;d be curious to see how well it can perform on a multi-object image setting which currently presents the main challenge in the field. Also, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if these results were limited to openAI scale of computing resources. 
All in all, great progress in the field. The phase of development here is simply staggering, considering the fact that few years back we could hardly generate any image in high fidelity."</p>

Then there&#39;s the geopolitical aspect. Is it fair to impose sanctions on Iran.3. There&#39;s another aspect around GitHub policy that asks if an entire organization be banned for the location of one team member.4. Finally, there&#39;s the aspect of relinquishing control. Your app development is on the cloud. IDEs are on the cloud. Deployments are on the cloud.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The US sanctions on Iran has such a massive impact on Iranians that most of us don&#39;t realise.All US companies have to comply and majority of the tech companies are unfortunately in the US.I know you can use a VPN and configure it on a router level to make sure that you are always connected via a VPN but just the fact that 1 slip-up can result in account level blocks (which google is notoriously good at and can essentially shut down your business) means no company would want to work with someone working from Iran.Coming from a 3rd world country, I know the problems of internet censorship which Iranians also face but being too toxic to touch for everyone outside Iran because the US leadership thinks so is just infuriating and heart breaking.Imagine being a programmer in Iran. Not only do you have less resources to learn and grow, you have a massive handicap to find good work as most work is outside of the country.Only bet is to leave the country but even there you have a very low probability as you basically can&#39;t have a trial period for your job as most companies don&#39;t want to risk having their accounts blocked.Most of us here know how degrading and infuriating the tech recruiting processes can be and now add to it the horrors of working from Iran.Wars are not supposed to have civilian casualties but this one has a generation of civilians being starved of information and experience critical for them to grow."</p>

There&#39;s two possibilities: the offset (aka &#34;random number&#34;) is dynamic, or it&#39;s fixed. If it&#39;s the former all you have to do is sample enough times to get through the noise. If it&#39;s the latter, it&#39;s not vulnerable to the previous attack, but if you have a known point of reference (so you can deduce what the offset is), then you can still stalk them (forever?). IMO the only way to do is &#34;properly&#34; is to quantize people into map cells, like how apple does it with their coarse location feature[1].[1] &#34;Apple doesn&#39;t reduce the accuracy of location fixes by adding noise.
