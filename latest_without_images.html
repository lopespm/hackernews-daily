								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; SQLite isn&#39;t just on the same machine as your application, but actually built into your application process. When you put your data right next to your application, you can see per-query latency drop to 10-20 microseconds. That&#39;s micro, with a μ. A 50-100x improvement over an intra-region Postgres query.This is the #1 reason my exuberant technical mind likes that we use SQLite for all the things. Latency is the exact reason you would have a problem scaling any large system in the first place. Forcing it all into one cache-coherent domain is a really good way to begin eliminating entire universes of bugs.Do we all appreciate just how much more throughput you can get in the case described above? A 100x latency improvement doesn&#39;t translate directly into the same # of transactions per second, but its pretty damn close if your I/O subsystem is up to the task."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fly is putting together a pretty great team and interesting tech stack. It&#39;s the service I see as a true disruptor to Heroku because it&#39;s doing something novel (not just cheaper).I&#39;m still a little murky on the tradeoffs with Fly (and litestream). @ben / @fly, you should write a tutorial on hosting a todo app using rails with litestream and any expected hurdles at different levels of scale (maybe comparing to Heroku)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Things I would like in a database:- All changes stored as diff trees with signed cryptographic hashes. I want to check out the state of the world at a specific commit, write a change, a week later write another change, revert the first change 3 weeks later. And I want it atomic and side-loaded with no performance hit or downtime.- Register a Linux container as a UDF or stored procedure. Use with pub/sub to create data-adjacent arbitrary data processing of realtime data- Fine-grained cryptographically-verified least-privilege access control. No i/o without a valid short-lived key linked to rules allowing specific record access.- Virtual filesystem. I want to ls /db/sql/SELECT/name/IN/mycorp/myproduct/mysite/users/logged-in/WHERE/Country/EQUALS/USA. (Yes, this is stupid, but I still want it. I don&#39;t want to ever have to figure out how to connect to another not-quite-compatible SQL database again.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Or, just make devices not so power hungry.I got this fancy tire gauge+filler.  It uses a couple coin batteries.  They live around 6 months with it &#34;off&#34;.  I use it a couple times a year, so basically every time I go to use it it is dead.  Removing the batteries requires disassembly.  A year or so ago I soldered in a couple AA batteries in place of the coin batteries, it&#39;s been good so far, but I&#39;m waiting to see.On the other hand, I have a Mitutoyo caliper, which also uses a couple coin batteries.  I sometimes forget to turn it off when I put it back in the case, and so far, over 6+ months, it hasn&#39;t run the batteries out.So it CAN be done.  Both devices are basicaally the same: LCD display and they measure a sensor.Back when I was in HS, I had a Casio calculator watch, but it ate through batteries (3-6 months IIRC). The bracket for the strap broke, so I just taped it up in my locker.  Soldered it to a D battery, and never had to replace it again.  :-)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My most ridiculous experience was when an MP3 player froze back in the day. We had no way to switch off, or pull the battery out, so we waited 2 weeks, until the battery was dead. Then it worked fine after a recharge."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I worked in this industry for many years. The railroads were always hyper-focused on increasing throughput. I left the industry about ten years ago, but back then derailments were considered the most significant risk to average network speed. At the time, average network speed was roughly correlated with profit. The rule of thumb was a 1 mph increase in average network speed was worth about $100MM in profit. That was 15 years ago.There were a lot of systems in place to monitor rolling stock:- Wheel Impact Detectors- Hotbox detectors- Acoustic bearing detectors- Truck performance detectorsTo name just a few. There were also efforts to monitor the railway infrastructure. The things I remember:- Rail stress management (rails need to be under the right amount of stress, which of course varies with temperature)- Top of rail friction management- Rail profile management (the name eludes me, but the idea is you want the interface between the rail and wheel to meet certain parameters)I worked on the rolling stock side measuring wheel impacts, overloads, imbalances, and a handful of more esoteric metrics. One of the outputs of these measurements was a train consist. For each of our locations we were able to build up the consist of the entire train (which was a fun CS problem in itself).I stared at a lot of consists over the years. In North America I never saw anything longer than about 100 cars and 2-4 locos. However, in Northwest Australia they routinely ran 300 car trains meeting the description in this article. But, the reason they could get away with that is they were running a straight shot from the heart of the Pilbara to one of the port towns on the north west shoulder (Karratha and Port Hedland).I need to check in with my old colleagues and see if things have changed. It wouldn&#39;t surprise me if train lengths have gotten longer, but I would be surprised if this correlated with a large increase in derailments, as that would have a tremendous impact on average network speed and thus profit.As someone mentioned elsewhere on this thread, there are a lot of single track corridors. It&#39;s bad enough when one train has to sidetrack. It&#39;s really bad when a train takes out the whole corridor. These aren&#39;t packet switched networks. It&#39;s not easy to reroute. And it&#39;s really expensive and difficult to lay new rail."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I also live in Ames, Iowa, where the author resides. I live less than a mile from the track segment he is talking about, owned and operated by Union Pacific. While I&#39;m pretty skeptical of this author&#39;s individual concerns given the twice-removed nature of the statements from their &#34;source&#34;, trains have unmistakably gotten longer during my 15 years near these tracks, and they are moving faster.A hazmat situation impacting only a one-mile radius around the tracks could effect up to 30 to 40 thousand people here. I interned for Union Pacific while in college, and yes, the company will state that safety is their number one priority, but it was very clear that their business was to profit by optimizing every single little part of their business for maximum efficiency. The company has an open distain for regulations, especially safety-related regulations, and did not shy away from sharing those views internally. I would not be at all surprised if crews are being abused, and safety sidelined, for the sake of maximizing profit."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; For myself: I believe it is Wall Street greed and investor demands. 16,450-foot trains weighing more than 42 million pounds are gratifying someone with power. Someone who wants it all and more. I believe it is those few, who live nowhere near here, who own their own private islands and jets. This is far removed from laissez faire economics, or the neo liberal model, coming out of the 1980s.This was an incredibly common economic outlook coming from the Midwest and South. It&#39;s both tickling and sad to hear. I do love the way this was written, and those PSR trains sound like a nightmare. When I worked the network engineering desk for a Class I railroad we took derails seriously to the extent of pulling anyone who made changes to infra to the dispatchers themselves. That wasn&#39;t that long ago either but it sounds like a lot has changed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The new typeface is nice, providing the required feel without succumbing to cliche, but now whoever is actually using it to typeset titles isn&#39;t doing any kerning! This makes the title look like it is supposed to be &#34;Avata R&#34; (the typographer almost certainly did create proper kerning in the font, but as soon as you start messing with different sizes and increasing the tracking, the kerning is going to have to be adjusted as well, and that wasn&#39;t done).It&#39;s like James Cameron said &#34;Fine! I won&#39;t let my guy I had make the titles last time choose the font, we&#39;ll have a new font made. But I want the my guy to do the rest of the title work, because he&#39;ll still do it for just a crew jacket.&#34;https://www.creativebloq.com/news/avatar-way-of-water-logoAnyway, I quite appreciate the WIP sketches, it makes it plain what the influences are: the bones of the letters are somewhat reminiscent of typefaces like Lithos or Penumbra, and the slight blobbiness of terminals and serifs (which might otherwise be classified as either wedge or flare serifs) subtly recall both Papyrus and some &#34;runic&#34; typefaces. The &#34;runic&#34; influence shows up in some other details as well, like the &#39;v&#39; of the A&#39;s crossbar. The rejected &#34;too extreme&#34; lowercase has a hint of Fraktur or something similar.Like Papyrus, though, this is most certainly a display font. I hope the designer gets to create a toned-down text version that will be usable for subtitles, fixing the other poor typography decision made in the first movie."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I use a &#34;textured&#34; font on my website (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IM+Fell+English, see https://maya.land) and it bothers me all the time that the deformations repeat across letters -- like cracked stone ones where the cracks are the same on every &#34;a&#34;? Because I think mine&#39;s simple enough, eventually I&#39;m going to figure out how to get a similar effect with an SVG filter like the &#34;xerox&#34; one on https://endtimes.dev/."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Preview is one of those essential things that sets macOS apart from the other operating systems, and contributes to that “Mac has good UX” vibe. Last time I opened the Windows equivalent, it tried to sell me on Microsoft’s PDF-alike format… and asked me to connect Office365.Another tiny macOS feature I love is that you can drop a file icon on any Open or Save dialog to select the file in the dialog. On other OSs, this moves the file to the directory shown in the dialog, or does nothing. On Windows, I install Listary to get the same features https://www.listary.com/There are so many other little macOS things that make it easier to work in the GUI - but on HN they’re all overshadowed by the big “wow window management on Mac is 90s unless you install an app” issue, which makes me sad. I’m hoping that the post-Ive Apple - an Apple more comfortable with “pro” users and beauty in utility versus form - will try to fix that one… and bring back all the good Mission Control stuff from Snow Leopard (which IMO is the greatest OS ever released)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really enjoyed working with the Preview team before I retired from Apple. My small group created a private framework that added &#34;document reconstruction&#34; to PDF documents: basically an inferred DOM based on whatever information (mainly geometric) we could use in the PDF document.Our moment of fame game at WWDC 2009, when Bertrand Serlet talked about Snow Leopard during the Keynote. At around the 5:10 mark he talks about performance improvements to Preview. He then goes on to say &#34;There are also lots of little touches. The one I like is about text selection in PDF files. .... In Snow Leopard, we have used a little bit of AI to infer the structure of the document....&#34; (He then demonstrates intelligent selection across columns) [Applause from the audience]. (https://youtu.be/FTfChHwGFf0?t=306)My colleague and I presented the proposal to add this &#34;little bit of AI&#34; to a small group from the Graphics and Imaging department. Bertrand was in attendance, and it was thanks to him that we joined G&amp;I. They were a fantastic team to work with!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"People also forget that you can use Preview to scan documents from your scanner rather than using whatever shitty software came with yours.Also, Preview &gt; File &gt; Import from iPhone &gt; Scan Documents gives you a virtual scanner instead of having to install one of those &#34;scanner&#34; apps on your phone. Its built into your iPhone already!I also use it frequently to change image file types.You can also make a digital version of your signature from a picture of physical version.There&#39;s just tons of small features that work well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I recently visited NYC and I can’t help but feel the city has a wide culture of laissez faire unenforcement. So many grocery and convenience stores in the city have no posted prices for any items, even in the airport. As a foreigner I was pretty shocked but the people I talked to said it was pretty much normal and there’s nothing really that can be done. Mind you we checked and it is actually not legal to have no visible pricing. I’m not sure what it is that’s stopping the city from actually doing anything about it, like the truck issue it seems it would be trivial to enforce."</p>

Here in Germany they can be often seen as garbage truck or fire fighting truck[2] in the cities. An BEV version was announced[3].On the other hand, even tallest semi trucks (here 40 tons class) are allowed to roll through German cities widely. They are often involved in accidents with pedestrians or bicylclists with fatal outcome. The main reason is bad sight when turning right. Therefore turning assistants[3] will become mandatory. However, placing the driver better and giving him more field of view is preferred.[1] https://www.mercedes-benz-trucks.com/de_DE/models/econic.htm...

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I sat on a citizen&#39;s jury about cycling a few years ago and one speaker we heard from (in our lead up to working on recommendations) was from the trucking industry. We knew trucks had poor visibility, that cyclists could get knocked over and swept under the trailer, etc but this guy was an absolute buck-passer and unfortunately he had the rest of the jurors spellbound with irrelevant excuses. He&#39;d admitted that &#39;skirts&#39; on the side of the trucks would make a difference, but there was zero appetite for that change because obviously it would cost transport companies money.Even just better visibility with the side windows has to be fairly achievable.That said, I have a lot of respect for truckers here in Australia. In my experience, they&#39;re some of the more responsible drivers on the road, through sheer mileage and consideration of their heft. They&#39;ll almost always signal when it&#39;s safe to overtake, through necessity they&#39;re wary brakers and so on."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The video interview at the bottom of the article discusses the source of capital for this enterprise to &#34;keep&#34; the peg. The interviewee claims that the source of the capital was basically a crowdfund. The team issued a lot of the tokens, kept a lot of it (about 1/2), and sold the rest. Perpetual motion is possible in finance, but you need fancy licenses and government appointments to do it. These guys are going to prison.This thing isn&#39;t just one token, but apparently at least three. One of them (Anchor) claims a 20% yield on savings. This alone should be a red flag because that&#39;s about 1900 basis points above what you can expect to get from a good savings account or short-term treasury.I don&#39;t have time to dive into the Rube Goldberg machine that this thing appears to be, but when it ends, it will end very badly.Every Bitcoin era seems to have its Ponzi scheme. In 2017 it was BitConnect. They offered something very similar to what Anchor appears to be offering."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So we&#39;ve been in one of the longest bull markets in modern history. I have been amazed at the wilful ignorance of Crypto Andys when it comes to why financial markets, the financial system, central banking, debt and debt markets are the way they are.There&#39;s a certain delight [1] in watching increased market volatility exposing how understanding merkle trees and consensus protocols doesn&#39;t make you an expert on what the financial system is, how it works and why it is the way it is.So lots of countries have tried pegging their currencies to other currencies, most commonly the US dollar. Your ability to do so is limited by how much money you are prepared to throw at it to counterbalance market forces. I mean this is one reason why we moved from Bretton-Woods to floating exchange rates.Central banks have far more ability to defend a peg. Still a pet can be attacked  (eg [2]) if the peg is sufficiently out of line with the market.It&#39;s going to be funny to watch these crypto trainwrecks learn these lessons (again) the hard way.[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCQGQ5qBQTA[2]: https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/08/george-soros-ban..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It looks like this (un-)stablecoin has lost its peg two times in the past. The interesting thing is that&#39;s it&#39;s an algorithmic stable coin: if its price is below a dollar, you can &#39;burn&#39; one UST to get $1 worth of LUNA (a regular crypto currency without an enforced peg). That has a deflationary effect and is meant to raise UST&#39;s price.
Conversely, if UST&#39;s price is above $1, you can burn LUNA to get back UST, inflating the supply and lowering the price.It&#39;s quite the neat idea really -- but I suppose it hinges on people believing that there is a healthy UST-LUNA ecosystem tomorrow that you can use to withdraw your funds if you want. Burning UST to get LUNA doesn&#39;t make sense if LUNA loses enough value by the time you could exchange it for something else, so I assume people rather take the loss on selling UST for less than $1, which would explain what we&#39;re seeing:
Right now UST is at $0.81 and LUNA is down 47% in the last 24h. We&#39;ll see if the system is robust enough to recover from a &#39;bank run&#39;, if you can call it that. It at least isn&#39;t the first time the peg has been broken, and so far it&#39;s stabilized at $1 again every time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"it will be interesting to watch NY (and/or CA) put something like this in place and observe from afar. i strongly feel that states should be much more aggressive running policy experiments if their constituents desire them, and at the national level we all get some benefit of seeing how things turn out in real time.all that said, assuming there is some tangible tax increase, NYC high earners are going to be knocking on the door of 60% combined rates (city, state, federal). tax avoidance and/or relocation services are going to be booming if so."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Coming from a country that has this, there should be caution: it gets more affordable, but you get what you pay for.  In my country of origin, you get a partially-paid-for ride to the emergency room, where you pay for things like casts, non-ward rooms, dental care out of pocket.  There is no prescription coverage.  There is no optometry coverage.  I would wait significant chunks of a year for procedures and diagnostics.  To cover the things that aren&#39;t covered, most have private insurance through work or also out of pocket.Since moving to the US, it is more expensive (than next to nothing), but I actually get good care.  Several conditions that were ignored or misdiagnosed for me are now cured.  My life might be significantly shorter had I not come here.If NY does this, the near zero chance of my moving there ever would go to absolute 0.  It is a terrible system for any place that does not have infinitesimal state or national government expenses and more-than-60% kind of taxes (e.g., Scandinavian countries)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m an MD who trained in NYC. I have also had emergency surgery in the NHS at one of their most prestigious hospitals in London and so I feel like I’ve seen the system a little bit from the inside.It was far cheaper for me than it would have been as a Brit in the USA, but the standard of care was lower. They didn’t have some technical and staffing resources late in the afternoon that would be a baseline in any of the hospitals I’ve been at in the USA. The English doctors were just kind of apologetic and bashful about it, talking to someone they knew was an American doctor who knew what kind of specific diagnostic algorithm was appropriate.The NHS hospital did have really excellent amounts of ancillary staff. Someone brought coffee and tea to me like 3-4 times a day, it wasn’t hard to get my luggage delivered to my bed, etc. Not like that in the USA from what I’ve seen.The NYC hospitals are somewhat financially strained as it is. Especially the public hospitals (Bellevue, Elmhurst, Metropolitan).Also related would be care at the VA hospitals, which is slower/worse than care at NYC flagship hospitals. But as a society we don’t want to prioritize or pay for good care for veterans, so it is what it is.I predict this will continue to basically just produce a more two-tiered system in the US. Most doctors who have a choice (large group practices) will take the wealthy patients with private insurance, and the big hospitals and whomever else who don’t have a choice will be forced to accept the NY single payers (basically the existing model, where the poor and 65+ are already covered under Medicaid and Medicare already). It will likely strain these systems even further, as reimbursements from Medicaid/Medicaid are insufficient to run large health systems which depend on higher rates from private insurers (payor mix). Good luck there.In NYC even more physicians and group practices will try to go to alternate models such as cash-only. Try being on Medicaid or Medicare and finding an outpatient psychiatrist in NYC now as it is. This will extend to more PCPs, chronic disease specialists, etc.Some patients will get better and more affordable care, but some will also get much worse care. It will be interesting to see what happens. I’m not necessarily opposed, but this is absolutely not going to be a clear and decisive win on all fronts as some commenters are suggesting. The US healthcare system, if you have private insurance, is the best in the world already in terms of level of service and access to rapid specialty and high-end care."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Back in the early 2000&#39;s, I taught &#34;computers&#34; to a bunch of kids in DC.  I first started off with how a computer work; IO, CPU, storage and their eyes glazed over.I quickly ditched that topic and went right to building a web page.  Taught them a few HTML tags and they instantly became &#34;webmasters&#34;. They were so thrilled.  They could create blinking text, could make all the fonts pink.  All just by moving around some simple text in NotePad.Most importantly, they were creating things that they thought were only able to be created by &#34;scientists&#34;. I loved how it boosted their own self worth.I&#39;ve stopped teaching a long time ago.  Not sure if there&#39;s still tools out there where a 13 year old kid with no technical experience can immediately get gratification with something so simple on a computer. Maybe it is a time gone by."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My 1996 self feels very seen.I think a lot about the way the web was back in the mid 90s, compared to the bleeding-edge technologies of today, particularly blockchain and cryptocurrency.And one major aspect I keep coming back to is that web technologies in the 90s, and even their descendent technologies now, are simple enough for most technology-literate people to understand, and that carried with it a lot of comfort and trust.For anyone who had been using desktop computers and office software in the early 90s, which was basically everyone who was a student or an office worker, the web was just files on a computer, served over a network, which we already had plenty of experience using. And I think that&#39;s why my father, who was only a little older than I am now when I first showed him the web, grasped it straight away and was supportive of me building a website for his business.These days I&#39;m not spending much time writing HTML files in a text editor and uploading them via FTP; rather I&#39;m writing programmatic code that talks to a database (A database! Just like MS Access or FileMaker Pro), does some processing, and displays the result on the screen with some elaborate JavaScript to make it look and function how I want (I’m happily a heavy user of React for building rich web apps), but it&#39;s still fundamentally the same concepts. Files on servers, accessed over a network and delivering useful information to my browser or app. The beautiful simplicity is still there, and it still doesn&#39;t feel like a big leap from the kind of computing we were doing 1993.The world of blockchains and cryptocurrencies and &#34;web3&#34; feels vastly more opaque and esoteric by comparison and therefore untrustworthy to many of us, which I think is a significant answer to the question that was asked here in the past couple of days: &#34;Why is Hacker News so anti-crypto?&#34; [1].I can&#39;t quite accept that it&#39;s just that I&#39;m &#34;old&#34;; firstly because first heard about Bitcoin soon after it appeared and was excited by its potential, but also because I remember how people older than me reacted when the web arrived, and there was much more rapid acceptance and embrace than there I currently see for cryptocurrency, outside of those who are just chasing quick riches.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31302494"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I miss those times.
I could spend hours complaining about the depressive current state of the web, I imagine being a newcomer to such world and have to handle the over complexity of the current scenario without knowing that things could be simpler.I remember seeing a team member migrating a project from grunt to webpack, the project was just a 404 page. &#34;You need to compile your assets&#34; they say, just a cat *.css &gt; site.css would do it. Or even better, just do it inside the HTML and that is it.People who need a JS library to check if a number is odd or even went way too far, I&#39;m not exaggerating - https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-odd"</p>
