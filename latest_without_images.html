								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Given where ML and CV are today, I&#39;d bet on open source models trained on weeds within 3-5 years. This company can scale, but their unit price is going to plummet. Also, it sounds like they&#39;re using cameras, where it&#39;s concievable that other future sensors could be more efficient. An iteration of this with higher resolution cameras and small flying drones seems like an intuitive next step.This is a super interesting problem because the confusion matrix (fp/fn/tp/tn) rate that makes this economical is going to be variable across both crops, and market demand.If there suddenly there was a demand jump for peas, you could afford to use a model with less accuracy, because you are optimizing betwee a sunk labor cost and margin on your yield. You could literally tune your detection parameters  based on futures price data, since if if prices were high, you could optimize compute on your model. Anyway, spoken as a total outsider, but what a cool and interesting set of problems."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I want to see details on power source and energy usage. That&#39;s where I&#39;m a bit skeptical. To do the 20 acres they&#39;re talking about you&#39;d need one hell of a huge battery, assuming it&#39;s electric. Even just to move the thing. Then add power draw for the laser on as well.Also seems odd to have it be something that is self-powered and autonomous rather than just something you pull behind a tractor on the three point hitch (where you could power off the PTO of the tractor). Seems excessively novel, given most farmers are already spending time going up and down the rows cultivating, etc. anyways. Adds to the cost, and complexity."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Love seeing advances in this space. I have an 80 acre farm and I’m waiting for an autonomous slope mower.Question about this tech is, does it really kill weeds, or just defoliate them? Like, is this laser strong enough to get down to the roots, which are often very deep with weeds?If not, I’m wondering why lasers instead of something mechanical that can corkscrew down and tear up the entire root?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s a great blog entry I just read about this, &#34;On Politics At Work&#34;. I think the author effectively hits on a real problem with a lot of these discussions.https://json.blog/2021/04/26/on-politics-at.htmlTo some folks, &#34;politics at work&#34; means &#34;endless battle royale political debates among coworkers in a Slack all day long; why wouldn&#39;t you be against that?But to others, &#34;politics at work&#34; means &#34;are we paying women and men the same for doing the same job?&#34; and &#34;are our recruiting practices leading to a non-diverse workforce and missing out on great people who should work here?&#34; and &#34;what problems does our company sole, and for whom?&#34;. These are really important questions. Why wouldn&#39;t you want to bring them up at work?I&#39;m giving Basecamp the benefit of the doubt and assuming they&#39;re trying to stave off the former. But it&#39;s not that easy to do that without also affecting the latter, because if you ask questions that boil down to is our company discriminating, even unintentionally and do our LGBT and minority employees feel as safe and valued as our straight cis white employees, someone will be super upset that you&#39;re &#34;bringing politics into the workplace.&#34; (I guarantee someone reading this is thinking &#34;ugh, &#39;cis&#39; is a slur, why you gotta be so political,&#34; and, bang: somebody has just made recognizing the existence of trans people into something inherently political, and now we get to argue over whether that somebody is me or the cis-is-a-slur guy.)Here&#39;s a thought: if your goal is to try to keep company Slack channels civil and focused on work, then don&#39;t say &#34;don&#39;t be political.&#34; Say &#34;keep company Slack channels civil and focused on work.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wasn&#39;t expecting to like these changes after seeing a ton of tweets from rubyists I respect criticizing them, but after reading them... I love them all.Companies becoming vocal political entities over the past few years has been mind-blowing and I&#39;m glad to see companies starting to reel it back and get back to, well, being companies. They make products; they don&#39;t need to have opinions on unrelated things.IMO people (even the people in charge of companies) can (and should) have political opinions! _Companies_ shouldn&#39;t.&gt;You shouldn&#39;t have to wonder if staying out of it means you&#39;re complicit, or wading into it means you&#39;re a target.This line speaks to me a lot. I find 99% of political conversations at work are just pontification and/or signaling; I don&#39;t want to waste precious time at work chatting into echo chambers (or starting fights!) -- especially in a context where my opinion (or my coworkers&#39; opinions) literally _do not matter_.Seems like they handled the paternalistic benefits well also by just providing direct compensation instead. I&#39;ve felt left out of benefits at companies in the past because I didn&#39;t want to use a gym, or buy certain things, etc. It&#39;s kind of the same vibe as smoke breaks at some jobs -- you&#39;re missing out if you&#39;re not a smoker. This seems more inclusive for everyone, and I really appreciate companies recognizing their place in a worker&#39;s life: they sign your checks for what you do during work hours.All in all, these seem like really great changes in theory. With all corporate policies though, we&#39;ll see how they&#39;re implemented in practice."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Issues that directly impact me and mine at my workplace are considered “political” by those of more conservative mindsets.That’s the really ugly flip side of this, and I know it’s been said elsewhere but: conservative politics in the US make some people’s entire existence political, full stop.So you do a lot more than just  cut out “distracting” conversations this way. You uninvited certain people entirely, and in doing so have taken a hell of a stance on that persons inherent worth.You can’t disconnect this from the current US political situation. They’re joined at the hip."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The following quotes are fairly interesting and ironic:&gt; Larry Page and Sergey Brin were originally pretty negative about search engines that sold ads. Appendix A in their original paper says:&gt;&gt; &#34;we expect that advertising-funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers&#34;&gt; and that&gt;&gt; &#34;we believe the issue of advertising causes enough mixed incentives that it is crucial to have a competitive search engine that is transparent and in the academic realm&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem is that google created a negative feedback loop  with the web. People have a tangible interest to game google, which worsens the quality of their AI datasets, which  makes their AI suggestions terrible. There was the expectation that google&#39;s AI suggestions and info boxes would improve over time, but i &#39;ve noticed them getting worse and consider them a permanently broken gimmick now. They probably have the same problem in  their Ads business which tries to optimize revenuesVoice recognition on the other hand keeps getting better because there&#39;s no tangible benefit for someone to game it.Perhaps, crawling the web is the worst way to go about creating a thinking AIIncidentally, i think the solution to web search is peer review: websites ranking other websites, and having themselves punished when they mis-rank (which is what pagerank was originally)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The commercial opinion bit is incredibly annoying. Ask for an opinion and you’ll get 5 pages of custom built “review” sites that offer nothing useful besides copious ads and paid click-through to Amazon.Even when Google knows where I go with my searches, they still refuse to show those sites for anything that might have commercial interest. So much for customized search. I get tired of being the product. Can we get a subscription search engine that’s actually good? I’d pay for that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Pfizer is keeping schtum about the detail of the lab tests it has completed but says it has demonstrated “potent in vitro antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2”, as well as activity against other coronaviruses, raising the prospect of a cure for the common cold as well as future pandemic threats.I have wondered if the COVID-19 pandemic might lead to some results, like extermination of the common cold, that humans would look back on and say that it was a net benefit. Something along the lines of, &#34;yes, 4 million people died, but in fighting COVID-19 we created highly-effective therapeutics for the flu and common cold. Over the following 10 years, these inventions saved 4 million lives and saved 15 million days of lost work/school&#34;.It&#39;s hard to think about these things as we are going through the pandemic, but hopefully there will be some good that comes of it. (Of course, it&#39;s also possible that by thinking we&#39;ve &#39;cured&#39; the common cold, we will open ourselves up to a once-a-century pandemic, where millions are wiped out by what used to just be a common cold.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Awesome!  They should totally go all out investigating this.The rest of us should totally not get too excited.  Many drugs go into phase 1.  Few come out.  There are more phases after that.  Tamiflu got through all of that and still hasn&#39;t been a game-changer for something that kills tens of thousands in the U.S.A. alone every year.But, hey, you have to take a lot of shots on goal before you get one, so I&#39;m glad they&#39;re going after it with a sense of urgency."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really, really wish I could opt out of having accounts with the big 3 credit bureaus. Freezes don’t appear to work - they usually say that I don’t have an active freeze whenever I go to lift one. Or their website is down entirely. Or they won’t let me get to the freeze section without clicking no on their paid monitoring services 8 times. For Transunion all I needed to lift a freeze was the last 4 of my SSN, so how does that help?I don’t want to have my information with these companies. Please let me not participate. It’s like every American was given a Chase Bank account at birth that we can’t close, it’s weird."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My favorite part of this system is when they give you a year of it as compensation for a data breach, saying it’s worth 12x its monthly fee (which they make up). That’s not even touching on the fact that their solution to losing your data is asking you for more of it.I’ve never been lucky enough to be compensated with such a service. But it wouldn’t surprise me if they were so helpful that they even auto-enroll you in another (paid) year at the end of your free trial!One also wonders why reforming the credit bureaus is not a bipartisan priority in Washington. Congress is apparently only interested in fighting over the issues that nobody can agree on. Don’t hold your breath for any progress fixing systems that anyone except a lobbyist can clearly point to as broken.The problems might get some attention if the corporate media chose to hype them, but guess who buys a bunch of advertisements on their news channels?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"  &gt; The best part about this lax authentication process is
  &gt; that one can enter any email address to retrieve the
  &gt; PIN — it doesn’t need to be tied to an existing account
  &gt; at Equifax. Also, when the PIN is retrieved, Equifax 
  &gt; doesn’t bother notifying any other email addresses 
  &gt; already on file for that consumer.

Hang on, so the attacker doesn&#39;t even need to break into somebody&#39;s email account first, they can just guess the questions and put in their own email address?! This is insane."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"HBO Max was delayed in appearing on Roku because of negotiation breakdowns. In the case HBO it was Roku that seemed to have the demands. They are looking at revenue anywhere they can, but if their position weakens look for Google, ATT, and others to simply forgo working with them.I think Roku is in a perilous position in general. They generated a lot of buzz on Wallstreet with their high user counts. They also purchased a DSP to get more into the advertising game. However they are at risk of being disrupted. They do not offer much that is unique and have largely gained and held market position by being the cheapest and easiest to use.Cheap Android TV devices are starting to compete with them on price and tv manufacturers have mostly chosen to create and maintain their own ecosystems.Unless they make some big strategic maneuvers I see them slowly being squeezed out like Tivo."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Roku alleges Google has asked it to favor YouTube music results from voice commands made on the Roku remote while the YouTube app is open, even if the user&#39;s music preference is set to default to another music app, like Pandora.&gt; Roku says Google has threatened to require Roku to use certain chip sets or memory cards that would force Roku to increase the price of its hardware product, which competes directly with Google&#39;s Chromecast.That&#39;s just straight evil - overriding user preferences to favor your own products... Some growth PM and/or business head is trying way too hard to hit their OKRs. I&#39;d be surprised if Google could defend this in court."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ehh... I would wager on Roku being more dug-in here.  For them, control over their hardware is an existential concern.  For Google, streaming television is one of their many dalliances that may or not still be active 5 years from now.Every television that I&#39;ve bought over the past 5-10 years has Roku built into it.  I know that some people prefer to plug in Amazon devices instead, and that&#39;s perfectly fine (not that Amazon is any &#34;less evil&#34; of a company than Google or Roku).  But I use Roku&#39;s platform because it&#39;s usually the hardware default, and I like the UI well enough.I&#39;m already pissed that Google has raised their prices to the point where I no longer save any money compared to what I used to pay for cable+internet.  And then dropped sports coverage for my local baseball team anyway.  If YouTube TV disappears from Roku&#39;s platform, then I&#39;ll just sign up for Hulu or whatever 5 minutes later.  Or fuck it, I might just go back to cable.  These over-the-top, &#34;skinny bundles&#34; have been a bait and switch in practice."</p>
