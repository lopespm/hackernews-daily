								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Facebook and Google have a long history of illegal activities.  If they colluded like a &#34;cartel&#34;, they should be treated like a cartel. The problem is both sides of the aisle have are irreparably entangled with big tech and cannot be trusted to prosecute not just fine them a paltry some that is insufficient to correct their behavior.  People have gone to jail for weed longer than anyone in power at big tech has paid for their gross violations of trust and privacy of the entire world.Edit:Someone believes cartels are just for drugs here is a link about some of our remedies:https://www.globallegalinsights.com/practice-areas/cartels-l...The DOJ can raid them, and states attorney&#39;s can file separate suits. Perhaps there is one state government that hasn&#39;t succumbed to the corruption."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google/Facebook doing shady things to undermine user privacy is a generally accepted fact in this community, so I think that the title understates the severity of the allegations in the article!It contends that there was collusion between Google and Facebook to protect their abuses of dominance in the marketplace:&#34;Google quickly realized that this innovation substantially threatened its exchange’s ability to demand a very large – 19 to 22 percent – cut on all advertising transactions,&#34;...&#34;However, Google secretly made its own exchange win, even when another exchange submitted a higher bid,&#34;...&#34;And as one Google employee explained internally, Google deliberately designed Jedi to avoid competition, and Jedi consequently harmed publishers. In Google’s words, the Jedi program &#39;generates suboptimal yields for publishers and serious risks of negative media coverage if exposed externally.&#39;&#34;...&#34;For example, Google and Facebook have integrated their software development kits (SDKs) so that Google can pass Facebook data for user ID cookie matching,&#34; the amended complaint says. &#34;They also coordinated with each other to harm publishers through the adoption of Unified Pricing rules…&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Brief note about this vs. yesterday&#39;s threads:People who think the tech giants maintain their dominance via patents are 60 years behind the times. It&#39;s network effect plus some outright illegality like this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I remember when google was the shining light of “be nice company” that we all dreamed of working for, at odds with the evil that was M$crosoft.And, from reading all the “why I left google” posts and hearing about them leaving China, the old google of 20 or even just 10 years ago was the good or even just a better google.With how google went from “do no evil” to this, with how Facebook has always been profits over ethics, with how Amazon treats employees generally, etc:Which employers are the “nice company making nice things and you’ll be able to sleep at night” tech companies nowadays?Who should we safely not feel bad about wanting to work for?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow. We&#39;ve just had a thread on how Facebook chooses profits over people (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28955579) and here&#39;s Google complaining that FB &#34;at times&#34; doesn&#39;t choose profit...&gt; Google was frustrated @Facebook was not aligning with it to reduce users’ privacy.“We’ve had difficulty getting FB to align on our privacy goals and strategy, as they have at time[s] prioritized winning on reputation over its business interest in legislative debates.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is pretty damning stuff. Here&#39;s the question I have: there are a ton of quotes in here from employees. In what context were these statements made? In depositions? I would guess not. I&#39;d guess they were made in emails, Google docs and presentations that were a result of discovery (or a whistleblower I guess).If so, I really want to find these people and ask them &#34;what were you thinking?&#34; Any big company has required training on communicating with care. So who are these people who seem to be so careless or oblivious to how those statements might be viewed when exposed? Leadership? Product? Engineering? ICs? Managers?I&#39;d be interested to know more about the allegation that Google declared itself the winner of an auction even if there were higher bids. If that has any substance, that&#39;s... a problem. I really wonder how such a thing could be implemented by engineers without someone raising eyebrows.Oh and once again can we just kill the meme of Twitter threads? I mean seriously."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am a big fan of RSS one of the reasons (alluded to by this article) is the type of content that tends to get exposed via RSS.Frequently the type of content that gets syndicated via RSS is long form and non-commercial.It turns out that these two properties produce a pretty good signal to noise ratio which filters out precisely the kind of trash that has ruined the web over the last decade or two (long form content at least has the possibility of teaching you something or presenting an idea with some kind of rigor; and since RSS isn&#39;t great at monetization, the worst offenders in media tend to deprioritize it).Of course RSS is a very imprecise filter, but it&#39;s basically the antithesis of a Twitter or Facebook feed, where everything is short form and you tend to see whatever serves the platform&#39;s commercial interests (i.e. their definition of engagement).This matters to me because at a certain point I realized -- I have basically never read anything short form on social media which enriched me in a meaningful way.I have learned a lot from studies, reference works, long form analysis, and books -- basically all the quality knowledge I possess has come from one of these sources.At best social media has given me occasional links to these things (scattered among an ocean of junk information).It&#39;s mostly because of how RSS originated with blogs I guess, and who was involved in designing it. But for whatever reason it has been far more valuable to me than any other form of content syndication online."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Remember when every Facebook page and profile had an RSS feed?  And FB messenger was XMPP compatible so you could use it with bitlbee and your favourite IRC client.  And you could email people @facebook.com and it would show up in their messages.Google gets all the “credit” for killing RSS, but there’s plenty of dismay to be spread around!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a regular downloader of BBC Radio podcasts, RSS has been a godsend since they redesigned their site around the godawful &#34;BBC Sounds&#34; mobile style. After the initial pain of tracking down each programme&#39;s own site (which contains a link to its RSS feed) and sticking them in Thunderbird, I can now easily download all the podcasts I want even quicker than before the Sounds redesign."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Recent and related:Flexport CEO on how to fix the US supply chain crisis - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28957379 - Oct 2021 (225 comments)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Truckers are leaving containers all over Los Angeles.[1]Allowing stacking over 2 high is only useful if you have the equipment to stack over 2 high. A place that just stacks empty containers 2 high probably only has large forklifts. The special equipment for high stacking is far more expensive, and only bought if you need it.[2]A more useful proposal is a &#34;peel pile&#34;.[3] This is a system which assigns outgoing trucks an easily accessible container to deliver, rather than a specific container that has to be retrieved. There&#39;s an app for that. This is being implemented by IMC, the largest marine drayage company in the US. They say they&#39;re already up to 8 high stacks in the LA area. The higher the stack, the longer the retrieval time.&#34;This keeps drivers moving and productive, even if they don’t know the exact load they’re getting or the delivery location.&#34; So it&#39;s really dumping the sorting problem on drivers. They have no idea where they&#39;re going next. There has to be some way to separate containers by approximate location to make this work, so a driver knows how far they&#39;re going to be asked to take the thing.How well this all works depends on how well the software organizing the stacking works.[1] https://jalopnik.com/the-streets-of-los-angeles-are-overflow...[2] https://www.bison-jacks.com/why-bison/blog/how-to-lift-a-shi...[3] https://www.peelpile.com/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am a member of ILWU 13. A couple thoughts after reading the comments:The zoning change is for TEU storage outside the port. The port itself was not subject to that rule.The Port of Los Angeles is a landlord and is not directly involved in operations.Private companies, such as APM, EverPort, and others, rent piers/berths and are responsible for the actual operations and logistics.Some speculation: recently I’ve heard of some ships not even waiting to load empty TEU’s as they normally would and instead they are immediately leaving for China, literally empty. I suspect this behavior is what turned the congestion we had before into the quasi deadlock we have now."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A good law IMO is: provide quantifiable anonymity metrics and post it visibly on your website somewhere (like nutrition labels). For example your likelihood of being personally identified is 14%). This obviously needs a body of research to come up with these metrics and methods to verify them. Governments can fund that research.Yet right now all I&#39;ve seen from EU and California regulations have been friction upon friction both for the end user and the service provider:Every website I visit I need to go adjust cookie settings (enable essential and telemetry and remove targeting).So I&#39;d vote for repealing all these useless laws"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I guess maybe I&#39;m missing the scandal, but this is why they employ people in &#34;policy&#34; positions, isn&#39;t it?  It&#39;s rather open that they&#39;re out to alter the law in their favor.e:  Another article in the front page suggests this is highlighted because it draws attention to Google&#39;s supposed pro-privacy position as a sham.  I hadn&#39;t realized they had one but OK."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I joined in 2010 and left in 2019. The company I joined was very different than the one I left. Every single one of Google&#39;s problems can be traced back to scale. Loss of trust, distance to top leadership, tone-deafness, repeated failures, escalating surveillance dystopia, perf management overhead, leaks...all of them are fundamentally due to scale. And scale is simply because greed. Gotta make that 23% YoY revenue growth. That is Google&#39;s true mission. Eat the world. It&#39;s now $180 billion in revenue. In five years, that will need to be $400 billion. And five years after that, it will need to be pulling close to a trillion."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"“Quite a few activists and researchers were fired for asking Google to be a bit more ethical”In the examples the author cited, those activists and researchers were fired for reasons going beyond “asking Google to be a bit more ethical. And frankly it doesn’t seem ethical for activists, researchers, and the author to deliberately misconstrue facts whenever they believe they’re on the right side of an ethical (and sometimes just political) issue."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think it’s interesting that the good things about working there had nothing to do with the employer and the bad things had everything to do with the employer.Indeed, this line is the takeaway, in my opinion: “…is because we&#39;ve been at least a little brainwashed into thinking a job at Google is the pinnacle of employment.”I haven’t worked for one so this take might be quite hot, but I get the sense that big tech companies do a great job selling you on the idea that they’re elite and therefore you must be elite too if you get the job. But then you’re really just another fungible developer in a pool of tens of thousands. There’s exceptions of course."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think Microsofts&#39; long-term plan is to get most developers to use cloud-based coding environments, which is not unlikely given that software stacks become more complex to the point where setting up a local development environment is really hard. Once they achieve that they&#39;re in a very good position to sell their own cloud services by making the integration into the development workflow really smooth.So their acquisition of Github and the large effort invested in VSCode as well as privileging their own software stack over competing solutions makes perfect sense, business wise. It probably won&#39;t be good for free software though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m generally weary of MS having too much influence over open source with Github and VSCode, particularly due to their history.My creep alarm went off a bit when I recently started a project to test the waters with TypeScript.  I was asking on a forum how to deal with native JS dependencies without types, and he answer I got was &#34;Are you using VSCode?  It will just find the community maintained type packages for you&#34;.It seems to me that VSCode&#39;s &#34;just click the button to solve my problem&#34; style of UX makes it very easy for developers to become reliant on proprietary workflows without even realizing it.  If one were to pursue an EEE strategy, this would not be a bad way to start."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Microsoft promising `dotnet watch` for a while and then dropping that certainly doesn&#39;t help with the already pretty damaged view of Microsoft not caring about open source developers. Here is the gist of the situation from Microsoft&#39;s point of view:&gt; Throughout the last year we’ve been working to enable the best possible Hot Reload experience in Visual Studio 2022 and .NET 6. Part of our goal was to also explore making this feature available to customers through a variety of mechanisms such as bringing the full power of Hot Reload to as many .NET and C++ developers as possible when running through Visual Studio 2022 debugger, supporting Hot Reload when running .NET 6 apps without the debugger, and the very basic Hot Reload support we added to the .NET SDK tools through dotnet watch.&gt; As we reflect on what was accomplished, and what is still in front of us, the backlog continues to grow. This includes many high value scenarios that will benefit the broadest number of developers, including focus areas such as .NET MAUI, Blazor, adding support more types of edits, more optimized experience when working with XAML apps, and much more.&gt; With these considerations, we’ve decided that starting with the upcoming .NET 6 GA release, we will enable Hot Reload functionality only through Visual Studio 2022 so we can focus on providing the best experiences to the most users. We’ll also continue to pursue adding Hot Reload to Visual Studio for Mac in a future release.So, first they wanted &#34;bringing the full power of Hot Reload to as many .NET and C++ developers as possible&#34; but now they shifted to &#34;focus on providing the best experiences to the most users&#34;.Best part of this whole thing is the pull request which was opened (https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/22217) but &#34; locked and limited conversation to collaborators&#34; straight after opening it as Microsoft anticipated the backlash but still went ahead with the change.Seems they still have a lot to learn before they can indeed be trusted."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a common technique in embedded products, but I should point out that it&#39;s not useful for general purpose Raspberry Pi work.The author disables several important kernel features to boot faster, including network support and USB support. Obviously, if you plan to use network or USB then it&#39;s not an option to disable those. You can disable some of the other debugging features and little extras for a slight boost, but it&#39;s going to be negligible (&lt;1s, in my experience).The biggest change comes from removing the init system entirely and replacing it with the user-facing app. This is the fastest way to get your app started, but now you&#39;re responsible for doing everything that was previously handled by the init system. The author can do this because they don&#39;t have any network, timekeeping, or other system functions normally handled by the init system. They only needs to mount filesystems, which is easy to replicate inside of the app.Anyone planning to ship a Raspberry Pi based product should read this article carefully as a great starting point. Anyone who wants to use their Raspberry Pi for general purpose use or even with network connectivity or USB devices will be disappointed if they try these techniques. Great article, but it&#39;s a narrow use case."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Talking about optimizations for raspberry pi, does anyone knows if there is any low power mode configuration available ?

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great job! I am building a CNC router in my spare time and I ended up using a raspberry pi 3 since I want to cram in a ton of features and esp32s and stm32s are simply not cutting it. And cutting the boot time is something I spend stupid amounts of time on. The best I was able to achieve was just under 8 seconds. I&#39;ll have to dig into this and see if there is something more I could do."</p>
