								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"HIV is incredibly sophisticated. It&#39;s actually kind of amazing how effective it is. I mean obviously the resulting disease is bad, no question. You can still appreciate the sophistication.HIV has resisted efforts to develop a vaccine for 30+ years at this point.I am already beginning to wonder if the 2020s will be the story of the social transformation caused by mRNA vaccines. An effective and relatively cheap HIV vaccine will be huge.Apart from Covid and HIV, mRNA is going to have a huge effect on the flu vaccine too. For anyone who doesn&#39;t know, predictions are made about what flu strains will dominate the coming winter 4-6+ months ahead of time and the vaccine is made from that. Those predictions may not be accurate, which largely explains the variance of efficacy. mRNA has the potential to reduce that down to 1-2 months so you can potentially react to the actual dominant strains.Cancer of course isn&#39;t a single disease. Even something like lung cancer are a collection of different diseases. But some cancers are caused by viruses. A notable example is cervical cancer where it seems like most cases are caused by HPV strains. Australia is on track to essentially eliminate cervical cancer by 2035 [1]. To be clear, this isn&#39;t an mRNA vaccine.But mRNA vaccines may greatly reduce the time required to develop a vaccine and make it possible to eliminate whole classes of diseases.This is all super-exciting.[1]: https://www.vcs.org.au/blog/our-impact/news/australia-can-co...."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Video of the lifecycle of HIV.  To me it&#39;s absolutely mind-blowing to think that this entire process developed on its own, in dark, and is mindlessly progressing along so effectively that despite all of our technological capability we can barely contain it.https://vimeo.com/260291607(also how awesome is the music?)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The graveyard of HIV vaccines that failed at Phase II is unfortunately large, and this isn&#39;t even there yet.  I won&#39;t be holding my breath on this one.  HIV is tricky."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What shocks me most with this story is that there is a vaccine (Lymerix), and it&#39;s pretty effective (76-92 percent after three injections) but apparently some anti-vax propaganda and a class-action lawsuit essentially removed it from the market. Based on a very rare side effect. Wtf? How can that be? Just tell people the risks of side effects, and if they are ok with that risk then the manufacturer is off the hook.I&#39;d totally take that shot. 59 cases out of 1.4 million is nothing, and even for those it&#39;s unclear how they actually were related to the shot.Sadly, this indicates that the new shot could suffer the same fate. Give it to a million people, some will for sure have some issue, anti-vaxers come with conspiracy theories and convince a few to a class action, and there we go, another few decades without a shot. Gotta be fast this time before it&#39;s too late again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a US new england-er, this is game changer for walking through woods.For those un-informed, on a walk through any woods, you should always wear high socks, and do a full body check for ticks after.Deer ticks can be as small as a few grains of sand, and near undetectable if they latch on unless you have sharp eyes.Obviously they can transmit lymes.I had a close encounter a few years ago, but very luckily giant rings appeared around the bite site, making it a very easy diagnosis.That only happens in 30% of cases though. The rest likely have no idea, and over time the disease will work it&#39;s way into your nervous system, causing permanent damage if not treated quickly enough."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know this is about Lyme disease, but let me add another word of caution while we are discussing ticks.  Two years ago I was bit by the Lone Star tick. Since that time I developed an allergy to all red meat. It was hard to diagnose and a few of the doctors I worked with along the years still don’t believe its true.  If your interested in learning more search for Alpha Gal.  There is an excellent Radio Lab podcast about it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I recommend almost anything else at all other than Zoom.As a security researcher that has reported a number of issues to Zoom, I can say without reservation they are one of the most security negligent companies I ever worked with.It was evident after multiple calls with their team they didn&#39;t employ anyone strong technically in their US offices and had no idea how to translate security issues, even obvious ones like DNS takeover, to their (I assume China based) eng teams.The software was designed without security as even a thought as many researchers have demonstrated. To this day the clients expect administrative access for no reason. I refuse to install them and tolerate the webapp when people insist on Zoom.A friend and I compiled this list to consider.https://gist.github.com/dacruz21/dd2480f195f5b48a9ab7af8b41c..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Offer a comparable alternative, then. I spend half my day on meetings either internally or with clients, and every time I have to jump on a client meeting with Microsoft Teams/Google Hangouts/WebEx/GotoMeeting because their company bans Zoom, it&#39;s a recipe for a fruitless meeting. Someone will fumble the sharing controls; screens will take forever to present; at least one person&#39;s microphone will become inaudible, static-y, or suffer from &#34;robot voice slow-down&#34; lag.To say nothing of the clusterf*ck that happens when two company-specific instances of Microsoft Teams try to communicate with each other and I&#39;m left with a bunch of orphaned chatrooms with outside personnel after the meeting concludes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like I live in a bizzaro world...First, I’ve been working remotely over skype, audio-only, for over a decade.
Yet in 2020 and with the emergence of zoom, it’s suddenly become an expectation that everyone is incessantly and awkwardly staring at each other through screens for the  whole workday.Second, the few times I’ve used Zoom it’s been absolutely garbage, with video and sound dropping or just not there (this was a university paying for Zoom’s services).Yet I use teams everyday, and while I have plenty of complaints about it, at least I can get the sound and (screen-sharing) video that I actually need for my work."</p>

					<h3><a href="https://physicstoday.scitation.org/do/10.1063/PT.6.2.20210817a/full/?af=R&amp;">Lawrence Livermore claims a milestone in laser fusion</a></h3>
				</div>
				<div class="story__comments">
					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28211726">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The article mentions losses at the hohlraum but doesn&#39;t mention losses in the laser. &#34;Ignition&#34; means they controled the implosion well enough to break (almost) even on laser energy, but the laser itself is less than 1% efficient on wall power. Input energy to the entire system is over 400 MJ per shot. Even at max theoretical fusion yield, it wouldn&#39;t come close to breakeven.There&#39;s also a firing rate issue. Even if the system produced net power, significant production would require many shots per second. Currently, the laser flash lamps are expendable and it takes on the order of a day (and lots of money) to prep for each shot.Some of these drawbacks were addressed in the LIFE proposal, which would use fusion neutrons to burn fission fuel in a blanket around the fusion chamber. You could burn spent reactor fuel subcritically (no fission chain reaction), for example. But then it&#39;s a fission machine, and criticality excursions aren&#39;t much of an issue in conventional fission reactors. In the end, there are many drawbacks and little benefit with such a setup -- even if it worked.I love lasers, and NIF is a marvel. But there really is no sensical story about power production in it. Even the machine&#39;s stated purpose -- stockpile maintenence -- is highly dubious. It is really an elaborate welfare machine, given to weapons scientists in exchange for their support of testing bans."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Herrmann noted that in previous experiments, neutrons exiting the capsule on one side of the implosion arrived a few picoseconds earlier than did those flying off the opposite wayLet’s all just take a step back here and marvel at this statement. We (science-humans) are capable of building a machine that can detect and quantify picosecond level variances in neutrons traveling in an enclosure.  We can do amazing things.Side note - the lab is just down the road from me, I’m proud of my fellow Livermorons, and continue to hope they keep all those megajoules contained."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reading the info so far...I would advise a frugal dose of 
moderate optimist toned down with a spice of healthy scepticism:&#34;The lab hasn’t yet reproduced this month’s results, and Herrmann cautioned that doing so might not be straightforward. “We don’t know what variability will be in successive shots. It’s a nonlinear process where alpha heating heats up the fusion fuel and creates more fusion, which creates more heat.” Herrmann says the 3.5 MeV alpha particles, which remain in the plasma, produced 20% of the fusion yield, with 14 MeV neutrons accounting for most of the energy.&#34;&#34;The lab is still analyzing the results from the shot. It’s not yet known which or what combination of advances to the targets, laser pulse lengths, or other variables led to the leap in performance. Some of the instruments were saturated by the unexpected yield of the reaction. A few that are used in the target chamber for other, non-ignition experiments will need repair.&#34;&#34;Herrmann acknowledged that the announcement deviates from the standard practice of peer-reviewed publication. But the results, he says, were leaking, “so we wanted to put it out so people could discuss the facts.”  &#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Zoom has a popular feature which allows for screen sharing a single application window instead of the entire desktop. I assume this is how its discovering running applications with GUI windows open in a cross-platform manner. Perhaps there is a better API for this? Its not a common use-case that an app would need to know all of the other open windows, but it seems like a perfectly valid use case, and frankly handy for sharing a PPT without fear of an embarrassing email showing up in during a meeting."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Why would it do that?We can answer part of that with just a little more reading.  What&#39;s pid 3844872?For me, the series of queries against /proc happen from a process that, just a bit earlier, called exec.  So it&#39;s not really zoom reading &#34;all processes and arguments&#34; but ... `pidof gnome-session`, so I guess zoom is looking for the pid of gnome-session.To what nefarious purpose zoom intends to put this knowledge of gnome-session&#39;s pid, I can&#39;t say - I am not running gnome-session so my trail goes cold; but at least for me, for that particular run, zoom itself doesn&#39;t actually see the contents of all of those files."</p>

				<div class="story__comments">
					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28197103">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have no specific comment to make on the (first two chapters of the) book recommended by this blog. However I have become wary of people recommending a textbook because it finally helped them understand something they had tried to wrap their head around for years.I heard a conjecture once that the best textbook you&#39;ll find on any given topic is your third. The point, of course, is that it simply takes about three serious attempts to make it click - but it is a fallacy to give all the credit to the third book."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m curious what the target audience this book is for. The chapter &#34;Our Goal&#34; says that the books is to teach programmers how to engage mathematics, but programmers have wide range of mathematical maturity. The second theorem in the book is as follows:For any integer n &gt;= 0 and any list of n + 1 points (x[1], y[1]), ... , (x[n+1], y[n+1]) in R^2 with x[1] &lt; x[2] &lt; ... &lt; x[n+1], there exists a unique polynomial p(x) of degree at most n such tat p(x[i]) = y[i] for all i.So, it seems the author assumes that a reader will have math maturity of a good senior high-school student, as most of students wouldn&#39;t need to worry about property of existence. The book also covers the proof of such theorem with formal notations and the proof is built up with previous theorems -- a pretty standard way in math books which nonetheless requires math maturity of a good high school senior. The table of contents also shows that the book will cover linear algebra, calculus, and group theory in a whirlwind. Again, such content demands close-to-college-level math maturity. I&#39;m also generous here, as public schools of the US do not really teach that much formal math.So, here is the dilemma: people with this level of maturity should already be good at math or have access to other materials to help them with math. People who do not possess such maturity will not go through the book anyway, or have more beginner-friendly materials to read. Note I&#39;m sure there are exceptions, but I question the percentage of such exception."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I maintain that it isn&#39;t just hard, it is computationally impossible.We should all know that given a belief about the world, and evidence, Bayes&#39; Theorem describes how to update our beliefs.But what if we have a network of interrelated beliefs?  That&#39;s called a Bayesian net, and it turns out that Bayes&#39; Theorem also prescribes a unique answer.  However, unfortunately, it turns out that working out that answer is NP-hard.OK, you say, we can come up with an approximate answer.  Sorry, no, coming up with an approximate answer that gets within probability 0.5 - ε, for 0 &lt; ε, is ALSO NP-hard.  It is literally true that under the right circumstances a single data point logically should be able to flip our entire world view, and which data point does it is computationally intractible.Therefore our brains use a bunch of heuristics, with a bunch of known failure modes.  You can read all the lesswrong you want. You can read Thinking, Fast and Slow and learn why we fail as we do.  But the one thing that we cannot do, no matter how much work or effort we put into it, is have the sheer brainpower required to actually BE rational.The effort of doing better is still worthwhile.  But the goal itself is unachievable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are some good bits in here. I love the subtitle especially: &#34;The real challenge isn’t being right but knowing how wrong you might be.&#34; Knowing when not to provide an answer is hard. A big part of my job is communicating statistical findings and giving a good non-answer is much harder than giving a good answer, both technically speaking and socially speaking.One thing I&#39;ll add that drives me nuts is the fetishization of bayesian reasoning I see some times here on HN. There are times that bayesian reasoning is helpful and times that it isn&#39;t. Specifically, when you don&#39;t trust your model, bayes rule can mislead you badly (frequently when it comes to missing/counterfactual data). It&#39;s just a tool. There are others. It makes me crazy when it&#39;s someone&#39;s only hammer, so everything starts to look like a nail. Sometimes, more appropriate tools leave you without an answer.Apparently that&#39;s not something we&#39;re willing to live with."</p>
