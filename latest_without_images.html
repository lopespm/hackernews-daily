								<p class="story__comment_others">"Egyptology is so fascinating. When I was in primary school, the teacher did a really special lesson I&#39;ll never forget. The classroom was decorated like a tomb - the windows were blacked out and the tables were arranged in a way that we had to crawl in to start the lesson. We went through puzzles and explored pyramids on the projector. When some pupils were distracted by the table tunnel, the teacher stayed in the character of an archeologist and warned them to keep away for the tunnel may collapse at any moment. Now that&#39;s teaching."</p>

					<h3><a href="https://sharats.me/posts/shell-script-best-practices/">Shell Script Best Practices, from a decade of scripting things</a></h3>
				</div>
				<div class="story__comments">
					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33354286">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hands down, shell scripting is one of my all time favorite languages. It gets tons of hate, e.g. &#34;If you have to write more than 10 lines, then use a real language,&#34; but I feel like those assertions are more socially-founded opinions than technically-backed arguments.My basic thesis is that Shell as a programming language---with it&#39;s dynamic scope, focus on line-oriented text, and pipelines---is simply a different programming paradigm than languages like Perl, Python, whatever.Obviously, if your mental model is BASIC and you try to write Python, then you encounter lots of friction and it&#39;s easy for the latter to feel hacky, bad and ugly. To enjoy and program Python well, it&#39;s probably best to shift your mental model. The same goes for Shell.What is the Shell paradigm? I would argue that it&#39;s line-oriented pipelines. There is a ton to unpack in that, but a huge example where I see friction is overuse of variables in scripts. Trying to stuff data inside variables, with shell&#39;s paucity of data types is a recipe for irritation. However, if you instead organize all your data in a format that&#39;s sympathetic to line-oriented processing on stdin-stdout, then shell will work with you instead of against./2cents"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Use bash. Using zsh or fish or any other, will make it hard for others to understand / collaborate. Among all shells, bash strikes a good balance between portability and DX.I think fish is quite a bit different in terms of syntax and semantics (I&#39;m not very familiar with it), but zsh is essentially the same as bash except without most of the needless footguns and awkwardness. zsh also has many more advanced features, which you don&#39;t need to use (and many people are unaware of them anyway), but will very quickly become useful; in bash all sorts of things require obscure incantations and/or shell pipelines that almost make APL seem obvious in comparison.In my experience few people understand bash (or POSIX sh) in the first place, partly because everything is so difficult and full of caveats. Half my professional shell scripting experience on the job is fixing other people&#39;s scripts. So might as well use something that doesn&#39;t accidentally introduce bugs every other line.Most – though obviously far from all – scripts tend to be run in environments you control; portability is often overrated and not all that important (except when it is of course). Once upon a time I insisted on POSIX sh, and then I realised that actually, &gt;90% of the scripts I wrote were run just by me or run only in an environment otherwise under my control, and that it made no sense. I still use POSIX sh for some public things I write, when it makes sense, but that&#39;s fairly rare.I think bash is really standing in the way of progress, whether that progress is in the form of fish, zsh, oil shell, or something else, because so many people conflate &#34;shell&#34; with &#34;bash&#34;, similar to how people conflate &#34;Google&#34; with &#34;search&#34; or &#34;git&#34; with &#34;GitHub&#34; (to some degree)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Use set -o errexit&#34;Only if it doesn&#39;t matter that the script fails non-gracefully. Some scripts are better to either have explicit error handling code, or simply never fail. In particular, scripts you source into your shell should not use set options to change the shell&#39;s default behavior.&#34;Prefer to use set -o nounset.&#34;ALWAYS use this option. You can test for a variable that might not be set with &#34;${FOO:-}&#34;. There is no real downside.&#34;Use set -o pipefail.&#34;Waste of time. You will spend so much time debugging your app from random pipe failures that actually didn&#39;t matter. Dont use this option; just check the output of the pipe for sane values.&#34;Use [[ ]] for conditions&#34;No!!! Only use that for bashisms where there&#39;s no POSIX alternative and try to avoid them wherever possible. YAGNI!&#34;Use cd &#34;$(dirname &#34;$0&#34;)&#34;&#34;Use either &#34;$(dirname &#34;${BASH_SOURCE[0]}&#34;)&#34; or grab a POSIX readfile-f implementation.&#34;Use shellcheck.&#34;This should have been Best Practice #1. You will learn more about scripting from shellcheck than 10 years worth of blog posts. Always use shellcheck. Always.Also, don&#39;t use set -o nounset when set -u will do. Always avoid doing something &#34;fancy&#34; with a Bashism if there&#39;s a simpler POSIX way. The whole point of scripts is for them to be dead simple."</p>

Hundreds of millions of Indians probably use it and if the company were to suspend service because the Indian government mandated a backdoor all hell would break loose!For the same reason both Australia and the UK haven&#39;t as of yet forced WhatsApp to install a backdoor, even though legislation forcing them to do so is already in place there."</p>

					<h3><a href="https://adguard.com/en/blog/ad-blocking-is-under-attack.html">Ad blocking is under attack (2017)</a></h3>

					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33356513">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is my article from 2017.Here&#39;s a short update on what happened since then:1. DMCA takedowns did not destroy ad blocking (thank god), but there were a couple more times when it was tried, nothing huge though.2. Streisand effect is a thing and the domain in question was blocked by everyone and everywhere. There was even a special filter list and later a browser extension which only purpose was to block such domains. It got some traction but later got abandoned: https://github.com/paulgb/BarbBlock. If something like that happens again I am pretty sure it can be revived very quickly.3. The corporations still try different angles to prohibit ad blocking. The last example I know about is something like this: Axel Springer claimed that the web page and all its content (including subrequest) and ads is subject to copyright law. So when you modify the web page with adding new styles or blocking a web request you violate the copyright."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While the article is from 2017, the relevance is high today.Large adtech companies are coalescing and supporting a single browser framework that gives them a modicum of control around how adblockers are integrated into the extensions, while also funding directly or indirectly realistic browser competition through Firefox (sorry Brave and Vivaldi... still a ways to go market share-wise). The economist in me thinks there is formal and informal coordination to make this ad &#34;market&#34; exist (no one wants ads, really, they want search engines with relevant results) and there is exercise in market power to the detriment of businesses purchasing advertising (and waste to society writ large)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ad blocking is by definition attacking ads and all the companies and interests that revolve around that.So ad blocking is and always will be &#34;under attack&#34;, that was always expected, &#34;small&#34; players, like individual news sites for example have been fighting ad blocking for years, now big players are feeling the heat too and since ad blocking is an &#34;existential threat&#34; ( Meta just learned that ), they no longer ignore it or &#34;kinda deal with it&#34;.It always has been a war. And like every war, there are endless philosophical theories and discussions about the &#34;sustainability&#34; of the Web &#34;without ads&#34;, the  tracking, etc.But the reality is: It always has been a war."</p>

Charging people $2,500 for wrongthink is simply asinine. They must be betting BIG on either woke politics being mainstream for the long term, unbreakable bonds with their existing customers, or both. I can&#39;t even think of someone around me that uses paypal regularly.I will be interested in reading the technical report on how they plan on implementing this because I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be silicon valley diarrhea.
