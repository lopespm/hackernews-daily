								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m usually a defender of the single screen on the Model 3/Y, but on this, the author is right: the new UI (v11) is terrible compared to the previous one (v10).Not only does it hide commonly-used safety-relevant functions behind extra taps in sub-menus (as detailed), it was apparently done to free up space to offer a &#39;dock&#39; of app buttons - three permanant and three &#39;recently used&#39;.  I struggled to choose three apps I needed enough to fill the permanant spaces - and certainly don&#39;t need quick access (when I&#39;m driving!) to Netflix, or games, or whatever is popping up in &#39;recently used&#39; today.  I would like the driver profile menu to be quickly available, but alas that&#39;s been hidden too.It&#39;s a total cluster-f*ck that makes no logical sense when considering the need of drivers, and I hope they listen and revert at least this aspect of the UI."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; &#34;The problem isn’t really that complicated: originally the defroster icon was visible on the bottom. With the latest December 2021 update it is now hidden behind the temperature indicator. Tapping the temperature brings up a sub-window with the defroster icon.&#34;Even after reading that, I had to look at the pictures again, and read the paragraph again to find where you are supposed to tap. When they simplified the UI, they also removed the degrees symbol and the fan.Seeing as how 60-70 are both reasonable temperatures in Fahrenheit and speeds in miles per hour, it is not at all clear at a glance what that number means.(Disclosure, I work for GM)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The manufacturer changing the UI of a car after you bought it should be illegal or at least highly restricted.I think many of us have been incensed by UI changes in software we use for our daily work, and that&#39;s already bad enough; but IMHO this really crosses a line.There were jokes when Apple changed the scroll direction, comparing it to the steering wheel of a car suddenly working opposite to what everyone is used to; I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s possible to do that with a Tesla or other modern car, but it&#39;s disturbing that we seem to be headed down that path. What an absurd reality.The icons-only UI is also a huge regression; would it really take much extra effort to add a text label? I know people often mention localisation when it&#39;s brought up, but much of the world knows English, this is an American car sold in English-speaking regions, and changing the text in software is much easier than a separate part with different printing.(I drive a 50-year-old land yacht that&#39;s received many upgrades, but all under my control; so my perspective may be slightly biased...)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In case you’re wondering what happened, from the thread:He sent ETH to the WETH contract, received WETH as expected.Then he wanted to do the reverse and sent WETH, but will not receive anything, because you&#39;re supposed to swap your WETH to ETH in exchanges like Uniswap, or call the &#34;withdraw&#34; function in the contract.For contracts that want to only work with ERC-20 tokens, you use WETH, which comes from a contract that takes 1 eth and gives you 1 WETH.A known problem with ERC-20 tokens is that transferring them to a contract that isn&#39;t made to access them is equivalent to burning them. You should almost never transfer ERC-20 to a smart contract. You instead use approve to give the smart contract permission to withdraw, then call the function you want to receive and tell it to make the withdraw (the contract will internally call transferFrom)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Since no one seems to think about how this could have prevented, here is a simple way, which I&#39;ve applied to lots of things in life, not just cryptocurrency transfers:- If you&#39;re making a transfer somewhere with a large amount, do a small transfer first and verify it&#39;s working. Confirm at the receiving end before moving big sums.- If you&#39;re calling a contract, try it with a small amount first. Verify the parameters multiple times, and verify the return values multiple times.- If you&#39;re doing something with a huge sum of money, do it in steps instead of all-at-once. Fees won&#39;t be as big since you&#39;re already dealing with a huge sum of money anyways- Verify verify and verify that everything went alright with the small sum before trying to do something with a big sum- If you&#39;re tired, don&#39;t do it. Wait until you got some sleep- If you&#39;re rushed, don&#39;t do it. Wait until you&#39;re not rushed, have a tea and think about it- When in doubt, verify it and don&#39;t be tired- If you&#39;re not an expert, have someone who is do verification above for you"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Just throwing my 2c into the well, as someone who used to be highly &#34;pro-science&#34; but lost confidence in much of academia and the validity of scientific research in general after starting a PhD and seeing how the sausage is made.The biggest problem science is facing is not an external threat from a rabble of ignorant science deniers, but the complete degradation of quality within the scientific institutions themselves.Most research is flawed or useless, but published anyway because it&#39;s expedient for the authors to do so.  Plenty of useful or interesting angles are not investigated at all because doing so would risk invalidating the expert status of the incumbents.  Of the science that is communicated to the public (much of which is complete horseshit), the scientists themselves are often complicit in the misrepresentation of their own research as it means more of those sweet, sweet grants.  The net result is the polished turd that is scientific research in the 21st century.&#34;Educated&#34; people can say what they want about how important it is to believe in the science and have faith in our researchers and the institutions they work for.The fact remains that if one were to assume that every single scientific discovery of the last 25 years was complete bullshit, they&#39;d be right more often than they were wrong."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The issue that plagues us is a lack of trust in long-standing societal authorities.We can&#39;t follow the entire scientific proof chain for every piece of information we encounter, because we don&#39;t have time.So we rely on authority to some extent, whether that be peer review, government, independent bodies, etc.We need to be able to trust that these bodies are telling us the truth and aren&#39;t seeking to mislead us. Because when we start to doubt them, we then inevitably elect alternative bodies, simply due to limited thinking capacity/time - as explained above it&#39;s impossible to do otherwise, no-one derives from first principles every opinion they hold.The best way, _overall_, to convince someone to do something, is by clearly explaining to them the positives and negatives and letting them come to their own conclusion.It doesn&#39;t always work, and there are specific situations (e.g. someone is holding a gun to your face) in which the cost/benefit analysis is very different - in such a situation, the short term is all that exists, the long term effect of misplaced trust is irrelevant - you simply have to neutralize them.But in general, I&#39;m absolutely sure that education over coercion is the correct approach for society.Because if you force them, sure, you&#39;ve got a short term win, at the long term cost of trust. What is the long term cost of lost trust?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Based. Nullius in verba [1]. The whitewashing of censorship is accelerating the erosion of trust in the institutions, and it&#39;s refreshing to see a long-standing institution take a bold stance.[1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nullius_in_verba"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is handy, but the good news is that if you&#39;re dealing with anything made in the last 30-40 years, it&#39;s all but guaranteed to have the ETRTO measurements marked on it somewhere.Practically speaking there are two rim diameters you&#39;ll likely come across on all but old, &#34;unusual&#34; or high end bikes:559mm: the ubiquitous &#34;26 inch&#34; mountain bike tire. Has largely fallen out of favor on high end mountain bikes, but there are zillions of bikes with 559mm wheels and frames sized for them out there. On high end mountain bikes, largely displaced by 29&#34; or 27.5&#34; setups.622mm: &#34;700c&#34; road rims or &#34;29 inch&#34; mountain bike rims. Nearly universal on modern road bikes. If you have something else on a new road bike, you probably already know it.Other sizes you might find in the wild:630mm: The largely obsolete &#34;27 inch&#34; road rims. uncommon on new bikes, but you&#39;ll still find plenty of them on older bikes. Not even the slightest bit interchangeable with 622mm. Usually, you can&#39;t even switch to 622mm rims on frame built for 630mm because the brakes won&#39;t reach 4mm closer to the axle. Easily mistaken for 622mm if you aren&#39;t paying attention.584mm is the &#34;27.5 inch&#34; mountain bike standard that splits the difference between 26&#34; and 29&#34;. If you have this, you probably know already.Once you&#39;ve got the rim diameter right, the tire width is pretty straightforward: if it looks right, it is right. It&#39;ll be pretty obvious that a &#34;29 inch&#34; mountain bike tire doesn&#39;t go on a road rim, even if the diameter on both is 622mm. If you have needs under which that doesn&#39;t apply, you&#39;re probably already aware of them.You can put hooked tires on straight sided rims safely (I have), but likely not the other way even if you could find dedicated straight sided tires.Tubulars are a while &#39;nother animal, about which I know nothing :-)ETRTO made it much, much simpler to get the rim size right when all of the various standards had different names to different people."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"https://www.sheldonbrown.com/tire-sizing.html  has (i think all?) of the edge cases you&#39;re going to encounter in any bike made after about 1925."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Huh. I thought the C in 700C indicated that the tire was a clincher as opposed to tubular but that seems to be wrong.You tool says:&gt; Reifenhöhe C: ca. 39 mm (French designation)but it says that for 700x19C as well as for 700x40C which seems odd?The wikipedia page for Bicycle wheel [1] says:&gt; The ISO 5775-2 standard defines designations for bicycle rims. It distinguishes between 1. Straight-side (SS) rims 2. Crochet-type (C) rims (...)and also&gt; Road wheels may be designed for tubular or clincher tires, commonly referred to as &#34;700C&#34; tires.but it doesn&#39;t explain the B in 650B.Sheldon Brown [2] says (emphasis added)&gt; A second number or letter code would indicate the *width* of the tire. (26 x 1.75, 27 x 1 1/4...650B, 700C...)The wikipedia page does mention both 650B and 650C and that the ISO diameter differs by a few mm. So if I understand right, these codes (650B and 700C) specify the full-wheel diameter (650/700) and the letter indicates how much of that diameter the tire needs to make up, i.e. a 650B rim is slightly smaller (571mm) than a 650C (584mm) and the tire needs to make up that differencxe to get to 650?[EDITED] 700C rims are ISO diameter 622mm, which matches with 2x 39mm tire width: 622 + 78 = 700mm. So I guess the intended tire height at time of standard-invention was 39mm?But in practice a 700x19C rim-tire combo will be smaller in diameter than a 700x40C so I guess they&#39;re not fully &#34;700C&#34; standard compliant?[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_wheel#650B_gravel_bicy...[2] https://www.sheldonbrown.com/tire-sizing.html"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is extremely common. In their 30s, people get married, have kids, and move to the suburbs. Finding and keeping friends in your 30s is quite a challenge.Some tips:- move to a city - things are much much easier in a city as people are more transient, groups aren&#39;t as established, and new people arrive all the time- it sounds like you have some friends - ask them if they have any friends in your area you should meet platonically- the easiest way to make friends is an activity: you mentioned a hobby, but it can be anything - a running group, the gym, board games, etc. The more non-nerdy, the more likely you are to find non-nerdy people- if you&#39;re like me, you struggle to make friends because it&#39;s not &#34;easy&#34; like it was in college. Friends in your 30s take work: reaching out, texting, scheduling, planning, etc.- it sounds like you&#39;re not in therapy. So let me be the first to tell you that you&#39;re depressed (that &#34;apathy&#34; you&#39;re feeling is depression). Which is fine, it happens us all. But go to therapy because that&#39;s how you solve that. Just try it for a month, no pressure."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;they&#39;re all full of lonely developers and other socially awkward people - short guys looking for girlfriends, unattractive/aging women looking for husbands, etc.&#34;So...people like you?
you sound really judgemental man.Since you have no friends(so nothing to hold you where you are, right?), and apparently a good source of income, I&#39;d advise you to go remote, travel, try digital nomadism, go to meetups, meet other travelers, maybe try coworking spaces? hacker houses/airbnbs with people from lots of different places?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have often been told im good at making friends and I think you can make them anytime, anywhere, anyhow, the first thing to focus on is your personal mindset and build from there:  1. Just say yes. When someone asks for anything, say yes, no matter how big or small (help them move out, look after their dog) This will put you into novel situations.
  2. Show genuine interest in things. Ask why, learn more, dig deeper, keep conversations going by trying to share anything you think is slightly relevant.
  3. Dress up. Wear things that stick out, even just a bit, a funky shirt, a nice bright pair of socks, use these to add flare to a standard dark blue and grey world, people will reflect back and be interested in you.
  4. Pick one new thing you want to master (not online) my advice here for all round great friend activities - Rockclimbing, Pub Quizes, Boardgame nights, Cycling, Pottery. Each of these almost always need another person to make them work and that helps you grow your confidence.
  5. Don&#39;t work so hard. Tell your boss you wanna slow it down, try and do 4 day weeks, give back some commitments, take a pay cut. Don&#39;t quit just slow it down and give your head some space.

I&#39;m 35, I just quit my /Director of Product role at a successful startup because I wasn&#39;t happy. I&#39;m about to go to Thailand to learn how to become a yoga teacher, not for a career but for a disciplined adventure that will deeply enrich me and is nowhere near a computer! You can do it! Put a plan in motion.HN Believes in you! :D"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Most of the comments here are focused on the question of why you would prefer an app to calling. The author&#39;s point is a great one though, and something I&#39;ve wondered a lot. Why should I create an account to order a pizza? The app should reduce friction even from the very first order. Instead it adds, and adds for every order... Got to go look up coupon codes! On the phone I just ask the guy what their best deal is in a large cheese and garlic knots and he gives it to me. The app or website should make my life better but instead it&#39;s harder.Worse, the app pretends to be an unrelated party when something goes wrong. &#34;Sorry, you need to call the store. Look up their number, it&#39;s on the website.&#34; For me it doesn&#39;t add anything to the transaction, it only takes away.The literal only reason I use the pizza app at all is for chains where I have no idea which store delivers to me. Rest of the time I&#39;ve gone back to calling. Much faster that way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My local pizza place in Seattle has moved the technology the other way. Here’s the dialog when I call.  “Pagliacci Pizza, how can I help you?”
“I’d like to order a pizza”
“Sure thing. Is this John Smith?”
“Yes”
“Do you still live at 1234 Main Street”
“Yes”
“Would you like to order the same thing you did last time?”
“Yes”
“Ok, it’ll be there in 20 minutes”Even better, while you talk to the store you called, the order goes into some sort of pizza load balancer and gives the order to the least busy store with a good drive time to your house.I’d seriously like to buy/have a beer for/with whoever designed it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That is the happy path. It has a lot more possible sources of error/time consumption than the app and there are many benefits to the app.1. The line is busy. The app is next to never busy.2. The line has static and you are not heard correctly. Especially problematic for delivery or complicated orders. Or they may get your name wrong. My first name is common and my last isn&#39;t great over the telephone.3. You have to remember what you ordered each time. Apps let me quickly re-order.4. You cannot easily pre-pay (irrelevant if you have cash, but if you are like me and wish to never use cash again, having to pull out the card is annoying rather than just grabbing the pizza).5. Most places now seem to be on DoorDash, so you can just order from there and avoid the additional friction. You also know you can get excellent customer service from DoorDash while a new restaurant is an unknown."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I agree with your general point that the search quality has gone down, quotes doesn&#39;t even always work anymore to get exact results.Looking into your suggested example: That turned out to be interesting and unexpected.So, the exact string you put here was &#34;David, we have been expecting you - this is what you have been searching for - this place, David, is where dreams are born&#34;, which is what you get when you copy the text from the website.

                           been searching for - this place, &lt;br&gt;David, is where dreams are born.”

If you take any snippet of text that doesn&#39;t do a line-break, it seems exact searches do work, like &#34;expecting you - this is what you have been searching for - this place&#34; or &#34;deep and melodious when it spoke&#34;.If you do take a snippet that does a line-break, then it cannot find anything, like &#34;David, we have been expecting you&#34; or &#34;this place, David, is where &#34;It seems that Google as unlearned how to treat different type of whitespaces, especially when the author/software has introduced manual line-breaks via the &lt;br/&gt; HTML tag.I&#39;m sure they have at one point introduced some &#34;quality filter&#34; that gives higher score based on how well the markup is made by the websites, for one reason or another, and eventually it got so &#34;improved&#34; or established that even if it&#39;s the only relevant hit for a human, the computer simply ignores the result for low scoring, since the markup is not 100% correct."</p>

It also takes away most of the pain from virtual machine management w/ native hypervisors.If you&#39;re looking for customizability (boot image, docker version, container runtime), minikube is probably your best bet. It even comes with some rudimentary file-sharing and port-forwarding primitives, but it isn&#39;t as batteries-included as Docker desktop. On the other hand, you have full ssh access to the VM to do whatever you want (+startup scripts, etc.)Awhile back, I wrote up a comparison of all the Docker Desktop Alternatives.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know people doing docker dev are generally targeting a Linux of some sort, but why the heck doesn&#39;t the macOS kernel support native containerization?Come on Apple. Microsoft can do it.edit: this seems like a new development since my last whine/complaint on this topic:https://macoscontainers.org/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The favorite replacement that I have found for docker desktop is to run docker-ce in lima vm [1]. It’s only a couple of commands to get up and running with their docker example [2]. Basically:brew install limalimactl start docker.yamllima is built on qemu, which is always a solid choice for virtualization. It also supports M1 Macs, and even Intel on Arm emulation (at a pretty hefty performance cost).One of nice features of lima is that it automatically forwards ports from the host vm to guest, so when you start up a container listening on port 5432, for example, you can access it at localhost:5432. This works nicely in particular for local development while using a VPN client, which I have found has a tendency to interfere with local network traffic (if split tunneling is disabled).lima is used under the hood in rancher desktop, which is another great option if you would prefer to have a gui. But I have settled on lima as I prefer the CLI for scripted installations, and also find it to be more customizable.I have also seen colima mentioned in the comments, which appears to wrap lima with some prebuilt configurations. I don’t really think this is necessary, and seems like something that could just as easily be done with a gist, but if you are looking for the absolute quickest way to get up and running with docker (and optionally kubernetes) on lima, then this could be it.[1] https://github.com/lima-vm/lima[2] https://github.com/lima-vm/lima/blob/master/examples/docker...."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; This is strange, in a way, since the series does not present an obviously alluring portrait of creative collaboration. Its principal locations are drab and unglamorous: a vast and featureless film studio, followed by a messy, windowless basement. The catering consists of flaccid toast, mugs of tea, biscuits and cigarettes. The participants, pale and scruffy, seem bored, tired, and unhappy much of the time. None of them seem to know why they are there, what they are working on, or whether they have anything worth working on. As we watch them hack away at the same songs over and over again, we can start to feel a little dispirited too.Are you kidding me?? This is probably the most inspiring part of the whole show! This is how you create things. It&#39;s a long, &#34;unglamorous&#34; slog full of dead ends, muck &amp; mire, and discovery. This is what gets an artist excited - the oeuvre in gestation, the birthing pains, the grim determination depsite not knowing whether you&#39;re pursuing genius or madness! Gets me fired up every time.The completed creation is usually a bit of a downer, like when you finish a good book."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you ever played in a band, even if it&#39;s a middle-aged-friends-with-minimal-talent one, you&#39;ll enjoy Get Back immensely. It looks so real. Even if you weren&#39;t in a band, but in some other kind of a team of peers, you&#39;ll enjoy how group dynamics plays out. I still didn&#39;t manage to watch part 3, but first two are pure gold."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Beatles fan since 1963 here. Easily the best thing I&#39;ve ever read about them. All the mind-reading, which I generally hate in profiles like this, is pretty well justified by context. For anyone creative, Peter Jackson&#39;s &#34;Get Back&#34; can be both heartening and devastating: the former because it reminds you that a lot of creativity is sweat equity, and the latter because holy shit, they just had it like no one else."</p>
