								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi there, Signal-Android developer here. I updated the issue to reflect this, but this bug has been fixed. I was tracking it on a separate issue, and had forgotten to close this one.We do, in fact, take issues like this very seriously. This bug was extraordinarily rare, and because we have no metrics/remote log collection, there was an initial period where we had to spend time adding logging and collecting user-submitted logs to try to track it down. As soon as we were able to pick up a scent, it was all we worked on, and we were able to get a fix out very quickly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Several years ago, when I worked at FB, I ran into a similar bug on an early internal version of a Messenger rewrite. Sent pictures to one chat, showed up in another.My bug report on it kicked off an absolute maelstrom of dev activity and investigation. High level engineers showed up in the comments. Lots of immediate followup. The severity was clearly understood and resolving it was clearly prioritized.I exclusively use Signal now, but the discrepancy between what I see here and what I saw there is pretty disheartening. This kind of bug is not only a massive privacy risk, but it also massively erodes user confidence and trust."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Fantastic ride and if you follower her Twitter she&#39;s been doing a lot of very detailed exploration of her endurance limits in preparation.When the lead group fell to 3 they had an 11 minute lead.She broke free and went solo with 40km to go.When she finished that lead had eroded to 2 minutes as the front group she dropped had been caught.So in those 40km she lost 9 minutes of lead she had built with the help of the breakout group.This was all strategy and then a tremendous physical performance on her part.Dutch team needs a serious kick in the ass for underestimating an &#34;amatuer&#34; in this regard.  It was obvious she was in it for the gold or nothing; and they fatally assumed it would be the later.Fantastic win when you consider training, strategy, and performance all came together to pull it off.  This is what olympians are all about!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some additional context for those who don&#39;t follow professional cycling: the Dutch women&#39;s team was incredibly strong coming into this road race. All 4 riders on their team are stars in their own right, and the only reason there wasn&#39;t a clear favorite for the race overall is that people weren&#39;t sure which Dutch rider would win.So you have a complicated group dynamic, where the majority of the peloton has no interest in pulling the group to catch the break, since they would just get beat by one or more of the Dutch riders, and the Dutch riders didn&#39;t seem to have a clear plan on how to control the race and who would sacrifice their chances and work on the front for the rest of the team.As others have said, there were no radios allowed for riders in the race, so all information about the breakaway came from the race director&#39;s car trailing the peloton. This was a well known fact about the race coming in, and it&#39;s the same way that the annual World Championship race is run. It&#39;s normal for riders to drop back to the team car to get information about the break, and the lead moto for a group of cyclists will occasionally show time gaps on a whiteboard.At least one of the Dutch riders claimed to have known about the lone rider off the front [1], but somehow that information didn&#39;t make it to the rest of the team. It seems that most of the peloton didn&#39;t know (or didn&#39;t care) how many riders were up the road, and the Dutch team failed to communicate amongst themselves and establish a plan.All that leads to Kiesenhofer&#39;s solo move working out. All credit to her for an extremely strong ride.[1]https://netherlandsnewslive.com/miscommunication-and-underes..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"(More related to the comments than the article) I&#39;ve seen tons of takes on this since watching the end of the race this morning and, although it certainly played a part in deciding the outcome, it&#39;s a shame that more focus has seemed to be on making excuses or how the Dutch riders messed things up instead of Dr Kiesenhofer&#39;s incredible story and ride.Kiesenhofer was on a fantastic day: van Vleuten&#39;s earlier attack from the peloton made no inroads to Kiesenhofer, assuming the time gaps shown on the TV were correct.Watching on the TV we knew there was still a rider out front and, even if the race &#34;ardoisier&#34; (blackboard holder) wasn&#39;t the best, team management should have figured out a way to get that information to the chasing pack. I mean, the race finished on a motor racing circuit with pit lanes containing team helpers! It&#39;s not like it was like stage 16 of this year&#39;s Giro, where poor weather stopped race images being broadcast[1].[1] https://cyclingtips.com/2021/05/gallery-amazing-images-from-..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Pretty much. The best way to insert supply chain exploits is to embed them in a stack exchange answer to a beginner&#39;s question.This isn&#39;t new, we&#39;ve always had programmers who programmed by &#34;recipe&#34; rather than first principles, and DRY paints that as a feature, but it underlies a lot of pain and cost over the years.To give some context, I inherited some kernel code when I worked in the Systems Group at Sun Microsystems in the 80&#39;s that was written by a mathematician who had become a programmer because the money was in programming, not applied math. They had cut and pasted code they didn&#39;t understand in order to achieve the result they wanted out of the code they were &#34;writing.&#34; When I inherited it I read through it and found a couple of dozen ways the code would panic the kernel[1]. Once fixing those obvious issues, it became clear that the original owner of the code didn&#39;t really understand what computation did. They had an idea, and mathematically they could show that it was correct, but literally no ability to express that algorithmically.This is not a &#34;new&#34; problem but it is an important one that managers of software engineers need to watch for.[1] At the time the only difference between &#34;kernel&#34; programmers and &#34;application&#34; programmers was that kernel programmers recognized that unsafe code crashed the whole system, not just the application. So they tended to be cultivated from paranoid programmers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some time ago I found this video series on YouTube about how to build a PHP application from scratch. Ten hours worth of XSS, CSRF, SQL injection, badly coded authentication, you name it. When confronted, the instructor said that he did not want to confuse the beginners with all of that security stuff. I just thought &#34;ok&#34; and moved on.Now I went back to this guy&#39;s YouTube channel and saw that half a year later he finally did upload a bonus episode on how to mitigate SQL injections. One person in the comment section actually thanked him for the much needed video because their site was getting hacked. It is pretty hilarious to see this unfold but I do feel bad for the ~10k people who watched his videos."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I freelance fixing and maintaining legacy web apps, almost always PHP.Anecdotally I see SQL injection vulnerabilities  in about half the code I look at. It’s one type of problem among many other problems and vulnerabilities in code written by amateurs and often copy/pasted.PHP programmers can find lots of resources online. Some of those are terrible, either very old or written by amateurs excited to show how they got something to work.I have seen the same kind of thing with Java and Python, but the popularity of PHP means there’s a lot of junk info and examples online.PHP has supported safe SQL and safe HTML for decades, but the programmer has to understand the problem and the solution."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Author of the Damn Interesting post here. Internally we worried that there would be some fallout from abandoning our Facebook page--by the numbers we had more followers there than any other social media platform, by far. But the response from our audience has been almost 100% positive, even from our Facebook followers[1]. It put only a tiny dent in our site&#39;s daily traffic. It resulted in many new subscribers to our email list. There was a flurry of new donations, with attached supportive comments about the amputation. Facebook was exactly the gangrenous thing it appeared to be, and we are better off without it. If you will permit me the indulgence of quoting my own post:&gt; Some call it a “necessary evil,” but if that’s the case let’s do all we can to make it unnecessary.For any organizations considering the same move, I cannot recommend it enough. It feels like cutting off contact with a toxic acquaintance--equal parts relief and optimism.[1] https://www.facebook.com/DamnInt/posts/10158097374656961"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just wish more people and especially companies would join this movement to leave.I hate that the city I live in has almost zero online presence.  If I want to sell something, everyone says &#39;use FB market.&#39;
As someone who refuses to, I have a ton of stuff waiting for the yearly yard sale.The neighborhood I live in also only posts updates to FB.  So cue the monthly surprise(garbage not picked up, road repaving, etc) and never knowing about it in advance.And don&#39;t get me started on companies with zero website and only some FB page.I know it&#39;s &#39;free&#39;, and at this point it feels petty, but I&#39;m literally holding out until the end."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So Facebook is no longer showing all posts to people who intentionally subscribe to a page? If so, what, if anything, does “subscription” or “following” mean, then?I realize I’m showing my age here, but I remember when missing an issue of a paper “subscription” was cause for anger and resulted in an apology from the publisher (and usually a redelivered copy). But I also remember when “follow” meant “show me all new posts from this user” on Facebook, too, back before they fucked up the News Feed in the 2010s and turned it into their manure delivery system."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Just as a point of comparison, one of the programs San Francisco introduced during the pandemic was &#34;safe sleeping sites&#34;, which are parking lots where homeless can have their tent without it being periodically swept by police. To that, they add chemical toilets, a water supply and (I&#39;m not sure why) 24/7 security staff. For this, the city pays around $60k per tent site per year. I&#39;m not sure if this is in part due to some unsavory relationship between the org administering the program and some city official.
Recently the program was extended. It would be cheaper to rent apartments at current market rates, even in San Francisco.Our revealed preference seems to be that we&#39;d rather have homeless people live in tents than have poor people get free or nearly free housing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The fundamental problem with Agile is the fundamental problem with all product development:The customer doesn&#39;t know what they wantAgile assumes as a first principal that including the customer throughout the development process will align the building team and the customer to come to the same conclusion.This is almost never actually true. Having built and managed a lot of products I can state fairly confidently that the amount of time the customer has, and clarity about the problem they want solved is orders of magnitude more ambiguous than is required to actually build and deliver something to their satisfaction.In my opinion successful products, and I mean ones with significant flywheels with customers and viral growth and stickiness are with few exceptions - accidents. It was someone who had an interesting thought and a lot of people for whom the product was good enough for their desire that they often didn&#39;t even know they hadYou can&#39;t write down how to do that, it&#39;s like asking a nobel prize winner how they came up with their discovery. It&#39;s not repeatable. Some people have better intuitions than others and these are the people who are repeatably successful with products. But it doesn&#39;t generalize.That said, the fundamental problem isn&#39;t wrong in theory, it&#39;s just naiive in practice."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Agile is a generic umbrella term that involves a vast array of complex, subtle knowledge and skills. It&#39;s like saying &#34;Engineer&#34;, or &#34;Chef&#34;. Each has a shared skillset, to be sure. But each category&#39;s members can&#39;t just work the same way at all jobs, and there&#39;s no book on how to be an Engineer or Chef everywhere.The Agile Manifesto is a failure at trying to make Agile happen because it can&#39;t tell you how to make it happen, because it varies wildly. No manager can read a book on how to &#34;Agile-ify&#34; their org, they have to apply their brains and figure out how their specific version of &#34;Agile&#34; will work. But the skill-set required to do this is not a Managerial skill, it is a lower-level-worker skill. But it&#39;s also a very advanced lower-level-worker skill.And that&#39;s why things like &#34;Agile&#34;, &#34;DevOps&#34;, etc will fail. People at the higher end have no clue how to make it happen, and people at the lower end who have an idea how to make it happen don&#39;t have the power to make the organizational changes to do so. You need a way for the lower-end people to tell the higher-end people what to do, and have the higher-end people listen to them, and make the changes happen. This is very hard in a traditional organizational hierarchy, because higher-end people have big egos and bigger concerns over things like politics."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not an expert on this subject, but I feel like &#34;agile&#34; could be summarized as &#34;a process for actively incorporating feedback early and often&#34;.That doesn&#39;t mean you need points or tshirt sizes or constant status meetings. You just need channels of communication with the right people and a chance to adapt to what they say."</p>

These invalidated pages, which still contain the data, remain present until a block fills up with them and a true deletion is initiated.&gt;Accessing flash memory that has been factory reset in this way does require some amount of technical skill and specialized equipment, but nothing that is a real barrier to the average enthusiast working at home.By that logic my iPhone 11, my Android phone, my Mac or my Windows PC doesn&#39;t wipe personal content either after factory resetFeels like a bit clickbait-ishBut at least Macs have a built-in 7-pass erase option to comply with DOD standards https://techpatio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/disk-utilit..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This explanation infuriates me so much. 
They use technical terms and true technologies to lie about their security issues and measures. Flash memory should easily withstand north of 10k write/erase cycles, base on type.
Even if there was somehow some very low limit, users’ request to delete personal &amp; sensitive data should be honored and any cost.
But then again, we’re talking about people paying actual money to have these devices in their homes."</p>
