								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"    This periodic adjustment mainly benefits scientists and astronomers as it allows them to observe celestial bodies using UTC for most purposes

This is incorrect, dealing with leap seconds is a major problem in astronomy, requiring a data file or even recompile any time there is a new one announced.  Since they are only ever announced 6 months in advance, it creates a lot of logistical problems.Astronomy algorithms usually work in Barycentric Dynamic Time, or Terrestrial Time, or UT1.  In reality the whole invention of UTC is so that people don&#39;t have to deal with those systems on a daily basis.The process most astronomy programs go through is to get the UTC from the user, convert the Gregorian date to a Julian day number to get rid of the Gregorian Calendar altogether.  Then look up the number of leap seconds, add those to the JD to get International Atomic Time, then add 32.184 seconds to get Terrestrial Time.  If Barycentric Dynamic Time is needed, you must first compute the velocity of the Earth relative to the solar system barycenter (which itself requires TDB), then compute the relativistic effects of that motion on Terrestrial Time.  If you need UT1, these can only be obtained by observation from the International Earth Rotation Service, and required daily updates, and interpolation of values in between observations.So, as you can see, leap seconds do nothing to make an astronomer&#39;s life easier.  In fact, we jump through a lot of hoops to make the average person&#39;s life easier.  It sounds like Meta wants to change the definition of time for everyone just to make their programming a little easier.  I find the very premise just out right ridiculous.It&#39;s true that your average person will not be affected by the Sun setting a few seconds earlier.  But eventually it will build up enough error that it eventually has to be addressed, and Meta is just trying to make their problem someone else&#39;s problem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Everyone is treating this as some idiosyncratic proposal of Facebook&#39;s, but removing leap seconds is a mainstream position.  Representatives of the US, China, France, and a majority of other countries were in favor of this when it was discussed at the 2015 ITU meeting [1] though the UK and Russia&#39;s were not.  This has been under discussion since at least the 2003 ITU meeting in Turin.[1] https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2015.18855"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Can&#39;t help but agree with 80% of this post but strongly disagree with the solution. This feels like a hack that punts the problems to the future.UTC has the leap second cause it&#39;s not &#34;real time&#34; and so now we&#39;re just gonna never sync up UTC to real time at all? How is that the solution? Either we deal with leap seconds or we need to implement something that can&#39;t go backwards and properly models time. Leap seconds seem much simpler...In the end we didn&#39;t get rid of SQL cause of SQL Injection. We fixed the frameworks and promoted the solutions. We may simply need to make a push for languages and etc to just properly support time and promote how to do things correctly. It honestly seems easier."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In my experience on small teams that I&#39;ve been on - a key motivator for people is shipping products and features. The sooner and more frequently you can do this the more positive reinforcement there is for the entire team - not to mention reduced risk of something never making it to the target users.Teams that have figured out the optimal way to get product and features into the hands of users as quickly as possible are the happiest teams because it&#39;s evidence that they&#39;re working together efficiently to meet their shared goals."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is why when leading an engineering org I narrowed down to one metric:Committed to Completed RatioIt encourages completing things and only committing to what you can complete.It&#39;s legible, easy to understand by engineering, product, and management, pointless to game, and positively reinforces completion. It&#39;s quite difficult to accurately predict when a complete feature will ship, let alone a whole product. But, if one breaks down a feature into its legible constituent components and then commits to completing just what is within that (which also necessitates any required communication to arrive at understanding the requirements) then over time you can get quite good at predicting what you will be able to get done in a sprint and better at only committing to what you believe you can actually complete."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article is very thorough, but makes one fairly big mistake: it assumes there is low variability in task size.This could be a reasonable assumption if you&#39;re very good at adjusting scope, but I would be skeptical unless you have measured it and have the numbers to prove that in practise, tasks indeed turn out to be roughly the same size (±20 % or whatever -- I don&#39;t know the exact threshold.)Why this matters is that under cheap context switches and even modest task size variability, it&#39;s -- surprisingly -- a performant queuing policy to pre-empt the currently processing task to handle every incoming task. The intuition behind this is that if a task is still processing when a new one comes in, it&#39;s likely to be a &#34;big&#34; task, and it&#39;s worth letting small tasks ahead in line. Reduces mean response time.Of course, this could all be moot anyway because context switches are certainly not cheap for software engineers. I just thought I should mention it for nuance. Rules of thumb only get you so far, at some point you have to more accurately model the situation and simulate."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Honestly, I think $7,000 delivered for this is a pretty good price. It would make a nice farm vehicle, especially with that dump bed. It&#39;s in the same price range as a lower end UTV and looks like it would be far more comfortable doing, e.g., snow clearing duty. Swap in a set of BFG Mud Terrain tires and you&#39;re all set.Some feedback on reliability, the rust issues, etc. would be nice but I&#39;d seriously think about getting one. As for it not being street legal, well I live out in the country. Golf carts, UTV&#39;s, ATV&#39;s, minibikes, on the roads around here are not at all unusual. Not legal, but I only know of one case of someone getting ticketed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Re: the Rust optimized implementation, I was able to get ~20-25% better performance by rewriting the for loops as iterators, using Rust&#39;s byte range pattern matching, and a buffered writer, which seems crazy, but it&#39;s true.  I chalked it up to some crazy ILP/SIMD tricks the compiler is doing.I even submitted a PR[0], but Ben decided he was tired of maintaining and decided to archive the project (which fair enough!).[0]: https://github.com/benhoyt/countwords/pull/115"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those curious about Rust optimization, the “optimized” version makes three changes compared to the “idiomatic” version:* It uses byte strings instead of UTF-8 strings. In my opinion, that’s not an optimization, that’s changing the problem. Depending on the question you’re asking, only one of the two can be correct.* It uses a faster hash algorithm. It’s not the first time this came up in a benchmark article. Rust’s decision to use a DOS-safe hash by default (and not provide a fast algorithm in the std, like other languages do) really seems to hurt it in that kind of microbenchmark.* It uses get_mut+insert instead of the more convenient HashMap::entry method, because the latter would require redundantly allocating the key even in the repeat case. I’ve hit this problem in the past as well. Maybe the upcoming HashMap::raw_entry_mut will make this kind of optimization cleaner."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love using the UNIX shell (pipes and programs that do &#34;one thing well&#34;) to the point where it hurts my ability to improve at other other languages. But sometimes all you need is a throwaway command to do something once, not a beautifully optimized function that will be written, improved, compiled, profiled, reoptimized and then executed a billion times. The utter tersity of a bash one-liner just tickles me."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I looked into GNS a little while ago and what I understood about how it works is:1. I runs on top of GNUnet, which is a huge DHT that can be used for any purpose you like.2. So GNS aims to replace DNS with a newer &#34;modern&#34; protocol, it is not a alternative root zone (like Handshake or such), nor does it decentralize the root zone, it just decentralizes &#34;DNS&#34;.3. How it is supposed to work is, instead of OS bootstrapping using root servers, they are preloaded with a root zone public key (possibly belonging to ICANN) or a list of TLDs (with corresponding owner public keys). Then the key owner can publish zones signed with the corresponding keys on the DHT, which recursively contains keys for child subdomains. It&#39;s like if torrent and DNSSEC had a baby.4. To lookup a domain, you do a request with (tld, pubkey) and verify the response, do this recursively for each label until you have the record you want.5. The problems with DNS it solves is: censorship (DNS is very easy to intercept and censor), query privacy (I don&#39;t know how this works, they don&#39;t seem to use onion routing or something), and secure resolution.One thing to note here is development on GNS started in the 2001s, this was before DNSSEC and DoT/DoH were a thing, and most of the DNS was unsecured (which albeit even is today), and this could have been a completely viable approach."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This might be an unpopular opinion, but I think that decentralized DNS, and decentralized naming in general, is one of the few use cases that can be neatly solved by a blockchain, but is extremely hard to solve any other way.A major problem when designing a decentralized naming system, or any naming system at all really, is preventing malicious users from grabbing all the cool names for themselves. The only way to do this is to make acquiring domains costly, and blockchains are a perfect way to enforce that in a decentralized manner. Other problems include accurately tracking domain ownership and letting the owners transfer domains to others, which cryptocurrencies have solved long ago. As an added benefit, because all domains in such a system are owned by a public key, we suddenly no longer need a root of trust for TLS, instead, we accept any TLS certificate signed by that public key."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; How can a legitimate domain owner tell other people to not use his name in GNS?&gt; A: Names have no owners in GNS, so there cannot be a &#34;legitimate&#34; domain owner. Any user can claim any name (as his preferred name or &#34;pseudonym&#34;) in his NICK record. Similarly, all other users can choose to ignore this preference and use a name of their choice (or even assign no name) for this user.This is confusing me. How is it not a problem that randoms can just claim other people&#39;s domains?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I also think that C# and .NET are awesome. Especially latest releases dotnet 6 and upcoming 7 have a ton of new things to be even more productive.I like the fact, that you can develop command line apps, Web APIs, Desktop Apps and smartphone apps all with the same toolset, including the fact that deployment is possible on nearly every major platform for every major platform (except iOS and macOS Apps, as always only on macOS). Even systems programming and AOT is doable or full featured static deployment is possible integrating a small runtime into a single binary.And boy is .NET fast...This facts made Golang pretty interesting to me, but what I did not like here is the lack of a usable cross platform Plugin-Loader technology, most of the stuff has to be monolithic, then the module management and some of the missing concepts (like generics, which is also now available in go).The sheer amount of concepts in C# is overwhelming (from basics like Generics to less common ones like Extension-Methods, operator overloading, etc.).I don&#39;t like Visual Studio as IDE, but VS Code is an acceptable alternative tool, although I personally prefer the non-free JetBrains Rider.Nuget package manager also has it&#39;s caveats, e.g. that the official repo can only &#34;unlist&#34; packages, not delete them or that the publish times sometimes have horrible delays, but that&#39;s also still acceptable, since you can use the github package registry or bring your own to overcome these issues.Technologies on my todo list include getting into MAUI (a cross platform UI stack) combined with Blazor[1], which can use Web Components in native UI apps and develop TRULY cross platform (Web, Desktop AND Mobile with the same codebase). Like electron, but without the browser dependency due to native integration.Although everything is tied pretty tight to Microsoft, there is a huge open source community developing cross platform libraries, that are easy to use. Even though i find that microsoft has often made strange decisions in the past, the current state is clearly a recommendation to have a look.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eIsQ3Pm2bE"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The thing I miss the most with C# and dotnet is offline documentation. With Java, I can install the java-17-openjdk-javadoc package and have the full API reference (at /usr/share/javadoc/java/index.html), and download a couple of PDF files to have also the full language and bytecode specification. With Rust, I can install the rust-doc package and have the full API and language reference (at /usr/share/doc/rust/html/index.html). But so far, I haven&#39;t found an equivalent for dotnet, unless you&#39;re running Visual Studio on Windows. When you want to learn by leisurely browsing the API documentation and language reference, the speed difference is massive: the online documentation takes a bit of time to switch from one page to another, while with offline documentation it&#39;s nearly instant."</p>
