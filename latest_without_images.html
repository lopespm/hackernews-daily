								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Code is my favorite technical book of all time [1]. Charles does an amazing job of building a computer up from basic principles &#34;two young boys who want to communicate after their parents tell them to go to bed at night&#34; all the way to modern (for 1999) computers. He layers abstraction on top of abstraction all the way to a working computer. My only (slight) disappointment in the book is that he tries to cover operating systems -&gt; object oriented programming in a couple of chapters at the end. That could have been a multi-volume series in its own right.It goes really well with Elements of Computing Systems (2nd ed) [2] which I kind of think of as a &#34;lab manual&#34; where you get to build a computer from first principles.[1] https://www.amazon.com/Code-Language-Computer-Hardware-Softw...[2] https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Computing-Systems-second-Pri..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This book was absolutely essential when I was first sinking my teeth into software programming. Things that seemed either arbitrary or completely mysterious suddenly made sense now that I had a contextual understanding of how computers worked. Without having that knowledge, I think my career would have been vastly more difficult and frustrating.While I understand many “get started programming” books/tutorials put an emphasis on getting coding asap, I really had to stop and learn about computers before I could start coding in a well rounded way (and that’s coming from a WebDev, who doesn’t even have to deal with low-level stuff too often!).Thank you Mr. Petzold!!!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Programming Windows&#34; exposed the simplicity behind the Windows architecture.  If you had even a smattering of C experience, Petzold could get you writing Windows applications the same day you opened his book.  He triggered an explosion of software development.There are excellent books for novice Linux programmers, but unfortunately, nothing compared to Petzold&#39;s clear and direct presentation.."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Individual states’ pay transparency laws are already applying upwards pressure on salaries across the country.My company has multiple groups in different states including Colorado, and in anticipation of needing to post salary ranges for our open positions in Colorado, my group (with no positions in Colorado) preemptively bumped up everyone’s salaries to the midpoint of their pay bands to avoid anyone becoming frustrated if they learned they were in the bottom half. Despite the preemptive adjustments, a colleague of mine became angry and quit when they found out their salary wasn’t at the very top of their position’s pay range.So pay transparency laws are having a big impact—not only in the obvious cases of candidates negotiating salaries in the states that passed the pay transparency laws, but also for average employees in other states who didn’t even need to do anything except learn how much their labor was worth."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Microsoft said it would disclose salary ranges in all internal and external U.S. job postings no later than January 2023. That date is when Washington state, where Microsoft’s headquarters are located, will start requiring employers with at least 15 employees to disclose salary ranges for each position.In other news, Microsoft to comply with a new law."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s incredible in these comments that so many of you who work in the industry on the employee side are arguing against having more transparency for the employee, and for having more leverage in the negotiating process for the employer instead. I want all the advantage as an employee that I can get. Any secret withheld from me is not to my advantage."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is funny, but the OpenSSL CLI is in large part just a series of utility/driver/diagnostic programs for library functionality that isn&#39;t expected to be used on a standalone basis. It&#39;s the industry standard for generating certificates, but that&#39;s because the industry doesn&#39;t understand certificates; most people should be using nothing but certbot and mkcert.What bugs me a little is the idea that you might want a well-designed version of what the OpenSSL CLI offers. Bad idea! You want tools designed to do one thing well, not one tool that offers a thin layer of getopt() over a low-level cryptography API."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Truly great GUI design is very challenging.  I&#39;ve used very few applications which I think have a truly great UI that beats the CLI in terms of the efficiency of presenting options in orthogonal and conditional ways (orthogonal: two features which don&#39;t interact at all can usually be programmed independently and appear in distinct locations, while conditional: options that are only valid if another option is set to a specific value).The best UI I&#39;ve worked with so far is Fusion 360.  Like most 3d modelling tools it has a fairly steep learning curve, but it does a fantastic job of making your life easier.  It has a bunch of UI dialogs for parameter setting (some of which are better than others) that do a good job with both orthogonality and conditionality.  I really wanted to like blender but just about everything in it feels rotated 90 degrees to how I&#39;d do it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That isn&#39;t a praise of GUIs, it is a damnation of OpenSSLThe exact opposite of *NIX philosophy. Don&#39;t do just one thing well, be Swiss Army knife, the largest one you have ever seen, with a lot of the blades poking part way out, so you may lacerate yourself at any moment."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author is here and ought to make it all clear but if you google the title of the article you can download the paper already despite everyone being coy about it and the ACM not having published it yet.  It&#39;s kind of ridiculous it&#39;s getting this kind of press before the paper is officially published and available.   If the paper was published and security experts were allowed to analyze it before the tech press went nuts the stories would probably have a different tone.This is interesting theoretically but the amount of access required is pretty high, this is hardly an exploitable zero day.Having read the paper, in a nutshell it requires:- Login to the Mac in question- Ability to install a custom kext to make the PACMAN Gadget work.   The exploit requires access to undocumented registers on the M1 that are apparently not accessible from user space, but this is a bit unclear.- Also need an exploitable kernel buffer overflow against Mac OS (they made a custom kext with a buffer overflow)- Run the bufferflow + Pacman Gadget together to do the final elevationIf someone can find a way to do this without installing kexts then it becomes way more serious.   As is it certainly is a super interesting paper and presents a bunch of work for chip designers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone with a bit of experience in this area, IMO, the Techcrunch article is more confusing than it should be.Here&#39;s a link to the actual abstract. The work will be presented at ISCA, which will start on June 18. https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3470496.3527429Here&#39;s a link to MIT&#39;s press release. https://www.csail.mit.edu/news/researchers-discover-new-hard...Here&#39;s a link to the vulnerability&#39;s website, as is tradition now.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve posted this before, but you can achieve the same with uBlock Origin static filters alone without having to install any additional extensions. For example:To block results from specific domains on Google or DDG:    google.*##.g:has(a[href*=&#34;thetopsites.com&#34;])
    duckduckgo.*##.results &gt; div:has(a[href*=&#34;thetopsites.com&#34;])

And it&#39;s even possible to target an element&#39;s text content with a `:has-text(/regex/)` selector:    google.*##.g:has(*:has-text(/bye topic of noninterest/i))
    duckduckgo.*##.results &gt; div:has(*:has-text(/bye topic of noninterest/i))

As a bonus, here&#39;s how to get rid of Medium&#39;s obnoxious cookie notification across all domains:    *##body &gt; div &gt; div:has(*:has-text(/To make Medium work.*Privacy Policy.*Cookie Policy/i))"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Years ago, I made a FireFox addon for myself to do exactly this but everywhere on the internet. You specify a regular express to match attribute values and/or text, and the CSS to apply to the elements containing the matches. You can specify any CSS you want but if it&#39;s something like visibility: hidden or display: none it has this effect (and is the only thing I&#39;ve actually used it for). It even worked on FireFox for Android when that supported proper addons.It&#39;s really nice to never see a link to Facebook, Twitter, etc anywhere on the internet. It&#39;s almost like they don&#39;t exist. It causes a few oddities here and there (The text matching is problematic but it&#39;s optional, the attribute value matching works really well), but I&#39;ve never missed anything important. I feel like if everyone had this power everywhere, it would serve as incentive for sites to not suck.It took some fun javascript APIs I&#39;ve never had to use before (like MutationObserver and TreeWalker) to get it to work right and efficiently, especially on sites that load content via JS (like Google).Source: https://github.com/7w0/ssure (the interesting bits are in content.js)Addon: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ssure/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Initiatives like the Dot Collector and the Performance review system that has led to a toxic workplace cultureI was curious about that &#34;Dot Collector&#34;:Dot collector was an application invented by Ray Dalio’s hedge fund and Bridgewater Associates. The application has set its foot in Coinbase since the start of the year and has been in use by the HR and IT teams of the company. The user interface of the app is quite simple and efficient. It asks the user to rate the coworker or the manager on how well they demonstrate the 10 crore Values at coinbase. The values are not only limited to things like communications, but also include values like positive energy. The information about the co-worker can be shared by either giving a thumbs up or by giving a thumbs down. There is an option of giving neutral feedback for the co-workers in the application.Sounds like hell."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve become convinced that hiring more people is generally a warning sign. A team of between a few and about twenty people seems to produce all the good stuff. Anything beyond that, your value per employee drops drastically, and your cost per employee goes up as you need to offer higher and higher salaries to stay in competition. A company going on a hiring spree is now a negative indicator for me. I think FB, Goog, etc. could lay off thousands with no adverse effects and in fact an increase in velocity, quality, and quantity of new features/products. Sometimes one person can be much more productive than a whole team. This is obviously unscientific, just a feeling I’m getting lately."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My signals processing professor apparently knew one joke, and one joke only.&#34;A LOT (Polish airline) airplane is about to land in New York City; as they align for final approach, the first officer notifies the passengers that those seated on the right can now see the Statue of Liberty. A number of passengers get up from their seats left of the aisle and lean over the people seated on the right to get a glimpse of the statue. Plane promptly crashes.Why? There were too many Poles in the right half of the plane.I&#39;ll lead myself out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this article is trying to make a political statement, &#34;Our leaders have just done something that is going to cause a future problem, a crash&#34;.I have only read the linked article, I think the followup might be available, but I&#39;m not going to read it before posting this -- because this article was meant to be clickbait, to get you hooked and possibly mis-informed.The article as it stands (incomplete) contains some classic argument fallacies.It is an &#34;appeal to authority&#34;, by attempting to explain control theory. This person knows something.The examples all result in bad things, airplanes crashing, hard drives (crashing - perhaps a stretch). Bicycle at the edge of a cliff. Eating too much ice cream. Chernobyl. This is a possible &#34;appeal to emotion&#34;.The final issue is an &#34;incomplete comparison&#34;. The graph at the bottom of the article shows housing prices -- all of the previous examples have mathematical models which can explain the behavior. For the last graph no model (the equations) is presented. Without a model you cannot  use control theory to analyze the zeros and poles.The last graph wants you to believe in a continuing upward trend, the fallacious argument, implies that whatever the Canadian political change that has been made is going to make this trend to zero, despite the intention to keep it trending upwards.Background: A long time ago, as a mathematics undergraduate, I did take a course in control theory, it was run out of the engineering department. It was somewhat awkward as quite a few mathematical terms were not-quite-the-same. I get the same unease when reading this for poles, zeros and right-half-planes. Any engineering textbooks that use j for sqrt(-1) instead of i (because that is taken) is an indicator. Yup, this could be construed as an &#34;appeal to authority&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am not sure what to take from this. The title certainly makes sense from a engineers perspective. But from a layman&#39;s? I don&#39;t know.It seems, that he tries to explain an important concept in control theory but does not explain the meaning of &#34;plane&#34; at all. Even worse: He uses airplanes as an example.Isn&#39;t it terribly confusing for non-control-theory people? If I don&#39;t know control theory, then how on earth would I know that he means a 2D-plane? And what&#39;s this &#34;minimum-phase-system&#34; he mentions once? Is a pole a number? And what about RHP poles?I would be interested in how readers without a background in control theory and higher maths understood that article and what questions arose."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"While it is much less of a concern with runtime permissions that are optional.... yeah, I greatly dislike this too.In particular because not everything is a runtime permission.

And google just keeps taking more and more steps to hide that information from me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That seems OK since it still asks you as it needs them when running an app, and &#34;prunes&#34; permissions away from apps that you do not use often.Lots of apps only need specific permissions if you use specific parts of the app. And apps are much larger (one app does more things) than they were 5-10 years ago. Eg you can use some apps as a camera, but never as a photo editor, and get use out of it by only giving some specific permissions (camera), forever."</p>

In session 2, start the concurrent (re)index.
In session 3, monitor pg_stat_progress_create_index for session 2 to get to a &#39;waiting for ...&#39; phase.When you detect the (re)index session arrives in a waiting phase, start a REPEATABLE READ transaction in this session, and then halt (commit or rollback doesn&#39;t matter) the transaction in session 1.
