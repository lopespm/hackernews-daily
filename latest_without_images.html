								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"(author here)Great feedback! Yes, I am the &#34;Land of Lisp&#34; guySorry about the potential epilepsy trigger- that was the fastest way I could think of to code a quick &#34;reward effect&#34;, I will do something different in the next version. I didn&#39;t really expect anyone to care enough to solve the puzzle lol.Now that I know people like the puzzle, I will build out the website and post regular puzzles, follow my Twitter @lisperati for updates."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have to say the fact that I was able to figure out how the puzzle worked - what I was meant to do - with no instructions in about 60 seconds is a good sign.I&#39;m also immediately kind of addicted to this....I really like it.The one thing that annoys me is that I can&#39;t see what a symbol is if the dog/bunny is on it because it&#39;s covered up. It&#39;s hard to remember when there&#39;s so many. Some transparency or slight design adjustment would fix this easily."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Feedback:1. It was good enough that I finished. This is success! Good job!2. It took me too long to realize characters could occupy the same space, and the game doesn&#39;t draw characters occupying the same space very well.3. The flashing lights at the end are too fast, slow them way down and it will still look good. You&#39;ll probably only have to change a number in your code."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"First off, no, a full rewrite is not only not necessary, but probably the worst possible approach. Do a piece at a time. You will eventually have re-written all the code, but do not ever fall into the trap of a &#34;full re-write&#34;. It doesn&#39;t work.But before you re-write once line of code - get some testing in place. Or, a lot of testing. If you have end-to-end tests that run through every feature that is currently used by your customer base, then you have a baseline to safely make changes. You can delete code as long as the tests pass. You can change code as long as the tests pass.Once you are at that point, start picking off pieces to modernize and improve.Also, respect the team. Maybe they aren&#39;t doing what you would, but they are keeping this beast alive, and probably have invaluable knowledge of how to do so. Don&#39;t come in pushing for change... come in embracing that this beast of a codebase makes 20 million a year. So talk about how the team can improve it, and modernize their skills at the same time.Because if you walk in, saying, &#34;This all sucks, and so do you, lets throw it out&#34;, do you really have to wonder why you are hitting resistance?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Such a great opportunity to get in as an engineer and make a difference. The good news is the code is running in production and generates revenue! From here you can start making small incremental changes. I would start in this order.1. Make it script version controlled. 
2. modularise the code. This will help in understanding the structure. 
3. Add the dependency management. 
4. improve the code deployment process. CI/CD etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lovely knot to unravel!First, get everything in source control!Next, make it possible to spin service up locally, pointing at production DB.Then, get the db running locally.Then get another server and get cd to that server, including creating the db, schema, and sample data.Then add tests, run on pr, then code review, then auto deploy to new server.This should stop the bleeding…  no more index-new_2021-test-john_v2.phpAdd tests and start deleting code.Spin up a production server, load balance to it. When confident it works, blow away the old one and redeploy to it. Use the new server for blue/green deployments.Write more tests for pages, clean up more code.Pick a framework and use it for new pages, rewrite old pages only when major functionality changes. Don’t worry about multiple jquery versions on a page, lack of mvc, lack of framework, unless overhauling that page."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"To some extent I disagree with this, not that Google+Meta are under attack, but that the threat is coming from competitors.I’ve spent most of the last 10 years earning my living from an e-commerce business I own. The online advertising industry is unrecognisable from when we started. My thesis, in beef, is that the industries excessive uses of personalised data and tracking lead to increased regulation, and then a massive pivot to even more “AI” as a means to circumvent that (to some extent). The AI in the ad industry now, I believe, is detrimental to the advertiser. It’s now just one big black box, you put money in one side and get traffic out the other. The control and useful tracking (what actual search terms people are using, proper visible conversion tracking of an ad) is now almost non-existent. As an advertiser your livelihood is dependant on an algorithm, not skill, not intuition, not experience, not even track record.Facebook, Google and the rest of the industry were so driven by profit at all cost, and at the expense of long term thinking, they shot themselves in the foot.Advertisers are searching for alternatives, but they are all the same.I think online advertising, as a whole, is probably f***ed…"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Looks like the hack was made exactly how it was done for EA using stolen Slack cookie: https://www.vice.com/en/article/7kvkqb/how-ea-games-was-hack...There was a huge leak for Diablo 4 two weeks ago as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;ll be interesting to see what kind of innovations Rockstar is able to come up with for the next GTA, nothing stands out to me from these development leaks.The problem with GTA is that it&#39;s a fairly shallow game, which limits what kind of immersion you can experience. Imagine if it included more realistic elements like economics and persistent characters. You could decide you have a vendetta against Bob and steal his cheese every time he goes out shopping for groceries. Heck, you could become the cheese kingpin and monopolize access to cheese. Although a more thematic approach would probably have to do with drugs, which doesn&#39;t seem like too far of a bridge to jump considering the game genre."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hopefully it has a good single player mode. I have no interest in GTA online or any other online game for that matter. Gaming for me is about escape and immersion, not toxic interactions with others which is 90% of what I got when I tried GTA online."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For everyone commenting &#34;laypeople aren&#39;t the intended audience&#34;, this monstrosity was a recent Texas constitutional ballot proposal, i.e. all voters in the state were asked to vote on it:&gt; The constitutional amendment authorizing the legislature to provide for the reduction of the amount of a limitation on the total amount of ad valorem taxes that may be imposed for general elementary and secondary public school purposes on the residence homestead of a person who is elderly or disabled to reflect any statutory reduction from the preceding tax year in the maximum compressed rate of the maintenance and operations taxes imposed for those purposes on the homestead.I have an Ivy League education and I still could hardly understand it, and I still think some of the language is ambiguous (i.e. I think &#34;the reduction of the amount of a limitation on the total amount&#34; can be interpreted both ways).https://www.dallasnews.com/news/watchdog/2022/03/25/the-lang..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been a CTO at companies in various bits of the Anglosphere, and signed contracts in all of the bits (and some other places).I&#39;m also married to an Anglosphere lawyer (which gives me lots more exposure than I might have guessed to the idiosyncrasies of the profession).In my experience, I very much agree with the headline (and abstract) here, but would emphasise that the US is the worst for archaic language, creating a worse barrier to entry. Most other countries in the Anglosphere have been through a &#34;plain english&#34; language push in both contract &amp; legislation, while the US has stuck to &#34;this language is proven through precedent&#34; more stubbornly than anywhere else. This seems to be particularly prevalent in IP law, although that might be my tech bias showing.I would very much argue against those (even in this thread), that say that the lay-person isn&#39;t the intended audience for lots of contracts, particularly for T&amp;Cs where they are often written by a contracts lawyer, for a contracts lawyer or judge, but should ABSOLUTELY be written for the lay-person to understand.Anyway, I think the legal profession can &amp; should do better."</p>

There&#39;s a relevant Dilbert cartoon: [0]To simplify contract language, the biggest bang for the buck comes from SSSP: Short, Single-Subject Paragraphs, which are much easier to read; to review and revise during contract negotiations; and to reuse in other contracts.(It&#39;s not unlike modularity and orthogonality in software.)For more ranting on that subject — with some pathological before-and-after examples — see my online course materials (this version isn&#39;t pretty; I&#39;m almost done refactoring it).

								<p class="story__comment_others">"One more vote for terrible audio mixes and one for actors who mumble their dialog.Whenever I watch movies with my wife, we constantly have to fiddle with the remote control. The loud parts (including explosions and music) are too loud for her, so we have to turn the volume down during those parts, but the dialog is too quiet and mumbly for me to hear, so we turn the volume up during those parts. We now just keep the volume low and turn on subtitles--easy but shitty solution.Sound engineers need to stop needlessly flexing all that dynamic range that modern tools give them, and just produce a watchable movie. Actors need to go do some stage acting and learn how to e n u n c i a t e and project their voices."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The fact that there&#39;s a claimed generational gap here speaks more to the values of the generations re: passive vs active entertainment. I could also ask: &#34;Why do all these 60-Somethings have the TV on as background noise while doing other tasks?&#34;To me it seems closed-caption usage is correlated with actually paying attention to television consumption.People who have their TV on at all hours, as background entertainment to support their lifestyle, tend to not use CC. Why should they? The words literally don&#39;t matter, it&#39;s just an aesthetic.People who actually desire an immersive experience, who deliberately pay attention to the shows they watch, tend to care about CC since it complements the audio &amp; visual nicely. I don&#39;t have any evidence for this but I&#39;d wager that plot synthesis and comprehension of television shows is greatly improved by CC. Or maybe it&#39;s that people who use CC tend to value and perform better at synthesis and comprehension? Regardless of causality, CC seems related to an individual&#39;s desire for more active entertainment."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A probably naieve question. If the VPU can be used as the bootstrap loader for the CPU, much as a PDP11 on the door of the Vax 11/780 acted as bootstrap loader for the Vax, can we not simply replace all the complex VPU resident functions with &#39;just run on the CPU&#39; and then resolve the external device bindings in normal CPU code?Maybe I misread it, but it read like the VPU does more than the tiny necessary bootstrap to find an image, and chain load it. It reads like it has to do some timing critical initialisations of subsystems, but I cannot but think a CPU should be able to do this for itself, once it has some run state with a kernel in memory.It&#39;s as if the VPU has to make the other bits of blobby hardware be alive, for the CPU to be able to see them. Most odd.Oftentimes there are magic bits of this to do with ring states, and priviledge to alter ring at runtime. Maybe this is part of the story: the VPU initialises a specific ring state and some outer higher trust ring MUST be pre-initialised for the CPU ring state to be allowed to talk to it: it would violate the ring model, if the CPU did it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This project focuses on being a drop in replacement to the proprietary firmware needed to bringup Linux on the other processor. (The ARM processor.)Isn&#39;t anyone going to talk about running random stuff on the VPU itself?!  Given it&#39;s the thing used for 3D and stuff, I imagine it&#39;s going to be crazy fast at certain computations, much faster than the ARM is.Untapped potential of all Raspberry Pies out there... maybe the VPU can be (ab)used to do stuff similar to what the Raspberry Pico can do."</p>

Uber is allowed to get away with the mistreatment of the Drivers because they define them as independent contractors, but how do they do this?An employee of a company is in traditional terms, somebody who acts for the benefit and interests of a larger entity which engages in business to business or customer interaction, in return for earning a reasonable wage and defined employment terms set by the company.An independent contractor is an individual entity, who by setting their own terms and prices, provides a service for other individual entities for the purpose of earning a reasonable income for themselves.What Uber has done, is see all the protections afforded to employees of a company both traditionally and federally, and sidestep them because they call their drivers independent contractors. It is implied that the Driver is setting their own pricing and terms of employment. They may legally technically be doing so, but what they&#39;re really doing is agreeing to the same terms set by Uber and defined by Uber as every other driver, as if they were employees. This allows Uber to really do whatever they want to an &#34;independent contractor&#34; which has agreed to their terms of not setting their own rates, having no transparency, and being totally subject to Ubers conditional compensation agreements."</p>
