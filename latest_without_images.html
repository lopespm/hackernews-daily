								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Training is very important in duress systems.I once worked in a place with a keypad duress code on the security system. If you prefixed your security PIN with NN-, it was the duress version of the code and would trigger a silent alarm.This was setup long-ago, and not communicated. One night, the keypad was acting glitchy. Partially out of frustration (countdown is running), and partially to test, I ended up accidentally engaging the duress code by tapping a convenient corner number, which resulted in NNNNNNNNN-PIN.After law enforcement had surrounded the building, a quick chat and search alongside a few officers got it all sorted."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hate when my bank calls me about something and then asks to confirm my identity prior to giving out details about my account. Even when I think I know what it is about (e.g., a transaction with my card was declined just before the phone call), I feel very strange giving out any information to an inbound caller.One thing I have thought about doing is providing mistaken information to the caller and see if they go along with it. I came up with this idea when one bank said they could send me a text message and I could read back the number to them (huge red flag).Does anyone else have any ideas for how to authenticate a BigCorp caller whose corporate policies do not allow them to provide any account information to the people they are calling?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are multiple levels of protection one might want.I.e. when you are being selected for random questioning entering US as a non-US citizen, you&#39;d benefit from steganography-like approach: you give a password, and relatively bland, non-personal stuff shows up, giving appearance of full access to a system.If you only care about your privacy, the next one is to have a destroy-everything script (and it&#39;s not that hard: usually, passphrases are only used to decrypt the actual encryption keys, so overwriting those keys should be super fast).  This would also work against unsophisticated attacks which are not going to really cost you your life.If there is a potential for you to be a target of a sophisticated attack and the attacker does not care about taking your life, the biggest benefit is to have a way to inform someone of your whereabouts while you are actually giving access, ideally in a way that buys you time (eg. &#34;webcam has detected stress on your face, please wait another 6 hours before trying to log in again&#34; — sorry, company mandated software, when it happens usually, we call support)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A few highlights from a conversation with a friend who works for Zeiss and regularly deals with ASML (take this with a grain of salt, I may have misunderstood some of it and he also may not be an expert in all of these areas):- The lenses (actually mirrors for EUV) only demagnify by a factor of 4. So your wafer template is already extremely small and costs millions to produce.- 13.5nm is pretty much the smallest wavelength you can reasonably handle. If you want to go smaller, you have to build a particle accelerator. (He heard that from a colleague, wasn&#39;t sure how much of that was actually true.)- The prices in this Twitter thread are pretty spot on. The EU wants to invest into chip making to become more independent in this area. But the sums they&#39;re talking about wouldn&#39;t even pay for one such machine. Politicians don&#39;t seem to be aware of the dimensions we&#39;re talking about here.- Also in the thread, ASML has a monopoly on this tech. Others have not invested into EUV and by now, it&#39;s pretty much impossible for anybody to catch up.- Everyone&#39;s hiring like crazy atm. He started home office during Covid and now Zeiss says he can&#39;t even go back to the office because they don&#39;t have enough office space anymore. He doesn&#39;t mind. Everyone&#39;s distributed all over the place anyway so whether he does conference calls at the office or at home makes no difference.- He said they&#39;re not very affected by the chip shortage."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ah yes, ASML. I have a number of friends and ex-colleagues who work there. Unsurprisingly, due to their importance, ASML are extremely well-known inside of the Netherlands. It&#39;s one of those companies that spun out of Philips Electronics and became very successful (NXP is another good example).A lot of research and development is still going on in the area where Philips had their research labs. If you&#39;re curious to see what kind of high-tech is being worked on in the &#34;Dutch silicon valley&#34; I suggest you Google &#34;Brainport Eindhoven&#34; or &#34;High Tech Campus Eindhoven&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like ASML is the company that almost everyone who would care has heard of at this point. Granted, I hadn&#39;t heard of them 3 years ago, even though I work directly with HW designers.Its just funny how they&#39;re going through the hype cycle in their level of public awareness. Give it 3 years and (hopefully) the &#34;general public&#34; won&#39;t have to care about them again, because chip shortages are resolved

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The article says that employees of the AI company (ShotSpotter) manually reviewed and classified the sounds as gunshots:&gt; records showed that ShotSpotter actually initially picked up what sounded like a firework a mile away, and this was later reclassified by ShotSpotter staff to be a gunshot at the intersection where and when Williams was seen on camera.So the AI didn’t even make the call. The staff did, manually. I assume that means the actual audio is available and entered into evidence?If humans are making the call then blaming AI seems like a stretch. That’s almost like blaming the motion detection algorithms for triggering video recordings that were later reviewed by humans. It’s still humans reviewing the recordings and making decisions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This year in jail was awaiting the “speedy trial” that is supposed to be guaranteed by the US Constitution. I think that in itself is as much of an issue as the quality of the evidence. How can the government justify taking year away from the life of a man who has not been convicted of anything?"</p>

Large cars also reduce visibility which further reduces safety. There has been a car size arms race for the past 30-40 years.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve created ~five new projects over the past year using SQLite and I&#39;ve got into the habit of creating tables like this:  CREATE TABLE tIssue (
    id   INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL CHECK (typeof(id) = &#39;integer&#39;),
    col1 BLOB NOT NULL                CHECK (typeof(col1) = &#39;blob&#39;),
    col2 TEXT                         CHECK (typeof(col2) = &#39;text&#39; OR col2 IS NULL)
  );

This has saved me from a lot of errors and has been useful, but it&#39;s just so easy to let things drift, e.g. removing `NOT NULL` constraint and forgetting to also update the check constraints. I&#39;m also horrified at the auto-conversions that I&#39;ve just learned about from this link that I&#39;m not protected from.I&#39;m very much looking forward to using strict tables."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is really welcome.  One idea for an approach I had a while back (but haven&#39;t attempted writing code yet) was to see if &#34;personalities&#34; could be implemented.For example a &#34;PostgreSQL&#34; personality (set via PRAGMA maybe?) which dynamically imposes the same type names and &#34;limitations&#34; on SQLite as PostgreSQL.Ditto for other SQL dialects (MySQL, etc).SQLite already has the flexibility to allow the data types, so this idea is a way of putting constraints in place that are really beneficial for a _lot_ of common use cases.eg &#34;You&#39;re using SQLite as a local test for a [PostgreSQL/MySQL/etc] prod database&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It looks like this check-in from yesterday contains the implementation and tests: https://sqlite.org/src/info/f9c1d3441b87ee29As always the TCL tests are worth admiring:    # STRICT tables have on a limited number of allowed datatypes.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"2D games had so many tricks that they often looked better than their 3D replacements for quite some time. If you were able to do every pixel by hand for a few views you often ended up with more detail than you could in the low amount of polygons available early on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Fake perspective&#34; was problematic in early flight simulators as well where texture-mapping was used. The classic example being a long runway.If the runway was a long polygon and you had a long texture map (with a dashed centerline for example) the standard code to map the bitmap to the projected runway polygon would not in fact apply perspective to the bitmap — the intervals between the dashes would be a fixed not perspective distance.The solution was to break up the runway into a whole bunch of shorter polygons — each with a bitmap of perhaps one stripe/dash."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nowdays, I make the distinction between maintainable programs and hackable ones, the later of course being, imo, way better. What I mean by that is essentially that the ratio # by-design features over simplicity of code of the hackable program is considerably higher than the maintainable program (but there is no method to write a hackable program, you either have the sensibility for that or you dont, from my own observation - I&#39;ll be happy to discuss the nuances of that statement).I don&#39;t know today but blizzard used to write its game in the hackable way - which is both a feat and rare. Take WoW for example, do you know how the 3d engine basically work? It&#39;s so simple and so powerful, you are not going to believe it. WoW is made of levels that are connected by portals. That&#39;s it. A level will have portals that will get you to other levels which in turn will have portals which lead to other levels. For example, when you are &#34;outdoor&#34; (with quotes because the engine doesn&#39;t know outdoor actually, it knows levels!), you may find a portal that leads you into a tavern for example. Once you are in the tavern, the program can ignore the rest of the world and focus the whole computer resources on the tavern, just like that, by-design. So you&#39;ll have taverns as detailed as all of what you can see in the exteriors. Better, you can have landscape in each and every level. (note when the player is in the air, say on a gryphon, some portals are ignored.)This is both incredible simple and powerful. Remember the game run on early-2000 PCs. Imagine what you can do with that. Caves? Done. Houses that leads into catacombs? Done. Incredibly detailed cities? Add walls and portals, done. Texture streaming? Well, d-o-n-e. Buildings that leads to indoor landscape? Done.I wouldnt make a game engine differently today.As a comparison, I&#39;m working on one of the most played game in the world atm which is a maintainable program. You have no idea the pain in the ass in comparison just to add simple features. Oh yeah the code is readable. You can fix bugs. But features, just forget it, it takes a shit load of money to get one done."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Nabokov&#39;s solution to this dilemma, reread. The only good reader is, as he said, a re-reader. If we&#39;re honest nobody can actually remember more than a dozen books, and if you pick the right ones there&#39;s more to learn in any of them than you can learn in years.It&#39;s similar to the sentiment that the only way to understand a poem is to be able to recite it from memory, or the fact that some pianists play nothing else but Bach and yet reach mastery. Everything&#39;s already in there, or most of it anyway.Requires a different mentality, one that treats reading or perception and deep study as the thing to care about, not &#39;absorbing information&#39; or &#39;knowledge&#39;.Umberto Eco once pointed out that the size of the unknown, the books one has not read are magnitudes larger than the books one has read, so to treat knowledge as some sort of priced possession to climb in the pecking order is meaningless, what matters is being adequate in understanding the few things one actually has the time to study."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Because when you’re finally in a situation where you could use its insights, you’ve completely forgotten them.I once read a short essay by Patrick Süskind (author of &#34;Perfume - The Story of a Murderer&#34;). I am paraphrasing, but in it, he discusses his embarrassment that he cannot remember even major plot details or character names of great works of world literature, although he has read them multiple times and they deeply inspired his own work. He then makes an interesting speculation: if a book really and deeply influences you, then maybe actively remembering facts and insights of the book becomes harder and harder, because the book&#39;s ideas have been so deeply ingrained into your brain and thinking that you cannot remember them as facts independent of your thinking. But this doesn&#39;t mean that you have &#34;forgotten&#34; them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The way to remember what you read is to make sure you understand all the words in the text, the way they apply in context.It&#39;s the micro-misunderstandings that lead up to the macro-misunderstanding which manifests as &#34;forgetting&#34;.Other commenters also mention applying what&#39;s in the book. That is 100% true, when you&#39;re reading about how to do something. If you&#39;re reading a fact-based book (non-fiction) but not about doing something I usually take a break from the text and think about how it would apply to the subject I&#39;m studying. But it&#39;s just obvious that you can&#39;t get a concept if you don&#39;t understand the words that describe it.The target is conceptual understanding. It&#39;s got nothing to do with memorization. TO get the meaning of a song, for instance, it&#39;s not necessary to memorize the lyrics.One real-world example, I was taking care of my father in the hospital and I noticed one of the techs telling him that he needs to order his dinner from the &#34;dysphagia&#34; menu. I asked her if he could have some other soft foods from home and she said, &#34;all I know is that he needs to order from the menu.&#34; I asked her what dysphagia means, honestly I didn&#39;t know. She didn&#39;t know. I looked it up and told her it means &#34;difficulty in swallowing&#34;. She realized that she never actually understood the concept of WHY one needs to order from the menu. As if the food is somehow magic. So that helped her understand the concept of the rule, and why it applies and I am sure she hasn&#39;t forgotten it.I don&#39;t take notes, mark up pages or speed read or use any crutch, trick or technique to study. I just get the definitions of words that I don&#39;t understand and I do just fine."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"In addition to walking, I&#39;ve noticed that walking in a fasted state (usually early in the morning) really gets the mind turning.It does take a little while to get that perfect pace sometimes.Also: hounds (in my case, a beagle) are excellent long walk buddies.One more, going off the deep end: long thinking walks along trails in the woods (ideally a path that you know well so you don&#39;t have to think about it) can be a low-key spiritual experience."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I agree 100% with this article - I do my best thinking when walking. It is the combination of light exercise that gets the blood moving (to the brain!), but not too strenuous that our minds must devote mental energy to the act of phsyical exercise, the oxygen from the fresh air, the feeling of _wandering_ and letting our minds wander.Sometimes I struggle with deep thinking at my desk - its too quiet / stable. A little bit of distraction helps. Not to say I don’t think while at my desk, I just think walking is a great compliment and in our sedentary lives, better to think on our feet and leave the desk to implementation / coding.I say this after two productive walks today :)"</p>
