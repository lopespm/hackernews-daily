								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I just look at what my KPIs are (key performance indicators) and maximize those. Management won&#39;t tell you what they are, but it&#39;s usually the same between companies- making managers look good by stakeholder demos
- making sure your a team player
- being active in core hours
- unblock peers in PRs
- not abusing pto time, just state your working and do your own thing so long as works done 
- delivering high visibility features 
- delivering value in planning sessionsWhen I get my actual work done and how long it takes for me to do it is irrelevant. What I do make sure is that I&#39;m also outperforming some of my peersI usually do all my work is one shot somewhere in the afternoon everyday. We also have to put comments on tickets everyday so I just have enough to write a paragraph and use that for standup. That takes me 2 hours of coding everyday give or take. most days I don&#39;t work more than 5 hours. This doesn&#39;t include the time I spend thinking about the problem though"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Do people regularly run into coworkers like me during their career and simply ignore it because they find it too awkward to criticize them? Have I just been incredibly lucky and every boss I have had is too incompetent to notice? Do I have imposter syndrome and I am actually a 10x developer whose laziness makes them a 1x developer?Lazy developers don&#39;t really bother me, if you do a couple hours of high-quality work a week I&#39;d have no complaint. (Many weeks I do as little, some weeks I do a decent amount of real work :) The problem is developers making negative progress, usually messes that need to be cleaned up ... and it&#39;s an awkward situation, no matter your relative authority. I&#39;m in the &#34;we should consider them lines spent, not lines produced&#34; camp.An old disputed quote:&gt; I divide my officers into four classes as follows: The clever, the industrious, the lazy, and the stupid. Each officer always possesses two of these qualities.&gt; Those who are clever and industrious I appoint to the General Staff. Use can under certain circumstances be made of those who are stupid and lazy. The man who is clever and lazy qualifies for the highest leadership posts. He has the requisite nerves and the mental clarity for difficult decisions. But whoever is stupid and industrious must be got rid of, for he is too dangerous."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think there&#39;s also something to be said for passive processing.Sometimes I&#39;ll know I need to write some code or some function and I&#39;ll just think about it in the back of my head while doing other things, sometimes for a whole day or two. Then I&#39;ll sit down and write it in like 20-30 minutes. Did I work 20-30 minutes, or have I been working for a day or two? I would say a day or two, and the 20-30 minutes was the time needed to produce the deliverable of that work."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wonder why no one ever talks about architectures in the middle between those two - modular monoliths.The point in time where you&#39;re splitting your codebase up in modules (or maybe are a proponent of hexagonal architecture and have designed it that way from the beginning), leading to being able to put functionality behind feature flags. That way, you can still run it either as a single instance monolith, or a set of horizontally scaled instances with a few particular feature flags enabled (e.g. multiple web API instances) and maybe some others as vertically scaled monoliths (e.g. scheduled report instance).I wrote more about that approach on my blog, as one of the first articles, &#34;Moduliths: because we need to scale, but we also cannot afford microservices&#34;: https://blog.kronis.dev/articles/modulith-because-we-need-to...In my eyes, the good part is that you can work with one codebase and do refactoring easily across all of it, have better scalability than just a monolith without all of the ops complexity from the outset, while also not having to worry as much about shared code, or perhaps approach the issue gently, by being able to extract code packages at first.The only serious negatives is that this approach is still more limited than microservices, for example, compilation times in static languages would suffer and depending on how big your project is, there will just be a bit of overhead everywhere, and not every framework supports that approach easily."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is a lot of talk about monoliths vs microservices lately.. I just want to throw into the ring that you can do both at the same time. easily. And noone is going to kill you for it either.maybe we are getting caught up in sematics because its christmas, but &#34;monorepo/monolith/microservices/etc&#34; is -just- the way you organize your code.Developing a montolith for years but now you have written a 15 line golang http api that converts pdfs to stardust and put it into on a dedicted server in your office? welp thats a microservice.Did you write a 150 repo application that can not be deployed seperatly anyway? welp thats a monolith.You can also build a microservice ecosystem without kubernetes on your local network. We have done it for years with virtual machines. Software defined networking just makes things more elegant.So dont stop using microservices because its &#34;hard&#34; or start writing monoliths because its &#34;easy&#34;, because none of that is true in the long run.What is true is that you have a group of people trying to code for a common goal. The way you reach that goal together defines how you organize your code."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unless you have a strong technical or organizational reason to use microservices, using microservices is just more work to achieve the same results.Organizational reason would be multiple people/teams who don&#39;t want or can&#39;t talk much to each other, so they develop pieces of a larger system as relatively independent projects, with clear API and responsibility boundaries. Frontend/backend style web development is an example of such approach, even though we don&#39;t typically call these parts &#34;microservices&#34;.A technical reason I can see is some component of a system actually having to be written in a different stack, or to be run in a separate location for business reasons (separate physical computer, separate VMs or containers don&#39;t count). Like a firmware running on an IoT system. Or most of the system uses python, but there&#39;s a really good library in java for solving some very specific problem, so let&#39;s use it.If neither of these reasons stands, you don&#39;t have a microservice architecture, you have a distributed monolith. You just replaced some function calls with RPC. RPC call which takes a much a longer time than a local one, and can randomly fail. Most of your microservices are written in a single stack, so you refactor common parts into a library, but then different services are stuck to use different versions of this library. You end up with a much slower and a much more fragile system which is harder to work on for no good reason."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The years when Rails monoliths were the de facto web stack were some of the best of my career. As I progressed in my career and the popular tech stack shifted to things like microservices, document DBs, serverless functions, Node, importing tiny nom packages for everything, docker containers, React, and GraphQL, the sheer cognitive overhead of getting a simple app up and running gradually took all the fun out of the job for me. The fast, satisfying feedback loop of writing a feature in Rails was replaced with weeks-long coordination efforts between independent microservices, constant discussions about tooling, and doubts over whether or not we had chosen the “right” flavor-of-the-week framework or library for our product. Every time I started a new project or a joined a new company, we had the reinvent the wheel for our bespoke Node/serverless stack and have the same tiring conversations about naming conventions, logging, data consistency, validation, build scripts, etc., all of which Rails gives you by default. I ended up spending more time on tooling setup than actual business logic.I eventually gave up and switched to a semi-technical product management role."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have spent a lot of time with node(express), Java(Spring) and rails. I see a lot of complaints about node, but node with typescript has been a joy to work with. It is lightweight and has a type system. I know where every piece of code is coming from, there is no magic involved. I either wrote the function in that file, I am importing it, or it is a method on a js object. I only have know one language for both front end and back end. A better standard library would be nice.Rails is nice in terms of getting the project set up, not bikeshedding about the tooling, and working with the db. But the actual coding has been painful for me. I really dislike working with a non typed language. I dislike optional parans in function calls and optional braces for hashes. I dislike all the magic of rails. I never know what is going on because there is some functionality that inherits from a rails class or some other part of the code base. I would rather write a bit more code for a bit more clarity. Maybe if python were typed I would like Django? But python has all of that nonsense around virtualenv.Spring has been ok, but not great. Too much bloated abstract factory creator nonsense. Dependency injection never really clicked for me. All of these annotations. I quite liked plain Java but Spring just felt like this monster.All in all node(express) has been the nicest for me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yeah it&#39;s funny... Now 10 years+ in the web dev business. I occasionally  got drawn by the hype, dug myself considerably deep into express based frameworks, sails.js, koa.js, nest.js... But in the end i had to conclude, my first go-to framework django always came out superior in terms of developer productivity. It even eventually covered the bases where i still thought node was superior like async/websocket communication. Imho Django and similar batteries-included frameworks are as state-of-the-art as they&#39;ve ever been."</p>

Free-market economies still take measures against insider trading, still place limits on how and when high-ranking executives can trade company stock. Placing restrictions on how congress members can trade, when they have access to material non-public information, is totally compatible with a free-market economy.This is not a defense, it&#39;s a dismissal."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yes, we are a free-market. But there are people, like company executives (and high-ranking politicians) who have non-public information that does not belong to them. When congress uses insider knowledge, they are stealing from the ameria, and undermining any semblance of policy integrity.And for that reason, the SEC has 10b-5 plans, which can certainly be critiqued, but at least removes the low-hanging fruit like &#34;we are getting acquired so I&#39;ll buy as many shares and out of the money options as I can&#34;.Iirc her husband was basically buying fairly far-out (~16-18 months) calls at the onset of the pandemic, and they were expiring around the time of, was it an antitrust hearing? The timing itself was poor, but the expiration didn&#39;t seem diabolical.But it was just like, c&#39;mon, I don&#39;t even like the anti-trust bent congress is on, but how are you thinking people are taking your goals in good faith when you have any explicit (and intrinsically timed) personal interest in not harming the businesses you are looking into anti-trust action against?The Fed trading ethics thing with Kaplan and Rosengren was also pretty bad. But imo, they made real changes. They restricted a lot of individual trading, and anything they can still trade in, has to be requested 45 days in advance. I think they understood the gravity of what that said about them, and took real steps to remedy.The STOCK Act otoh says Congress and employees have to report within 45 days..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I worked for a finance adjacent firm, not even a firm that handled money, my compliance policy was super strict even by industry standards and I was a lowly Sr. SWE. 
The reasoning I was given was to not never even provide a hint of impropriety or using data ahead of our customers. Reputation was everything.The blanket company-wide policy was as follows. Certain departments had rules on top of this.1. Limited to general stocks, ETFs, mutual funds, etc. No derivatives allowed (options, etc.). Even private stock or private options from my prior require required a review from compliance when I started.
2. No selling for a gain within 30 days of the purchase date on ANY security. Selling for a loss was allowed at any time.
3. All brokerage accounts had to be linked to their compliance portal. An automated compliance check pulled your statements weekly and would open a ticket with compliance if anything looked to violate policy. If your brokerage was not supported electronically, you had to submit monthly paper statements.I don&#39;t see why Congress shouldn&#39;t be subject to similar rules, especially those on finance committees."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Good! I‘ll go long on them.Reddit is the ONLY place on the Internet where you can simultaneously watch garbage recycled content from TikTok and visit extremely-niche and highly knowledgeable communities in the same session. Heck, I get my HN updates from Reddit now.Facebook/Instagram/TikTok are nothing like this in that the info you get is wholly dependent on your social graph. Twitter has very high quality content, but it’s a firehose that is very difficult to curate and keep up with. Reddit is democratizing in a sense, like riding the NYC subway.An even wilder bet: Reddit can fit nicely into the metaverse (as a news outlet of sorts, on steroids) and even potentially minimize the need for Google Search.Anecdotally, a VERY LARGE percentage of my Google searches end in “site:reddit.com” these days. Reddit posts, especially from smaller subs, tend to be higher quality and don’t have ulterior motives (ad revenue). If Reddit’s Lucene cluster were better, between that and SO, I’d use Google a handful of times a week. Maybe this IPO can help fund that.If the ad revenue from the whale subs allow me to continue learning about interior design, supply chain logistics,  the inner workings of car sales, finance and tax strategies if I become high net worth, and more, I’m here for it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Reddit of 2006 where tutorials on generating HTML in Lisp rocket to the top of the homepage is long gone. I can&#39;t imagine investing in an ad company that is fueled by clickbait and outrage the way Reddit is. Plus, some percentage of the userbase will always run aggressive ad blockers and be impossible to effectvely monetize. However, my brain works very differently from other people&#39;s, so I could be wrong."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The larger subreddits have problems, but Reddit has done a remarkable job of collecting people with niche interests into one area.I wouldn&#39;t discount their success and future success (as much as I&#39;d like to).What&#39;s odd is they haven&#39;t stopped growing. It&#39;s just been linear user growth.They could literally do nothing and the site would still grow. It&#39;s closer to Wikipedia than a social network in some respects. And by that standard, we should try to judge it.I look forward to the next forum site as much as the next person. But I don&#39;t know what it would look like. If anyone does, I definitely urge you to build it if you can.Substack has every incentive to build a community. Discord as well. So there&#39;s definitely opportunities, but from where I sit, I don&#39;t have any insight as to what you could do to beat this behemoth."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is there a conjecture that says for a field with given a degree of complexity, a given string or function of a can be encoded equivalently in a number of different ways that is proportional to its size and maybe complexity class?Between this and project zero&#39;s analysis (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29568625) of NSO using compression encoding to create a virtual machine for calculating exploit offsets, while unrelated except at a very high level of abstraction, it reminds me conceptually of cryptographic hash collisions, where over a large enough search space or field / domain of complexity there are many equivalent encodings or homonyms/isomorphisms.The issue with the NSO exploit was they found that the compression encoding for a font was Turing complete, and then wrote a virtual architecture in it, and then ran programs on it that did the calculations necessary for their exploit.This png encoding issue is different, but if you abstract it upwards to find a general principle it may be the effect of, it&#39;s like there is fast rule where if if you know the size or definition of the field of possibilities, and then have a definition of a given string in it, the function that describes or defines that string will also yield all strings whose evaluation is the same. It&#39;s like Kolmolgorov complexity, but where instead of finding the smallest progam to compute something, it&#39;s: given the number of instructions to define programs over a field of inputs of a given size, there are N programs beneath length L that are equivalent.Sort of a showerthought, but it&#39;s interesting to think that our ideas of encodings and general isomorphisms may be instances of the same concept linked by a sort of &#34;imaginary&#34; function."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very cool project, and impressive he got it working!I feel like possibly a better way to deal with the communication though might be to put a dual-port RAM [e.g. 1] in-between the gameboy and the microcontroller, and load in a program to it so the Gameboy is just waiting for certain areas of memory to be updated (with flags that one side sets as &#39;new data&#39; and then the gameboy flips). Basically some kind of circular buffer of commands, and as long as there&#39;s enough space in there and you only fill it from the microcontroller slower than the Gameboy can process them, you wouldn&#39;t need to have careful synchronisation. The microcontroller just has to check that the next slot in the circular buffer has had its status bit flipped to &#39;processed&#39; (or hasn&#39;t been used yet) before putting the next command/data in.1. https://www.renesas.com/us/en/products/memory-logic/multi-po..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That design is badly missing some registers (D-type flip-flops) -- the whole &#34;let&#39;s read/write multiple bytes and discard the first one because the ESP is not ready yet&#34; seems like a super hacky solution.A pair of something like 74574&#39;s would make this so much easier. When sending to ESP, register latches the last byte written and then ESP can read it at its leisure. When reading from ESP, ESP pre-loads the data into register, and then gameboy reads data from the register. This generates interrupt which ESP uses to load next byte into register.Moreover, there might be a right logical series which will be compatible with both 3.3 and 5V busses. Then one could replace the level converters with register, keeping the overall complexity about the same."</p>

Complicated things become simple, and tasks that usually make me sigh (add a new data point and add it right through Knex, Hapi models, routes, redux actions, redux store, dispatch/selector and template) turns into a SINGLE COMMAND. Sold :)Very excited about this new release!Edit: I wrote a blog about this a while ago btw, but there are many others pieces out there like it: https://nikodunk.com/a-node-js-developer-discovers-rails/ - using it to create https://electrade.app currently."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve played around with the new default frontend (no js build step at all!) and it&#39;s been an absolute joy. I was able to write basically babby&#39;s first Rails app and have it look, feel and behave like an SPA, and that&#39;s a wonderful thing for apps that need just a little bit of interactivity. While I&#39;ve mostly moved on to Phoenix for my personal &#34;weekend project&#34; web needs, Rails is still a wonderful framework for getting an app off the ground fast."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just today I was helping a junior (php) developer get setup &amp; started with ruby.RVM, gems, bundler. Then onto rails. Upon first attempt to launch rails it choked on yarn requiring to install packages.And then I had to go through node, npm/yarn, webpacker, rails is primarily the backend, webpacker manages the front end. And it all seemed needlessly complicated.I love that rails have doubled down on the low-js direction.  Progressive enhancement, the whole js ecosystem is there if/when you need. But until then KISS."</p>
