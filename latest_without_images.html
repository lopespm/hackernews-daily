When unpartitioning is taking effect, we will stop using double-keying and revert the ordinary (first-party) key.What are these &#34;certain cases?&#34;Edit 2: Reading on, there&#39;s this bit about storage access grants heuristics [2] linked from the blog. But is that really it, or is there a hardcoded whitelist as well? If so, it&#39;d be great to see it.This bit in particular is ambiguous in how it&#39;s supposed to work exactly (who&#39;s &#34;we&#34; here):&gt; If we discover that an origin is abusing this heuristic to gain tracking access, that origin will have the additional requirement that it must have received user interaction as a first party within the past 30 days.1. https://hacks.mozilla.org/2021/02/introducing-state-partitio...2. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Pri..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a lot of comments in here about how it&#39;s bad that cookies haven&#39;t always worked this way, but a significant amount of web content to this day still requires third-party cookies to work. And I&#39;m not talking about cookies that are designed for analytics purposes; the discussions here where concern is raised revolve around simple things like logins breaking.For greenhorn web developers, you could say the same thing about TLS certificates. Why weren&#39;t they always free?Well, another reason is because TLS (and formerly SSL) wasn&#39;t (weren&#39;t) just about encryption, but about a &#34;web of trust.&#34; Encryption alone isn&#39;t trust.Many things about web technologies have changed over time; and it&#39;s easy to say that any individual piece of functionality should have worked this or that way all along, but the original intent of many web features and how those features are used today can be very different.One day industry standards may dictate that we don&#39;t even process HTTPS requests in a way where the client&#39;s IP address is fully exposed to the server. Someone along the way might decide that a trusted agent should serve pages back on behalf of a client, for all clients.After all, why should a third-party pixel.png request expose me browsing another website?! How absurd. Don&#39;t you think? And yet, we do it every day."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been following Tether for quite a long time. I have no absolute proof it is a scam but the writing is on the wall. Here are some facts.- The current Market Cap of USDT is 34 Billion Dollars. It was 4B this time last year. Since the value is pegged this means there has been an influx of cash of 30 B into this shady company in the last year alone. Who invested this money? We have no idea since Tether doesn&#39;t disclose, but we&#39;re supposed to believe all this money entered USDT even with the red flags we see.- There&#39;s a correlation between Tether printing new USDT and the Bitcoin Price.- There&#39;s no way to transfer USDT into USD. The few exchanges that say they offer withdraws actually don&#39;t if you go and try.- Daily volume of transaction is in the 100 B mark. Twice that of Bitcoin and 3 times Tether daily volume this time last year.- BitFinex is included in the NY decision because it&#39;s proven now that Bitfinex and Tether are operated by the same people. Note that a few years ago this was not only undisclosed but actively denied by Tether.- Tether initially told its investors it was 100% backed by dollar reserves and that it would be subjected to constant audits. The audits never happened, and they eventually conceded only ~70% was backed by &#34;short term cash reserves&#34;.My conclusion is that the folks at BitFinex came up with a new currency, printed billions of it and used it to wash trade against itself and other crypto, creating an artificial demand that drove the prices up. It&#39;s textbook Ponzi scheme and will inevitably come crashing down, killing Tether, BitFinex and a chunk of the Crypto Market.Crypto folks will counter argue that people has been saying this for years but Tether is still chugging along and crypto is healthier than ever.Personally I won&#39;t touch any crypto with a 10 foot pole until this thing blows over. If that means missing out on a lot of possible gains so be it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m waiting patiently for the whole Tether printing scheme to fall and crush to finally purchase Bitcoin / Ether.
However I&#39;m not viewing them as inflation hedges so long as Bitfinex / etc. are allowed to continue with their obvious money printing scheme.When most crypto trading volume is traded at trustworthy exchanges which actually hold dollars as much as they say they do, I&#39;ll trust $/BTC to be a fair market.It&#39;s dumb escaping from Powell&#39;s printing machine straight into Bitfinex tether printing machine. BTC isn&#39;t the hedge people think it is so long as it&#39;s traded against fictional dollars. Tether&#39;s volume exceeds Bitcoin, so that&#39;s the scale of fictional dollars supporting Bitcoin right now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It appears from the link in the settlement agreement:https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/2021.02.17_-_settlemen...Tether wasn’t backed at all times. The argument was that this happened due to asset seizures in Poland and Portugal in 2017-2018.https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/95207/bitfinex-tether-ne...Seems to me they couldn’t prove malicious intent, so they suggested they stop trading. Frankly this seems a bit of a click-bait title with the whole “illegal activities”.Sure, tether wasn’t backed at all times (probably is now), due to governments seizing their funds. Also banks do this all the time, every time they issue a loan for instance. The bank only keeps 10-30% collateral on your home."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"1. At an individual/hobbyist level this is a fine thing to do, if one is already a cryptocurrency enthusiast.2. At a social/planning level it is important to remember that opportunity costs matter, and this should not be recommended as public policy. One kWh of electricity could either be used for mining bitcoin (creating at most one kWh of indoor heat), or it could be used for running a heat pump[*], yielding multiple kWh of indoor heat due to the magic of heat pumps and their &gt;100% &#34;efficiency&#34;[**].[*] Yes, I realize the OP is already using a heat pump, but assisting it with preheat is inherently less efficient than plowing the same energy into running the heat pump itself.[**] Yes, heat pumps aren&#39;t &gt;100% efficient per a physics textbook, but what most people care about is that you can use them to get &gt;1 joule of indoor heat from 1 joule of energy input, which feels magical when compared to electric heaters, gas furnaces etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I did this in an apartment I lived in years ago, and do it now in my house.My computer room in the house is the lowest point in the house, so naturally, it tends to be a couple degrees cooler than the upstairs.  This means that if I set the thermostat so that the computer room is comfortable, the bedroom is too warm.  If I run the house circulation fan constantly, it&#39;s not an issue, but that consumes a decent amount of power.If I&#39;m going to consume that much power, I might as well mine crypto and make a few dollars.  Mining for NiceHash, a service that lets people rent hashing power from miners, I&#39;ll average $100-400/month worth of Bitcoin on my RTX 3080, depending on current hashing prices, and how much of my time I spend gaming, since mining is effectively paused while gaming.  The mining happens while I use my computer with no noticeable loss in performance, and it puts a few watts of energy into the room to heat it up a bit, evening it out with the rest of the house."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Years ago when mining with a single gaming card was more common and viable, I lived in a rented room in a house owned by a live-in landlord who controlled the heating, and wouldn&#39;t turn it on for very long in the winter. Since electricity was included in my (fixed) rent, I was able to keep my room a few degrees higher than the rest of the house.However I must point out that you shouldn&#39;t do this in most circumstances, there are environmentally friendly ways of heating your house."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As someone who has had to do IVF for our child and go through the challenge of figuring our what to do to try and improve sperm quality, I can tell you once you start looking into it, basically everything about modern life is bad for sperm. Heat, radiation, plastic, micro plastics, soya, tap water, Teflon, antibacterial soap, underpants, western diet. It’s a perfect storm.If you’re going though it though I offer a ray of hope that it was possible to sufficiently avoid these things, at least temporarily, and it made a very large difference (4X better within 6 months) and resulted in a now 3 year old child."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It would be helpful if we knew eactly what these endocrine-disrupting chemicals were. As is usually the case with such reports, this article is short on specifics.Over the years there have many reports from cleaners to plasticizers, phthalates, and various other chemicals as endocrine disruptors but no one has put a sufficient measure on the problem so that we can move foreword - put regulations in place, etc.As the article points out, what is so problematic is that many of the chemicals that are under suspicion are ubiquitous and not easily avoided.I consider it important that we act quickly for not only public health reasons but also the fact that we&#39;re living in an increasingly chemical-phobic society and worrying the public without solid evidence isn&#39;t helpful to anybody.We need need more research on this urgently.Afterthought: it is essential that we have solid evidence ASAP as billions of dollars are tied up in the plastics industry. Plastics already cause environmental problems (and I constantly curse the fact that I have to get rid of so much waste plastic) but there&#39;s no point deliberately alienating the plastics industry without good cause."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Store food in glass containers, not plastic. Above all, don’t microwave foods in plastic or with plastic wrap on top. Avoid pesticides. Buy organic produce if possible. Avoid tobacco or marijuana. Use a cotton or linen shower curtain, not one made of vinyl. Don’t use air fresheners. Prevent dust buildup. Vet consumer products you use with an online guide like that of the Environmental Working Group.I really want to do this, but it seems impossibly hard. For example, almost all the food I buy is in plastic containers."</p>

I was almost 12. School was closed for 2-3 weeks because they couldn&#39;t promise there would be electricity to heat the building. The ice kept breaking power lines or crushing the transmission towers from the weight (ice is heavy!). Imagine your car, covered in a 1-2 inch thick layer of very solid ice, encased.People died. The military had to come in to help. My family was fortunate that we had a wood stove in the basement that kept the house warm and cooked some meals on. We lost power a few hours at least every day.Crazy time.Edit: For those interested in this, the Wikipedia article (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_1998_North_American_ic...) has some great photos and description. 1,000 transmission towers/pylons destroyed, 35,000 utility poles. Whole forests devastated."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Once at its destination and hooked in, its V12 had to be run at a specific, constant rpm&#39; to generate AC current at 60 hertz, the frequency used by most North American utilities.I don&#39;t think this is exactly right. I&#39;m sure it wasn&#39;t consistent either, but few loads really cared too much.From the article&#39;s link, about a different locomotive doing the same thing:&gt; Conrail actually had a set of standing instructions on how to provide quasi-commercial power from a locomotive.  For an SD40-2, you attach to the bus before the diodes.  Operating in notch 6 runs the generator at 647 RPM.  Since the AR10 is a 10 pole machine, that gives 64.7 Hz power.  You could tweak the governor to get it closer to 60 Hz if you really wanted to, but for powering everything but clocks, it&#39;s close enough.  I think the method for regulating the voltage was to disconnect the load regulator from it&#39;s governor-powered vane motor and dialing the voltage in manually.  The output is 3 phase power.  Max output in notch 6 is about 1000KW.  If the avg home draws 2-3 KW on the avg, that&#39;d power several hundred homes.http://cs.trains.com/trn/f/111/t/194245.aspx"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The last paragraph on Amtrak has nothing to do with CN or the rest of the article.

It&#39;s a publicly-traded freight rail company that doesn&#39;t currently operate passenger service. The US obviously has analogs: Union Pacific, Norfolk Southern, etc.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_National_Railway"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m also a solo developer and use git in a much less sophisticated fashion. I tend to use it as, &#34;freeze my code here, so in case I f something up, I can get back to a moderately clean state.&#34; It&#39;s kind like a snapshot-based local history.  And, quite frankly, I rarely revert one, but it makes me feel safer. I don&#39;t care if I have a lot of commit messages that say, &#34;interim&#34;. The good ones are clear.Is this a terrible coding practice? I don&#39;t have enough non-me experience to know what an anti-pattern this probably is. I probably won&#39;t change my process, but I&#39;m curious."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m happy for this person if this works well for them. For me, no thanks. One of the reasons I feel much more productive as on my solo project than at work is that I don&#39;t have this kind of overhead. I don&#39;t need to write tests for everything (I write them just where they add value). I don&#39;t need to follow some strict branching standard. I can commit in chunks that make sense to me, and adjust as needed for the situation.From my perspective, a lot of this kind of rigid process is important and valuable when you are working with a team, but is counterproductive when it&#39;s just me. I know the tradeoffs of the corners I cut. I have the experience to know, for example, that&#39;s it&#39;s not a safe assumption that I will understand my own code a year (or even a month) from now. But the solution to that is to throw in some freeform comments that jog my memory; not to implement a heavyweight documentation system.Everyone should work in the way that makes them the most productive and happy, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea for solo developers to bring in practices that are designed for team collaboration without really understanding what value they will get from the extra effort."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I was a new developer and first learned Git, I felt compelled to use Git the &#34;right&#34; way. That is... small commits with clean messages, things described in this and other posts.But, as I spent more time programming, I developed different Git habits for different situations:- Solo explorative work: working on a feature, many small commit messages create nothing but noise. Trying to come up with wording for these commit messages is mostly a drain on my mental energy: there is an infinitesimal chance I&#39;ll need these commits later. In such cases, I prefer to maintain large &#34;checkpoint&#34; work-in-progress commits that are the result of near-continuous `git commit --amend`s so that I can use `git status` to see what&#39;s changed since my last checkpoint, and easily revert to the last checkpoint. If this fails me, I can almost just as easily refer to the reflog to find some changes. The reflog, in my opinion, is an extremely under-utilized tool. `git diff HEAD@{2}..HEAD@{0}` allows me to see what&#39;s happened in the the last two times that I updated my checkpoint. Since this is active work I&#39;m doing right now, I have a good sense of what happened and when, all without tiresomely writing commit messages that will be a bunch of gibberish in two days. When I&#39;m satisfied with with the work on a checkpoint commit, I reset the branch to the previous real commit, and then incrementally create real, meaningful commits from the accumulated work, that have some chance to be useful to me in the future.- Working on patches and bug fixes for live systems or production libraries: small, atomic commits that include tests for the patch are the only way to go. I believe the &#34;correct Git&#34; approach that is widely espouses is targeted to this use case, but not explorative feature work. Or maybe that&#39;s just me.Wondering if anyone else codes like this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The world did nothing when same was happening in Tibet and China was a fraction of its current power.Nothing is going to happen now when China is obviously more powerful. Moreover, none of the Muslim countries care, ME countries will happily sell China oil and Pakistan touts it’s relationship with China."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yes - we know this. We&#39;ve known this for a long time.The question is what now? Western nations have shown no political will to stand up to China."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It’s interesting to read the pro Chinese propaganda on HN. It’s too bad we can’t see the region from where those comments are coming from. It saddens me that people are forced to stand up for a regime that massacres and enslaves its own people."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I agree with the premise that making is harder than commenting, and this can be frustrating. But I don&#39;t think that telling people not to comment is the right solution.There can be a lot of value in comments, even ones that have not been thought through very deeply. In fact, casual, uninformed comments are often the most valuable as they&#39;re representative of how someone new to your product or project will perceive it.I&#39;ve found that the keys to getting value out of comments without getting discouraged are:1. Not to take comments too personally or get defensive about it. They&#39;re not attacking you. In fact they&#39;re not attacking anything. They&#39;re just making an observation. (On rare occasions, you may get a comment from an asshole who really is attacking you personally, but it&#39;s pretty easy to tell when this is the case and ignore them).2. Take a more statistical view on comments. If one person mentions something, maybe they&#39;re just an outlier. But if 10 people mention the same thing, they&#39;re probably on to something."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Roosevelt’s Man in the Area quote sums this up well.&gt; &#34;It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.&#34;It&#39;s also a useful metric for deciding who to follow on social media. Is the person showing off their work or are they just commenting on the work of others? If the work/comment ratio drops too low, I stop following them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article is so vague that people can read anything they want into it, and judging from the comments here, they are. My question is, who is the target of the article, who is supposed to avoid commenting? Your coworkers? Your boss? Your paying customers? Your non-paying users? The media? Twitter/HN randos? All of the above?If you&#39;re a maker, then you&#39;re making things for someone. If you&#39;re only making things for yourself, then of course nobody else has a right to comment. But if you&#39;re making things for other people, then it seems to me that those other people have the right, perhaps even the obligation, to comment on the product, right? The article verges on the parodic idea that no maker should ever be subject to any criticism. If that&#39;s not the author&#39;s intention, then the author ought to be clearer what is intended.That&#39;s my drive-by comment."</p>
