								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m so happy to see this. I am working on publishing a book on leanpub, and leanpub disburses payments using paypal. Yesterday, I logged into my paypal account and I remembered that this happened to me and my funds and account were frozen since 2010 (something I must have put out of my mind :p).I was searching for this issue and found this lawsuit and cannot wait to be part of it.Dealing with Paypal during the time was borderline abusive and I felt helpless every step of the way. In 2010 when they froze my account they mailed me a physical letter with an activation code which took weeks, and when I called to confirm my account I was told that the code was incorrect...I had very very little money in my account &lt; $100 and I can&#39;t imagine how frustrating it would be for someone who needed paypal for their income.I&#39;m happy to be in a position where I can choose to never use paypal again and I hope they are punished for the way they treat their customers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Lena Evans, one of the plaintiffs who&#39;d been a PayPal user for 22 years, said the website seized $26,984 from her account six months after it got frozen without ever telling her why.Wait, what? They&#39;re actually taking the money? I thought the article was just being careless with the terms &#34;frozen&#34; and &#34;seized&#34;.On what power are they doing so? It&#39;s understandable when the relevant authorities (be it a tax authority, or a financial supervisory authority, or a court, or whatever) seize money, but they are not an authority.Furthermore, if the money in question actually were illicit, then by what fantasy argument would they be allowed to keep it themselves rather than having to hand it over to the goverment? The entire point is that the money is dirty and nobody may keep it."</p>

You should also consider not updating the OS (e.g., upgrading to Windows 11) and related Intel drivers to the latest versions in order to keep the Intel SGX feature from being removed from your PC. You should also ensure your platform meets all the other playback requirements of Ultra HD Blu-ray as the playback solution:
https://www.cyberlink.com/support/faq-content.do?id=19144Wow, the official solution is to use old hardware and software. I&#39;m sure that&#39;s a great idea :)Sarcasm aside, I wonder when corporations will realize that until they offer proper easy and affordable solutions, people have little incentives to actually jump through the official loops and simply not pirate content. I hope to see this realization sometime in my life, but maybe I&#39;m too optimistic."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ll never understand the stupidity of studios/streaming platforms (DRM/Widevine). DRM only hurts legit customers, period. Any TV Show or Movie you want to watch is going to be on Torrents/Usenet within hours at most of release, their DRM has completely and utterly failed to stop piracy, instead it punishes paying users.I still remember a good decade ago getting a DVD from Redbox and trying to watch it with some friends. Tons of unskippable ads, FBI warnings, etc. Partway through the hell of enforced watching I started a torrent, before we got to the title screen it was done and we watched the downloaded version instead.Furthermore, look at the state of TV today with all the streaming platforms. I&#39;m excluding &#34;live&#34; TV because I can&#39;t imagine why anyone would subject themselves to that cesspool. Having to jump between streaming services/UIs/UX/etc is terrible. &#34;What platform was that show on?&#34;, &#34;Wait, weren&#39;t we watching this on service X? That&#39;s why it lost our place in the season&#34;, &#34;Oh, did they remove Y show?&#34;, and the list goes on.It&#39;s incredibly sad the the best TV experience is some combo of Plex/Jellyfin+*arr-type software. Music piracy is practically non-existent in my friend groups (the same could not be said 10+ years ago), Spotify and friends did that. Not any laws, not any enforcement, not any crackdowns, etc, no a /paid/ service beat music piracy. Why? Because it was better, it was easier, and it had everything. As long as we only have a choice of disjointed services and platforms TV/Movies will never be better than piracy.Things like Amazon Channels and Apple TV (yes the app, not the device, not the service, come on Apple...) are somewhat of a step in a better direction but Plex is still bar none. No ads, instant playback, no BS."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Here&#39;s a link to the article [0].Just a bit of background - 95% of humans will experience infection with EBV at some point in their lives.  Once you&#39;re infected, it remains latent, only flaring up in particular circumstances.  MS is an autoimmune disease, like many others, and this paper does not imply that EBV directly causes MS.  Obviously, as so many more people have EBV than have MS, EBV infection does not completely explain why people get MS.Just to put a small caveat to the paper.  The comparison is to EBV &#39;seronegative&#39; population - this is a minority of people (i.e. people who do not have evidence of being infected with EBV).  You could argue this is an &#39;unusual&#39; population in the first place and there&#39;s something about them that provides protection from MS.Another point is that EBV is a risk factor, there are other risk factors known too.  I think the key to understanding a lot of autoimmune diseases is to understand how our adaptive immune system works.  Our immune response is a very complex cell-to-cell interaction between millions of cells all with different roles, and how the immune system decides whether something is a threat or not is not, and how to respond to it, is not yet clear.[0] https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abj8222"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have MS and my first relapse was a pretty textbook case of transverse myelitis of the sort that the EBV can cause.I know some people have been asking about why that might be the case when a ton of people have EBV, and I think the causality may go the other way: Those of us with something wrong are more likely to both have EBV complications and MS.There are other viruses like this as well (ones that most people get/have but aren&#39;t dangerous). I was on one medication where I needed to be tested monthly because if I got one particular (normally harmless) virus, the suppression caused by the medication meant I would probably die.There&#39;s pretty clearly some sort of relation between the state of one&#39;s immune system + how it deals with &#39;benign&#39; viruses + auto-immunity, and I&#39;m excited to see what the future holds, but for now it&#39;s a cool confirmation of something a lot of MSers have talked about amongst ourselves for a while."</p>

https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/13/opinion/america-falling-a...A loss of civic sense and cultural criminality are incredibly hard to weed out of a population, once it has taken root. I worry that the a mix of pessimism and a loss of civic sense is sending non-elite America into a death spiral.Opponents of return-to-normalcy claim that these are temporary and anomalous circumstances as a result of covid. However, a 2 year period of cultural erosion can lead to this regression getting cemented as a modern cultural identity of non-elite US.Cost-benefit analyses have been ignored in favor of tunnel-visioning on viral outcomes and short term political gain. At the end of this, we might just find ourselves asking &#34;We made it out of this, but at what cost?&#34;.p.s: I am not advocating for any particular policy, just pointing to the absence of any holistic response. That being said, the complete failure of the American response in terms of &#39;viral outcomes&#39; despite tunnel visioning on it, doesn&#39;t inspire confidence in it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ll be departing my job at the end of the month. I had too many roles, affecting too many pieces of engineering, and my title didn&#39;t reflect my work. I needed to go down to a 4 day work week and have my title reflect my roles, but my manager attempted to call my bluff and essentially said it&#39;s not going to happen. I hinted about what my decision would have to be if these accomodations couldn&#39;t be made, but he didn&#39;t budge. When I gave my verbal notice, suddenly there was immediate backpedaling and said maybe something could be worked out. I declined because I don&#39;t negotiate like that. If you mismanage a negotiation, there is no do-overs just because you overplayed your hand. The trust is broken."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Rather than look for another job I retired at 63.5. My job was long hours, high stress, high visibility, continuous deadlines and changes that never ended at a large non FAANG company. Compensation was OK (not FAANG but OK for where I am). Everything I or my team shipped worked great; but lots of things with these challenges never shipped for political/idiotic reasons. So much budget was wasted on Exec whims and fantasy. I just grew tired of the frustration. If I were younger I would have left and gone to the local competition or even moved somewhere. But enough was enough after almost 6 years here.I still write code but now its just for me to support my generative art. I still hear stories from my former team; not missing the nightmare at all."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the good things that I think happened from the pandemic is that more and more people are realizing that tying up your identity and sense of self-worth in your job is a bad thing, that&#39;s why I&#39;m very glad to see compensation so high on this list.Sure, everyone wants to work in a good working environment, but I think the idea that &#34;nobody left because of the money&#34; is finally being put to bed.The fact is that corporations and VCs have always realized that business is primarily just about the money, and their ability to get people to work for their &#34;passion&#34; has resulted in people getting underpaid. I&#39;m always especially amused when people are expected to have &#34;passion&#34; when they&#39;re working at like a bank or an insurance company.You work to make money. There are plenty of opportunities for hobbies and volunteering for passions. I&#39;m not saying you shouldn&#39;t enjoy what you do at work, but don&#39;t lose sight of why someone is paying you to do it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; it&#39;s substantially more work to clean and organize the code for publishing, it will increase the surface for nitpicking and criticism (e.g. coding style, etc).Matt Might has a solution for this that I love:  Don&#39;t clean &amp; organize!  Release it under the CRAPL[0], making explicit what everyone understands, viz.:&#34;Generally, academic software is stapled together on a tight deadline; an expert user has to coerce it into running; and it&#39;s not pretty code. Academic code is about &#39;proof of concept.&#39;&#34;[0] https://matt.might.net/articles/crapl/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hi, Iâ€™m a Research Software Engineer (a person who makes software that helps academics/researchers) at a university in the UK. My recommendation is that not only do you publish the code, you mint a DOI (digital object identifier, Zenodo is usually the go to place for that) for the specific version that was used in your paper and you associate them. And you include a citation file (GitHub supports them now: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-reposi...) in your software repo.Benefits: people who want to reproduce your analysis can use exactly the right software, and people who want to build on your work can find the latest in your repo. Either know how to cite your work correctly.In practice drive-by nitpicking over coding style is not that common, particularly in (some) science fields where the other coders are all other scientists who donâ€™t have strong views on it. Nitpicks can be easily ignored anyway.BTW should you choose to publish, the Turing Way has a section on software licenses written for researchers: https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/lic..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The paper itself is enough to reproduce all the results.No, this is almost never the case. It should be. But it cannot really be. There are always more details in the code than in the paper.Note that even the code itself might not be enough to reproduce the results. Many other things can matter, like the environment, software or library versions, the hardware, etc. Ideally you should also publish log files with all such information so people could try to use at least the same software and library versions.And random seeds. Make sure this part is at least deterministic by specifying the seed explicitly (and make sure you have that in your log as well).Unfortunately, in some cases (e.g. deep learning) your algorithm might not be deterministic anyway, so even in your own environment, you cannot exactly reproduce some result. So make sure it is reliable (e.g. w.r.t. different random seeds).&gt; In my field many scientists tend to not publish the code nor the data.This is bad. But this should not be a reason that you follow this practice.&gt; clean and organize the code for publishingThis does not make sense. You should publish exactly the code as you used it. Not a restructured or cleaned up version. It should not be changed in any way. Otherwise you would also need to redo all your experiments to verify it is still doing the same.Ok, if you did that as well, then ok. But this extra effort is really not needed. Sure it is nicer for others, but your hacky and crappy code is still infinitely better than no code at all.&gt; it will increase the surface for nitpicking and criticismIf there is no code at all, this is a much bigger criticism.&gt; publishing the code will be removing the competitive advantageThis is a strange take. Science is not about competing against other scientists. Science is about working together with other scientists to advance the state of the art. You should do everything to accelerate the process of advancement, not try to slow it down. If such behavior is common in your field of work, I would seriously consider to change the field."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi HN,This idea has been a dream of mine for years [0]. As a web developer, I never learned After Effects or any other complex animation software.But I&#39;ve always dreamed of creating interactive demos and animations just by using my natural mouse movements. It just feels right.So last week I took a few days off from my main project to create Animatize [1], a proof-of-concept showing off the idea of using natural movement to create an animation.I&#39;d love to know what you think.[0] http://motioncomicbuilder.storylog.com/[1] https://github.com/panphora/animatize"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is such a cool project. Quick suggestion: would be nice to have some way of &#34;smoothening&#34; the animations; I think a simple interface for that would make it a lot more usable in practice. The human hand is a bit shaky :)Anyway, bookmarked!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is what ergonomics looks like. Even small children can convey the movement of actors through space using similar techniques. It&#39;s an extremely natural way to communicate how something moves. But we have lost that basic idea in favor of very precise animation tools and the complexity that comes with them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A huge problem with this industry is the inflexibility to pay current engineers LARGELY increasing comp each year. The thought is that there is a market rate for an engineer and that pay can increase with the market rate, but this is a fallacy. An engineer that has been at a largish company for 1 year is worth 20-30% more than the year they were hired because they have specific knowledge of the tech stack. Yet that engineer will likely be offered a 3-5% raise. An engineer with 3+ years might be worth 50%+ because they have developed the specific skills relevant to the job AND know the idiosyncacies about org politics and the nitty gritty parts of the codebase. Yet they will still only get a 10-15% raise. So that engineer moves on and accepts a 40% raise elsewhere. And thus we see the constant churn of highly talented engineers which is a huge drain on productivity for all involved."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Perhaps Iâ€™ve been unlucky but my experience at big tech has been marred by churn and burn culture - high pressure tactics to get the most work out of employees and discarding them when they inevitably burn out. Average tenure was 1-3 years.  Amazon was particularly bad at this. The only modicum of power employees have is in quitting and now that theyâ€™re exercising it the employers are acting like their throats have been cut.Edit: a story I like to tell people about what itâ€™s like to deal with Big Co. is that I solo built a $50Mp.a. profit data science artifact in my first year. They offered me the highest once off bonus on offer $30K stretched over 6 years, no promotion (those were used to keep US citizens). I said, give me the same bonus as my manager for for â€˜managingâ€™ my project ~$150K in one year or Iâ€™ll quit. They said no so I quit. The artifact was extremely difficult to build and written in Scala, it took a lot out of me, no one understood it after I left. They rewrote it in Java which made it even harder to understand. It atrophied over 5 years and now it doesnâ€™t even work at all. Iâ€™m in contact with my former colleagues and keep offering to fix it for 7 figures, but no dice. Theyâ€™ve now convinced themselves it is impossible to do. Thatâ€™s how committed they are to maintaining the status quo."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article does accidentally capture one of the major corporate problems pretty well. The conclude from their data that Toxic Workplace Culture is the biggest cause of resignation, and then they immediately suggest 4 short term things to try that don&#39;t relate to culture at all.If you have a toxic workplace culture, the very first thing you should do is to start fixing your culture. This is very hard and not fast (as they acknowledge to be fair). One thing you can do though is to acknowledge it to your employees - &#34;X, Y and Z is wrong and we&#39;re working to fix it&#34;. Nothing destroys morale more than employees being unhappy about a set of things and then management standing up and telling you there aren&#39;t any problems."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"1) At the blocking moment I had only 2 videos (just screen records) on my channel which showed the same problem in 2 different Grammarly products
2) these videos were an illustration for my report https://hackerone.com/reports/1282282, which Grammarly disclosed to the public and does not consider this a problem.
3) these videos were published after Grammarly representatives allowed me to release this information
4) in the description of the video there were links to the HackerOne case for the problem  and to my blog https://evilksandr.medium.com/7bdb343c956b with a detailed study of this problem
5) the video was posted for educational purposes only and without malicious intent
I believe that my channel was blocked by mistake.
Please, anyone who knows somebody from YT/G team, tag them in my tweet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A Grammarly team member but posting own thoughts to clarify some things.First, Grammarly has nothing to do with this suspension and does not have any problem with the videos in question, just as mentioned in the official HackerOne response.Second, this is not a hack or even a flaw. It is an attempt to use Grammarly for a NON-INTENDED purpose, that predictably did not work. Grammarly is not meant for anti-plagiarism policy enforcement. Grammarly aims to help users avoid accidental or unintentional plagiarism by highlighting parts that may need to be cited. So it does not attempt to deal with any plagiarism enforcement countermeasures. If someone is deliberately masking plagiarism with these countermeasures, it&#39;s definitely NOT unintentional or accidental and a whole different issue altogether, so Grammarly does not get involved with this, by design. Bypassing the tool that is designed to HELP YOU avoid getting in trouble with accidental plagiarism is not a hack but more like &#34;bypassing&#34; your wifi by putting your own router in a microwave - defeating the purpose rather than defeating security. So Grammarly does not care about these videos (although I think presenting this as a hack or a flaw is a little unfair).Finally, Youtube&#39;s automated (I&#39;m guessing) blocking often does strange things. My account was once blocked for supposedly violating Sony&#39;s video game copyright. The video in question was me driving a car on a race track, in real life. It got unblocked within a week or two, though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"After Grammarly spent millions of dollars on Google ads, I expect them not to accept valid criticism on Google platforms.But it&#39;s unfair to block a guy that talked about a real flaw in Grammarly&#39;s plagiarism checker, at least pretend that you allow free speech and take down that video for a random reason specified in your ToS."</p>

Either way, it&#39;s a quirky thing for Gravitational to post, since their flagship project --- Teleport --- basically eliminates bastion servers altogether (you might think of it as an API-controlled self-contained bastion server). Teleport is free, and worth checking out: it solves a bunch of SSH management problems, not just controlling access, but also linking SSH access to SSO, running fleet-wide commands selectively, and generating transcripts of SSH sessions.Teleport is kind of big and sprawling. But they&#39;ve repeatedly contracted Doyensec to do assessment work for it, and Doyensec is a fantastic firm. I think parked behind Tailscale, so none of your SSH infra is exposed to the Internet to begin with, it&#39;s a pretty great solution, and I&#39;d do that again before I ever hand-tooled an SSH bastion host again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a few weird things, but it&#39;s mostly okay.Do not trust the firewall on the bastion host, if an attack can get into the bastion host, they can disable the firewall, so it cannot be used to limit egress. It&#39;s better than nothing, but consider using a firewall that&#39;s managed on a via a separate management network. I do agree that you should only allow SSH from a few known IPs.Limiting the number of users is weird, and not recommended. Create all the accounts you need to provide individual accounts for the staff that need to access the bastion host, you will need that as things like HIPAA require named accounts for auditing. None of the accounts need any privileges other than the most basic. Users do not need sudo/root privileges on a jump host.Other than those two complains, it&#39;s good recommendations.A final recommendation: If you use AWS though, consider using Session Manager instead of SSH and drop the bastion host. You can still connect using the SSH command, using proxy command in OpenSSH, but no public IP or bastion host is required."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It does not seem to be mentioned here. But, my #1 hardening suggestion is install the Tripwire IDS (Intrusion Detection System). It is probably the best thing you could ever do for yourself as a system administrator. It integrity checks the entire file system. If anything happens to your system that you didn&#39;t authorize you&#39;re notified of it immediately. After initial install it is important to minimize and exclude false positives so that you end up with a system that rarely changes in ways you don&#39;t expect or can at least explain.Another really useful tool is logwatch.I actually caught an intruder this way hijacking my system several years ago. They removed rkhunter, chkrootkit and a variety of log files. And, modified lines in the last logged in users log. But, a combination of logwatch and tripwire caught it.https://opensource.com/article/18/1/securing-linux-filesyste..."</p>
