If the answer sounds vague, beware. If the answer makes no sense, beware. If the answer is multifaceted, beware. This suggests that the company will not even begin the process of becoming profitable.2. Who has this problem?You should get a clear picture of an actual person. If not, beware. If that person has no money, beware. If that person has no pull within an organization, beware. If that person is high maintenance or fickle, beware. This suggests that the company will never find the revenue they seek.3. What&#39;s your solution?If the solution doesn&#39;t actually address the problem, beware. If the solution is too expensive for the customer, beware. If the solution can&#39;t be differentiated from its competitors, beware. If the solution has no competitors, beware. If there are a dozen solutions, beware.

Have you ever seen a person turn a shade of grey? Have you ever watched your interviewers start to argue about what the meaning of true happiness might be, before conceding that neither of them were happy?My all time favorite, from a gentleman at TD Waterhouse, nearly 20 years ago:&#34;Is anyone really ever happy at work?&#34;They made an offer, I didn&#39;t accept. Nearly everyone in Corporate America looks visibly depressed. Doubly so in our new COVID world.Someone remind me what the point of all this is again?

As of now there is no specific reason for most of the people to try Deno as Node with its plethora of frameworks works and every one can choose their stack as per their taste.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Personally I think they should not be able to decide such things. A payment provider should be forced to accept all legitimate customers. It is absolutely unwanted for a private business (in an unrelated category no less) to be playing the role of legislator.The problem is once a majority of payment providers (especially in this category where there&#39;s only really 2 major ones) starts blocking things, it becomes really difficult for fringe groups that are in fact perfectly legal. I understand that porn payments are a bit more risky but the providers can simply have a policy to deny chargebacks for this category and shift the risk to the customer. Similar to the way returns of sex toys are not accepted for hygiene reasons.Recently there was a lot of news in the Netherlands about prostitutes not being able to open bank account because all banks refused them. Think of prostitution what you will but over there it&#39;s legal work and they pay their taxes. But not being able to get a bank account gets them into very difficult situations and pushes them to shady people (which was exactly what the legalisation was avoiding).Also other platforms like fetlife have recently been forced to validate their users, leading to potentially serious consequences if this data ever becomes compromised. Many people there don&#39;t even show their face so the result is that they have to give a lot more personal info now than they would have wanted to."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; A section on furries, an online subculture interested in anthropomorphic animal characters with human personalities, reads âcontent that depicts furries and humans engaged in sexual acts are not permitted across the board. Content that depicts furry engaged in sexual acts with another furry is acceptable across the board.â Lest that leave any room for misinterpretation: âPlease note, per Visa Â­regulations a furry that contains human-like characteristics is not permitted.â So, no half-man, half-furry.Oh, what I would give to be a fly on the wall in that meeting"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As an author of pinephone keyboard firmware, I spent a bit of time thinking and trying to use keyboard like this. I can say that what hinders portability/serious use of all of these layout designs that try to emulate regular big keyboard is that they try to emulate big keyboard layout. That layout is made with an asumption that you have many fingers available, and that they can easily reach anywhere if you like.If you have only two thumbs available for typing, that can only reach about half the keyboard each (quite a hard limit!), you realize how asumptions this layout makes suddenly don&#39;t hold, and normal things like ctrl+a or alt+shift+1, or alt+shift+any arrow are almost impossible.Yes, you can modify the shortcuts in i3wm,screen,... (not Firefox, which is quite resistant to modifying keyboard shortcuts by design) specially for your &#34;PDA&#34;. But  if you just want a portable device you can painlessly migrate your tasks to for a few days a year, spending a lot of time designing shortcuts for your DE, or terminal multiplexer, is not that appealing.It would be probably more useful if key layout was designed from the start to allow various modifier combos to be invoked by dedicated keys, or layout designed so that more modifiers were symetricaly placed (or something even less traditional, and have all letter/number keys on the right and all modifier/modifier combos/special keys on the left), instead of wasting space on big enter key, or big spacebar (for which you may spend several HW iterations just to make those right and reactive on their whole surface), etc. Due to size, it&#39;s usually uncomfortable to press 3 key combos even with the keyboard laying on the table.Also comfortable position for the most comonly used keys (usually modifiers) is not on the edge of the keyboard. That&#39;s really pretty bad for your thumbs.The layout of these things just needs a lot more thought.Sad thing is, that if someone would spend a ton of research and thinking on making something usable and comfortable, most people would completely poopoo it as a freaky unusable layout, just because it would look unfamiliar, lol."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ugh, every time I see a device like this (and even the larger Reform) I&#39;m so tempted. But I learned my lesson form-factor wise with the GPD Win Max: even as a travel laptop it&#39;s painfully small after about a day or two of use. And the sad reality is that the performance-freedom tradeoff is still immense. If we assume the best system module is faster than say a Raspberry Pi 4 (which seems optimistic), it&#39;d still get absolutely walked by an 11-year old i5 (e.g., Tx20 generation Thinkpad which are coreboot-able these days).Any kind of performance-critical stuff is clearly not the point, but it&#39;s hard to not think that smartphones have killed off this form-factor/performance tier for good reason. Makes a lot of sense as a Raspberry Pi with a screen and keyboard, but not really as a &#34;laptop.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m fascinated, ongoingly by a Linux phone. I spent effort making many versions of the Sharp Zaurus cellular(ish) back in the day, even going as far as writing a sync tool for Evolution back in 2003. I&#39;d love a Linux cellphone.  My needs are very simple, and I&#39;d love to know the state of anything that can (and with stability).1. Be a decent phone (voice, sms)
2. Contacts/Mail/Calendar sync
3. Run android apps that require voice (Telegram, Signal, WhatsApp, etc)?
4. Take pictures + videos (not even at a high level)
5. eSIMEverything else is gravy. But those 5 items are the base requirement that I personally have for a phone. Every time I dip in, it&#39;s at best unclear."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There is of course a flood of negative comments...So in the interest of balance I have to say thunderbird is a excellent program. I use it as my daily driver in work and for personal use.It has so many features that puts me, the user, in control that I totally take them for granted until I have to use outlook for something.I use it in a multinational, I used it with exchange and now with office 365. People can complain away but there are many like me who rely on it every single day and it has a real, positive impact on our work lives every single day.Some days are just email client and Web browser, and without thunderbird and Firefox working for me as the user...... I dunno, work would be a lot more frustrating I guess. MASSIVE thanks to all the contributors to thunderbird!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; One of the core philosophies behind the development of Thunderbird 102 was doing more with less.&gt; ...youâll find out-of-box support for the popular, decentralized chat protocol Matrix in Thunderbird 102Personally, I see these two statements as being directly contradictory. I&#39;m glad to see Thunderbird&#39;s maintenance continuing well, but I want it to be a focused app. On the other hand, I have been glad to have out of the box Lightning integration, so perhaps I will come to enjoy the Matrix addition as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A few months ago I was tasked with switching our office from Gmail&#39;s web interface to Thunderbird and it&#39;s gone surprisingly well. Usually new software meets a lot of resistance and complaints from the staff, but I&#39;ve heard mostly praise.I&#39;ve been playing around with a testing version (beta? nightly? can&#39;t remember) and am very excited about the chat integration. I&#39;m not sure if it will be useful in the office, which is small enough for people to just talk to one another, but it could come in handy in some circumstances where we&#39;d normally use an email chain."</p>
