								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The blurring and then sharpening in spatial domain is equivalent to applying a band-pass filter, or rather a band-stop in the article&#39;s case, in the frequency domain. Blurring requires a lot of parameter tuning, in particular the size of the mask and the weight of each the mask element. The choice of parameter can be mapped to particular filter in the frequency domain, e.g. a gaussian filter or an ideal filter. Same for sharpening. Operating in the frequency domain allows you to skip all the trial and error of parameters, by eye-balling the frequency of interest, and suppress its presence.&gt; what you did is still the best out thereIt still is.I worked with a printing company before. The company impart anti-forgery pattern to packaging material by tuning the half tone-ing angle of the printer. The printing company then offer a seemingly transparent film, with special pattern printed on it, to company requiring brand protection. By overlaying the film on top of packaging material, a specifically designed moire pattern would occur. If you squint your mind enough, it is like public-private key encryption in the physical world. Whenever the brand receive dispute over authenticity of purchased items, a special team, a team having that transparent film, will be summoned to verify the authenticity of item in question. It is one of the many ways the brand in question protect their goods. The printing company was looking for a mobile solution instead of delivery the transparent film, that&#39;s where I get to learn more about the printing industry."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nature will quite readily calculate the 2D Fourier transform and its inverse for us without the use of a digital computer.This is because lenses effectively do a Fourier transform at the focal point. With the right setup, you can apply filters at the focal point and get pretty much exactly what you would expect. An example of such a setup is the 4F Correlator.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article doesn&#39;t say, but te method described in the article is called a notch filter. Here are some links on it, [0], [1], [2], [4]. Instead of cutting a sharp edge on the frequency domain, it&#39;s better that the filter blur the edge to avoid introducing too much artifacts, and this is called a Gaussian notch filter.Anyway here is another method, that also targets peak regions on frequency domain for removal but is based on a median filter instead, [5][0] Removal of Moiré Patterns in Frequency Domain, https://ijournals.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/5.3106-Khanj...[1] Periodic Noise Removing Filter, https://docs.opencv.org/3.4.15/d2/d0b/tutorial_periodic_nois...[3]  Adaptive Gaussian notch filter for removing periodic noise from digital images, https://ietresearch.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1049/iet-...[4] Adaptive Optimum Notch Filter for Periodic Noise

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi,
I am the developer of the app in question, accessible hangman, as well as the other games I hve made for iOS.
I am a blind developer myself, that is why I thought htat making games for the blind would be the best approach for me. I chose Apple&#39;s platform, instead of Android, because of the way that SwiftUI lets me write the UI via code and change visual appearance of buttons, etc just by adding button shapes, icons, etc.Now, I do understand that every app needs to go through review every time it is updated, of course. But this is verion 2.5 of the app, this is in no way the first or second version.
So yes, Apple seems to find a new issue when someone just finds a little light in their brain clicking into place, the first version had no such issue. But after 4 or 5 versions, oooooh wait, your app does not comply with blah blah blah.
So, yes, I think this is unfair.
Anyway, I have some news regarding this whole hing, the update was pushed through and approved finally so I&#39;m a bit less worried, they still say I should talk to them on the phone so they&#39;re going to schedule a call with me.
Let&#39;s see how this turns out. Thanks all."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Apple killed one of the best voiceover enabled single-player poker simulator about 2 years ago.  THETAPoker was absolutely great, and the author invested a lot of time and energy to make the game perfectly self-voicing.  Until Apple review falsely identified it as a gambling-app which needs to be banned.  The author tried to get someone to listen at apple, and was totally ignored.  Now, Apple has a similar poker simulator, called hold&#39;em, which is by far not as good regarding VoiceOver support.  It feels like a scam to kick someone from the AppStore who did a very good job just to make your own botched copy-cat app more prominent.That said, Apple VoiceOver is still one of the best shipped-by-default accessibility systems.  However, we have to thank Steve Jobs for this.  If it were only for Tim Cook, apple wouldn&#39;t even know how to spell accessibility."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At a previous company, when I was developing an iOS app, it was difficult to impress upon the business people that there was a very real risk of Apple simply cutting us off.  (When Apple wanted to compete in our space, or they cut a deal with a competitor of ours, or they came up with some new idea about &#34;security&#34; or &#34;experience&#34;, or simply Kafkaesque random bureaucratic whim with no appeal.)I then had to explain why &#34;the market&#34; hadn&#39;t already corrected that, and why regulators hadn&#39;t.Separate from my professional career, one of the more personal reasons that the reality of the iron-fisted mad-king Apple iOS app store made me sad is... I had hard-won skills at some tricky iOS things, and it would&#39;ve been very tempting to moonlight on some creative apps that did something new, while also generating side income.  But, for this and other Apple developer-hostile reasons, I&#39;d end up aggravated in my spare time, and always with the risk that at some point Apple will stab me in the back.  That&#39;s no way to spend one&#39;s spare time refreshing from the real job."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One thing that helped me is not to care so much about my employer&#39;s goals.It&#39;s almost heretical. But once you embrace this mindset, it does wonders. Or at least, it has for me so far.I think a lot of us want to be proud of the work we do, and we feel that if we slack off, then we shouldn&#39;t be proud. But it&#39;s the other way around. I think the slackers have it right.You&#39;re probably not going to get rich from working a day job. You&#39;re replaceable, and if you left your job tomorrow then you&#39;ll soon be forgotten. This is true for the majority of software engineers.In that context, why do so many of us take on so many unnecessary responsibilities? It&#39;s tempting to say &#34;Well, my employer assigned them.&#34; But how often do you tell them no, or try to present a different approach that just so happens not to involve you?I know someone who is a chronic yes person. They will almost never say no, and they&#39;re pretty stressed day to day because of it. Whenever I point out that they&#39;re taking on too much, they say that they disagree and that it&#39;s their career.That&#39;s true, but they won&#39;t get rich from that career, so I don&#39;t understand why they care so much about it.Just remember to say &#39;no&#39; for yourself from time to time. You often don&#39;t need to take on as many responsibilities as you have."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a 54 year old Software Engineer, who has had a nice IT career for over 26 years, I&#39;m spent.This is coming from someone who has always had a growth mindset and had a really hard time sitting still.  I used to loathe naps and felt like I was missing out if I took one.  Now, I take a one hour nap almost daily and I&#39;m finding that after 1pm I&#39;m basically fried (I start working around 7AM).I&#39;m not sure what to do about it, if anything.  If I could retire now, I would.I&#39;m trying very hard to get my earnestness about learning new things back and I&#39;m finding that my motivation has just tanked.I&#39;m afraid this is a permanent state now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"All good advice. I distinctly remember they day I changed. I was talking to my wife and telling her how I thought Sun should give more vacation, she pointed out that I had come back from the office at lunch time and that is was Christmas Eve which was a company holiday. So many things went &#34;Click!&#34; all at the same time.From that point on I made it a priority to be home by 6PM so that we could have dinner with the family at 6:30. No more late nights, no more stressing about being the first guy to leave the office. Instead I was going to have a relationship with my kids and share in the adventures of their childhood.It did affect my career, nobody who wanted to get to VP level ever went home on time AFAICT. But it gave me focus in that I knew I was going to roll out of the office between 5:30 and 5:45 so my deadlines were set accordingly. I did log in some evenings after the kids had gone to bed but it wasn&#39;t the &#34;usual&#34; thing. And the wife and I spread out the vacation so that every month we had a 3 day weekend (either from holidays or by using a vacation day.) It made things much more tolerable."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The real reason they were so pissed off at Assange seems to be in two parts:
1) The Chelsea Manning State Department cables. The video was all the hype, but just dig through the &#39;SECRET&#39; cables on Iraq, Saudi Arabia, etc.  Zero interest in &#39;human rights and democracy&#39;, lots of interests in oilfields, pipelines, military sales contracts, etc.2) Those Vault7 CIA leaks are incredibly embarrassing, it&#39;s like so closet criminal organization - and with a program to run cyberwarfare attacks using Russian/Chinese signatures in the code to hide atttribution? That&#39;s kind of insanely deceptive and criminal I think.All told, those revelations make the State Dept. and the CIA look more like some kind of organized white-collar mafia outfit in the service of Wall Street shareholders than anything else.  That kind of raw exposure makes the corrupt insiders in the US government very sad.I&#39;d guess they&#39;ve got a lot more to hide, and are most worried about further eruptions of embarrassment."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t see how anybody could read this and then pretend that Assange has any chance of a fair trial in America. Not only were his communication constantly monitored for years, already a breach of client attorney privilege, the US considered flagrant assassination as a potential way to handle him.I&#39;ve heard many people say that Assange committed actual crimes and it&#39;s time for him to face the consequences of those actions. While I personally disagree about whether he&#39;s done anything illegal,  even if he has it impossible for him to get a fair trial and justice to be served. Everything being done to him is an effort to get revenge on the person who embarrassed the military and intelligence communities."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The interesting bit I didn&#39;t know was the article says that Wikileaks did not publish the complete contents of the Vault 7 materials they had. Not sure whether they just published shasums of the bits they didn&#39;t, or if they proved some other way they had parts they were holding back as leverage.It&#39;s odd to read what was really at stake. Pompeo&#39;s team was ready to assasinate Assange in London, and the only thing stopping them was the justice dept and only nominally the office of the President. What WL (and Snowden) did was show to the public the intelligence community, who was ostensibly accountable to them, for what they truthfully were. The news media took a bigger credibility hit for their history of spiking these stories and delivering hit pieces than the spies ever did.Most people saw how the sausage was made and decided they still liked sausage. Not only do we tolerate what these services do, but now that we know about it and have done nothing to change it, we have acknowledged it and rewarded them for it all. Snowden&#39;s story practically created the ability for retired generals to accept pulpits from tv news where they can armchair QB the issues of the day, and they should thank him for the minor television celebrity and speaker circuit fêting they now enjoy. Whether that undermines the credibility of their institutions is still to be seen, but all that plotting to kill Assange just to sustain some lame narrative about a bureaucracy seems like it was just a fatal distraction from the real unseating of western power that we are clearly into the endgame of today."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"People think if a project on github hasn&#39;t been updated since 3 months then it has been abandoned!!Like, why don&#39;t we just let projects be &#34;done&#34;? Things don&#39;t need to be maintained and updated for eternity.In my mind, the best software engineering is where you solve a problem once and your solution just works and needs no configuration or maintenance or updates.This of course has a very low chance of happening if your system has to exist as a part of &#34;ecosystem&#34; where you expect/assume the presence of some external service that can change its API on a whim (or just disappear).Yes, to a certain degree it&#39;s impossible to design software that does not exist as a part of an ecosystem, which is why I put it in quotes.Some APIs are stable and are guaranteed to continue to exist for a very long time: CPU instruction sets, networking protocols (IP/UDP/TCP), operating systems (AFAICT: Linux (the kernel) works hard to not break user programs, and Windows is kind of known for bending over backwards to maintain compatibility with old programs), file systems, etc.What I&#39;m advocating for here requires that your program be compiled into a native executable binary file, and it must embed all its library dependencies (aka static linking)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been at my current company for maybe 6 years now, in an engineering role.In that time, the service-oriented code which has significantly outlasted anything else, with nearly no maintenance, has maybe surprisingly or unsurprisingly been: AWS Lambda functions.We have quite a few Lambda functions (written in Node) that I believe pre-date even my tenure at the company; the only modifications in the interim, maybe a few lines of obscure bug fixes, updating the lambda node version, we switched from JS to TS everywhere a few years ago, and keeping the CI updated on those repos (which is a rather ironic and wasteful investment of resources given they&#39;ve only changed a half dozen times in something like six years).Checking in on those dozens of functions handling millions of invocations every month, and seeing them just chug along with no maintenance, has convinced me, personally, that if a problem domain can be solved in a FaaS-like way, its the way to do it. Not every problem can, and I&#39;m not specifically advocating for Lambda vs Azure FaaS vs an open source kubernetes-based solution.More-so that, every deployment artifact has to draw an &#34;operations&#34; line, to the left of that is the rote, daily operations banality, and to the right is the ever-changing business problem space. The further right you can draw that line, to push as much as possible into operations, the better; it gives you optionality to outsource that left part, maybe to automated software, maybe to AWS, maybe to an in-house operations team. FaaS draws that line roughly as far right as I think a general purpose programming system can; further right would approach things like Excel, Retool, etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The &#34;essentially no dependencies&#34; thing always fascinates me.Certainly, complex C code is a risk across OS versions but ... perl5 version 8.1 was released just over 18 years ago and after multiple years of annual major releases of perl we&#39;re now on version 34. Many of my chosen cpan dependencies produce the exact same output when on a 5.8.1 install as they do on a 5.34.0 install, and I can move them to a new machine/OS via rsync or tar of the local::lib structure (virtualenv like thing configured by setting a couple of environment variables) and it Just Works.Am I weird here? Is the author? Is python unusually bad? Is perl unusually good? This all seems quite strange to me."</p>

Sort of an Olympic committee for gaming. Give me the option to only play with other verified players. Getting caught cheating in one game then impacts your reputation in _all_ games. There&#39;s a gazillion details that would need to be hammered out to get this right (appeal process, account hijack recovery, etc) but I think the idea has merit. I feel something like this is the only way to end cheating once and for all.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s more information on the Institute for Justice class action (mentioned in the Twitter thread) that&#39;s challenging TSA airport forfeitures:https://ij.org/case/dea-tsa-forfeitures/IJ is the leader on this issue, and if you oppose civil-forfeiture abuse, you might consider supporting IJ&#39;s work.(Disclosure: the IJ attorney pictured in the thread is a friend whom I admire greatly.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a joke in Cuba: Two women argue about who has the better boyfriend. The one says proudly: &#34;Mine works as a luggage-handler at the airport!&#34; To which the other replies ashamed: &#34;Mine&#39;s just a doctor...&#34;With that in mind I wonder whether it is TSA policy to always have these officers cross-sworn in with the FBI, or if it&#39;s a legal loophole which officers can exploit?From the tweet-thread it looks like local police departments have similar &#34;double-agents&#34;...So if it is a loophole the guy in the video just figured how to maximize his reward for his moraly derelict actions. Like the luggage handler at Havanna-Airport."</p>
