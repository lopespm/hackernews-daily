								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As many techies will probably always say anytime inkjet product shenanigans come up: just buy a laser printer.And I now add: and don&#39;t let it connect to the Internet, and don&#39;t install proprietary drivers or software for it on your computers.Also, remember the names of companies doing sketchy things, and do your part to provide negative feedback when you can, and to give positive feedback to better companies.  (Example: I&#39;ve just moved away from the Apple product ecosystem, because Apple did one too many obnoxious things, and I&#39;ll also be pointing friends who ask to alternative solutions.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For  some reason I enabled the ‘auto refill’ on my new canon printer because that is what our office did (somehow).Don’t do that: it kept making purchases because it didn’t receive the ink as fast as it expected due to supply chain issues. It took a long time for Canon to cancel the orders that had never left the factory and give our hundreds of dollars back.It’s a fun story at least!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t mean to beat a dead horse, but when can we get some momentum behind repealing or ruling unconstitutional anti-subversion laws from the DMCA? It would be nice if this sort of thing goes to court and starts to challenge that law, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a likely outcome here, since the nominal case is about fraudulent advertising and no subversion attempt was really made. But it&#39;s exactly the kind of problem that the law creates and perpetuates indefinitely. It&#39;s been barely over 20 years and exploiting them has become the business model of giant swaths of our economy. The harm done to innovation, consumers, and probably honestly the productivity of the US as a whole has so massively dwarfed that of even the most pessimistic models of &#34;piracy&#34; and has reshaped our way of life for a generation. It&#39;s a bad law and it needs to die"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Things I want from Spotify:- Fix the damn album artwork in the browser. A big part of enjoying an album is viewing the cover and liner art. Let me do that full-screen with zoom.- Let me create genre-limited radio stations from my likes. Don&#39;t just play songs from my likes. If I&#39;m in the mood for , say, 80s hip-hop, I want a radio station based off my liked 80s hip-hop songs which includes related artists.- Hide the damn podcasts. There will never be a situation now or in the future where I want to use spotify to listen to a podcast. Users should be able to hide them.- Improve your audio quality. I&#39;ve shamefully returned to bit torrenting flac files because some of what I&#39;ve heard on spotify is so bad. Part of that is because I want access to a vinyl mix.- Your interface sucks. One thing I liked about Google Play Music was easier access to an artist&#39;s discography. Please give me an option to hide &#34;Popular releases&#34; or put a quick access button to reach either Albums or a full discography at the top of the artist&#39;s page so I don&#39;t have to scroll down and hunt for an easily missed label to reach the discography when I use the Android App. When I start the app, there should be a search box ready to go. I shouldn&#39;t have to click the magnifying glass and then a search box. Either put a search box/icon on the home screen which goes direct to an input dialog, or make the magnifying glass respond accordingly.I miss Google Play Music. It wasn&#39;t perfect but it was, in my experience, a far superior product. It&#39;s regrettable that YouTube Music is such a dumpster fire."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"An option to hide all podcasts would significantly improve spotify&#39;s recommendations.  I don&#39;t listen to podcasts (though I have accidentally clicked on one, when a podcast interviewed a musician I like... blech).  Why is my screen filled with podcasts multiple times per day?  I like the music recommendations, &#34;so and so artist radio,&#34; etc., but they make me hunt for them.Also, while I like a broad variety of genres, I only like listening to one at a time.  I don&#39;t want a rap mix to be invaded by a Bach sonata.  And yet..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A dislike button would be handy. There is that feature on some of the generated playlists, but I don&#39;t think they do anything. My two biggest issues with Spotify right now are:
1. Release Radar filled with re-releases and remixes, often from artists who have long since passed away. I want new music as in released for the first time.
2. Name collisions. I&#39;m surprised this is an issue, but I will often get songs from different artists with the same name. And then I&#39;m unsure if selecting &#34;I don&#39;t like this song&#34; or &#34;I don&#39;t like this artist&#34; will affect the actually intended artist.I&#39;ve also reached a tipping point where I no longer find new music through algorithmic recommendations. To be fair it&#39;s taken about 5 years to reach this point. Now the good music I find comes from searching for curated playlists. It&#39;s come full circle as before streaming I got my music recommendations from blogs and friends."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a good example of making the mistake of conflating implementation details and user interface design.Firefox always had two boxes: URL bar and search. One of the big changes Chrome made when it was born was to have the Omnibar, being of course one bar that does both.If you think about this as an engineer, Firefox&#39;s design decision makes sense. You don&#39;t want to accidentally leak things to a search engine. URLs and search bars are just different. There are also corner cases where you&#39;re not sure if something is a URL or a search term, mostly to do with intranets (eg &#34;go/foo&#34; can be a URL internally).But users don&#39;t care about any of that. Users don&#39;t have the mental model to differentiate search terms and a URL. Chrome&#39;s decision was correct. It&#39;s surprising how long Firefox stuck with their bad (IMHO) design.Here&#39;s another example of this: IIRC one of the most frequently searched terms on Google is &#34;facebook&#34;. Tech-savvy people will just type &#34;facebook.com&#34; but users will just search for &#34;facebook&#34; and click on the (hopefully) first result. That happens a ton.So the lesson is don&#39;t leak technical and implementation details into interface design. Your users don&#39;t care about any of that. Think like a user, not an engineer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"serde is one of the best things about Rust in practice.It is more convenient to use serde to serialize/deserialize to some standard format like JSON or YAML than it is to write your own half-baked format and serialization/deserialization code --- even for the simplest tasks --- so you just stop doing the latter. This is a fundamental shift, and very good for your software.&#34;Convenience&#34; here actually covers a lot of ground. The APIs are convenient. Boilerplate code is minimal (#[derive(Serialize)]). serde&#39;s attributes give you lots of control over the serialization/deserialization, while still being convenient to use. cargo makes importing serde into your project effortless. All of these are necessary to achieve that shift away from custom formats.Before Rust I used to write a lot of one-off half-baked formats. Pernosco uses Rust and serde and it uses no half-baked formats. Everything&#39;s JSON, or YAML if it needs to be more human-editable, or bincode if it needs to be fast and compact and not human-readable or extensible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To me, Serde is one of the killer features of Rust. Once you realize how much of programming is (for better or worse) shuttling data between different representations, it&#39;s hard for me to program in a language where I don&#39;t have a tool like Serde.A big part of its flexibility is how modular it is. Most common Rust libraries support serde serialization (at least as an optional feature), so if you use crates that do, you can plug any backend in and serialize those data structures to it. It doesn&#39;t even have to be string-based; I&#39;ve been using Serde to store arbitrary data structures as objects on Google Cloud Firestore."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Whilst not classical de/serialization I wrote serde_v8 (https://github.com/denoland/serde_v8), an expressive and ~maximally efficient bijection between v8 &amp; rust.It has powered Deno&#39;s op-layer since 1.9 (https://deno.com/blog/v1.9#faster-calls-into-rust-with-serde...) and has enabled significant improvements in opcall overhead (close to 100x) whilst also simplifying said op-layer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Trust busting can seem like it’s anti free market, but when a company has a monopoly on a network it stops functioning as a company and basically becomes a government. The problem with Facebook/Amazon/Google is that they have a monopoly on a specific information network, for Facebook the social graph, internet discoverability for Google, and online shopping for Amazon. It’s similar to if a single company owned the road systems or the internet, since the structure of these networks means that competitors can’t exist, there can only be one network for it to have value, so the first company to build it will have a monopoly and be able to indefinitely milk it for a profit.The same thing happened with railroad barons in the 1800s and also in other areas of the economy, and the trust busting response the government took seems to have worked well to bring back a fair market. Government should keep the information networks predictable and accessible.This is a core theme in George Gilder’s controversial but imho extremely insightful book Knowledge and Power: The Information Theory of Capitalism and How it is Revolutionizing our World: https://www.amazon.com/Knowledge-Power-Information-Capitalis..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sigh, another day, another blame of Facebook for destroying Snap.Fundamentally, products are always gonna get copied. Google tried to do it to Facebook, back when FB was the size that Snap was at the time, how well did that work?Fundamentally, while competing with a megacorp sucks monkey balls, Snap shot themselves in the foot with their boneheaded product strategy.They literally didn&#39;t invest in their Android app because they wanted to be exclusive. Given that the vast majority of countries are majority Android, this gave FB the space to clone their product and put it in front of hundreds of millions of users who&#39;d never seen the concept before.Ultimately, while I do agree with most of the articles points (breaking up the internet behemoths would probably be a good idea), I really dislike the Snap analogy, as they could easily have beaten FB to the punch if they&#39;d had an effective growth strategy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem with these types of articles is that it doesn&#39;t contain a single actionable step on how one would go about breaking up these monopolies. It&#39;s a lot of &#34;well, we did it with the electrical providers and telephone providers so we should do it with google.&#34;Well, you can take a national utility and split it across geographic regions so local calls or electricity bills go into the pockets of the region you are in, and calls between two regions go into the pockets of both according to whatever long distance agreement is in place. That&#39;s at least workable. Or you break up an Oil Company that has 500 wells/concessions, into 5 groups of 100 wells/concessions. Or a railroad with a nationwide network, split up into 5 regional networks. That could work, too. That&#39;s what we did in the past to break up monopolies.Now how would that work with google search? Prevent people in region A from loading a website in region B? Is that what we want? cricketsSure there is low hanging fruit in terms of divesting -- e.g. no reason to keep a video monopoly like youtube with a search monopoly. I&#39;m all for it. But now you just have two monopolies, and have not solved the problem of lack of competition in either video or search, which is ostensibly what you use to justfy these actions.In fact the consumer pains with long distance in the wake of the ATT breakup is the reason why the law has changed on anti-trust. Now you must show consumer harm to pass constitutional muster and your proposal has to show consumer benefit.  A proposal to break off youtube from google is going to have a hard time passing this test.So yes, we, get it, we solved the problem of anti-trusts in the past, we don&#39;t like google, so We Must Do Something. Except those old anti-trust strategies just wont work against monopolies that have no geographic dimension. That no one is willing to touch that explains why we have a deluge of pleas, none of which contain a single workable proposal."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The view I share with a majority of Germans: Costs of nuclear energy are very much a burden that future generations will have to carry. A hundered thousand years of safe storage is not part of the calculation of the energy price. It is also clear now that the the companies running the plants will not pay for the deconstruction of the plants after they reached their end of life. Tax payers have to pay for this, and a large part of the remains will need to be stored safely for millenia as well. This is the opposite of sustainability and fairness towards future generations. Worldwide there still exists only a single final storage solution for nuclear waste - in Finland for the finish waste. In densly populated Germany the search for a storage site has been going on since the late 1950s, so far without success. All this on top of the risk of a system failure that would devastate huge territories. In a country where, as we&#39;ve recently seen, simple emergency warning systems are basically non-existent and fax is still the main communication tool for the authorities..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s worth noting that nuclear is really expensive when factoring in insurance and disposable, a lot more so than wind and solar.&gt;The cost of generating solar power ranges from $36 to $44 per megawatt hour (MWh), the WNISR said, while onshore wind power comes in at $29–$56 per MWh. Nuclear energy costs between $112 and $189.https://www.reuters.com/article/us-energy-nuclearpower/nucle..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One generally underappreciated aspect to nuclear energy opposition is the intrinsic link to nuclear weapons.  Some of it is scientifically illiterate nonsense (a lot of people seem to think power reactors can have a nuclear explosion).  And some of it is just historical association.  But some of it is a lot harder to dismiss.A world without nuclear reactors or enrichment facilities is a world without nuclear weapons.  Any medium or large industrialized country with power reactors could build nukes very quickly.  It&#39;s bad enough half a dozen already have.  This notion keeps some people up at night, I think.  If you consider nuclear weapons to be an existential threat to the species -- perhaps worse than climate change -- then building infrastructure that would allow their more easy construction might seem like madness."</p>
