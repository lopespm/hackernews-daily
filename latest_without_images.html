It already passes Acid3, which is more than can be said for Dillo and NetSurf, the two other prominent &#34;alternative browser&#34; projects. Those aren&#39;t even capable of passing Acid2.The Ladybird browser came to life on July 4thCoincidence or not, that&#39;s a great date."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Q: Do you have a JavaScript JIT compiler?&gt; No, we have a traditional AST interpreter that is being replaced by a bytecode VM. You can track the LibJS test262 score for both backends here. I’m not convinced that the complexity and security burdens of a JavaScript JIT are reasonable, and given recent developments like Microsoft Edge’s Super Duper Secure Mode, I’m interested in pushing for best-effort JIT-less performance while keeping the codebase simple.Always excited to see new JS engines. I&#39;d be curious to see where LibJS&#39;s performance / code simplicity / memory balance tends towards over time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been watching his YouTube videos on developing the LibJS and LibWeb components. They are interesting and show that this kind of thing can be done.As a larger point, it is important to have multiple web stacks so that no one player can dictate what the web should look like, or gate access through that stack. Having this new stack grow to the point where it is becoming a viable alternative is great to see."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I highly doubt AI is being used here to match up the Open Camera footage with the instagram pic. Identifing humans as an object within a frame is trivial. Identifying individuals requires a considerable amount of custom training which is more than what is available from an instagram pic and a few video frames. I&#39;m not saying it can&#39;t be done, it&#39;s just not that easy. I&#39;d bet $100 bucks that most, if not all, of these matches were accomplished using good old stalking (matching post times to manually reviewing video data). Would be happily proven wrong but without any source code provided I stand firm with my opinion."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The UK media (not just the BBC) continue to profess &#34;amazement&#34; at the speed and efficiency of the transitioning from a dead monarch to a living one. There&#39;s been much speaking in awed tones at the pace of the various proclamations, committee meetings, document signings, etc, as if this pace tells us why we should be impressed.Personally I&#39;ve found it borderline sickening.If there was a curtain that could have slipped, we all knew what would be behind it: a bunch of cherry-nosed coffin-dodgers with old-school-tie chums ensconced in the machinery of state, parliament, the military, whatever.Sure. Fine. Yadda yadda, blah blah. The &#34;deep state&#34; dancing hand-in-hand with the old school elites. Yuck. Disgusting but hardly a clear and present danger.But to see this machinery spring rustily, creakily into action has been truly eye-opening. Hitherto unknown people wearing ritualistic outfits have marched into public spaces in several cities, and declared that a member of the elite has been replaced, the continuum is unbroken. And this has been broadcast 24/7 by pretty much all media in the UK and in other countries. Elected representatives from all political parties have fallen into line.It is not okay to ritualistically march a bunch of military-state personnel into multiple public spaces across the country, under the protection of the police and with the consent of multiple international media outlets, and expect public passivity and capitulation.And yet, that&#39;s what has happened. And it keeps happening.It&#39;s bizarre in the extreme, and we really should not be okay with this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They aren’t being arrested for being anti-monarchy though.They are being arrested for being rude about it.Was the fella on radio 4 who stated to the entire nation that ‘King Charles and his family should be put in a council house and that the Monarchy should be abolished’ arrested? No.If you are going to attend a funeral, any funeral, be it the Queen’s or anyone else’s and hurl abuse or hold up signs with obscenities, you will be arrested.There were arrests in which the arrestee has been unarrested, when the police made a mistake. Like the fella who stated that ‘we didn’t vote for him’ when King Charles was pronounced King.You can, quite legally, protest the Monarchy. Being a dick about it and trying to upset people mourning will however be considered a breach of the peace or some other public order offence."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The new law allows police to act in cases which they deem to be &#34;unjustifiably noisy protests that may have a significant impact on others&#34; or seriously disrupt an organization&#39;s activities.Doesn&#39;t take a political science degree to see what&#39;s wrong with this law. When cops get to decide what is a justifiably loud protest and what isn&#39;t you no longer have the right to protest. Protests are meant to disrupt, if you can&#39;t be loud about it then it no longer has its intended effect."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Riding a bike doesn&#39;t need to be the only or primary way that people get around in every city, all the time, for it to drastically improve quality of life for people living in cities the world over. Most people are capable of riding a bike - especially an e-bike - to get to where they&#39;re going. It&#39;s cheaper than a car, it can be faster than driving a car, and it is obviously better for both the global climate and the local environment.More than half of all daily trips in the US are less than 3 miles[1]. If cities give people the option to ride a bike for those shorter trips without feeling unsafe, a lot of people will ride bikes to complete those trips. That&#39;s shown over and over again. Change is hard, but a future with less cars and more trips by bike and public transportation is better, and possible.[1] https://www.energy.gov/eere/vehicles/articles/fotw-1230-marc..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just bought a bike in Bangkok.To be honest it sat in my living room for a week because of the fear of riding it on these most dangerous streets. (Bangkok has bad reputation for accidents worldwide).But today I took it out.I rode to work and it was amazing. People here respect two wheels a lot and drivers slow down for you.Normally I’d walk to work for the exercise 3km. Which is about 45 minutes for me each way.But today the riding took about 10-15 minutes with a great cardio workout.I’ll take the bike out most of the week now instead of taking a cab.Here motorcycles are the mainstay. But I’ll stick with my bike for shorter distances and cabs for longer ones."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don’t understand take that this is not possible due to disabled people, winter, hills. Climate and city planning is an incremental problem. Just 2 new bike lanes significantly change the way I am able to commute, even far into the winter, and when it’s raining or snowing I switch to car or public transport. I live in a reasonably bike friendly city for us standards, and it’s clear that some overhauls have made the road much more efficient for cars themselves, pedestrians don’t stray out nearly as much into the road, as did the consolidation of parking spots into parking lots. Just go see some European cities for how not only public transport, biking and a more modern street layout make life better for almost everyone.For disabled people, having dedicated parking spots as well as a pedestrian friendly street layout makes life easier than having to navigate a busy street.Make the city better for bike doesn’t mean making it hell for cars."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I recently watched an interesting discussion on the legality of diversity statement requirements. [1] There&#39;s a lot of nuance here, and the two speakers have different opinions on the matter.One believes that diversity statement requirements can be done properly and we shouldn&#39;t throw the baby out with the bathwater by banning diversity statement requirements.The other speaker suggests these are analogous to requirements that a candidate talk about how they support the government&#39;s ongoing war effort, and catalog all they have done in furtherance of it.1: https://reason.com/volokh/2022/08/30/do-university-diversity..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It could be that the people do care about the values listed, but don&#39;t know an effective way to guarantee them, and that existing diversity statements are a stopgap measure until something better is figured out.But no, let&#39;s jump directly to &#34;Conclusion: By and large, they don’t care about diversity. They’re just lying, in a really transparent way, because they think it gives them a patina of legal legitimacy.&#34;Or... perhaps don&#39;t ascribe to malice that which may be adequately explained by incompetence."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’m glad this research is being done. I don’t use cannabis, but I also don’t frown upon it. However some of the conversations on the use of cannabis recently have changed from “it’s a drug, but it isn’t that bad” to “it is completely harmless”. Which in my opinion is very dangerous and could harm entire populations before we have enough research. In my opinion, it should be considered similar category as alcohol, cigarettes, fat and sugar, a national health issue and research needs to happen asap on various short term and long term effects."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is this really surprising?Any time I had used cannabis I felt like my IQ dropped 20-30 points and I would lose hours of my day where it was difficult for me to learn. It made doing household chores not terrible, but brought out a lot of panic inducing moments and erratic behavior. I was thinking about a 100k other things while doing one thing. Later on I realized I wasn&#39;t even doing that one thing so well. Anything that drops cognitive abilities for a moment is going to be awful long term and especially for babies.I know a lot of people think cannabis isn&#39;t bad, but it is intellectually dishonest to disregard the broader effects of effects on cognition. I say that as someone who used to smoke a ton of cannabis.Not having to rely on drugs to find calmness has made a profound change in my life, and I can&#39;t believe that I used to turn to weed, alcohol, etc. when all I needed to be permanently (key word) happy was already present within me. Prior, when the effects went away I spent just as much time craving and suffering heavily.That being said I don&#39;t think it should be criminalized or anything like that. It is up to adults to do whatever, but it is useful to be honest as well. Not everyone uses it for epilepsy, none of the dispensaries here sell CBD products. Its all high THC products meant to &#34;fuck you up&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The amount of research over last decade has been huge, even outside of this. It used to be the only way companies could research cannabis was by getting really crappy samples from a government grow house, but with legalization the supply of research samples and the quality of researchers willing to work on it has grown considerably.This is a direct safety issue. I used to moderator one of the bigger cannabis subreddits and one of the bigger questions that always came up was whether it was safe to smoke while pregnant. The answer I always gave was that we just don&#39;t know, and so it should be avoided. The lack of research though meant that people couldn&#39;t make informed decisions, and the stereotype around cannabis being safe meant that people did not always err on the side of caution. Now there is something concrete we can point to."</p>

Makes it just so easy to switch and select. Embed in your html page, select an item from the drop down and see what it does to the page, when you’re happy, remove ! Simple. Genius.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Folks here said the new Weather app has the same info. I upgraded to iOS 16 about a year before I normally would just to check this. And nope, it doesn&#39;t have the one feature I use Dark Sky for – the one feature no other weather app has: the ability to see what the weather was yesterday.It&#39;s what Dark Sky calls &#34;Time Machine&#34;. (Can&#39;t believe Apple let them use this name this long, now that I think of it.)(I supported the original crowdfunding campaign for Dark Sky in 2011.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Upsetting about the app, but the new iOS weather app has the functionality essentially.The real gut wrencher is the darksky website going down.

I&#39;ve used the two side-by-side since I learned about this, and it seems like Dark Sky gives far richer detail.In fact, sometimes, I&#39;ve noticed that Dark Sky will accurately predict rain when Apple Weather doesn&#39;t.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A nice game made in Twine is &#34;Chuk and the Arena&#34; [0]. I&#39;m playing through it with my young son currently (having completed it myself before). It&#39;s not extremely easy but not very difficult either, and rather forgiving.  It&#39;s also kind of sweet in a way.  Except for the obvious bad guy(s), people you meet are kind, they help you and each other.Another very impressive Twine game by the same author, 4x4 Archipelago [1], was fun to play, a randomly generated RPG with multiple plots.  But it&#39;s wayy too long and requires some grinding.They&#39;re both kind of like standard IF in that you have an inventory, you can use stuff from the inventory to do things and complete tasks, and you have to rely on hints to figure out what to do.  Also both of them have no time-based elements and it&#39;s very obvious where to click.[0] https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=2fa5imp327k84ox[1] https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=nmg570ycyex4mty0"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interactive, nonlinear stories == interactive fiction (IF) == text adventure games in the style of 1980s Infocom.It&#39;s interesting that the Twine website seems to actively avoid calling them IF or text adventures or games, and prefers &#34;stories&#34; instead. Maybe the community feels that those labels are too limiting. (I haven&#39;t played any contemporary IF or any Twine experiences, so just observing as an outsider.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is amazing. It&#39;s exactly the sort of thing that I can use with my children who enjoy digital literacy (i.e not social networks) but crave play based learning.The language, the tooling.. it all communicates effectively with the way my children think and approach things. Imagine a world of interactive literacy (note: not IF!)? This is a gamechanger for us."</p>
