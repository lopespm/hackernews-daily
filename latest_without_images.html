								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m impressed that one of the first Webb images was a deep-field view.Hubble&#39;s own Deep Field image required about 140 hours of imaging (divided amongst 4 bandwidths and ~150 separate imaging events).  Webb&#39;s own view took a little over 12 hours.  I was expecting nearer and brighter objects to be first targets.  Impressive as heck.Though of course, Hubble paved the way and showed that deep-field imaging is useful and provides insights.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Deep_FieldFor comparison the SMACS 0723 image used for reference in the JWST image target selection nnouncement recently:https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2022/07/hlsp_relics_hst..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know this is whistling in the wind, but the Webb telescope just fills me with such hope and excitement. I feel generally so down about the state of the world, but when I think about the sheer complexity of the Webb telescope and how it has basically gone as well as anyone could hope, it just makes me happy. Deep thanks and gratitude to the huge number of people who worked so hard on this project."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Can someone explain why this won&#39;t result in a renaissance for peer to peer and e2e encrypted chat/forums/social media etc.? When government or industry makes it nearly impossible for consumer needs to be met we inevitably see a grey and black market spring up to meet those needs. My prediction is that if legislation like this becomes widespread we&#39;ll see a freely distributed application rise to prominence among a gaggle of others, it&#39;ll dominate the chat and social market until even grandma is using it and the establishment will have a right proper freak out as other social media giants implode and everyone is communicating anything they want with zero oversight from the government or industry. This is roughly how I remember the Napster affair going when DRM was pushed hard by the recording industry, it eventually collapsed but not before dealing a massive blow to the status quo and forcing a transition to streaming."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If UK government really cared about children, and not about surveillance and censorship, they would solve the problem another way.The only way protect children online is to ban them from Internet. Children should not have access to normal laptops and smartphones, instead they should use &#34;kid phones&#34;. Such phones would allow children to communicate only with people approved by parents or teachers and visit only approved sites. This way they will enjoy perfect safety which this Bill fails to provide.Every site which wants to become approved, must fulfill all the requirements from the Bill and indicate this with a HTTP header. Kid phones and laptops should allow only to visit such compliant sites.Kid-oriented phones and laptops must be visually distinctive: for example, have a shape of a cute animal. In this case teachers, parents or police will be able to instantly spot and confiscate illegal devices.This is a win-win plan: kids would be safe and adults would be safe from government overreach. Obviously no government will agree to such plan."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"With respect to the politicians not turning up, it&#39;s worth noting that at least some of the candidates for PM are against the Online Safety Bill and want to scrap it. So for them, campaigning to become the next leader may actually be a more useful way to spend time than hearing what they already know.It appears the OSB has become a victim of incoherent requirements specifications. It&#39;s grown enormously during its gestation period and is now trying to do way too much, including things that are self-contradictory. Some politicians recognize this, for example Kemi Badenoch:https://order-order.com/2022/07/11/watch-badenoch-slams-onli...but I recall others saying similar things. I just can&#39;t find the references right now."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This comment is from the perspective of a Calibre power-user, and someone who has been involved with the software for years now.I must admit, I&#39;m slightly shocked at some of the comments here. Kovid puts in an extraordinary amount of work (nearly 80 hours a week) into Calibre - of which most is for free, in the name of open source software. Anyone who has spent a decent amount of time on the mobileread forums will also know him as a remarkably intelligent, dedicated, and all-round fantastic guy. He&#39;s very patient and kind with beginners, responsive to feedback, and rarely loses his cool with anyone. His only &#39;crime&#39; was being blunt with a bug report around eleven years ago, and I&#39;m struggling to see why people are so myopic as to turn that into their entire perception of him. Add to the fact that he eventually fixed every bug in that thread as well as second-language difficulties that he likely experiences, and the vitriol that people have for him is undeserved.The proof of the pudding is Calibre itself, which is a joy to use. It is hands down one of the most useful programs on my computer. It&#39;s rarely buggy, fast, logical to use, very feature-rich, and rather customisable. I&#39;m perplexed as to whether some of the people in this thread and I are using the same software. It&#39;s very easy to set up, as all you do is either point to a pre-existing library of files or create a new one. Adding books is trivial, as is editing metadata, and the reader itself is splendid. That&#39;s really what most people need out of e-book software, but Calibre really does go above and beyond any e-book software on the market right now. The only close competitor is Foliate, which is not cross-platform like Calibre, and even then it simply lacks many useful features that I rely on with Calibre, despite having a much cleaner UI."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Kovid Goyal, the developer of Calibre, is a very responsive, very gentle person. Whenever I needed help, I have gotten help from him. [1] - Calibre is an indispensable tool for me to manage my digital library with close to 800 books.I support him regularly. Consinder doing it as well if you appreciate the app. Go to https://calibre-ebook.com/ , there’s a support link on the top right.[1] This is the forum dedicated to Calibre 
https://www.mobileread.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=166"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Calibre does its job so well it&#39;s downright essential for anyone thinking about dealing with ebooks. Glad to hear that full text search is added in this version, using it with a bunch of reference books saved will be so useful. It might be worth splitting out the fiction books I have to clean up the results. Maybe it works with tag filtering, I&#39;ll have to check."</p>

					<h3><a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/pipermail/gcc/2022-July/239057.html">GCC Rust Approved by GCC Steering Committee</a></h3>

					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32057116">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is great! Gcc support opens up more platforms, more targets, and the opportunity to more easily integrate with the various common embedded toolchains that are built around gcc.And it&#39;s free software, for those that care, this matters."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have mixed feelings about the idea of a GCC frontend for Rust.On one hand, having frontend diversity for a language helps bring new people into the language; think of the groups who can&#39;t use Rust because it doesn&#39;t support certain targets or can&#39;t integrate with their existing toolchain. There is a lot of talent that could be brought into Rust just by virtue of them being able to be included and the less barriers of entry, the better.But on the other hand, I don&#39;t want to have to think of implementation specific behaviors, bugs, quirks, et cetera. Having an ecosystem built with thousands of people wrestling with that problem seems like a recipe for buggy software and burnout. People say that a spec would help with this aspect but I&#39;m sceptical; a spec doesn&#39;t prevent divergence from happening, it just gives you a frame of reference for what is correct. You also don&#39;t need multiple implementations to have a spec either!I fear that the way this is going to pan out is that we&#39;ll have multiple frontends for Rust, but the vast majority of engineers using the language will only ever think about &#34;true&#34; Rust: the current mainstream implementation. Issues in crates that primarily affect &#34;alternative&#34; Rusts will go unacknowledged, be tossed out, or have hacky patch jobs. We&#39;ll end up with either a) two separate, but high quality, ecosystems or b) one shared, lower quality ecosystem that is constantly fighting itself. I hold Rust in really high regard and it&#39;s my favorite language at the moment, so this thought is scary to me.Though, there are a lot of smart people involved so maybe it doesn&#39;t have to be so doom and gloom. A couple of years ago I thought that cross-platform software was really messy and hard to get right but languages like Rust have the proper language features to make things like this much easier (though not perfect!). It could be that the emergence of multiple frontends could necessitate features and tooling for the Rust itself which makes all of that I said a non-issue. Maybe. Hopefully."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am the author of this feature.  The background here is that the SQL standard was ambiguous about which of the two ways an implementation should behave.  So in the upcoming SQL:202x, this was addressed by making the behavior implementation-defined and adding this NULLS [NOT] DISTINCT option to pick the other behavior.Personally, I think that the existing PostgreSQL behavior (NULLS DISTINCT) is the &#34;right&#34; one, and the other option was mainly intended for compatibility with other SQL implementations.  But I&#39;m glad that people are also finding other uses for it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is great! I have multiple places in our code where I&#39;ve had to define multiple unique indexes (with conditionals) to get around this. It&#39;s definitely confusing behaviour the first time you encounter it.Honestly I think SQL already breaks it&#39;s own standard of &#34;NULL = unknown&#34;. One example: If you do a LEFT OUTER JOIN and the joined data is missing, you get NULL in the resultset. But in that case, it&#39;s not &#34;unknown&#34; whether there are records that can be joined to, the answer is that there are definitively no records there.NULL is univerally considered by most programming languages to equal &#34;not present&#34; vs &#34;unknown&#34;, and in many cases by SQL in practice. The ship has probably sailed on actually changing the default behaviour, but optional flags like these are a good step."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is amazing. We moved from Oracle to Postgres after being on Oracle for 15+ years. That was a huge move that took 2 years. One of the biggest hurdles was rewriting thousands of sql queries. One of the biggest things we had to change was accounting for how oracle handled nulls versus how Postgres handled nulls. However, we missed this nuance about how Postgres treated nulls and unique. It wasn’t until about 2 years into using Postgres, and running into so many issues, that we finally stumbled upon this nuance in the documentation. Crap. That required making a bunch of more changes to account for this. At this point I’m firmly convinced that null handling is the hardest part of database work ;-)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Per the article this came in response to questions raised by a Columbia faculty member critiquing the university&#39;s data. I thought that report[1] was actually more interesting than the original article.As per the quote at the top of the report:&gt; Rankings create powerful incentives to manipulate data and distort institutional behavior for the sole or primary purpose of inflating one’s score...It would be shocking to me if Columbia was the only institution that fudged its numbers a bit in pursuit of a higher US News ranking. Given how important that ranking has become in US culture, I wonder if it&#39;s time for the methodology to change to require audited/auditable metrics rather than continuing to allow self-reporting.1: http://www.math.columbia.edu/~thaddeus/ranking/investigation..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For context, U.S. News and World Report used to be a trusted periodical that reported national and international news. In the 80&#39;s they started ranking colleges and selling it as a separate publication, which turned out to be pretty profitable, so they repeated the trick by ranking hospitals (1990), cars (2007), and then states (2017). The news business went online only in 2011, then shuttered in 2015. Since then they&#39;ve just been a rankings company, but they kept the name to trade on their reputation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"You are describing the hedonic treadmill. Essentially, you become used to your surroundings, and while they are objectively great, from the perspective of inside your own head, this is now normal and you / your monkey mind wants more.There have been a lot of post floating around the internet with various solutions, the most popular being Stoicism &gt; Positive Psychology / Happiness research &gt; Buddhism / Meditation. I&#39;ve dabbled a little in all of them and they all have something to offer.Essentially, you are experiencing a disconnect between how it feels to be you and how you expected to feel. As someone only a little older than yourself, I would say this: your job will never love you back, and especially in the software realm, it may not be as fulfilling as something like woodworking or therapy. It does pay the bills, though.The above mentioned happiness research / positive psychology suggests that having multiple, meaningful social roles that you can fulfill outside of work will allow you to shoulder more responsibility and find meaning in your life.What I&#39;m trying say is that in the second half of life, it is our job to give back. So start there.Also, this is in my morning bookmarks to revisit:

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some advice from someone a bit further down the career path:* If you want to try something, try it! Save up some runway, do your own thing. Try some other projects right now, don&#39;t wait. (You won&#39;t be able to devote full time effort to them, but can still make progress.) You may find that what you dream about isn&#39;t all that, or maybe it is. Either way you can take steps forward.* I learned to be happy with my life after I&#39;d taken a few alternative paths. Nothing like jumping to a situation, realizing it wasn&#39;t what you thought it was, and then jumping to a different situation, then realizing it wasn&#39;t all that great, then jumping to a different situation... After I did this a few times, I learned that I needed to create happiness where I was, not try to find it elsewhere. YMMV.* It is a cliche, but kids are only young once. Enjoy that time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was there 5 years ago. My psychology was getting worse by the month as everything I did seemed more and more futile.I quit my job, travelled to some bucket list destinations like Japan, Fiji, Galapagos, machu piccu, then went on a 5 month backpacking trip across both islands of New Zealand with my (ridiculously) supportive wife. I immersed myself the whole time in zen philosophy and tried to lose my egocentric placement in the universe.It was a great reset for my depression, but did nothing to erase the fundamental feeling that all of reality and my actions within it are pointless.For the first year I took my passion projects seriously, devoting almost a full work week of attention to them. At a certain point, I stopped those too. I realized I was merely creating my own flavor of the distractions I&#39;d tired of.Now the only things that bring me real joy are improving my home environment, the health of my family, and getting out in the sun and playing sports. That kind of &#34;out there, just around the corner&#34; abstract life satisfaction I was chasing seem as ridiculous to me now as participating in US politics. It is all ephemeral."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Being the same vintage as Jim, much of this brought back memories.There really wasn&#39;t any such thing as a tech stack - our company would produce software for various Unixen and, especially, Vax, and the language was alway C, with some Pascal on the Vax side (as, I was told, the Vax Pascal compiler produced far more optimal code than the C compiler).Being a software engineer was like being a furniture-maker. You had to master a small number of tools - the saw, the chisel - and then craftsmanship consisted of discovering an affinity with these tools and a love of getting ever more skilled at using them. This path wasn&#39;t for everyone, which was fine - plenty of management and other non-tech roles for those folks - but if you grooved with your tools it was a real joy to be able to move from chair- to table- to cabinet-making and carry and refine your skills as you went.This idyll could not last, however. Before too long it became uneconomical to make furniture this way, so for your chair making project you instead had to learn how to run a chair-making machine. When you moved onto a tables project, the machines there were infuriatingly dissimilar to the chair-making ones you&#39;d just mastered. Worse still, moving back to chair-making after a year or two, you discover that the old machines you knew are now obsolete and you have to re-learn how to run their replacements. This stops being fun, or interesting, after a while, and yet sadly it&#39;s all that most younger software engineers know.Occasionally, there is the need to make some shim or gizmo that the machines don&#39;t cover, so out come the trusty saw and chisel of yore - much to the amazement of the young&#39;uns, who are astonished that an old-timer can still wield these antiques so effectively."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thing I hear from a lot of software engineers from the time-frame of 1980-2000 is how much software engineering - to engineers at least - was about the craft. It was all about the craft of making good software. People invested real energy into trying to do it right, and treated it as such. This is of course likely colored by experience and &#34;rose tinted&#34; glasses, however, I think we as an industry have let this go, especially since the rise of bootcamps. It just isn&#39;t about the craft anymore, its all about &#34;hustle&#34;. There is some truth to the fact that engineering in this time there was more caring about it as a craft, caring about performance, caring about shipping quality etc.I like thinking about things as a craft, I don&#39;t always like the &#34;hustle&#34; aspect that is pervasive now, it guarantees shipping too early and never taking quality &amp; craftsmanship seriously, I feel like.I want to work somewhere again that sees engineering software as a craft again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I lived and worked throughout Berkeley, San Jose, Cupertino, Marin County from &#39;80-&#39;95. I&#39;ve been in the original Apple office. I remember 280 before all the CISCO and Oracle buildings went up. I have my share of stories.Still I feel like us old guys have got to have more on the ball for the new-comers than (i) memories (ii) rants about how it used to be.A psychologist once pointed out old people go to memories if they&#39;ve got nothing going on now. I like Warren Buffet&#39;s line noted for not investing in tech: I might be old fashioned but I&#39;m not old fashioned stupid.Part of having gray hairs is to know what was stuck-on-stupid then, and not repeat it now. Part of having those gray hairs is a Peter Drucker take on business: factual, direct, and unsentimental but not mean. The future (i.e. today relative to &#39;89) isn&#39;t always better."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This area of finance is utterly, completely backwards and seems like one of the most (evil)successful bits of proper-burden reversal in existence. The entire concept of &#34;identity theft&#34; as it exists now is 100% pure industry propaganda. Nobody is cloning bodies and transplanting brains or something. It&#39;s not that anyone is &#34;stealing my identity&#34; it&#39;s the financial institutions don&#39;t bother to verify it and then somehow have managed to make a system where this is my problem. If I haven&#39;t chosen to have a business relationship with a given financial institution or credit bureau, and they choose to give somebody else financial services, it shouldn&#39;t matter if that person used my name or widely circulated information about me, anything less then full biometrics/video for signup and establishing mutual certificates and cryptographically signed interactions thereafter should be presumptively invalid. If Person M lies to a Bank A about their info claiming to be Person A and tries to escape their commitments sure they&#39;ve committed fraud, but if the Bank A then tries to go after Person A then the bank are literally accessories to fraud and should face criminal prosecution or at the least massive financial penalties (with both expenses and punitive fines paid to Person A). If the banks want to have private credit bureaus to help them with scaling, abstracting and reducing bias in the risk aspect sure; there are reasonable arguments for that. But said credit bureaus should have no role in identity verification, and if they are lying about people (claiming financial things about them which are not true) that again should be on them, with serious statutory penalties.All the burdens are completely backwards, in turn massively perverting the incentives. And it&#39;s eternally infuriating. Some rando applying for a credit line on the opposite side of the country should be Not My Problem, 100% of the time, whether they have my name or address or a random symmetric 9 digit number some government assigned me. All the tools exist for financial institutions to manage their risk/convenience tradeoff, but they&#39;re the ones who have the power, information and should have the incentive to do so. They are externalizing onto the general public instead."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s shocking to me that this type of email change swapping still works. I might have to write up a blog post explaining how to fix it permanently.It&#39;s a fairly simple process though.1. Create a table that tracks every email address change on the account. It can&#39;t just be a single field because once compromised, people have learned to just change the email address twice.2. That table should contain fields for: user_id, email_from, email_to, confirm_key, reversal_key, created_at, confirmed_at, reversed_at, created_ip, confirmed_ip, reversed_ip3. When an email change is initiated, an email should be sent to the new email address with the confirmation_key to have them verify the new email address before making the change.4. Once verified, an email should be sent to the OLD email address notifying them of the change and including a link to the reversal_key to use if they did not make this switch, including the IP address and approximate geolocation of the IP address for some context.5. If the user clicks the reversal link it will clear the confirmation and reversal links of every email change that came after the link that was clicked,  ensuring that the original change can always be reversed no matter how many changes were made afterwards, revert the email address change and force the user to update the password. This password change screen should warn them that their account was likely compromised and strongly recommend they enable MFA (if available on the site) to prevent it from happening again.I spent a year working on a site that dealt with a TON of fraud and phishing against the user base. This was one of the biggest issues that we dealt with, but this approach completely resolved the problem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Moderately tangential, but I just had my Uber account hacked today. I also used a strong, unique password managed by a password manager. As far as I can tell, my email wasn’t hacked (Google Workspace account backed by a physical security key). My best guess is they scammed support, but I am just taking a stab in the dark.The worst part is, you can’t even talk to Uber support chat unless you put in the account’s current email, phone number, and last 6 digits of the credit card on the account. I have the attacker’s email address, but not the phone number, so I couldn’t even chat with support. They have an “email support” form, but it asks for the same info. I put in what I knew, but I haven’t heard back from support since the attacker took my account this afternoon, and I fear I’m not going to get it back."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What annoys me about this the most is the message from Steam, that sort of plays along with this.&#34;This game is no longer available for sale on Steam&#34;. No big deal, right.Ok, fine, but it doesn&#39;t imply the servers going down and the title becoming unplayable...Then 2nd message:&#34;Please note this title won&#39;t be accessible from &lt;date&gt;...&#34;Once again, accessible doesn&#39;t imply &#34;the game won&#39;t start, thanks for the monies&#34;.It&#39;s a bloody shame that I can start any games from the 90s on an emulator and they run just as fine, even content heavy. While these titles are completely riddled with DRM and screw you over after X years.Publishers need to come clean, and after years of milking the cow, they must have a plan allowing paying customers to play the title they&#39;ve been enjoying all these years. Otherwise, they should be forced to include the verbiage at release date &#34;This title will stop working as of &lt;date in the future&gt;&#34;.This kind of nonsense only promotes cracked games."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If platform licensing arrangements don’t protect customers from losing access to purchases, they should be forced to advertise them as rentals or leases and not something the consumer is buying."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Don&#39;t buy Ubisoft games, clearly. Games which require servers to work at all (vs. just the mulitplayer components working) are also a big no. This is likely a good thing: it will educate gamers about unnecessary DRM."</p>
