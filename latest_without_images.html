The DoJ will say, &#34;See, here is this horrible crime we are investigating and because this company chose to make it impossible for law enforcement, with a warrant and a subpoena to get it, the criminal is going to go unpunished and that will be on you because you refused to mandate lawful access to communications.&#34;The Congressional response should be, &#34;Do you have no other way of investigating these criminals?&#34; &#34;Could you not put an officer out to surveille them?&#34;, &#34;Have you not seen the misuse that law enforcement has engaged in, with such capabilities? From petty revenge to stalking lovers who rejected them. Will you consent to mandatory surveillance of all law enforcement officers that is recorded and stored in a civil controlled repository so that officer conduct may be reviewed at any time?&#34;They won&#39;t say that of course. But they should."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Beautiful. That&#39;s how you do it.I actually believe that law enforcement has the legal right to subpoena information, with a judge&#39;s consent, while investigating criminal activity. This is exactly the solution to that problem. These platforms should want to know as little about you as possible."</p>

During an outbreak you’d want students to have a private airspace to go to and the possibility of ventilation.Update: from another comment, Munger designed a similar building in Michigan. It has great reviews!But, one of the top ones was “great until pandemic”. Adding this to clarify that, contra other comments, I don’t necessarily think Munger was mistaken. But events have made the idea unfortunate.https://www.veryapt.com/ApartmentReview-a7222-munger-graduat..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"From my point-of-view as a former firefighter, I would say this:A building meant to house 4500 students, with only two entrances? There&#39;s a word for that: deathtrap.Building this is setting UCSB up to be the site of the next Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire[1], Station Nightclub fire[2], or Hamlet Chicken Processing Plant fire[3].At a first glance, based only on the information provided in the article, I&#39;d say that there is basically NOTHING good about this idea. But I&#39;ll allow that there are other details that could change the dynamic. Still, the weight of history suggests the importance of taking a somewhat skeptical position towards any measure of hand-waving when it comes to fire safety. At the moment, color me skeptical.Edit: Let me add this... the linked article doesn&#39;t go into any real details about the fire safety aspects of this, so there&#39;s a lot of info we don&#39;t have without digging into other sources. One of those details would be the presence of a sprinkler system. IF local building codes require sprinklers in dormitories and this building is properly sprinklered, that would assuage some of my concerns, as a working sprinkler system is basically the single most important thing you can have to save lives in the event of a fire.[4][1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_Shirtwaist_Factory_fi...[2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Station_nightclub_fire[3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamlet_chicken_processing_plan...[4]: https://nfsa.org/2020/12/15/sprinkler-saves-proof-that-fire-..."</p>

&#34;...the corrosion on the glass also forms millions of tiny pits. The authors think those pits could serve as tiny reaction chambers...&#34;In other words, the experimental conditions, as intended, were almost &#34;too perfect.&#34;  The simulation of reality requires some amount of unspecified noise with respect to CONDITIONS, in this case, corroded glass.How many experiments, on the terminal or the bench, are run with noise in the underlying test conditions?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Taken from the Ars comments:Article Quote:
When Miller showed his results to Urey, the latter suggested a paper should be published as soon as possible. (Urey was senior but generously declined to be listed as co-author, lest this lead to Miller getting little to no credit for the work.)As if Urey doesn&#39;t deserve enough respect, the story is better than described:Sub-article Quote:
After Miller showed the impressive results to Urey, they decided to submit them to Science. Urey
declined Miller’s offer to coauthor the report because otherwise Miller would receive little or no credit. Knowing that a graduate student could have a difficult time getting a paper like this published, Urey contacted the Science editorial office to explain the importance of the work and ask that the paper be published as soon as possible. Urey kept mentioning the results in his lectures, drawing considerable attention from the news media.The manuscript was sent to Science in early February of 1953. Several weeks went by with no news. Growing impatient, Urey wrote to Howard Meyerhoff, chairman of AAAS’s Editorial Board, on 27 February to complain about the lack of progress. Then, on 8 March 1953, the New York Times reported in a short article entitled, “Looking Back Two Billion Years” that W. M. MacNevin and his associates at Ohio State University had performed several experiments simulating the primitive Earth—including a discharge experiment with methane wherein “resinous solids too complex for analysis” were produced. The next day, Miller sent Urey a copy of the clipping with a note saying “I am not sure what should be done now, since their work is, in essence, my thesis. As of today, I have not received the proof from Science, and in the letter that was sent to you, Meyerhoff said that he had sent my note for review.”Infuriated by this news, Urey had Miller withdraw the paper and submit it to the Journal of the American Chemical Society. Ironically, at the same time (11 March), Meyerhoff, evidently frustrated by Urey’s actions, wrote to Miller that he wanted to publish the manuscript as a lead article and that he wanted Miller—not Urey—to make the final decision about the manuscript. Miller immediately accepted Meyerhoff’s offer, the paper was withdrawn from the Journal of the American Chemical Society and returned to Science, and was published on 15 May 1953.https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Prebiotic-Soup--Revisi..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Glad to hear about this. I sued Facebook in a California small-claims court to rescind my purchase of the Quest 1 (and all accessories and game purchases) after I declined the change in ToS adding the FB account requirement. It took a while (negotiated with their customer support, then sued, then finally months later got an intelligent response), but we settled for what I asked for. I can&#39;t be the only one who got my money back. I liked the product except for the added account requirement, and I would now consider buying again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It begs the question: if they host the social media account and VR account and can reliably identify / link them on their end, and the laws and terms allow them to do so, does it really matter if they’re different accounts?It&#39;s still a win if you don&#39;t have a facebook account.  For everyone else: I would assume that they will identify your accounts reliably."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Mark&#39;s statement was worded carefully in that he stated access would not longer require your _personal_ Facebook account. I interpreted this to mean you&#39;ll still need a Facebook account, but it would be through a Facebook for Work account (although I&#39;m not sure if today these are distinct entities)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A detailed analysis of Meow Hash: https://peter.website/meow-hash-cryptanalysisIt&#39;s not the highest of quality hash functions (see the SMHasher benchmarks), but it is fast. A great alternative is XXH3 (https://cyan4973.github.io/xxHash/), which has seen far more usage in practice."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A collision was reported a couple months agohttps://github.com/cmuratori/meow_hash/issues/80"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have measured (on a Skylake core) the hash from Daniel Lemire, Owen Kaser, &#34;Faster 64-bit universal hashing using carry-less multiplications, Journal of Cryptographic Engineering (to appear)&#34; at t_cycles = (0.00741 +- 0.00098 cycles/byte) * bytes + (37.43  +- 0.48) which is roughly 135 B/cycle (675 GB/s at 5 GHz) or over 2x faster than the claim here.  Admittedly, that 37 cycle fixed cost is probably quite a bit higher, and I don&#39;t know how well the bit mixing compares.Parenthetically, a time equation (like t_cycles = coef * bytes + fixedCost) is a more convenient way to summarize performance of this kind of thing than the constant short string/long string mumble-mumble.  Yes, loop unrolling/etc. can create step-ish functions and a linear regression is pretty approximate (but my stderrs are pretty small above), but even so..much less tripping over words."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very grateful that my employer has committed to remaining flexible with remote work. Full time in the office, hybrid, or full time remote. It’s up to the individual. Full time remote has done wonders for my health - instead of a 2 hour commute I get to exercise. Instead of coming home stressed, annoyed, and sitting in front of the TV, I go outside for a solid hour+ after I close my laptop. I travel more liberally now that I don’t have to take time off to do so. My quality of life has never been better, and my gratefulness translates into feelings of loyalty towards my employer. Why would I quit if I’m treated well and have a nice work life balance? Why would I risk this situation by slacking off when I am on the clock?Prior to the remote shift, I was unhappy and I didn’t even realize. No exercise, no passion outside of work. All my energy went into my 10+ hour day (when you consider the commute).Since then I’ve lost 30lbs, become enamored with new sports and hobbies, and my social life outside of work exists again. I feel more “alive” than I have in a decade.I’ll never work for a company that doesn’t allow me that flexibility for the rest of my career, as long as I can help it. Companies that want access to good talent would be wise to follow this example."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; ... There is a more intriguing possibility, however. Work that is largely done remotely may be more efficient compared with an office-first model.I don&#39;t think in-person real-time communication is always effective. No, I personally think it&#39;s one of the least method of communication that can happen in an office environment when the topic gets slightly complex (that is, if the topic is complex enough for you to write a memo about it).For those topics, I love to communicate with some &#34;written&#34; form, such as in an email, posts etc. Because doing the &#34;writing&#34; part allow me to conduct some research and analyses on the topic (usually took 10 minutes), which will in turn increase the quality of my reply.If you standing right in front of me and asked a question that require a complex answer, then my reply will probably make me look like an idiot, because I might not able to discover all the information that I need to process and output within 30 seconds. Not very effective in my opinion."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Blender is such an amazing tool. I have a side business where I create 3d printed jewelry with my customer&#39;s fingerprints on it in gold and silver (https://lulimjewelry.com) and I use Blender on the backend for all of the jewelry creation.I run blender headless in a docker container on google cloud run. When needed I invoke it with an image and have a blender script &#34;engrave&#34; that image on the jewelry and output an STL file.It is incredibly flexible to script in python, although its not very &#34;pythonic&#34;. The UI is quite stateful (edit mode, object mode, which items are selected, etc) and you have to keep track of that state in your program. But once you get around those issues you can do quite a lot, and its all a free program!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love Blender, but have been stuck on version 2.7 due to what I can only describe as some sort of icon dyslexia.For 2.8, all the Blender icons were replaced with monochromatic ones. This is a very popular trend and a lot of programs are replacing their icons in this way, so it&#39;s obviously fine for most people, and I realize this is probably a niche accessibility need I have.But, to use the new icons, I find I have to check each one every time to find the one I want. Instant recognition is no longer possible. For me, this extra cognitive load makes it difficult to use Blender for more than a few minutes at a time.Blender is a fantastic product and one of the best examples of what open-source can be, but I for one will be appreciating it from afar, and remaining on 2.7 until there is a way to get more usable icons."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The general guideline will be to keep Blender functionally compatible with 2.8x and later. Existing workflows or usability habits shouldn’t be broken without good reasons – with general agreement and clearly communicated in advance.Oh boy. How I wish so much that other software developers would follow this principle... It seems nearly every software I use and rely on has to change its appearance and interface every 6-12 months, breaking familiarity for no objective reason, and simply because &#34;it looks better&#34; to look at (and not necessarily to use!) to the subjective eyes of someone."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; * The POSIX-blessed way of finding an executable program is command -v, which is consequently built into most shells. Given the standard alternative, Adams said, &#34;surely no one competent would choose to have a package depend on `which` when a standard POSIX utility can do a better job&#34;.*This feels a little tone-deaf to me.  I&#39;ve been using the *nix command-line and writing (and reading) shell scripts for 20+ years, and I&#39;d never heard of &#34;command -v&#34; until now.  Now that I know about it, I&#39;ll probably start trying to retrain my muscle memory to use it (though it requires 2x the number of keystrokes).Despite its lack of true standardization, &#34;which&#34; (along with &#34;type -p&#34;) has been the de-facto &#34;standard&#34; I&#39;ve seen in shell scripts for figuring out if a command exists.  It was a surprise to me to learn that &#34;which&#34; isn&#39;t a part of POSIX, even."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Regardless of whether &#39;command -v&#39; is a better alternative, &#39;which&#39; is ensconced as standard practice in many shell scripts, and I would go so far as to say I think the majority of them that actually have to choose between the two use &#39;which&#39;.Given that, having it print out a deprecation warning without considering what that means to all the people that use it is irresponsible.  I help manage a few hundred servers.  We send root email to a list and actually review it all every day.  We make sure to sanitize anything run from cron so that we only get email output on error (STDERR).  Given that some of those cron jobs run quite often, this would have been thousands of emails to sift through if we used Debian.There were many possible solutions, as the maintainer notes.  Unfortunately in trying to remove themself from the decision, they forced a non-solution on everyone that is disruptive.  I can&#39;t think of any way this is a good choice for this particular set of facts (I can see a deprecation warning being warranted for some other things, but this case has little to do factually with those theoretical situations)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a descriptivist when it comes to standards. When everyone uses `which`, POSIX should add it. &#34;but it&#39;s non-standard!&#34; can be fixed by making it a standard."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Assange was a non-U.S. citizen working outside the U.S. - I don&#39;t get what gives the U.S. jurisdiction to try him in the first place. If China tried to extradite a U.S. citizen acting within the U.S. who published leaked information allegedly in violation of Chinese law, we&#39;d laugh them out of the courtroom, and rightly so.Adding insult to injury, publishing leaked military secrets is not even illegal in the U.S. due to the first amendment right to a free press. When the New York Times publishes leaked classified information, there&#39;s no trial or extradition. In the U.S., those who will have legitimate access to classified information first sign legally binding agreements not to disseminate it, and those who violate that agreement can be prosecuted.And in this case, that already happened: Manning served 7 years in jail for leaking the very information that Assange is being extradited over. With the leaker found and prosecuted, convicted, and sentence served, the U.S. Department of Justice should congratulate itself on a job well-done and move on to other things. It&#39;s absurd that they continue to pursue the publisher of the information almost a decade later."</p>

Ubuntu / Arch / Fedora were about 11% faster overall than Windows 11 Pro on this system. Meanwhile, Clear Linux was about 18% faster than Windows 11 and enjoyed about 5% better performance overall than the other Linux distributions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wonder how much of these results were actually due to compiler/benchmark implementation rather than operating system mechanisms.I expect file system related (not I/O) benchmarks would differ significantly in Linux&#39; favor as we&#39;d observed with WSL1 vs WSL2; but the rest? Are we to believe that DirectX 12, the API that’s supported by hardware vendors themselves, optimized to no end for first-class gaming, is actually slower than whatever&#39;s on Linux? (Not downplaying the significant achievements of Linux in graphics, but meagerly pointing out the fact that Windows is way ahead in graphics performance because of politics)For example, Windows 11 loses in all Java benchmarks. Coincidentally, Oracle has great investment in Linux as a platform. Is this really a fair operating system comparison?Similarly, GCC is optimized primarily for Linux. Windows is a second-class citizen there. It could be the same case with clang as well, I don&#39;t know. How are we supposed to be sure that compilers treat two OS&#39;s the same? Do benchmark apps get compiled with MSVC on Windows?I think OS performance can only be compared fairly with benchmarks specifically designed to measure OS performance, not performance of a specific application per se, simply because the developers have varying priorities for optimizing their apps for a platform.An OS benchmark could measure context switch latency, I/O latency, raw I/O throughput, certain responsiveness metrics etc, compiled with the preferred compiler of the platform."</p>
