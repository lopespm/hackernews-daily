								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"That&#39;s a really awesome story with a great opening, middle, and especially the end, if one ignores the adolescent fraud. I think it really highlights the simple joy that technology that literally just works can bring. I&#39;m around the same age as the author, a little younger in fact, but there&#39;s just something about today&#39;s Internet and a lot of the overwhelming amount of technology that just isn&#39;t fun or memorable. From game consoles to land lines to various other things, there were pieces of technology that just worked and worked well. Of course, there was technology that didn&#39;t work well, but I think part of the tragedy is that a lot of technology that worked well has been replaced by &#34;better&#34; technology that doesn&#39;t work well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just last month I got the opportunity to assist with an art installation that involved a phonebooth, which meant I got to take one home and poke around its insides. It was some of the most delightfully 90s tech I&#39;ve seen in a while - 2-layer PCBs, all through-hole components, only a few well-known ICs... I ended up carefully removing all the &#34;brains&#34; and hooking up the insides to a raspberry pi, which could join a  Discord channel or answer an incoming call when you picked up the phone.Standing next to the phone talking to friends was strangely fun and nostalgic experience, despite the fact I had only used a payphone once in my life. I got a cellphone very quickly (perks of having a tech journalist in the family), so by the time I was old enough to be able to buy a phone card with my own money I no longer needed it. During the pandemic, all of the remaining phonebooths in the country were quietly shut down and dismantled.I know it&#39;s completely irrational, but I&#39;m still sad that I had to eventually return the one I worked on and that in the many years the system was still operational it never occurred to me to buy a card and call someone from a phone booth just for the fun of it.P.S.: If anyone from Slovenia or other ex-Yu countries has any ideas how I could get my hands on one of those Iskra payphones, drop me an email (address in bio). I have so many ideas for projects involving them, but it seems that I&#39;m a bit too late to stand behind the Telekom dumpster and snag a few before they&#39;re scrapped."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thanks for this article and the comments.
Reminds me of a trick we kids did in the early 60s (yeah, sorry) with the British &#39;phone box&#39; pay phones. We called it &#39;tapping the phone&#39;, but it wasn&#39;t spy style listening. Passed from kid to kid the amazing trick was you could dial the number by tapping the handset (10 taps for zero, 9 taps for 9, ..) and the phone would ring the number but you didn&#39;t then have to &#39;press button A&#39; to speak.. you simply made the call, spoke normally, hung up, and pressed button B to get your money back! Sadly, I never tried international calls...
When we moved to New Zealand around &#39;63-4, I discovered the phone dial was reversed, in the UK it was 1-9,0, in NZ it was 9-1,0. (So emergency calls were 111 not 999 as in the UK.) The trick still worked but, except for 0, you had to &#39;10s complement&#39; the taps. Maybe because of that none of the kids I knew at the time in NZ appeared to know the trick..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hey folks, Geoff here from Gitpod. Very pleased to see there continues to be strong interest in open (and FOSS) software development tooling. VSCodium uses the OpenVSX registry (which Gitpod folks created) because the VS Market place is proprietary and can only be connected to from official  Visual Studio branded products.If you can&#39;t find an extension when using VSCodium then please send a pull-request to this repository https://github.com/open-vsx/publish-extensions with the identifier and that will help grow the ecosystem of open tooling.ICMYI - We blogged more about this over at:- https://www.gitpod.io/blog/cloud-ide-history- https://www.gitpod.io/blog/openvscode-server-launch- https://www.gitpod.io/blog/open-vsxIf you got any questions lemme know. &lt;3"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If anyone is interested in an experience report, I&#39;ve been using it for about three years and it&#39;s exactly the same experience as VSCode (even works with Live Share, for example).The main thing you&#39;ll have to contend with is that the extension registry for VSCode is different from Codium, as Geoff says here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31606704This means you might find that extensions you use in VSCode aren&#39;t in Codium. This is usually remedied by just downloading the extension manually yourself or by asking the extension developers to cross-publish."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So glad this exists. It took people quite some time to group up for this.I find it... borderline immoral to have an open source product and then have binaries contain telemetry and other stuff that&#39;s not in the main tree.But, hey, we couldn&#39;t expect Microsoft not to muddy the waters a bit."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Another data point: After writing / (re)writing 20K+ lines of code as a CLI side project in Rust (without touching async), I think I can say it&#39;s the best language for me after 20+ years of experience in other languages. I like the compiler, and I learn a lot from clippy.The &#34;hard&#34; part about Rust is you have to &#34;unlearn&#34; some of the basic mechanisms like scope and ownership that you bring from other languages. It doesn&#39;t allow you to build quick and easy solutions that allows you to lie to yourself (or your boss.) You have to spend more time upfront to compile and fix all warnings, but in my experience so far, fixing these at the right time (i.e. before compilation) is better than fixing them after someone writes a Github issue. I can&#39;t say it eliminates all bugs, but my trust level to my Rust code is around 10x more than my Python code for the same problem. (And I&#39;m writing Python since 2002.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wish there was a Rust-like programming language that was just a little bit higher level than Rust. I like Rust&#39;s wide ecosystem with high quality packages, the nice type system, traits, the idea that my code generally runs pretty fast even if I&#39;m being lazy about writing good code, and my code usually working correctly if it compiles.I care about speed and correctness but Rust makes me also care about ownership and lifetimes even when I don&#39;t really want to care about that stuff. I&#39;ve written Rust for years now and this still occasionally can really slow me down. Rust is still a very nice language so I just deal with it :) no pain no gain.I would love a Rust-with-GC or something in that spirit that is similar to Rust but automatically figures out lifetimes as much as possible and GCs whatever it cannot figure out automatically. I&#39;ve looked at languages like Nim and read about research languages like Koka so I&#39;m optimistic something will emerge from this space I really like."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is rusts most loved status simply Stockholm syndrome? I&#39;ve really tried with rust, and we simply don&#39;t get on. I hear all the arguments about CVEs and wonder if rust will reduce the number of these problems simply by disabling the programmers that create them. I understand the draw, I want to love it, but i think I might not be smart enough."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is amazing, thank you.Seems like several others, my actual development career began on WebOS. In high school, I was intrigued by the idea of a web-based, multitasking capable smartphone and begged my parents to buy me one.Ultimately I learned a ton and have great stories such as staying up all night re-architecting Weatherman (https://appcatalog.webosarchive.com/showMuseumDetails.php?&amp;a...) because of the popularity (and this was before it was on the WebOS store, at this time it was invite-only so I had to post it on a forum!). Weatherman was just a hack on top of a hack on top of a hack. There was no Canvas API on the device so I had to generate the weather images on a server and then send them to the device, for example.The highlight for me was winning one of the top spots in the Palm Hot Apps competition for the &#34;free apps&#34; category with Pixi Dust (https://appcatalog.webosarchive.com/showMuseumDetails.php?ca...). The physics weren&#39;t accurate by any means, but it was the first time I had seriously used C++ (I think it was, it was so long ago!).I miss having platforms like these with innovative ideas and small communities. I learned so much by having to hack my way around the limitations of the operating system, and really miss WebOS overall. I think I might still have an old Palm Pre sitting a drawer somewhere."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow! The Pre was the reason I got into development, because I wanted to be able to run through flashcards on the bus to school. So I built Study Buddy[1]. The joke is by the time I figured out how to really build it, I had a car so it wasn&#39;t quite as personally useful as it could have been. It was a small community but there was a decent amount of teenage developers, maybe 8 or so of us, and I think 10 years later we&#39;re all still in the engineering space, basically because of webOS.[1]: https://appcatalog.webosarchive.com/showMuseumDetails.php?ca..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This makes me so, so happy!  I put so much work into WebOS apps, and your site lists five of them. Sadly it&#39;s missing a few, like &#34;My WebOS Apps&#34;, the developer dashboard app I wrote for WebOS app developers that let developers see their download stats on the phone, get notifications of when their app was accepted or rejected and more - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U4bVq_VIhs&amp;list=PL792FA4594...I&#39;m getting so nostalgic, even tearing up a little :-)Flickr Mundo - https://appcatalog.webosarchive.com/showMuseumDetails.php?se...Mazer - https://appcatalog.webosarchive.com/showMuseumDetails.php?se...Irish Rain - https://appcatalog.webosarchive.com/showMuseumDetails.php?&amp;a..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The amount of creativity here is astounding. Just imagine all the decisions the AI made in incorporating Kermit into the movies: the clothing it&#39;s chosen, how the character wears the clothing, the facial expressions, how to make Kermit himself look similar to the other movies characters. Should he be lanky? pudgy? Even simple decisions like obliviously Kermit in Wall-E is going to be a robot, it has to figure out what he looks like as a robot, what his mouth looks like, that his eyes should be enlarged.It gets a lot of things wrong, like I&#39;m not sure why kermit has a plastic texture in many of the pictures. If you showed me ten pictures of Kermit and ten frames of total recall, and for some reason 8 of your pictures had a plastic Kermit, and asked me to combine them in my head, I&#39;d probably imagine something on-par or worse than what Dalle has managed to do. But I wouldn&#39;t be able to show anyone what I&#39;d made!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a real disappointment. Had a great job lined up at Coinbase that I was quite excited about, was in the middle of visa processing when this happened (why I had to quit my previous job, can’t have two visas in the US).This was for a relatively senior position, not a fresh grad. Going to be hard to get a new job considering most of the other places have hiring freezes and I chose Coinbase over other offers (mostly from FAANG), these offers have probably been out for over a month now doubt i can resuscitate them.On top of that most of the other offers were for SF, and my partner already has a job in NYC on this basis.Nothing but pain. As much as I appreciate the severance, the damage being done here is immense."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; We will rescind a number of accepted offers.&gt; [...]&gt; And at the end of the day, I think you’ll be proud to have helped Coinbase navigate this next part of its journey.If my eyes could roll any further they would fall out the back of my head"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; We will rescind a number of accepted offers.This continues to happen over and over again in the industry, and is the reason why I always advise people who get exploding offers from companies to just accept them and then back out later if they need to. Loyalty and respect cannot be a one way street. There&#39;s so much propaganda around &#34;burning bridges&#34; that keeps prospective employees in line (and it also extends to stuff like negotiating wages, discussing salaries at work, job hopping and more). Look out for yourself out there, no one else is going to do it. Certainly not the HR department."</p>
