								<p class="story__comment_others">"Does anyone know if this is different to Webauthn? You can already login with touchid/faceid, with the private key stored in apples keychain. Lots of sites support it, I just added it as 2FA to Mailpace (https://blog.mailpace.com/blog/why-we-use-webauthn-for-2fa/), making it passwordless login instead of 2FA is trivial and fully supported by webauthn.What’s different about this?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Instead of the above syntax combining Markdown and JSON, I could use a Unicode private use area to define bytes that mean “line,” “circle” and so on.That would not be a good idea because of contention, as you may wish to use those code points for their meaning in some icon font.You’d be better to use HTML elements, which is the proper way of embedding such stuff in Markdown. (Look, even hijacking code blocks as an extension mechanism is a controversial technique.) And then SVG, or at least a subset of it, becomes an obviously excellent solution; the {&#34;p2&#34;:{&#34;x&#34;:141,&#34;y&#34;:85},&#34;mode&#34;:&#34;line&#34;,&#34;p1&#34;:{&#34;x&#34;:34,&#34;y&#34;:44}} example becomes:  &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 200 100&#34;&gt;

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The truth I had to unlearn is that coding is a solitary activity, and that coding is the most important part of a senior software engineer’s job. Now I rarely have the chance to code for a few hours straight because if I have enough information to write code then all that’s left is the easy part. The hard part is coordinating, defining the problem, planning for the future, and communicating the current status of the problem. Not to mention onboarding newer devs who haven’t learned the technologies yet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For me, it was that I thought that being a good programmer was that I write clean code with enough abstraction and indirection to make it future proof.Boy I was wrong. Unless you’re doing the same thing you’ve done for years, you can’t tell the future. And just when your unnecessary abstraction is wrong, this the reason why we’re talking about tech debt in the first place. Because nobody wants to touch it.Unfortunately, I didn’t have anyone to tell me this for the longest time. It wasn’t until I had to fix a bug for something I wrote in the past, and I couldn’t figure out just what I wrote.Now I try to write dumb and simple (yet sensible) code until there’s a good reason for abstractions. I have nothing to prove at this point in my career."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Things like indendetation, formatting, naming – god forbid you did it differently than I would have.I agree with chilling out about this when it&#39;s a human making the changes...except now that we have autoformatters we can actually be more pedantic about this than ever before :) If the autoformatter doesn&#39;t agree with what you wrote, bam, red CI.&gt; Everyone writes testsA big thing I&#39;ve learned over the years is that making your code testable often takes more foresight and experience than actually writing the tests. &#34;What&#39;s the right way to test this?&#34; becomes an important question when starting something new. And &#34;Can we make it easier to test this?&#34; becomes an important question when inheriting something."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I like to put things on x/y-charts to get a visual overview. Even things that usually are not displayed in this fashion.When it comes to prime numbers, it always irked me, that one cannot easily look at them in a visual way. I always thought that they would probably look beautiful.One day, I had the idea to counter this by visualizing prime numbers in the complex plane. I then wrote a little script to colorize each number in the complex plane by how &#34;prime&#34; it is. And indeed, the result looks beautiful:https://www.gibney.org/does_anybody_know_this_fractalThen I went back to do more mundane things with x/y charts. The one that became most popular is Product Chart:https://www.productchart.comBut every once in a while, I still dream about the &#34;complex divisor fractal&#34; and what mysteries might be hidden inside of it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;&gt; In 2019, he and Carl Pomerance, his adviser at Dartmouth — who, according to Lola Thompson, a mathematician at Utrecht University and a former student of Pomerance, essentially “came out of retirement to work with him”Somehow that made this whole story a lot more human to me. Pomerance is a big name in modern number theory (to me anyway) but apparently at the end of the day he&#39;s just another guy with a particular set of interests who will pop up again when the right thing comes his way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Can we also talk about how this guy is in the third year of his PhD and has no less than 18 papers listed under &#34;major/recent publications&#34;, all but two of which are published, and one of the latter &#39;shocked&#39; the math community?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This particular copy-pasta of the story is dated to 2022, but the story is much older (I mean, obviously it happened in the 60s, but I think the word-for-word copy is more recent).  The story was published online at least as early as 2007: https://web.archive.org/web/20071201072335/http://www.916-st...Previously discussed:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=133282 (2008)https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=519337 (2009)https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4652643 (2012)https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21500153 (2019)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love hearing these stories about these little automatic backups and failsafes kicking-in and heroically doing their jobs in the case of unthinkable situations (e.g
 the flight suit emergency oxygen, automatic parachute etc here).  I get kinda goose pimples thinking about all the systems that were probably spasmodically firing off in that last second or two or flight (and perhaps in the split seconds after breakup if they had power still?), trying their damn best to valiantly do their final important tasks, even when doomed to fail.Kudos to all the engineers involved.Anyone got any other first-hand stories or links to similar stuff?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To those interested in the blackbird, the museum of flight had a series of panels on their youtube channel, including actuals sr71 pilots and mechanics [1]Lots of more minor annecdotes (including a brown pants one). One thing I learned is that the idea that the sr71 flew faster than anti-air missiles is a misconception. But the missiles at the time couldn&#39;t be reprogrammed once launched, so what made it safe is that because the sr71 flies so fast and so high, between the time the missile is launched and the time the missile reaches the expected sr71 position and altitude, the sr71 will have had time to change course and be far away.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbuOD6bgPc4https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1uq-qOzf5ohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54FEBBPCZ-Yhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiX_JPuir0"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This looks like what the Macbook (2015) wanted to be. Keyboard and single port aside, it was a fantastic form factor, albeit crushingly slow. Mine no longer holds a charge, and am eagerly awaiting replacing it with one of these.Over time I&#39;ve also noticed I no longer care about having the fastest possible laptop, since my job provides me with an MBP and that&#39;s where serious work gets done.I have a feeling this is going to be backordered for a long, long time though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"And for the first time, MacBook Air supports fast charge for charging up to 50 percent in just 30 minutes with an optional 67W USB-C power adapter.Anybody know if the 67W USB-C power adapter is finally stock?  Edit: Nope, still gotta wait a month: https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MKU63AM/A/67w-usb-c-power...  Other (bigger) chargers are a 2 month wait.  Looks like Apple is still suffering from supply chain issues."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Finally, Apple has seen the light! This is going to be an instabuy for many, including me. This feels like 2012 when Apple introduced Retina displays: Everything that&#39;s good about Apple in a single package, and unavailable at any price anywhere else. The nitpicky in me will complain about the lack of a glass touchpad, but I feel Apple is justified in leaving it as a Pro feature."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As someone who has configured a number of products like this I have to say I find it all to be &#34;nerd candy&#34;. As in it&#39;s a lot of fun to setup but not very fulfilling and I can never change my habits to actually use the dashboard (even ones that can show relevant info about the apps they link to, like up/down speed or other stats).I&#39;d be interested in hearing from people who have set this (or an alternative) up and use it daily/regularly. For me I just always go to myservice.mydomain.com directly. I normally only have to type 2-3 letters before it pops up for me and it&#39;s way faster than going to first to a dashboard/launch page, finding my service, and clicking on it."</p>

Of the above, I like heimdall the best for its cleanliness and simplicity, but its hardly customizable.I think we&#39;d be much better served by a really well thought-out framework for self-hosted/homelab dashboards with excellent API documentation that has pluggable modules for things like authentication, data sources (e.g. docker, db, config file, service APIs), and the front end. This would allow people to easily build the dashboard with the features they want, and make it even easier for people to contribute a variety of &#34;themes&#34; for endless customization of how things are displayed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Does anybody know of something similar, but written in a more elaborate book-like fashion?It&#39;s not about format, of course, it&#39;s just that all these model-zoo&#39;s are only half of the story — not useless, but rather incomplete. That is, if you learn a lot of them, one day you might remember something and find it useful — or you might not. This is a bit abstract, but I want to say you rarely ever need any special tools of thinking (or maybe even tools in general) — you want a technology. That is, a relatively broad (but precisely defined) instruction of how to identify and approach a set of problems in some domain. I.e., it is more about when to use a tool or technique, rather than being a exhibition of such tools. I mean, there is important difference — that&#39;s kinda the difference between going to college and going to a museum.For example, GTD is a technology (doesn&#39;t matter good or bad). It tells you when to use tools/techniques suggested (and a better book would have more showcases and exercises to internalize the idea, IMO). This site or coursera&#39;s famous &#34;Models Thinking&#34; course — aren&#39;t."</p>
