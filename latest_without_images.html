Current models ship with QMK (open firmware), although I believe my older trackball didn&#39;t, I&#39;d have to flash it.I have both a left-handed trackball (rare!) and a right-handed mouse from them, I like to alternate.Two obvious complaints:- They&#39;re really expensive- They&#39;re 3D-printed, which means manufacturing isn&#39;t polished. My trackball had a sticky mousewheel, which I ultimately had to buy a replacement for and swap out. My mouse has some rough edges I haven&#39;t filed down yet, and the 3D-printed texture may not be for everyone.The good news is that it&#39;s easy to make replacement parts and repairs yourself!Still, I wish they would make mass-produced versions with more conventional and precise manufacturing techniques, just with the option to 3D-print your own parts if you feel like it / need to. Maybe that would bring the price down while also improving build quality."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;The transition to endemic COVID-19 is also a psychological one. When everyone has some immunity, a COVID-19 diagnosis becomes as routine as diagnosis of strep or flu—not good news, but not a reason for particular fear or worry or embarrassment either. That means unlearning a year of messaging that said COVID-19 was not just a flu. If the confusion around the CDC dropping mask recommendations for the vaccinated earlier this summer is any indication, this transition to endemicity might be psychologically rocky.&#34;Diseases that are endemic today, such as chicken pox, once caused epidemics with massive body counts, notably in North America.  No vaccines, no advanced medical care, and no natural immunity meant that some villages just ceased to exist.Today, thanks to air travel, the world is a village.  Wuhan is exposed one week, and the world the next.  We, the natives of that village, have vaccines and advanced medical care in finite quantities, plus a better understanding of how to reduce transmission rates.  That&#39;s gone a long way to soften the blow.  The transition from pandemic to endemic usually kills a lot more people in a given area, and the area effected right now is everywhere.The thing is, COVID-19 is not endemic yet and, even once it is, will likely retain the capability of mutating into a strain that causes a new deadly pandemic.  Flu is endemic, but another 1918 could happen at any time.  Until we&#39;ve built up immunity to several different strains of COVID-19, every new strain has the potential to overwhelm our medical systems, and a unusually contagious and deadly mutant will always be a possibility.It&#39;s not as simple as flipping a switch from &#34;life threatening pandemic&#34; to &#34;quotidian endemic&#34;.  There are shades of grey in between that cause varying strain on hospital ICU&#39;s, and the transition isn&#39;t one-way.Our village will be hit far less hard if we behave intelligently about disease prevention.  Turning vaccines into a political wedge issue is one of the stupidest things I&#39;ve seen in my life."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good article, but doesn&#39;t mention the other reason that covid-19 is never going completely away: animal reservoirs.  We know that dogs, cats, hamsters, guinea pigs, mink, white-tailed deer, a gorilla, and a tiger have been found to have been infected with covid-19.  It is implausible that it will ever cease to have an animal reservoir, especially given the finding in Canada of 30% of white-tailed deer having it.Of diseases that get as widespread as this, with animal reservoirs, I don&#39;t believe there is any case of eliminating it.  But, like vaccines can teach the immune system how to respond more intelligently (and less self-destructively) to covid-19, hopefully society can learn to respond more intelligently, and less self-destructively, to the fact that it&#39;s always in circulation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"My biggest concern now is around seeing those who hedged their willingness to get the vaccine on its approval instead find a new reason not to get it.So with that in mind, I&#39;m much more keen on seeing how employers will decide on vaccination mandates now that at least one vaccine is fully approved. Any news yet on whether any more employers are likely implementing mandates (if they haven&#39;t already this morning) based on the news?

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If I recall correctly, Specialized Bikes pulled all their products from Amazon a while ago, pointing to the failing local bike shops eventually hurting the bike business for everyone.Bicycles are not toys. They are vehicles that need maintenance. You can do much of that maintenance yourself if you&#39;re a nerd, but the vast majority of cyclists are dependent on local bike shops to sustain the cycling community.The bicycle/parts manufacturers need a large cycling community to sell products to. The large cycling community will have novice and intermediate cyclists that will abandon cycling if their bikes break down. The novice and intermediate cyclist need local bike shops to do maintenance on their bikes at affordable rates. The local bike shops need a revenue stream beyond labor for maintenance to be affordable. Thus, the major bicycle manufacturers need to give a oligopoly status to the local bike shops in order to keep their user base large.As a life long cyclist, I&#39;ve seen the industry grow and wane, and throughout it all, I&#39;ve seen the vast majority of people think bicycles are some type of sports-equipment. Decisions like this are one of only a few business models that I can see sustaining the community. I&#39;m actually surprised and optimistic to see the major manufacturer Trek start building their own brick and mortar shops in certain major cities, though I&#39;d prefer to see this happen through a major cooperative between the various brands. If you care about making cycling a serious, sustainable transit alternative, we need to maintain the entire ecosystem of ridership, which means the race to the bottom on amazon must be stopped."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the article: &#34;PNW wasn’t the only business growing tired of Amazon. Kerson and his team asked buyers at every retailer who stocks PNW parts to remove them from their Amazon stores too, so that everyone involved could maximize their profits and not undercut each other.&#34; ...  “We set up these calls and we were not expecting them to go very well,” says Marshall, “As soon as we started talking about it the buyers were really excited.”From the FTC: &#34;Price fixing is an agreement (written, verbal, or inferred from conduct) among competitors that raises, lowers, or stabilizes prices or competitive terms ... Price fixing relates not only to prices, but also to other terms that affect prices to consumers, such as shipping fees, warranties, discount programs, or financing rates. Antitrust scrutiny may occur when competitors discuss the following topics: ..., Capacity, Identity of customers, ... Defendants may not justify their behavior by arguing that the prices were reasonable to consumers, were necessary to avoid cut-throat competition, or stimulated competition.&#34; [1]Is there a lawer who can say if that was price fixing?[1] https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/competition-guidance/guide-a..."</p>

  - includes modern browser APIs like fetch() without needing to import additional dependencies
  - The Deno-specific APIs (like Deno.readTextFile()[0]) are Promise-based and have intuitive interfaces
  - The Deno standard library[1] reduces the need for 3rd party dependencies, since it covers a lot of cases where one would be needed

								<p class="story__comment_others">"When this topic is applied at scale, I feel that the article is discussing &#34;Tech giants don&#39;t want to recruit the people they need to handle customer support&#34;, with extra steps.Tech scales cheaply. People do not.The argument here, which I wholeheartedly support, is that people deserve transparency - we should know what happens to our data. The sum of human interactions, our actions as a group, our foibles, best natures and choices are sitting behind NDAs and firms that are essentially imperial, a state that no one wants.Firms like the power, but not the cost. But any more equitable state will require legions of people to respond to all of those complaints raised in a day. Which costs money.Making that information transparent, giving reasons, creating an appeals process (the santa clara principles) is expense.I bet that no firm wants to, and if forced to do so, they will shift the costs to someone else. Either firms that treat all of those escalations as fodder to churn through or upsell, or to tax paying citizens.Kafkaesque bureaucracy? If anyone is willing to take the other side of a bet, I&#39;ll bet that there is ONLY Kafkaesque bureaucracy here. Get more people, then  you get more lopsided human bias influenced decisions. Get more automation, and then you have the current state of affairs - no nuance, no clarity and the unfeeling boot of an automaton on your account.&#34;Which KPI defined the fate of humanity? Appeals addressed per second&#34;Final point: In the real world, if you have open transparent rules, then it takes human time and physical action to appeal or tie up the system.In a digital system, open and transparent rules mean that someone will eventually automate a way to tie up your appeals que at no cost. Ban the user? New account shows up in 10 seconds.I have no idea how to address this last difference."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What magnifies this problem is that unrelated, offline companies are more and more frequently requiring you to use these tech products in order to do business.  On United, you can&#39;t buy a drink on the airplane without installing an app (only available to serfs of the apple or google empires).  You can&#39;t attend a Cubs game in Chicago, again, without an app (no physical tickets, before pandemic).  You can&#39;t see a menu at a restaurant without a smartphone and personal internet connection.  Order carryout only through an app, etc."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Here is what will happen with this technology... nothing. The company is an IP play where they have locked up this concept in IP and will try and force it on jurisdictions by various means of legislation to ensure they can get the highest prices possible for said IP. Incumbents will resist choosing to continue with current public domain technology. In 30 years when the IP expires it might possibly come into more common use. The current IP regimes are a complete disaster and are hamstringing human progress.PS: Also scroll compressors are substantially more energy efficient than rotary and various means of staging is even more efficient yet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unfortunately the explanation of the A/C fluid cycle is haphazard and the description of how forces relate to crankshaft position is completely wrong.  The crankshaft actually applies maximum force to the piston while approaching top and bottom dead center, when the mechanical advantage is greatest, and the least at mid stroke, where the torque of the motor is most directly opposed by the pressure of the gas against the face of the piston.   This is good, however, because it marries well to the available power through an alternating current system.The design described does seem to have fewer moving parts, which is good.  But the advantage of linear vs rotary motion with respect to forces seems sketchy.  Field strength in the linear system is likely to vary across the travel and would still need to be synchronized to the alternating current to prevent motor stalls.  (Edit 50 of this comment: this effect is actually illustrated directly in the video here: https://youtu.be/2TFiL5BM3ss?t=348  Imagine the field lines directly correlate with force applied, and mentally plot the quantity of field lines over time as you watch the animation.  Turns out it looks precisely like the force chart of a rotary compressor.)The primary advantage of this pump, to me, seems to be reduced weight/complexity and lower friction losses.  For it to operate with low starting load it would likely need to essentially vibrate its way to full travel (confirmed at 7:47 in the video), something rotary compressors can’t really do.  If you try to restart rotary compressors too quickly after stopping, the high head pressure will stall the motor.  This causes it to effectively be a dead short minus winding resistance, pulling much more current than average (known as LRA or locked rotor amps) with no cooling.  This will heat the motor quickly until it thermally trips or burns up.  This is why you will frequently see restart delays in A/C systems.For what its worth, scroll compressors have been around forever and share some of these advantages, but aren’t dominant in the industry because of the additional complexity in manufacturing.  They have an additional advantage of somewhat continous output pressure, which *significantly* reduces ambient noise and vibration.  They also have fewer moving parts and are generally more reliable.All of these advantages convey to standard air compressors by the way, something I&#39;m a little surprised they didn&#39;t mention."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Do note that Magtor is currently only claiming to be able to compress air, not air conditioning fluids / refrigerants. They add that &#34;[a]lthough air compression is a first milestone for Magtor, the medium-term goal is to bring Magtor efficiencies to climate control engineering allowing products such as fridges, heat pumps and air conditioning units to become 30+% more efficient&#34; [1].It&#39;s hard to verify more on the design. They offer a lot of explanation and tests, but no independent review is given. Main question on YouTube about scrolling compressors (used in newer fridges) is anwered a bit vaguely [2].The patent portfolio page is very grandiose [3] but doesn&#39;t care to link anything.
