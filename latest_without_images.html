But was he in any way involved with the legal defense team for GNOME?The story reads to me like GNOME spent $150k on a legal defense that saved themselves and carved out a little niche for FOSS projects, but otherwise allowed the patent troll to continue profiting from this patent.&gt; Of course, that’s little comfort to the 20+ victims attacked after GNOME with the now-proven-worthless Rothschild ‘086 patent, or the 50+ companies targeted with related patents that haven’t yet been re-examined.Meanwhile, it looks like Mr. Smith basically did what the GNOME defense team should have done from the start and got the patent invalidated, with no funds to speak of."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is super cool.In case you don&#39;t make it through to the project&#39;s webpage howisfelix.today, and read through to the end, here is the creator&#39;s conclusion:Overall, having spent a significant amount of time building this project, scaling it up to the size it’s at now, as well as analysing the data, the main conclusion is that it is not worth building your own solution, and investing this much time. When I first started building this project 3 years ago, I expected to learn way more surprising and interesting facts. There were some, and it’s super interesting to look through those graphs, however retrospectively, it did not justify the hundreds of hours I invested in this project.I’ll likely continue tracking my mood, as well as a few other key metrics, however will significantly reduce the amount of time I invest in it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Neat, and interesting that his conclusion is that it&#39;s too much effort to do for oneself.My take on this is Timelinize[0], which is capable of downloading all your data from various digital records like social media, your phone, arbitrary files and unstructured folders, your Google account, etc. So it can aggregate data from Google Photos, Location History, Twitter, Facebook, text messages, and more, onto your computer, organized into a single timeline.(It is the successor to Timeliner[1].)I suppose Timelinize can support personal body metrics from various devices, and it is planned to support manual entries as well like journals. Analyses like his would also be possible.Data can be automatically imported on a regular basis via APIs (like, backing up your new tweets every day). The arbitrary file importer can also be scheduled to watch a directory for changes: just write a file or folder to that directory, and Timelinize will automatically import it (and optionally delete it when finished).Timelines are stored locally on your own computer, as plain files on disk, with a sqlite database as an index, so it should be a breeze to back up and use/read without proprietary software.The idea is to:- Back up your precious data that is otherwise held more-or-less hostage on somebody else&#39;s computers- While creating a detailed, personal journal for your family history- In a way that can show you your life in context with others&#39; timelines and the wider world.[0]: https://twitter.com/timelinize (No actual website yet.)[1]: https://github.com/mholt/timeliner"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This project is super cool. I would recommend the author starts tracking the amount of CO2 he emits in a year, which could easily be approximated with the flight/transportation and food data he has. Carbon emissions per Capita per year in the US: 18 metric tonnes. In Italy: 8 metric tonnes [1]. Author is probably close to 60-80 with all the transatlantic flights.[1] https://www.theguardian.com/environment/datablog/2009/sep/02..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Refreshingly honest about the video quality you should expect in the main promo video. Typical problems like dynamic range, color profile, light bleed and tracking problems with the top of the head being cut off at one point. Pretty typical unless you spend more money on your drone or camera equipment. There are so many companies that fake the footage or pick much easier shooting locations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this is such a fun/playful idea, kudos to Snap!Their first hardware product pretty much bombed but this is oddly one of the first consumer tech toys in a while that I&#39;ve felt I wanted. I can definitely see this being a fun thing to bring out in the backyard or to cookouts/parties, especially as a dad with young kids too.A couple things I&#39;d be a bit worried about:* Battery life would need to last long enough to use this on and off for a few hours. If it&#39;s like 15 mins then no way.* Would there be an audible hum in the video it records from the 4x propellers?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"People saying that this can’t compete with DJI are missing the point.This product knows its target market (hint, not the people who browse HN) and, based on my initial first impressions, I think it’s nailed it.Forgive me for a slightly contrived analogy, but if a 
DJI Mavic is a DSLR, and a DJI Mini is a portable point-and-shoot camera, then Pixy is a Polaroid. It’s certainly not got the highest picture quality, doesn’t have good altitude or range and the 30s flight time sounds laughable, but it’s a nice looking, approachable device that looks like it could be used by anyone to take videos they currently can’t with the devices they currently have (the mode dial is a brilliant idea.)I think this thing will sell very nicely. The big question for me is whether the Pixy wireless streaming to the phone allows exports out of the Snapchat app, if it does then all the biggest TikTok stars will buy one immediately and it will explode in popularity."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Great list, but:&gt; To keep young kids behaving on a car road trip, have a bag of their favorite candy and throw a piece out the window each time they misbehave.That&#39;s terrible advice. Treat children with respect! They are very smart, they just lack experience. If they &#34;misbehave&#34;, talk to them and explain why this is not good. If you can&#39;t find an explanation, chances are you are wrong and you should reevaluate your position.But never, never, never willfully hurt them by throwing away their favorite candy. So wrong on so many levels.This was a big surprise for me in this list as I mostly agree with the items before it. Or, to use a previous item:&gt; You’ll get 10x better results by elevating good behavior rather than punishing bad behavior, especially in children and animals.Well said."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Criticize in private, praise in public.I broke this one, and it broke a 10 year friendship which took another 5 to heal, and I decided to stop pretending to be a manager. This is a rule of life not to break if you can avoid it. Almost irreparable harm done."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;  When checking references for a job applicant, employers may be reluctant or prohibited from saying anything negative, so leave or send a message that says, “Get back to me if you highly recommend this applicant as super great.” If they don’t reply take that as a negative.Big disagree here, that&#39;s not fair at all to the applicant. Some people are just terrible referees and it&#39;s hard to know that as the applicant until someone lets you down. Some people mean to reply but forget, some people are too busy to answer and don&#39;t get back to you, some people just don&#39;t want to even though they think you&#39;d be an excellent candidate. On top of that, with people moving around so much it can be hard to nail down recent contact details.If somewhere I&#39;m applying to work can&#39;t get a hold of someone, I&#39;d very much expect them to reach back out to me in order to resolve the issue, if they can&#39;t do me that courtesy then I guess I&#39;ll be working somewhere else."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The author fundamentally misunderstands language design. He picks an arbitrary design constraint, in this case correctness, and argues that any language that does not provide 100% correctness is bad. He uses Rust for his examples, a language that has correctness as one of its top design goals, and contrasts it with Go, for which correctness is not that important. So of course Rust will come out on top when the only metric you care about is correctness.As usual with such one-sided rants, the downsides to the supposed clearly right alternative are omitted. How long would it take for me to learn Rust + write a given program vs Go? How long does it take to model problems 100% correctly vs merely well-enough?&gt; It [Go] constantly lies about how complicated real-world systems are, and optimize for the 90% case, ignoring correctness.Yes, exactly. Optimizing for the 90% case, not simplicity, is the primary design goal of Go. In other words, pragmatism or the 80/20 rule. Go attempts to provide 80% of the benefit for only 20% of the cost.This is pervasive throughout the language:- the author&#39;s examples,- a GC,- merely good-enough error handling.The sweet spot Go attempts to strike between speed of coding, correctness, safety, performance, and mental overhead is the reason it&#39;s so polarizing. You may like this approach or not, but let&#39;s not pretend that Go is all bad or that say Rust is some perfect holy grail that will save us all."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Go has a lot of issues. Some of them would be easily fixable if people promoting and developing Go actually admitted the problems. However, the fanbase usually acts as a cult pretending that issues are features. Thing is, just like broken, hackish dependency &#34;management&#34; had to be fixed (introducing tons of complexity for the sake of not destroying backward compatibility), other problems will have to be fixed as well. It will add even more complexity to the language.For example, Go error handling is shit. People will attempt to fix it with generics now and that will create a lot of inconsistency between different APIs. Because of those inconsistencies the entire language will loose any possibility of elegant, high-level, pre-packaged solutions for certain things (like automated logging, recovery, etc.) This loss will be permanent and the vast majority of users won&#39;t even understand why some things are so hard."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My Anecdotal Experience:Golang is great for spinning up new services and tools with very little overhead, the language is well designed for the backend - and the lack of &lt;insert programming language feature here&gt; avoids &#34;odd&#34; decisions which other engineers will dislike in the future.  If your job is building lots of new things using relatively common building blocks, then Golang looks fantastic!However on mature services, engineers often need &lt;insert programming language here&gt; because they are dealing with something extremely complex.   The author of this blog post digs into the scenario for a package which needs to support different non-nix operating systems, but the same can be true of an app which has to manage many different kinds of objects (Kubernetes, or any service with many DAOs). Alternately there are engineers building all kinds of weird software which may do new things in novel simplified ways.  Golang occasionally makes expressing these types of applications more difficult.Overall I enjoyed my time writing go, until I tried to write a statistics based application for a startup idea back in 2016.  The project didn&#39;t get very far, and that was partly due to me getting bored having to deal with all of the different numeric data types, at the time the lack of generics made it so that you either had to use reflection - or implement the same function N times over to support the different numeric data types.  This tedium killed my love of the language (I&#39;m sure it&#39;s a better experience in 2022)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t understand entropy and this article did not change it. The issue I take is with the definition of &#34;the most likely state&#34;.Think of a series of random bits that can be either 0 or 1 with equal probability. How likely is it that they are all 0 or all 1? Not very likely. There is exactly one configuration. How likely is it that they have a specific configuration of 0 and 1? Equally likely. All states are equally likely. If you randomly flip bits you go from one state to another state but each one is equally likely to occur. There is no special meaning to a specific configuration if you don&#39;t give it one.If you look at the average of all bits you start grouping all states together with the equal number of 1s. If you talk about the average there is only one configuration that is all 1s but most configurations have roughly 50% 1s. If you now start flipping bits you will meander through all possible bit-states but the average will most likely be close to 50% 1s most of the time.In physics we usually look at averages such as the average velocity expressed as temperature. Therefore it makes sense to group together all states using the average and then the states with very low or very high averages are few.But if you look deeper than that averaging it stops making sense to me. It&#39;s a completely different world. I don&#39;t know what Entropy is supposed to mean on the level of individual states/configurations. I don&#39;t understand what kind of macroscopic &#34;averaging&#34; function we may use to group up those states. There could be more than one possibility - from that would follow that there is more than one definition of macro-Entropy. Ideally there should be one general definition of how we have to look at those microstates and from that follows our general definition of Entropy. Sadly I didn&#39;t study Physics and this topic still continues to confuse me. The usual explanations fail to enlighten me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One aspect of entropy that I always find counterintuitive is that unlike mass, charge, etc. it is not a physical quantity. In fact, from the point of view of an experimenter with perfect information about a physical system, the entropy of the system is exactly conserved over time (as made precise by Liouville&#39;s Theorem). The Second Law survives in this setting only in the most trivial sense that a constant function does not decrease.It&#39;s only when you start making crude measurements---lumping positions into pixels, clouds of particles each with their own kinetic energy into a single scalar called &#34;temperature,&#34; etc---that you start to see a nontrivial entropy and Second Law. Different ways of lumping microstates into macrostates will give you different (and inconsistent) notions of entropy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I thought entropy (in the Shannon sense) was a property of discrete and finite probability distributions. It&#39;s essentially a measure of how random a sample from such a probability distribution is. Notably, continuous probability distributions don&#39;t have meaningful entropy (or in some sense, their entropy is always infinite). It&#39;s worth considering the similarities and differences between entropy and standard deviation.I thought the 2nd law of thermodynamics was saying that with incomplete knowledge, the probability distribution of possible states becomes more and more spread out as time goes on. It&#39;s almost a limit to how you can make predictions or simulations of physics when the initial state of the system is not fully known. Equivalently, it&#39;s a banal statement about chaos in the sense of chaos theory.The only thing I don&#39;t get is how physicists get around the discrete and finite restriction. Maybe the state of the system is not what has entropy. Rather, one can define an arbitrary function f from the system to a finite set S, and then talk about the entropy of f(System at time t), because this is indeed a discrete and finite probability distribution which you can take the entropy of.Hmmm. Maybe I understand entropy."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The problem is that spam was/is so bad that extreme measures were taken to curb it. There are all kinds of invisible forces that you abutt that can be difficult to figure out, such as IP blacklists and the like. And even if you set everything up properly and host your email with a responsible host, Microsoft will still mark your mail as spam.I host my own email server with Vultr on an OpenBSD VM using OpenSMTPD and Dovecot, relaying all outbound mail through SMTP2Go (their free tier more than meets my needs). I have all of the necessary DNS entries set to mark my mail as legit, and I sign all outgoing mail using strong 2048-bit RSA keys. Thus far, I&#39;m able to send mail and not have it marked as spam (at least to everyone that I&#39;ve corresponded with thus far). It was a lot of work to get to that point, but not terrible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been self-hosting email for about 20 years, from a dedicated server in Europe. The server hardware has been replaced a couple of times but kept its IP.If you set everything up right, and choose the host for your mail server carefully, and never change IP, after a fairly short time you won&#39;t have much problem with being marked as spam. No more so than with any other email host.As is so often the case, the people that say you should never do it probably have little relevant experience, they are just repeating something they heard."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a lot to say here from both sides - people running their own mail infrastructure (like I have for almost 25 years) and big mail providers dealing with brutal, unrelenting spam.But there is one piece of this that&#39;s ridiculous, broken and almost cruel:  silently dropping messages marked as &#34;spam&#34; with no notification given back to the sender.Why does this practice exist ?  Who believes that this is decent or acceptable behavior ?If gmail doesn&#39;t want my inbound message - for any reason - that is just fine.If they drop it on the floor without telling me that is totally shitty."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"E Ink (the company) keeps improving their electrophoresis display technology. Unfortunately the technology necessarily has very low refresh rates since it it is based on moving around solid particles submerged in a liquid.There were other passive e-paper display technologies like the one by Liquavista (based on moving colored oil droplets) or Mirasol by Qualcomm (mechanical micro-shutters create colored light via interference). These were capable of achieving high refresh rates, but unfortunately they have long been abandoned.I believe the monochromatic electrophoresis displays by E Ink had higher reflectivity and lower price, which is what mattered for e-readers, so all the others went out of business."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The thing that always bothers me about these articles, and I completely accept it may just me reading into it what I want to see, is I immediately assume the dollar figure is annual. $160k/yr sounds like great passive income. You could certainly stop working a 9-5 and build out a really great lifestyle business.But then I look at the article. Oh, it&#39;s over six years? Okay, $26k/yr is a lot less and all of a sudden it&#39;s a big risk to try and turn that into a real business. Wait, what&#39;s that in the screenshot? 78 books? $341 per book, per year. And my thought goes from &#34;that sounds like a great little business!&#34; to &#34;fuck that&#34; within about fifteen seconds.And such is the lifecycle of these &#34;how I made $n doing x&#34; articles. Great claims that when you dig into them, the resulting wisdom is basically &#34;do a lot of work, and have a little bit of luck. And don&#39;t forget the marketing!&#34;I don&#39;t mean to tear down what the author did by any stretch, it&#39;s impressive regardless of the time frame. But if you&#39;re already making $150-200k/yr from a tech job, do you really want to bust your ass for another couple grand?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Writing (from a quick skim check) at least 16 books over a period of 6 years, and earning money from that, is not exactly what I&#39;d call &#34;passive income&#34;. And given the topics are mostly (all?) about niches in current technologies they also won&#39;t continue to deliver passively forever.A more appropriate title and angle might be &#34;How I&#39;ve earned $10k/book and manage to keep writing more while maintaining a day job&#34;.
