								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Having done a short stint dealing with this stuff I am glad something is being done. NIST/NSF funded several studies that I was close to that were suddenly owned by a journal who did nothing but provide a place to put it.Public money should always mean public access. Not just for journals, but for anything. If one red cent of taxpayer money goes to it, the taxpayer should get it for free. Hopefully the trend continues."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"US Federal grants are involved in almost all research done in the US, so this likely means that the vast majority of research papers will become open access.Open Access will mean that top quality research will no longer require membership of a University; anyone will be able to access research."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s only doable with a text-centric website. I&#39;m currently finishing a photography section for my personal website, and the gallery pages are several hundred kBs in size, while single photo page is almost 1MB in size (provided you load it on a 28&#34; screen; browser will load smaller variants on smaller screens). Most of that weight is the thumbnails (and almost-full-size photo in the latter case). The only JS I have is 6 lines (before minifying) on single photo pages which allow you to go to next or previous photo with keyboard arrows. I don&#39;t use any CSS frameworks, just a single hand-written CSS file. I don&#39;t have any tracking, analytics, social media features or anything of this sort.So if even a personal site being done with no deadlines, no pressure from management to include analytics etc. can&#39;t do it, because it wants to display a bunch of photos, then I don&#39;t think we can expect &#34;web-scale&#34; websites to achieve it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wonder if anyone has studied the impact of latency on user behavior while considering the impact of user expectations from their typical connection speed. Whenever I see an article about page speed optimization, the assumption is that a user will give up if a page takes too long to load, ans that everyone gives up after X seconds. Usually X is about 7s based on a Nielson article from years and years ago.The thing is tbough, a user who frequently uses satellite Internet or a 2G mobile connection will learn that pages take a while to download over that connection, and they will adjust their expectations accordingly. Satellite Internet users aren&#39;t giving up on pages every 7s. They&#39;re waiting because they know the page will load slowly.I suspect most users wait for a page if most pages are slow. So long as your website is no slower than the average then you&#39;re probably not losing many visitors.Obviously that&#39;s not to say you shouldn&#39;t make your website as fast as you can. You should. Everyone will appreciate the effort. But don&#39;t assume that knocking a few seconds off the TTI time will actually impact your conversion metrics. It probably won&#39;t (but only a proper study can prove it either way)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a sad day. Pricing changes are always hard, and having been through some of the earlier pricing changes at Heroku you can&#39;t make everyone happy. But, so many developers deployed their first app on Heroku and was a staple for so many bootcamps. Without it I&#39;m confident we&#39;d have less developers in the world.It is still one of the gold standards for developer experience. Years after its heyday companies and tools talk about and try to emulate that experience. I recall polling on twitter a few months back which the key feature was:- git push heroku master- Heroku add-ons- Heroku Postgres- Review appsAnd the reality is any one of those could standard on their own. But put together, Heroku simply lets you forget about ops and focus on shipping, and shipping is king.I fully get it&#39;s a business, but can&#39;t help but feel this is the writing on the wall for the future.Gonna pour one out tonight for Heroku.Edit: And may be trying to figure out how to offer free Postgres databases, cause shutting down databases with 3 months notice feels pretty short. Not sure if that means deleting the data itself or what, but ouch."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We pay Heroku many, many tens of thousands of dollars a year. And I still use free dynos, both personally and at work. For example, throwing up a quick app for testing (where I&#39;m happy with dynos that sleep or are limited per-repo). By pushing us off the Heroku ecosystem for some stuff, we might as well just move everything.The only reason we even use Heroku now is because I used it for free over a decade ago.I get why they made this decision, and I&#39;m excited for Fly.io, Render, etc who can run the same playbook Heroku did 15 years ago. But also a bit sad, from a nostalgic standpoint. Many of us are here because of Heroku&#39;s free tier, and I&#39;m very thankful for it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fly.io has a dedicated process for moving off of Heroku. Auth via Heroku and they&#39;ll launch your app onto Fly. They also have a free tier.The process: https://fly.io/launch/herokuThe docs: https://fly.io/docs/app-guides/speed-up-a-heroku-appI haven&#39;t used it [the Heroku -&gt; Fly process] myself, but it&#39;s been around for quite some time!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Looks really good. A layer over Nix that makes it tolerable sounds like a godsend. I’ve had a TODO item for “somehow use Nix for our dev env” at Notion since 2019, but I keep kicking the can down the road because its better to tolerate a 500 line setup script than learn all the Nix stuff. Of course we could use Docker, but then on Mac our dev process would be 3x slower.Congrats to Daniel and the team! Excited to see what’s next after this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Having a deterministic environment, but that is actually running on your laptop is so much better than working inside a docker container. Inside a container the file system is very slow, and you lose all of your other tools and shell aliases."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is shelling out to nix-shell (https://github.com/jetpack-io/devbox/blob/97c19c370287e203bb...) which means that it will only support bash AFAIK. I&#39;ve seen a lot of discussions around using nix-shell for dev environments, but read somewhere that is not really made for this purpose originally, rather for just building packages, bash being only one of the limitations.I tried to experiment myself with nix-shell, but I think it doesn&#39;t provide separation on the machine on which you run, it&#39;s not a chroot nor a docker container. If you are interested in some level of separation to make sure that a dev environment is &#34;safe&#34; to run on your machine without making side effects to things external to the project, then I&#39;m not sure nix-shell would be able to help, but I would be happy to learn there is an option to do otherwise."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article engages in my pet peeve, which is referring to entertainment as &#34;content&#34;.I don&#39;t have a problem with the word &#34;content&#34; in the context of content vs framing.  e.g. if you are designing a network protocol, you care about distinguishing the content of the message from the framing, and you don&#39;t care at all what the nature of the content is, it could be video, image, text, etc, and it could serve many different purposes (entertainment, personal communication, employee training, archival/backup, etc).However, this sort of language has crept into discussions of online entertainment, for no good reason.  &#34;I&#39;m not an online entertainer, creating entertainment  for people to enjoy, I am a content-creator creating content for people to consume.&#34;  I think people don&#39;t like to think about what they&#39;re creating or consuming as entertainment, because society has already attached a connotation of triviality to the term &#34;entertainment&#34; (for good reason IMO).Someone who talks about &#34;content&#34; is adopting the terminology and framing of a businessman, who cares little what purpose the &#34;content&#34; serves, just that it can attract attention, and thus money.To be fair, once the internet is entirely taken over by bots, maybe it will be appropriate to call the stuff that bots create and consume &#34;content&#34; without a whiff of irony."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The end result of all this fakery is a growing doubt and distrust of the world and the information presented to us. Bots on twitter, corporate reddit moderators pruning discourse, astroturfed discussions, deepfakes, AI generated news articles, AI art, it all waters down the assumption that what we see before us is real. Leading us to doubt everything we read, see and hear. Much of this bot driven noise online is only possible in large, public online communities.I think we will see a shift towards much smaller walled gardens of community online. It&#39;s already happening with the mass exodus to discord and smaller chatrooms. I think we can all safely assume that our 30 discord friends are real people... for now.The country club exists for the wealthy to enjoy the pleasantries of community and pastime without interruption by the masses. I think the internet will move to mirror the real world as we segregate apart into the places we most enjoy... or have the connections and money to afford. Authentic and vibrant human communities with novel content curation will be a luxury, while the &#34;public pool&#34; for the masses will be an internet of data pollution and grime."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s another route to an industrial revolution that might have happened - steel.The British industrial revolution was built from iron, not steel. Mass production of steel didn&#39;t appear until the 1880s, with the Bessemer converter. This was half a century after the deployment of successful railroads.Iron and steel was known to the Roman empire. The steel wasn&#39;t very good, even by the standards of antiquity, but it was good enough for short swords and some tools. They got as far as the &#34;bloom&#34; process, but no further. Despite this, there was a modest iron and steel industry.A Bessemer converter is a simple thing. It&#39;s a big iron vessel lined with brick attached to a furnace and blower. Roman ironworkers could have built one. It&#39;s the metallurgy that&#39;s hard. Bessemer built the thing, but steel quality was random at first. Robert Mushet, a metallurgist, after about 10,000 experiments, figured out how to get consistent quality from the process. The basic idea, from Wikipedia, is to apply enough heat and air to burn off almost all the carbon in iron ore, leaving pure iron. Then add  &#39;spiegel glanz&#39; or spiegel eisen, a &#34;double carbonate of iron and manganese found in the Rhenish mountains&#34; which was iron, 86…25; manganese, 8…50; and carbon, 5…25.  Controlled amounts of manganese and carbon are thus put back into the molten iron, and steel comes out.A number of cultures figured out steel by accident. Thus, Japanese steel, Damascus steel, etc. 
Various trace additives - vanadium, molybdenum, etc. were used. The Roman empire got as far as mediocre steel. But the process was neither understood nor reproducible at scale. Mass production required enough analytical chemistry to do quality control on the ingredients.So an interesting speculation is what might have happened if an early culture had some people really into finding out what stuff is made of. That leads to analytical chemistry. Some Roman philosopher might have discovered that if you grind rocks to a powder, mix with water, and spray into a steady flame, colored light comes out. If you look at that colored light through a prism, you see sharp lines, in the same places for the same materials, which indicate the elemental composition of the material. If they&#39;d happened to talk to someone in the Roman army responsible for a sword factory having yield problems, they might have gotten some samples of the minerals being used. That might have led to the beginnings of metallurgy quality control. As there is in a modern steel plant, there would be somebody in a little room not too far from the furnaces doing analysis on the raw materials.Steel would still be somewhat expensive, but with a repeatable production process, swords and knives would get better. Then agricultural implements and other tools. If you need to plow hard or rocky ground, a steel plow is a big help.The next big breakthrough in an an agrarian society with some steelmaking capability would be a reaper. The McCormick reaper was the first machine that really boosted agricultural production. That&#39;s what kicked the world past sustenance-level agriculture.So that&#39;s an unlikely, but not impossible, alternative path to an industrial revolution."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The basic argument is that without a clear use case to overcome the version 1.0 troubles of (steam) engines, there was no incentive to work out the kinks and pumping water out of coal mines was the big &#34;killer application&#34; of such motors. That is, pumping water out of coal mines was the &#34;early adopter&#34; market for engine technology:&gt; As we’ll see, this was a use-case that didn’t really exist in the ancient world and indeed existed almost nowhere but Britain even in the period where it worked.I remember reading a blog post by TechnicsHistory [0] (which was on the front page of HN at one point) that makes the same argument.The acoup.blog article goes on to give a reason why coal wasn&#39;t needed earlier as the need for heating fuel became scarce when wood became scarce:&gt; Consequently wood as a heat fuel was scarce and so beginning in the 16th century we see a marked shift over to coal as a heating fuel for things like cooking and home heating.I&#39;m still skeptical of why it took so long. Were there no other places in Europe, Asia or the Middle East that didn&#39;t have the same deforestation issues? Was it the combination of deforestation and population density?[0] https://technicshistory.com/2021/07/13/the-triumvirate-coal-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great article. Thought provoking.Maybe an industrial revolution could not have happened in the times of the Romans, but I think maybe, just maybe, it could have happened 1000 years before them.The bronze age was followed by the iron age not because iron is a better metal (initially it was not), but because bronze requires trade routes (copper comes from some mines, tin from some other mines), and those disappeared after the Bronze Age collapse.Now, imagine that the Bronze Age had lasted a few hundred years longer. Just one hundred years before the Bronze Age collapse there was the battle of Kadesh [1], where tens of thousands of soldiers squared off. There were 5000 to 6000 chariots altogether.Which means the late Bronze Age empires needed huge quantities of weapons, therefore of bronze. Egypt does not have a lot of trees, and trees are quite scarce in other places in the Middle East. Just like Britain ran out of trees and needed to resort to coal, a few hundred years more of bronze age would have forced Egypt to look for a substitute for charcoal. It would not have been coal, because there are no easily accessible veins of coal in the Middle East.It would have been petroleum. Petroleum was known during those times [2]:  More than 4000 years ago, according to Herodotus and Diodorus Siculus, asphalt was used in the construction of the walls and towers of Babylon; there were oil pits near Ardericca (near Babylon), and a pitch spring on Zacynthus. Great quantities of it were found on the banks of the river Issus, one of the tributaries of the Euphrates.

Sure, except despite their ostensibly open nature, many of these projects are run as internal projects of large tech corps, and the bandwidth and interest of the team in reviewing and merging external PRs is limited to nonexistent. I&#39;ve submitted small, obvious bug fixes, complete with test coverage, to projects and had them sit unreviewed for years.Fork it? Well there is a big, big difference between spending an hour fixing a bug and submitting a PR, and forking a large and complex dependency. You&#39;re committing yourself and your team and employer to the ongoing maintenance of the fork and merging of upstream changes, just so you can merge a bug fix. Usually, that&#39;s just not practical.Fuck off? Many third-party dependencies in mature projects are non-negotiable. Removing them would require a complete rewrite. You may not even have been the person who chose them, but you&#39;re stuck with them, and then your boss asks you to implement a feature or fix something that relies on a change or fix in a dependency. Being blocked due to upstream intransigence is very frustrating, and there is often a professional cost to saying &#34;no&#34; to a request, especially a bug fix, no matter how convincing you argue that it&#39;s not your fault or under your control."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As an OSS maintainer for a large project I disagree. Sometimes people did fuck off and it didn&#39;t do the project any favors.I needed people to communicate clearly and with volume why I should change some opinions. Ultimately, my mistakes led to a competitor that was indeed unsuccessful but sucked a lot of the mindshare so we both got screwed.We&#39;re smart people but we all need to learn humility occasionally. I do agree we need manners but I don&#39;t agree that people should just fuck off. I want complaints. That&#39;s how I can gauge improvement. A culture of ignoring complaints is bad. I know that is not what the article is about exactly, but it&#39;s where these things lead."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s (at least) four Fs, and the first in the list should be &#34;File it&#34;.Not every open source user is a developer who can Fix it or Fork it, but a well-written bug report (and other forms of high-quality feedback) is a godsend. Even as a developer, everybody benefits if I file a bug and then spend my energy on my own open-source work rather than spending that same amount of time trying to learn the codebase of every piece of software I use."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t quite understand the argument &#34;0-based being easier for pointer arithmetic is nonsense because the language doesn&#39;t have pointers&#34;.Whether or not the language presents the concept of &#34;pointer&#34; to the user is independent of whether or not it uses pointers internally. And if it exposes arrays as a concept, it has to implement them somehow.The simplest possible implementation of arrays is having a start address and putting all elements next to each other in RAM. To get the address of a particular item, this layout naturally leads to the formula &#34;base address + index * element size&#34;, with &#34;index&#34; being 0-based. If you want to expose other indexing schemes in your language, you&#39;ll have to add more logic to convert the user-visible index back to 0-based before you can obtain the address.All of this is completely independent of the fact whether your language exposes pointers to the user or not.Even the yacht story sort of hints at this:&gt; To keep people from having their jobs cut short by yacht-racing, Richards designed the language to compile as fast as possible. One optimization was setting arrays to start at 0.If all indexing schemes were equal, why would this change even be an optimisation in the first place?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Other advantages of zero based indexing, beyond being &#39;closer to the machine&#39;:It works better with the modulo operator: `array[i%length]` vs `array[(i+length-1)%length+1]`. Or you would have to define a modulo-like operator that maps ℕ to [1..n].It works better if you have a multi-dimensional index, for example the pixels in an image. With 0 based indexing, pixel `(x,y)` is at `array[x+widthy]`. With 1 based indexing it is at `array[x+width(y-1)]`. You might argue that programming languages should support multi-dimensional arrays, but you still need operations like resizing, views, etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Because otherwise you would be wasting a perfectly good number for no reason, which means you need to use more bits to do the same thing.To write 4 numbers (including zero) you only need two bits    0: 00
    1: 01
    2: 10
    3: 11

To write 4 numbers if you avoid using the number zero, you need three bits    1: 001
    2: 010
    3: 011
    4: 100

If you extrapolate that a little bit, you&#39;ll realize that you&#39;ll need two bytes (1 Byte + 1 bit from another byte) to store the indices of an array with 2^8 elements, which is just dumb.Some of you might be thinking: you don&#39;t need to store it the same way it&#39;s written, you can just substract 1 from whatever the user typed and convert it behind the scenes.Yes, you could subtract 1, but then you would be making the whole system more complex, opaque, and unelegant, while hiding information from the programmer for no good reason."</p>
