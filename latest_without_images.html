								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If I could ask Apple for one thing it would be to require approval of every push notification that an app developer wants to deliver. That an app gets either cart blanche to send me notifications or nothing at all drives me crazy. I don&#39;t want to miss a notification that my delivery food arrived, but I don&#39;t want to be bombarded with daily advertising messages from foodpanda trying to get me to change my behavior. Require app developers to submit a template string (and not &#34;\(message)&#34;) for each notification the app can deliver for approval in the App Store and let me have an on/off switch for each one.&#34;Notifications&#34; across every platform drive me crazy, because they usually start out as useful, but because people tend to pay them more attention than all the other channels that have already been tuned out, companies start juicing them for engagement. I use twitter rarely, but every time I do I am perplexed why my &#34;notifications&#34; are full of crap about who recently tweeted. Shouldn&#39;t that just be in my timeline?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article wants Apple to save us from mindless browsing, but I see mindless browsing as unavoidable. Not because of some technical or legal thing, but because mindless browsing is a good thing. We need it. Mindless browsing is like a walk through the woods, just looking for what is happening, navigating a huge amount of information that is hardly important at the moment – oh, the cherry tree is blooming – but could be important later.The &#39;outside&#39; is made up of myriads of tiny details – wind is moving the leaves, slowly and irregularly, the birds are singing, insects flying through the air, the earth feels soft and damp and smells of freshness after the rain, the movements of clouds and the sun are inexorably changing the lighting. We are, however, spending time in concrete boxes where nothing ever moves, and even seal off the sounds and air flow from the outside. Within those boxes we sit and lie and enter other, flatter spaces of our screens, which nonetheless offer us the possibility of some kind of change, movement in the world.. Of course we will browse those changes mindlessly.Since mainstream social media has turned into a manipulative toxic landscape, I find myself retreating to more niche and better moderated sites, devoid of hate and over-strained emotions. I also find myself wishing for a digital space, be it a game or a website, that would feel similar to a walk in the woods – where a lot is happening but not much is important. Like watching the breaking of waves on the beach. Like sitting at a campfire. Like watching the tree tops move in the wind.I like mindless browsing. I enjoy it. Just give me the right space for it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Even though this article is sarcastic(?) I can&#39;t help but get genuinely angry at these trillion dollar companies thinking they know what is better for us and trying to control and police everything. This is even worse than govt censoring porn and cuss-words back in the day thinking they know what is moral for the society.I was just talking to a friend the other day on how badly Apple and Google are trying their best to kill curiosity and creativity. I mean when I first got my 286 the machine was just full of possibilities. I think learning the ins and outs of it was more fun than doing anything productive.I used to hack away at it all day and night. Learning about interrupts, tinkering with the BIOS settings, hacking the serial port, irq, etc. Now everything is just locked down. In my latest phone I can&#39;t even run `fastboot` as that too has been locked down permanently because &#34;security&#34;.Thank god we have Linux created before all this Bullshit started happening. If Apple, Google and Microsoft was in charge of things as they are now, we wouldn&#39;t even have any hardware to run anything else than Windows and iOS."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Note that if you are just interested in US sales taxes, and only need to collect tax in the ~1/2 of the states that are part of the Streamlines Sales Tax (SST) project, you can have your tax rate calculation, registration, reporting, and filing all done for free.The member states of SST have agreed to pay for those services from several  tax SaaS companies. (There is one catch: to avail yourself of this, you must collect tax for all SST states, even though you might be below the threshold in some of them).The companies participating are Avalara, TaxCloud, Sovos, and Accurate Tax.For small online businesses I suspect that a lot more can take advantage of this than you might expect. Here&#39;s a map showing the SST member states [1]. Although it is missing some big states that you probably do a lot of business in (California for instance), a lot of those big states have quite high thresholds for sales or number of transactions before tax kicks in.Some of the companies that provide the fee SST service will also add non-SST states for a fee. If you only need one or two non-SST states, it will still probably come out cheaper than using Stripe (and will include reporting and filing).[1] https://www.streamlinedsalestax.org/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was lucky to be part of the beta for my SaaS (https://turnshift.app) and I must say this new feature simplifies things A LOT.Especially as a EU business owner, I previously had to sync every VAT tax rate possible, use a complex workflow to know if a customer needed to pay taxes or not, link tax rates to customers, and create taxes reports for my accountant. Stripe tax does all of that automatically, based on the customer full address and VAT numbers.Here&#39;s a twitter thread of everything you had to do previously: https://twitter.com/vvoyer/status/1347488977738149888PS: Yes there were other services (Paddle) providing this (and much more to be honest), but the Stripe API and customization options makes it my go-to solution for integrating payments."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Honest question: can somebody enlighten me about Stripe&#39;s appeal? I am not an user (until recently they weren&#39;t even available in my country) but I used ShareIt (now Digital River) 20 years ago and Avangate (now 2checkout soon Verifone) in the past 15 years and they both:- had a much larger international presence, with localizations and everything- had sales taxes, VATs etc computed from day one- had cart (not sure about ShareIt though) &amp; API- integrated countless payment gateways: from credit cards to purchase orders, wire transfers and even PayPalHow comes Stripe won even if they arrived much later on the market? I believe their pricing structure was not very far from the competition. What did they offer to attract users even though they lacked such important features?I want to learn."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A few years back, I had the opportunity to lead the Product Team of a 200+ people company. It took me over a month to understood who does what, and I tend to try to know things around me and at least have the idea of “what to do in an emergency.”I stumble on one DevOps guy who wrote every bloody thing happening in the system. He likes doing it, but from the way people were asking questions in the common chatrooms, group emails, I knew nobody read them. He loves plain text, nicely formatted with the old-school Unix-styles et al. I had talks with him outside of work and found him fascinating; I asked him help with my hobby, home-lab tinkerings, etc.By that time, I had already started internal blog groups and was encouraging people to write. And indeed, a lot of people came out to write about engineering, marketing, product, and it became a routine for people to show off what they can do, what they love, and what they are good at.In one of my regular company-wide emailers, I dedicated a big piece to the DevOps guy, pointing to his work and the beauty of his documentations. People loved it, and they began reading it. He remained a friend. That mailer was the only way I could highlight people I encounter doing good work, to the whole team up to the CxOs.By the time I left the company, I was responsible for many vital things in the company, but I could transition everything smoothly with the documents and credential details (thanks to 1Password).In the last year or so, I have been thinking more about -- always be dying. I think the similar vein of Always be Quitting; I try to document, write out details, just in case I die and my family has to figure out the intricacies."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What does one do when they live by this philosophy of documenting everything and making sure knowledge is captured, but your team mates just refuse to volley the ball back? I find myself documenting how the software works, writing up proposals with beautiful diagrams etc, but my teammates won&#39;t take the simple step to even read the dang thing without scheduling a meeting with me to spoon feed / read it aloud to them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Paradoxically, by being disposable, you free yourself.No, you just make yourself disposable.War is peace.
Freedom is slavery.
Ignorance is strength.Don’t listen to this article. It sounds like something overseers would tell their underlings.And when you’re quitting, that’s the company’s problem, not yours."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I cant +1 this enough. Thank you, Linus for standing up to the wealth of misinformation out there and holding his ground."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are a range of anti-vaccine opinions from idiotic (the example Linus quotes) to more reasonable. The way this issue has been handled is emblematic of the way many such political issues are handled: fringe views are promoted and &#34;debunked&#34; while more reasonable views that go against mainstream narratives are ignored. This is amplified by various high profile personalities in the media who shape the views people are presented with, so that all critics of the mainstream narrative appear to be lunatics. Thus stigmatizing anyone who has a more reasonable objection. This is not a new phenomenon but has played out much more frequently over the last year or so.Also, I got the vaccine, so if you interpret this as some sort of veiled anti-vaccine comment you are part of the problem."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very interesting given one of the lesser known complications of covid can be myocarditis in otherwise healthy individuals with few or no other covid symptoms.In fact, it’s likely the incidence of covid-induced myocarditis is vastly underreported given it often shows no symptoms and can only reasonably be diagnosed with a cardiac MRI which is not always widely available or advised for less-serious heart conditions.I was diagnosed with myocarditis last year and despite a negative PCR test around the onset of symptoms (light-headedness, heart palpitations, fatigue) was strongly suspected to have contracted covid.I was lucky enough to get my first dose of the moderna vaccine a few months back and beside a few days of increased heart palpitations I’ve had no trouble as far as I’m aware, does make me wonder about getting that second dose though."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the interesting things that happened at my company is that productivity instantly doubled when we started working remotely. The reality at my company is that people are only getting 20 hours or so of work done in the office - the rest is socialization, pointless meetings, lunches, or trying to look busy. When we went home for lockdown and kept working 40 hour weeks, not only did productive output double, but everyone burned out in a few weeks.In my opinion, the reality of working from home is that 20-30 hour work weeks need to be acceptable and we should use the rest of our time on non-working things, just like we did in the office, but now that time can be more meaningful to us."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So yes, as a &#34;boss&#34;, the work-from-home future is definitely and absolutely destroying my brain, but I think the whole discussion around control in the article completely misses my point. I couldn&#39;t care less about control and never cared about seat-in-the-ass time before.But as an engineer become manager, I can absolutely feel both sides here:While everything development is massively more chill remote (no interruptions and hey, just go fill your dishwasher while stuff compiles), everything about managing remotely completely sucks for me.Videocalls. Whiteboarding. Interviewing. Strategic work. Reading emotions and connecting to people. What was a matter of just getting six people in a war room for a week and getting that hard problem done now takes eternities and every meeting is an energy hog.Honestly, I really enjoyed being a leader for a technology organization, but right now, I absolutely hate it. There seem to be others who cope better, but it&#39;s certainly not for me.I&#39;m pretty curious on how all of this will turn out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Now, someone insufferable will read this and say “NOT ALL MIDDLE MANAGERS,” and let me tell you, if you’re thinking that, you are probably part of the problem.Clever.  Take the obvious objection--that this is all based on stereotyping of the role and, frankly, cynical assumptions about the way management is or can be structured--and then just turn it into another symptom of management dysfunction!How very tautological: Before you tell me I&#39;m wrong, let me tell you you&#39;re wrong for telling me I&#39;m wrong.And yes, I&#39;m a manager.  And no, I never spent time &#39;[walking] the floors, “[keeping] an eye on people” and, in meetings, “[speaking] for the group.”&#39;&#39; because I have far far more important things to do, like helping my staff understand the corporate vision so they can make good, independent decisions; helping solve problems for my staff when they come to me with issues; working with our sales team to manage customer expectations and negotiate on projects and solutions; managing the expectations of senior management based on the information I&#39;m getting from my staff.  And the list goes on and on.But, who am I to say.  I&#39;m just a middle manager who is, I&#39;m sure, just part of the problem..."</p>

It specifies a granularity of points are allowed to be endpoints of a validity period, but these are still POINTS AFAICT.&gt; It means that, for example 10:00:01 is AFTER 10:00, even though 10:00:01 is not a valid endpoint of a validity period (and it doesn&#39;t have to be, as it is a measurement result, not a validity period endpoint).&gt; Does RFC or BR requires a browser to round down the measured current time to full seconds, before comparing them against the validity period?As a random member of the public, this seems like a reasonable interpretation to me... though the time format which expiry dates are required to be expressed in is explicitly not allowed to include fractional seconds... so maybe it is meant as an interval not a point in time."</p>

Apple built a platform, where they take some cut for themselves, while allowing other people to sell digital contents on their platform.Other than the argument that this could be an anti-trust situation (i.e. in that case, the argument would be that Apple is abusing their market position), what differentiates these two cases ?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Being a hedgehog is useful on the journey to domain mastery because sticking to frameworks saves you time and headache compared to not having any frameworks at all.The 3 stages of domain mastery:Stage 1 - No knowledge or structure to approach a domain (everything is hard, pitfalls are everywhere)Stage 2 - Frameworks that are useful to approach the domain (Map to avoid pitfall areas)Stage 3 - Detailed understanding of the domain (in which you can move through pitfall areas freely and see where frameworks fall short)Hedgehogs are at stage 2. You move from stage 1 to stage 2 by adopting frameworks; hence, hedgehogs are seen as &#34;thought leaders&#34; because they teach the frameworks that lead MOST people to more mastery. Except when you&#39;re at stage 3, in which case frameworks lead you to more inefficiencies compared to your own understanding.All good decisions must be made by stage 3 persons, but ironically, training is most efficiently done by stage 2 persons. Hedgehogs get more limelight because 90% of the population is at stage 1 and values the knowledge of stage 2 (and can&#39;t grasp the complexities and nuances of stage 3).Many hedgehogs struggle to touch stage 3, and instead see stage 2 as mastery. This is compounded by the positive feedback loops of success - the frameworks save time, it gives them reputation, it allows them to save stage 1 persons from their ignorance, and it&#39;s the foundation of their current level and achievements. Frameworks are also convenient and broadly applicable to many problems; detailed domain mastery in contrast is difficult, time consuming, and  highly contextualized.All of this makes it hard to move beyond stage 2 into stage 3."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s cathartic to read other people who have to go through this.I&#39;m fighting red tape for my team as we build out a dashboard.Outlook is packed with 1–2 hour meetings for the next 3 months where so far I&#39;m:* being asked to load test our system to make sure it can handle the load (of 3 people?)* being asked to integrate with various analytics platforms so we can alert some poor schmuck at 3 AM in case the API goes down then (it&#39;s not a vital part of any platform)* told to have this run in k8s since everything runs in k8s* other pedantic tasks by Sys Ops who think everything is a nail and love to argue their points ad exhaustium (or worse, argue why their fav stack is the golden child)I understand the need for standards and making sure they&#39;re followed, but there really needs to be a human element of, &#34;is this truly needed for what I&#39;m trying to do?&#34;. So many engineering departments are all about automation, but don&#39;t truly think through how much automation is needed, rather than a 1 size fits all approach.I appreciate that this article comes to the conclusion that the more correct an answer will be, the more complicated it tends to be. I wish more people in decision making positions would understand this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My leadership is constantly pushing for “hedgehog” style advice to be depersonalized, encoded in policies, and handed over to bureaucrats or automation to enforce.Trying to empathize with their position, I think they think failure happens because the right hedgehogs didn’t show up to the design review that day, or forgot to harp on whatever point that time. They are never satisfied with the “it depends, there’s no hard and fast rule, you have to let the experts think about it in context” responses I give them when pressed for policy. This is limiting my advancement. But worse, someday someone will join the team and will write those hedgehog policies, and then I’ll have to live under them too.Software engineering is a thinking person’s game. I get that management wishes it weren’t, but it is."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Quick links to the five &#34;must read&#34; posts that William highlighted:&gt; FFF #243 - New GUI tileset: Showing off their GUI design document. A MUST READ, if only for a good example of a comprehensive design style that fits the game theme perfectly. (https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-243)&gt; FFF #176 - Belts optimization for 0.15 : Incredible analysis of transport belts and optimizing their performance. A MUST READ. (https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-176)&gt; FFF #204 - Another day, another optimisation : Solid technical writeup on how a prefetching optimization patch works across a number of resource-heavy factory builds. A MUST READ. (https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-204)&gt; FFF #296 - All kinds of bugs : The snippet at the bottom is a perfect encapsulation of their attitude towards problem solving. It’s such a simple concept, just going a little farther, that can take tremendous discipline and focus. A MUST READ. (https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-296)&gt; FFF #356 - Blueprint library for real : Michal “kovarex” Kovařík, one of the two cofounders, talks about falling out of the development process, losing his sense of purpose, and how playing Factorio with his son brought him back. Reading this one, even through the sometimes-broken English, is inspirational and a wonderful look at how things fall apart and come back together. Like I mentioned in the intro, this is one of those rare, special offerings that is technical in nature but deeply personal and human-centric in form. A MUST READ. (https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-356)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been a huge fan of Factorio since 2014.A huge fan of the game, the team, and the entrepreneurial adventure.Their willingness to share insights, every weeks, for 7 years is quite rare in the industry.It was also awesome to read the thought process behind each design decision alongside some nerdy story about C++ optimization.Factorio team, if you&#39;re ready this, thank you!"</p>
