								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In extension to this news and the press conference, one thing I am super excited about, is the private SPARC project and the MIT-spinoff Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS). If you don&#39;t know about it already, I would highly recommend checking it out (e.g. by searching YouTube for &#34;MIT Sparc Fusion Reactor&#34; for some fairly accessible videos on the theory behind why they should achieve fusion way faster than the current roadmap with ITER and DEMO).In the press conference just ended, they repeated how exactly the JET reactor worked as predicted by theory. In my layman&#39;s understanding, for the exact same reason (seemingly very sound theoretical groundwork), the SPARC reactor should exceed breakeven within the next few years.From Wiki on CFS:* Back in September 2021, they built the strongest high-room-temperature superconducting magnet (20 Tesla) suitable for a fusion reactor* Theory dictates that with stronger magnets, the reactor can be scaled down (with the square/cube, can&#39;t remember exactly), and thus cost and time to develop* Back in November 2021, they raised $1.8 billion from the likes of Bill Gateshttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Fusion_SystemsBoy, do I think it would be crazy cool if they succeed, even taking twice as long as they&#39;ve planned! :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am a strong proponent of Fusion energy and did some work on the subject in undergrad.This is not a major breakthrough, it&#39;s a benchmark.A major breakthrough would be materials that could withstand the neutron bombardment longer, the ultimate limiting factor for fusion energy plants after we achieve positive net energy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; It&#39;s not a massive energy output - only enough to boil about 60 kettles&#39; worth of water.This made me laugh. How much more British can you get?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This kind of thing is why software I don&#39;t fully trust only runs in my browser.With how good the browser APIs have become, there is little reason to run native apps, which nowadays are often just an outdated browser with a packaged web app anyways (Electron). Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, and even Zoom have demonstrated that web is good enough if they want it.If you try to force me to install a native app, that&#39;s a strong signal that the app is going to do something against my interest. Given how aggressively Zoom has pushed the app, it was very clear to me that this thing is never going to hit my main machine (I think I have a VM somewhere that I used for a job interview that needed the more advanced features)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Pretty confident this is related to the way the Zoom app can detect what conference room you are in when that room is fully equipped with Zoom hardware.From [Direct sharing in Zoom Rooms](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/214629303-Direct-s...):&gt; Direct sharing with proximity detection uses the microphone on your laptop to detect the Zoom Room controller."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hope I’m pointing out the obvious, but the answer to this question doesn’t matter. The real problem is that we’re compelled to run a bunch of software from organizations we, to put it charitably, have no reason to trust.This situation may exist because it’s inevitable but it still sucks."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"From a press release geekwire got:    “Between 1/24-1/31, a radio station in the Seattle area sent image files with no extension, which caused an issue on some 2014-2017 Mazda vehicles with older software,” the Mazda statement said. “Mazda North American Operations (MNAO) has distributed service alerts advising dealers of the issue.”

    The statement goes on to say that “dealers are currently experiencing parts delays due to shipping constraints” and that MNAO plans to “support impacted customers with replacement parts. These customers should contact their local Mazda dealer who can submit a goodwill request to the Mazda Warranty department on their behalf, order the parts, and schedule a free repair when the parts arrive.”

    The Mazda representative did not reply to GeekWire’s follow-up questions about what actually malfunctioned in these vehicles and what parts would need to be replaced."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wow I thought this was going to be a subtle effect but I literally knew all of the male words and zero of the female ones (I’m male). What’s even the context of those top words? The male ones are tech/games/science but the female? I think I half recognize jaquard as a fabric or fashion term."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This startled me in the same way as a really excellent magic trick. You are convinced it&#39;s not going to catch you out, but then it does. I pride myself of having a wide vocabulary (or so I thought) and the premise sounded unlikely to me and yet I knew all the male words and didn&#39;t know the majority of the female words. What an eye opener!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a woman software engineer, and I recognize every one of those as a word, which I think was the criterion being measured. (There are a few on each side I can&#39;t define but have definitely seen.) I&#39;m mostly floored by how many of the textile words people here don&#39;t recognize, to the point of thinking they&#39;re &#34;fake words.&#34; Have you never shopped for textiles for your house or apartment? I mean, espadrille, sure, that&#39;s a woman&#39;s shoe guys might not ever see the word for. But damask? Jacquard? Chenille? Do you not have curtains or a couch?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s not unclear at all. It&#39;s Chinese data harvesting software. They&#39;ll do token public appeasement to avoid negative pressure, but every feature in the app is designed to collect biometrics and behavioral data.China is not a good faith operator. Given the data needed to influence public opinion and voting, they will engage in manipulation favorable to their interests. That alone is sufficient to run tiktok at a loss, but the market manipulation possible, advertisement platform potential, and other monetization makes it  look like just another app.Google&#39;s been caught red handed deliberately manipulating political content.https://mygoogleresearch.com/The idea that tiktok isn&#39;t used for the same type of manipulation is dangerously naive.There&#39;s a need for social media manipulation watchdogs that can monitor content being delivered to different users so the companies and countries involved can be held accountable.It&#39;s sad that a massively scaled invasion of privacy can only be countered by more surveillance. Because of the ephemeral nature of tiktok interactions, the only way to combat manipulation is to surveil the content being delivered to user feeds and compare subsequent opinion poling and purchases."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I found the actual report this is based on even more interesting:https://app.urlgeni.us/blog/new-research-across-200-ios-apps...Just a few of the highlights:Magazine apps had the highest number of total network contacts (28), and the highest percentage of third party domain contacts (93%)Social apps, followed by Games apps, made the fewest number of network contacts, 6 and 7 respectively.Apps making the most number network contacts included iHeartRadio (56), Wall Street Journal (48), ESPN (42), Popeyes (42), and WattPad (36)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like TikTok is significantly underdiscussed, almost like the tech and business press are assuming it&#39;s a flash-in-the-pan more similar to Snapchat than Facebook.  It is almost certainly having a major impact on the business of some of the most prominent publicly traded companies in the US, yet there are just a handful of articles discussing their impact on Facebook&#39;s disastrous quarterly results."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"US-based cis-hetero white man here. The data reinforce the impression you get glancing at the headlines or spending a day out anywhere in America observing other men. Dare I say it even reinforces what I know from painful firsthand experience as a man, at the lowest points in my life. I was lucky though, with a supportive family who helped me through the confusing years of early adulthood.You can point to the decline of organized religion and with it traditional gender roles, but then what explains the relative stability in post-Christian Europe? The China Shock combined with America&#39;s threadbare social safety net starts looking more salient. We have inherited a much less trusting, much more alienated society than you are likely to find overseas.Whatever the cause I fully reject the lazy conclusion this is somehow women&#39;s fault. The &#34;Lump of Labor&#34;  fallacy is just that, a fallacy. Economic gains are not zero-sum."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think a big part of the despair is the obvious difference between what children are taught is the american dream vs what the american reality is.We are told america is the best place on earth with all the doors open to you to be rich. That all other forms of government are flawed and we have excellence here everywhere you look.And then you look at reality and see something else. Sure there are pockets of excellence and the dream still lives in fits and starts, but for the general person, they are likely shut out from any real hope of this grand vision.You add in COVID and the lockdowns, and economic turmoil, and then people start realizing that the whole race is kind of pointless. I can be poor busting my butt at a crappy job i hate, or i can be poor moving in with family and being &#39;unproductive&#39; (for some definition of societal unproductivity).Women, on the other hand, haven&#39;t been given the same advertising on the American dream that men have, which obviously is a terrible thing, but in this one sense probably helped them survive and prosper even when life sucks in a modern world.I&#39;m supposing the sell-job of an equivalence of the &#39;american&#39; dream in other countries is not nearly so commercial, and blaring. And so kids are likely not so shocked at the difference between expectations and reality. Throw in that many other countries are flat out better in many social structural ways, and i think that explains why, it&#39;s especially troubling in America."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s strange to me that most of the comments here seem to be focused on gender relations rather than what the article was talking about - educational and occupational attainment. I don&#39;t think romantic aspirations have anything to do with why young men are not achieving. Rather, we have grown up in a fearful and repressive society, with 9/11 and the wars, 2008, Snowden, and now Covid. Many have grown up being drugged and told they are broken for behavior that was considered normal once. The broken economy that rewards only capital and resigns the rest to drudgery offers no incentive to participate or care. On top of all this, we are still expected to be &#34;men&#34; and never complain, never mention a feeling that isn&#39;t lust or grand ambition, and never show weakness. Faced with all this, why not drop out and find refuge in a bottle, pipe, or needle?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a partner of a person with a complete spinal cord injury, I appreciate these articles and the science being done by these researchers, it is truly a big and complex and worthwhile problem to solve.For most of us, I do want to suggest being careful when and how you mention research and articles like this to people in wheelchairs. Just be aware there are lots of different reasons why someone might be in a wheelchair and what can and can&#39;t be done for a given illness. It can be really taxing to get suggestions or shares of articles like this from well-meaning friends and family that don&#39;t actually understand the realities of living with an injury or medical issue that puts someone in a wheelchair.Obviously people should know work is being done. And obviously people might be excited to hear about breakthrough research. If you&#39;re inspired by articles like this, consider donating to the institutions funding the research. But, be aware that articles like this come out every year and for the vast majority of spinal cord injury patients it won&#39;t be available to them soon or ever.If you really want to support those in the accessibility needs community, support local building code changes and adaptive sports and outdoors programs. Making buildings, sports, and wilderness accessible will impact more people positively in the near term. The science is cool and amazing, but 100k people are limited by a few stairs to enjoy life and experiences with family."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In case you didn&#39;t know:American Institute of Mathematics is a research non-profit ran by one of the Fry brothers (of Fry Electronics).At least until recently, it&#39;s been run out of the back of the office space of their headquarters location on Brokaw road in San Jose.Now that the store (and the company) is defunct, I&#39;m happy to see that AIM is still kicking.Can&#39;t vouch for everything that they do, but they have been running pretty solid geometric group theory workshops on the reg. I got to attend one, and have good memories of it.I&#39;m still sad that the store has shut down. They cite COVID as a reason, but they&#39;ve been in liquidation mode long before that (at some point, I couldn&#39;t even get a USB flash drive there!). I hope that AIM will go on as a legacy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m just a lowly adjunct, but I sense that one barrier to open textbook adoption is the accreditation process. I don&#39;t know exactly the connection, but I get the feeling that the department can check some box if they say that all their lower division calculus courses are taught with Pearson&#39;s book, for instance. Sort of a &#34;no one ever got fired for choosing IBM&#34; type situation.Anyone have any insight to this? I only have a sample size of two... which leads me to believe not all departments worry about this so much.Edit: see these MAA guidelines: https://www.maa.org/programs-and-communities/professional-de...One suggestion is &#34;there should be established procedures for periodic review of the curriculum... should include careful scrutiny of course syllabi, prerequisites, and textbooks.&#34;As much as I hate to say it, there are legitimate reasons for carefully controlling the curricula in lower division courses. A big one is: transfer credit. People get pissed when it&#39;s difficult to transfer their cheaper CC credits to a larger university.The easiest way to solve these problems is by dictating curricula. But, unfortunately, the Pearson&#39;s of the world feast on the resulting homogenized market.This is similar to my problem with Common Core. Everything in Common Core is perfectly reasonable. But now we have one giant textbook market where Pearson dominates with their products which now bear a &#34;Common Core approved&#34; label on the cover."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who&#39;s never studied real math (only Physics math), I found the book &#34;Abstract Algebra: Theory and Applications&#34; extremely interesting, in part because it leads you to understand asymmetric cryptography and error-correcting codes. Also the SAGE exercises are neat.http://abstract.ups.edu/aata/aata-toc.html"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;If you’re curious why unionization has taken the journalism world by storm the last few years, you don’t have to look to politics or in-group signaling for an explanation, basic economics will get you all the way there.... You reduce quantity of labor supplied and end up with higher equilibrium wages for those who manage to get their foot in the door. Of course, this will only heighten the favoring of those who can get their foot in the $3200/mo Brooklyn rent door while dressing fashionably and using “semiotics” correctly in a sentence, but that’s neither here nor there.&#34;This is a cute theory, and tickles some people&#39;s ideological fancy. But if the author had done more research, they would know where the CWA-NewsGuild is actually doing most of its new organizing (hint: not New York), what sorts of contract articles they bargain around hiring, and what the status quo in non-union newsrooms is.In brief, the Guild has been organizing tons of local newspapers in small cities and rural areas, particularly those bought up by private equity firms who want to cut the newsroom to the bone. They bargain contract articles that curb the nepotistic in-group hiring practices common at non-union papers.Source: I&#39;m a former NewsGuild member, but at a software company, not a newspaper.Take a gander at the NewsGuild president&#39;s twitter account and you&#39;ll see many examples of these campaigns: https://twitter.com/gaufre"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not just journalists, but politicians, priests, etc. The filtered bubble of their society becomes the pole star of their existence, and the rest of the world gets devalued.Used to be, near any event that generates news coverage, there would be a bar where the journalists hung out. Listening to the conversations there would tell you what the story was going to be, as well as how it differed from the facts. The audience that mattered was the rest of the media clique; the actual paying &#34;audience&#34; was the chum that everyone took for granted."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What is the source for the claim that so many American journalists under 40 live in the area  encircled in the map in the tweet? The source for wages in journalism having gone to hell? The source for unions restricting the supply of labor? If so, why hasn&#39;t all the journalist unions he see forming already restricted the number of journalists and increased their wages?I also think the author&#39;s characterization job status is wrong. Journalists mostly hang out with journalists so whether journalist is a high-status job or not is irrelevant since they are all journalists. Working for Google has high status in some circles but probably not among Google&#39;s own employees. Furthermore, only a tiny fraction of all journalists write for the Washington Post or other recognizable papers. Not a lot of status in writing for marketing agencies or obscure trade press magazines."</p>

The program was &#34;slirp&#34; which was named after SLIP/CSLIP, but then upgraded to support PPP once that became a thing.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slirp"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Usermode WireGuard would be a big deal. I maintain a list[0] of tunneling solutions, and one of the only limitations of systems built on WireGuard is the requirement for admin privileges. Even with the performance hit from running outside the kernel, UDP-based tunnels have a lot of advantages for multiplexing channels. Pretty much your only mainstream options today are QUIC and WireGuard, and only QUIC is intended to run in userspace.I&#39;d have to dig into the details more, but something like this might allow you to implement a simple tunneling system based on WireGuard that runs in the kernel if you have the privileges, otherwise falls back to usermode and is no worse than QUIC in terms of performance. That would be awesome.[0]: https://github.com/anderspitman/awesome-tunneling"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This post pairs nicely with Julia Evans’ post on why most people use the Linux kernel’s TCP/IP stack and why a few others would bother with a userland stack.In her post she doesn’t mention fly.io’s motivation for doing userland TCP-IP: a nicer end user client experience.If I read this correctly then fly.io did all this work to make their CLI user experience markedly better. That’s pretty cool. Twist yourself in interesting knots to make your user’s lives better, maybe even in ways they won’t notice!"</p>
