								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like DataDog but it is prohibitively expensive for monitoring serverless applications, even with negotiated rates. I don’t think their sales team has identified a reasonable way to bill applications that entirety use serverless AWS services. We’re looking for alternatives. Paying for DataDog is many orders of magnitude higher than our AWS bill."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t know what other people&#39;s experience has been with DataDog, but the user interface experience I had with it was definitely reminiscent of something produced from a dog&#39;s rear end.Definitely a product where no one in the org said &#34;no&#34; to an idea.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I spent a lot of time on UI/UX design between 2004-2014 at Opera, the browser company (on the mobile browsers). Finding someone who was good enough at pixel level graphics design and was capable of iterating like us software people were used to was insanely hard, nevermind the complexities of the UI/UX designs.I think things have gotten a lot better since then. Now it&#39;s routine to see very well-designed apps (and sometimes even websites) from even relatively small national/local entitities that totally nail all three main aspects: GFX/UI &amp; UX (well, and sometimes even transitions/motion design). It&#39;s really impressive to see how the field has scaled up. I must assume that the various variants of education are working. (Northern European context.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m really curious about the sequel:  navigating through the ranks of a tech design Org.I’ve been a Senior SWE at FANG and have considered switching careers to design. My parents fed the family doing photography, I grew up from a design background, even spent a year in fashion design school part-time while I was a programmer at Google.Seeing the politics and the non-objective strifes in the design org at Google, the actual day-to-day of the job seems revealing offputting for me. This is obviously the bias of an engineer who has the privilege of focusing on concrete and mostly objective problems. The vast majority of my friends are designers, tech and non tech, and everyone is strong minded if not outright stubborn. For engineers, the strong mindedness can be resolved through logical arguments. With design a lot of it is intuition and/or unfalsifiable. UX research schools purport to teach quantifying and following the data/user, but the characters I know from design schools always think they know better. I can tell you the designers I met at FANG were data-driven 50/50 of the time. When they were data-driven, it was just confirming their own biases.I’m not saying there is no room for design intuition. That made Apple and it also got Snapchat pretty far, until it didn’t. Also Marissa Meyer era Google and, to some extent, AirBnB with their leaders being designers. But most of the salaried designers I met design out of ego and portfolio building, with service design for users being secondary. It’s arguably a harder incentive problem than with engineers. What’s changed in the tech industry since PG’s Painters and Hackers essay is that design is a lucrative job nowadays, and it attracts art snobs who a generation earlier looked down on engineers as poorly dressed nerds (and they still probably do). There are many aspects of design school such as critique and the self selectivity means some designers are arrogant, but the “niceness” culture of the tech industry forces them to hide it. With this is also a bit of art elitism, and so I’m curious about the journey of a self-taught designer through such ranks, now that actual design departments exist and it’s filled with art-trained designers rather than engineers with design sensibilities."</p>

					<h3><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/29/house-democrats-facial-recognition-act/">House Democrats debut new bill to limit US police use of facial recognition</a></h3>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This seems like a good rule. Warrants are good. Outlawing using it to ID peaceful protestors is good.While the points about facial recognition misidentifying black people are true, I&#39;d rather it rely only on the civil rights issues associated with it working and not tie it to misidentifying minorities. That&#39;s a situation where in 5 years &#34;it works on black people now, kay&#34; is the argument to overturn the law."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; It would also require police departments and agencies to purge databases of photos of children who were subsequently released without charge, whose charges were dismissed or were acquitted.Feeling weird about the notion that law enforcement keeps photos of children who have had run-ins with the law but ultimately weren&#39;t convicted of any crime. Why would they even need to keep such photographs? Data retention == legal liability."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The use of facial recognition has grown in recent years, despite fears that the technology is flawed, disproportionately misidentifies people of color (which has led to wrongful arrests) and harms civil liberties, but is still deployed against protesters, for investigating minor crimes and used to justify arrests of individuals from a single face match.I feel like I&#39;m the only peron where who doesn&#39;t see a problem with Police having access to facial recognition. Its not like anything used right now is accurate, eg eyewitnesses. If it really is unreliable it shouldn&#39;t be used as a sole basis to arrest people, I&#39;d expect a civil suit if that really happened. However just because some police mis-used it doesn&#39;t mean it should be banned."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you use Neovim, can you share why you chose it over VS Code, or one of the new terminal-based editors like https://helix-editor.com/, or new native GUI editors like https://zed.dev/ ?It&#39;s impressive to see what the Neovim community has built — preconfigured setups like https://nvchad.com/ are especially wild. But it still feels like a huge amount of work, hoop jumping, and _fragility_ just to reach parity with VS Code/Helix/Zed, which are pretty great out of the box, and which were built to be used as rich development environments instead of extensible text editors.I&#39;ve spent months tweaking Neovim/Emacs configs in the past and I ultimately end up conceding that I&#39;d rather spend that time hacking on projects instead of my editor config. I do feel the pull of these editors, though. I&#39;d love to understand what those who stick with them are doing differently, other than perhaps being more susceptible to sunk cost fallacies. :-)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Neovim is one of those things that seem maybe cool, but I just can&#39;t find a reason to switch. Vim works just fine for me, I don&#39;t know what I would be getting by switching, and I&#39;d probably waste some time porting my config and workflow to whatever the differences are (I&#39;m a heavy user of :terminal)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We recently started providing standardized neovim centric dotfiles setup to developers at our startup and this setup has improved productivity quite a lot.Our neovim &#34;distribution&#34; is highly geared towards our tech stack (Golang etc.) and provides fzf based command palette.See: https://github.com/fluxninja/dotfilesWe aren&#39;t using neovim&#39;s built-in LSP as we found it to be a bit immature.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; This wasn&#39;t obvious to the user because Explorer hides the &#39;detail&#39; of the file path and simply shows the usernameI really really dislike Windows when it hides paths, for example, &#34;My Pictures&#34;. Where the heck is that?This lunacy infects Windows applications, like Quicken and Thunderbird, which spew themselves and their data into gawd knows where hidden directories. Why can&#39;t they simply do the obvious? Create a \Quicken directory in the root, and have a \Quicken\program and \Quicken\userdata ? But noooo."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Give TestDisk a try. Years ago I have been able to use it to recover almost all files from a unreadable disk coming fom a RAID1 mirror gone bonkers due to a faulty controller.https://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDiskedit: oh, I just read that you mentioned TestDisk. Yes, it can recover the directory structure, at least it did in my case. After using it you will likely see that some files have been duplicated with a suffix added, like document.doc and document.doc.xyz (can&#39;t recall the exact suffix) in the same directory. In that case you need to check which file has been fully recovered, and rename it if needed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very important that you develop complete confidence that there isn&#39;t anything wrong with your product. It&#39;s not uncommon, in fact it&#39;s very common, for compromise kits for websites to take measures to avoid detection. A common one is only serving the malicious content when a specific referrer is present (I&#39;ve seen this be Yahoo Search in the case of compromised Drupal installations multiple times, not really sure why). It might be wise to engage a security firm to conduct an investigation if you don&#39;t have in-house expertise in this area. You should definitely review logs carefully for any unusual inbound traffic. Sometimes looking up your own domain on services like virustotal can reveal the problem, as it might turn up samples of malware retrieved from your website.I say this because I have been involved in this exact situation multiple times: website flagged by some or other security service, website operator has no idea why and insists it is fine, website turns out to be serving the landing page of a major pharma scam campaign unnoticed by the website operator due to anti-detection measures."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve noticed that the people running automated flagging systems seem to become inordinately smug to the point that they believe their false positive result over all forms of external evidence. So to them you are a criminal and that&#39;s that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As has already been said, there&#39;s a chance that you are compromised and don&#39;t know.  Obviously keep trying to contact MS, but in the mean time I&#39;d make as much sure as you can that they don&#39;t have a legitimate beef.If you&#39;re willing to share more details about your site such as your tech stack, we can probably give you more specific advice beyond &#34;check your logs for weirdness and hire a consultancy firm that deals with breach detection,&#34; though that is good advice.For what it&#39;s worth I went through something similar to this not too long ago, so I know how maddening it is.  My client never found any breach (though I did find some PHP library CVE&#39;s that could have conceivably been chained together to wreak some havoc), but I ended up rebuilding their prod environment clean and the flag went away on it&#39;s own after a couple days, probably because whatever malware was in there had disappeared."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Oh wow, this app got pulled from everything because it&#39;s an unofficial 3rd party client for Instagram?  I&#39;ll say it again, companies should be legally forbidden from blocking 3rd party clients.  They don&#39;t have to explicitly support them, but taking action to explicitly thwart them (and writing ToS that forbids them) should be outlawed.  There&#39;s no reason I should have to be subjected to untold tracking, snooping and advertising functionality to be able to post or look at photos and comment on them.  Tech companies get to exploit the public under the guise of something useful, while also getting to completely dictate the terms of that usage.  The only thing that limits their exploitation of users is the laws applicable in the relevant jurisdictions (and sometimes not even that).  Too bad looking out for the rights of users is apparently just a complete non-issue to anyone in power."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Privacy proponents should cheer for this. Legally Meta must take down the app to comply with FTC&#39;s order (obligatory not a lawyer):
https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2019/07/ftcs-5-bi...&gt; Another way the FTC says Facebook violated the order was by failing to adequately assess and address privacy risks posed by third-party developers. Other than getting developers to click an “I agree” terms-and-conditions box when registering an app with the Facebook Platform, Facebook didn’t screen developers or their apps before giving them access to massive amounts of data that users had designated as private. Of course, in the wrong hands, information like that can grease the wheels for identity thieves and fraudsters.&gt; The order imposes additional requirements to address Facebook’s illegal conduct. For example, Facebook must implement a stringent program to monitor third-party developers and terminate access to any developer that doesn’t follow the rules.https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2019/07/ftcs-5-bi..."</p>
