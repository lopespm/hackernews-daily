There are plenty of other choices out there when it comes to infrastructure services so this isn&#39;t &#34;deplatforming&#34;. I sympathize with people that are not pro regime but ultimately even those tax dollars they may generate go to the regime. We have people on the ground in Ukraine being bombarded now non stop. I cannot with good conscience continue to support the Russian regime in any way, shape or form. People that are getting angry need to point that at the cause, their own government. If more grace time is necessary for some to move, we will provide it. Free speech is one thing but this decision is more about a government that is committing war crimes against innocent people that we want nothing to do with."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a non-russia customer, I am inmediatly  moving all of my domains I host at namecheap to another provider.this kind of stuff from private companies are useless, and downvote me all you want, they do not work, and dont come to lecture me from your SF desk while im living in a sanctioned country, how did the 2017-2019 sactions for Venezuela worked? Everyone in the world moved on and even forgot about our country, and the comunist regime is more alive than ever, all the sactions just fucked the regular people like me, for example my gf is still explaining after 2 years to those idiots at transferwise support that her money sitting on their super awesome &#34;no borders account&#34; has nothing to do with the venezuelan govt and that it&#39;s from her US based remote job but they just decided to steal over 22k USD from her solely based on her citizenship. Or should I tell you how stripe completely killed my friend&#39;s startup by suspending their accout because they had venezuelans IPs and venezuelan citizenship and aparently they aren&#39;t able to check that they (normal citizens) arent the people on the OFAC list, (like 5 names LOL)So yeah, dont mind me, get your likes, get all the nice advertisiment you want while prettending you are helping and is nothing more than a PR move while messing with normal people with normal lives, struggling everyday but you won&#39;t get me as a customer anymore, we are all suppose to be professionals at our tech jobs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was surprised by this, until I realized that one of Namecheap&#39;s offices is in downtown Kharkiv. Today, the Russian military bombed Kharkiv with cluster munitions [1]. Civilians were killed, possibly including children [2].Given the severity of the situation, I&#39;m surprised that Namecheap has not opted for more drastic measures- for example, redirecting Russian web traffic. Simply transferring Russian businesses to other providers might be among the less-drastic options they considered.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e42F1V3AOq4&amp;t=150s[2] https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/02/28/kharkiv-rock..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My entire team of software engineers are Ukranian, residing in Ukraine (I&#39;m not in Ukraine, nor am I Ukrainian).For the past few weeks our &#34;water cooler talk&#34; has been almost exclusively about the rising threat of invasion, if not directly about the ongoing conflict in the SE of Ukraine. A number of the team signed up for the volunteer defence force and have spent countless weekends training with the army.The morning of the invasion I received early morning messages from a few of the members to the effect of &#34;Russia has invaded. We are going to fight.&#34;I have never sent such an emotional and heart felt &#34;Good luck, stay safe&#34; in what is such a vacuous and empty medium (i.e., a messenger client) before. I haven&#39;t been able to produce anything since the invasion began because I am constantly watching the news and various social media feeds for updates on the invasion, and it&#39;s really hard to pick up a full (now absent, mostly) team&#39;s efforts without metaphorically dropping bits all over the place.My work, and that of my team, it just.. doesn&#39;t matter in comparison. My boss is asking for progress updates and I&#39;m just responding &#34;Nothing. The guys are focussing on staying safe, warm, and well stocked right now.&#34; (with a small side of incredulity.)I&#39;ve brought it up with leadership and they are going to parachute in some agencies from other places and I can&#39;t help but feel we are just abandoning my team members. The people I have, on average, spent 5x8hr days working with for the past few years. My comrades. My friends. Just so expendable in the eyes of my employer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am American, moved to Kyiv almost four years ago.  My startup engineering team is 100% in Ukraine. As the warning signs mounted I urged my people to consider leaving but no one, myself included, thought it would come to this.  Of course no one left.I finally agreed to take a couple of weeks out of Kyiv to calm my cofounder’s nerves, sure that I’d be back and we’d have a laugh at how it all came to nothing. So I am in Tbilisi and my team are all stuck in Ukraine.We’re doing all we can to help   We can’t get the men out because the Ukrainian borders guards won’t let any men leave, and most of the women won’t leave their husbands behind. A few have joined the territorial defense forces and are defending Kyiv now. Many others are taking shelter in basements while the Russians shell their cities.Today, 66% of my 45 person team were online and working. It’s astonishing the grit and commitment the Ukrainians are showing. We’re resolved not to abandon them and to do all we can for them but the shitty reality is that’s just not a whole lot right now.If anyone can fight their way to victory in this war it’s them. I wish the west had done more when there was still time to make a difference, but now it’s up to Ukrainians to save themselves and make the Russian invaders pay for every meter they take."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As if the pointless prodding of “any updates? :)” is ever called for. If there were any updates, there would be fucking updates posted. I frequently get comments like this in projects they I maintain, sometimes less than a day after the issue was opened, and it does nothing but annoy me and make me not want to resolve their issue. Why is there an expectation that maintainers have infinite amounts of time to fix whatever problem you’re having? Extremely frustrating and makes me hate working in open source."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"DIY Perks [1] has a good tutorial on how to make a super bright LED panel from LED strips. Quite easily, actually.Been using one of those in my office for the last eight years or so. I use a server PSU for power.I was surprised to see how bright it is when I once went outside while it was on. Not only was my window the brightest in the entire street by far. But it actually illuminated the trees around my window.If I was to build it again - and especially for a place like living room - , I would build it so as to also simulate sunset. That is to say, that it will automatically lower the brightness and shift to a warmer spectrum in the evening. Otherwise, this thing messes with your biorhythm and gets you out of sync with normal daylight hours very quickly.[1] https://youtu.be/jLia59KfkSw"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I lived in Seattle, my solution was a 2’ square fluorescent panel I got from a gardening supply place called “The Indoor Sun Shop”. I grew up in the South and got real bad seasonal depression up there; it probably saved my life. I paid all of $300 for it. Plus like twenty bucks for a mechanical timer, because I discovered that there were a lot of mornings where I was too depressed and mopey to turn it on myself. I kept it in the home office I worked in and it did a lot to shut up that little voice that suggested killing myself as the solution to every problem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m from India. Lighting in my middle class house, since forever, has been poor. I never consciously felt it when I was still studying. Just that the rooms were dark and I would prefer to play/study outside, or in the front room, where the door was always open, allowing a lot of sunlight.I realized the lighting factor a few years back. Now, My own home has two lights in every room and whenever I am studying/reading/cooking, I always have them both on.The difference is stark. Perhaps I am clutching my pearls when I say this, but I feel my quality of life has improved with better lighting.I also got my walls painted with very light colors, and the ambient light is just amazing.Good lighting is a blessing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is cool! As someone who&#39;s into fine dining, a few thoughts/tips for people starting out:1. Don&#39;t go into a michelin level restaurant expecting &#34;well it&#39;s expensive so it should be what I normally eat but better&#34;, think of it as its own category of food, that happens to have a really high buy-in price. Lots more crazy flavors, presentation, exotic ingredients, etc. It&#39;s not that it has to be &#39;better&#39; than the best $12 bbq joint you&#39;ve ever been to, just different.2. Many very high end restaurants have great lunch deals, which can really cut the price to try them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m so glad this was a positive story, and I&#39;m so happy for the author! I went into it expecting this restaurant to be mocked, since articles like this are usually played as a joke.No, not everyone can afford to try a Michelin Star restaurant. A lot of Michelin restaurants suck. And you don&#39;t have to pay a ton for a good meal; some of the best food I&#39;ve ever had has cost $10.However, food is right up there with music as something that connects people. A taste or smell can unlock a memory you thought you lost forever, or create new ones you&#39;ll never forget. There&#39;s a reason meals are so prominent in movies and literature. Not everyone is lucky enough to have a good relationship with food (in fact, for many, the connotations can be quite negative), and I&#39;m so happy for this person that she loved it.When done right, nice restaurants are an experience. From start to finish, from the food to the drink to the decor to the people, it&#39;s closer to going to a Broadway play or art museum than it is a normal meal.For people who can afford it readily, the experience is almost lost. It can become a status symbol, where the Instagram story is more important than enjoying it. It was so charming to see this through the eyes of someone who had no pretentious goals going into it, and had a wonderful time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I was in Italy with my brother back in 2019, we mostly ate at cheap local spots to keep costs down. But towards the end of the trip, I said lets go get some amazing food, regardless of cost.We walked into this little Italian restaurant, ordered an expensive Merlot and a tomahawk steak to share. First the wine, &#34;holy shit&#34; was the exact words I used when I first tasted it, super smooth, to the point where you couldn&#39;t feel even the smallest bit of sting from the alcohol.Then the steak, the tenderest steak I&#39;ve ever had. You cut of pieces of fat and as soon as you put it in your mouth the thing just melts away.In the end dinner set us back 250 euros, and much like this lady, I walked away going &#34;that was worth every penny&#34;. Food like that isn&#39;t just about the experience, it&#39;s also the memory. That dinner I had is now almost 4 years ago but I still remember the wine and the slightly salted steak kisses fingers like an italian"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I do see a point in it working like it does, though. I&#39;m one of the lead developers on a free software project with over 20 years of history. Even though the project has used multiple version control systems (and hosting providers) over time, we have imported our entire project&#39;s history going back to the very  first commit into git and GitHub.Not every contributor has kept their email address for over 20 years. Some don&#39;t have access to the old addresses they once used for commits. Still they want the commits to be associated with their current GitHub account; even if it&#39;s just for statistics and &#34;bragging rights&#34;.If GitHub required email address verification, how would this be done?EDIT: To be clear: With &#34;working like it does&#34; I&#39;m referring to the possibility to add unverified email addresses to your account and have commits attributed to you."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In spite of GitHub&#39;s claims that nothing wrong, something is wrong and fixable.GitHub should be showing the identity pulled from the e-mail address, and not replacing it with the name of an associated GitHub account. Just like it does when there is no associated GH account.A reasonable compromise would be to show that name, but turn it into a link to the account if there is one. Then only someone curious clicking on &#34;Linus Torvalds&#34; would see: hey, how come this leads to some VanTudor account?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"GitHub’s response is pretty surprising. How can anyone think this is expected? Having to follow Git’s commit message emails makes sense and indeed anybody can use any email they want to make a commit. But then for GitHub to make the connection between (unverified) commit emails and (unverified) GitHub.com accounts is the issue for me. Since they can’t verify the commit email belongs to a GitHub account, why show that as though it were true?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There is an interesting fork of LFS that uses Musl instead of glibc.https://github.com/dslm4515/Musl-LFSI played with it for a while as the base OS for my KVM hypervisor servers.A couple of years ago, I tried to find all the source archives for the old LFS releases. I ended up using the Debian and kernel.org archives to find most of the old package versions. Packages from before 2004 started disappearing like as86 and the PowerPC patches. I was never able to find the PowerPC patches because they were never mirrored on anything but FTP sites. The Internet Archive did not pick up any of those mirrors.
https://archive.org/details/linuxfromscratch-releasesI eventually replaced the Musl-LFS build and replaced it with a buildroot set of configs and scripts when I had issues replicating my work with later package versions. Buildroot allowed me to more rapidly test and deploy my hypervisor config.  I wanted a simple /etc/rc init like what was in SunOS 4, no GRUB, and QEMU with VDE networking.I ended up with SYSLINUX for BIOS MBR and gummiboot(before it was converted into systemd-boot) for EFI because my EFI machine (Dell R810) did not allow for direct booting of EFI binaries."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"LFS is great to learn how a Linux based system works without all the sweet, sweet magic modern distributions give us.On a personal, nostalgic, note: running LFS on your laptop in my university was the ultimate Linux nerd cred. A step below, immediately following, there was Slackware.The reason I feel confident enough working with Linux today is because I started back in the early &#39;00 using Slackware, which recently had a new release[1].Don&#39;t get me wrong, compiling your own kernel, solving shared libraries compilation hell, messing up your init.d and starting over, leaving your Pentium 4 compile for several hours was a massive waste of my 20s.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Appreciate the effort the article author put in, but I&#39;ll be contrarian here (in the hopes of saving people time) and say that I think this is the wrong approach to take to getting hired (the effort:hire ratio is terrible).I don&#39;t know why, whether it&#39;s to be fair or avoid litigation, but in most companies I&#39;ve worked for or interviewed with, the senior engineers, hiring managers, HR, etc. don&#39;t have as much influence over the hiring process as you think. You&#39;ll probably still need to go through 5 stages of interviews, including a white-boarding or a take home test. Otherwise you wouldn&#39;t have all these &#34;rockstar&#34; programmers on Twitter complaining about the interview process. The best that these &#34;influencers&#34; can do for you, is to tip you off to an opening and maybe help towards the end of the interview process.The other issue is, how do you know you&#39;re betting on the right horse? e.g. is the person that you&#39;re getting cozy with really going to help you career? You only have so much time and &#34;connections&#34; to invest.My advice: instead of going to meet ups, take more interviews and improve your interviewing skills. Instead of spending 2-5 hours/week going to meet ups, take 1 interview instead. Even with no preperation, you&#39;ll start to see the pattern in the types of questions people ask. Improve on your answers. Interview again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is probably good general advice for getting comfortable in a crowd and starting conversations, but I doubt such &#34;networking&#34; has as much to do with getting a tech job as people like to think.In my 2+ decades of experience on both sides of tech recruiting, getting your foot in the door is always the easiest part of the process. Apply online at the company&#39;s careers site. Get an existing employee to refer you (literally anyone will be more than happy to do so for the bonus). Message a recruiter on LinkedIn. All of these will get you at least a screening call. From then on 100% of your hiring chances are dependent on your resume and interview performance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It’s clear to me that the author is introverted as in shy, not introverted as in neurodivergent; there are so many “why don’t you just ____?” and maybe there’s an audience who hasn’t tried that and would adjust well to the advice, but I’m definitely not in that audience.My advice to anyone who feels the same way: let yourself shine, make the social connections that feel comfortable for you, and… hopefully you’ll have the same privilege I have in being able to stand out just by being your awesome self. The job market is competing for you, not the other way around."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I once was part of a now-defunct reading forum in my teens.On the forum, people would package three related books into quests. A boring example would be a dystopian quest pack with three books about three very different dystopian scenarios.But the quests people put together were usually more interesting. I remember a &#34;Weird Magic&#34; quest had books with really unconventional magic systems. I found Motherless Brooklyn (detective with Tourette&#39;s) in a quest pack of &#34;heroes with issues&#34;. Other quest ideas would be evil protagonists, alien first-contact with the wrong guy, and stuff like that. You can often find three books for even the goofiest of quests.It was a cool way to find new books. And whenever you didn&#39;t know what to read next, you&#39;d look at what quests you were still working on and choose among them. Once finished, your completed quest count would increase.Long append-only lists of genre-related books were never as interesting to me. Quests only having three books made them a fun thing to collect. Maybe there&#39;s something fun there that new goodreads competitors can experiment with."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very interesting... some feedback.So I search for &#34;Proust&#34;, and the top 8 results are not Proust. Since Proust has one extremely famous book, I thought it would show up, rather than a bunch of different commentary on Proust.So I finally find the page for In Search Of Lost Time. However, it says none of my friends have read it. Well, of course not - I don&#39;t have any Booqsi friends yet. So, there&#39;s just nothing I can do on this page.Next I looked for The Power And The Glory. At least this page has a summary of the book. But, also none of my friends read it, and there&#39;s nothing I can do here.Next, Consilience. Same thing. Basically I search for a book, I get maybe nothing, maybe a summary, and then there&#39;s nothing else I can do on that page.So, I want to like this site, but I&#39;m just finding nothing I can do here.Personally, I love books but I hate Goodreads. I just don&#39;t care that a hundred thousand random people prefer The Twilight Saga Complete Collection to The Death of Ivan Ilych.I would be really interested to read a well-written paragraph that said, hey, if you like Nabokov and Borges, then you might like this other author. That sort of recommendation is what I occasionally get from reading blogs or tweets from people with a similar literary taste to mine, and it&#39;s very useful, I find most books through some sort of recommendation.Goodreads has this mistaken idea that I care about the average person&#39;s opinion of a book. A book is not a can opener. Everyone wants to open a can, everyone opens cans in the same way, everyone appreciates a can opener that successfully opens cans.Anyway, I hope you do succeed in building a Goodreads alternative, because I would love to spend more time reading about books, reading good books, discussing books, and Goodreads is just not providing that experience."</p>
