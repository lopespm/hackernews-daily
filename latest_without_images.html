His lawyer had already turned up his nose at &#34;Cadabra&#34;, and Jeff was looking for something else.It&#39;s also worth noting that the idea didn&#39;t grow over time - Jeff always intended to build something like &#34;Sears for the 21st century&#34;.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; This journey began some 27 years ago. Amazon was only an idea, and it had no name.Jeff&#39;s pitch at the time (1997); so on point, so precise: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWRbTnE1PEM&gt; The question I was asked most frequently at that time was, “What’s the internet?” Blessedly, I haven’t had to explain that in a long while.Here&#39;s Jeff explaining the Internet (at a TED talk): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMKNUylmanQ&gt; Invention. Invention is the root of our success. We’ve done crazy things together, and then made them normal... If you get it right, a few years after a surprising invention, the new thing has become normal. People yawn. And that yawn is the greatest compliment an inventor can receive.Jeff speaking about innovation, invention (based on first principles), making data-driven decisions (and also when to not trust data), learned helplessness at Stanford (2005): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhnDvvNS8zQ&gt; When times have been good, you’ve been humble.Heh. Reminds me of this 2008 lecture where Jeff is selling AWS to startup school students: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nKfFHuouzA Classic.&gt; Amazon couldn’t be better positioned for the future. We are firing on all cylinders, just as the world needs us to.Not sure about that last part, Jeff.So long, and thanks for all the fish."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I don’t know of another company with an invention track record as good as Amazon’sCome on man, that&#39;s just bs.
From wikipedia:&gt; Researchers working at Bell Labs are credited with the development of radio astronomy, the transistor, the laser, the photovoltaic cell, the charge-coupled device (CCD), information theory, the Unix operating system, and the programming languages B, C, C++, S, SNOBOL, AWK, AMPL, and others. Nine Nobel Prizes have been awarded for work completed at Bell Laboratories."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"According to a post in the comments, the author is 18 years old which means that I&#39;ve been using Linux longer than the author has been making use of the blood in his veins. But that does not mean that I didn&#39;t learn something from his post!While the technical accomplishments and understanding are commendable, I think that the main takeaway for me is the excellent approach to learning. Keeping it simple and taking an open-minded approach to learning (as exemplified by his attitude toward systemd) is an approach that more people could stand to take. So often we complicate things in our heads to the point where they seem unknowable and so we assume that they are too difficult and we don&#39;t try. I have seen this in myself at times and I see it others as well.I&#39;ll be sharing this post at work so that the people who I work with who don&#39;t really understand Linux so well can appreciate the approach that was taken and hopefully also glean something from the excellent write-up itself."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another more Linuxy-Thing to try: build a pam (authentication/authorization/etc) module to embed your own secret or come up with a fun/unique way to enter your password (e.g. you can not login unless you plugged your headphones in, etc :) )This makes you very aware of the way login works in linux and teaches you how to compile your library as a shared object conforming to an interface. Of course, you should be aware that you just baked your own security mechanism, so use it that way and better avoid using it for anything sensitive :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; In the case of Wayland, the “vague authority” are a bunch of volunteers who have devoted tens of thousands of hours of their free time towards making free shit for you.That does not mean anyone is under an obligation to like it.&gt; Maybe Wayland doesn’t work for your precious use-case. More likely, it does work, and you swallowed some propaganda based on an assumption which might have been correct 7 years ago.If you insist on disregarding people&#39;s use cases, don&#39;t be surprised they don&#39;t like your software. I&#39;ve been down this road a lot with FOSS software: &#34;I don&#39;t use it because it doesn&#39;t do what I need&#34;, &#34;sure it does!&#34;, &#34;no, it really doesn&#39;t&#34;, &#34;well you don&#39;t need that anyway!&#34;...On the whole however, I can certainly understand the frustration at having to deal with a community that gets annoyed at anything that changes simply because they&#39;re already so used to the garbage pile they have that they now hold the delusion that it&#39;s actually not garbage.In my admittedly somewhat distanced opinion, Wayland&#39;s biggest mistakes were not launching with a coherent strategy for replicating functionality like screen sharing, screenshots, and to a lesser extent remote desktop/applications. They just punted and said &#34;that&#39;s a compositor problem!&#34; as though that was supposed to make it ok. People have thus harbored some inherent resentment ever since."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have no beef with Wayland specifically and I agree that if you are harassing maintainers of any project you&#39;re probably an asshole. However,&gt;Maybe Wayland doesn’t work for your precious use-case. More likely, it does work, and you swallowed some propaganda based on an assumption which might have been correct 7 years ago.I&#39;m a game developer. None of the software I use works reliably or at all on Wayland. None of it. And I&#39;m completely fine with that, I&#39;ll keep using Xorg and you can give me a call when my &#34;precious use-case&#34; is handled."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m using a Dell UP2718Q (3840x2160, 144dpi, 60Hz) and a Fujitsu Siemens P17-2 (1024x1280, 96dpi, 75Hz) side by side, and without Wayland this setup isn’t even possible to get working properly. Sadly, KDE still doesn’t support it nicely under Wayland (so I moved to Ubuntu Budgie), but under X11 it’s entirely impossible to run it properly, as except for Qt nothing supports mixed DPI, or mixed refresh rates properly.Once proper wide color gamut and bitdepth support is added, it’ll be even better, as the monitors are 10-bit Rec.2020 and 8-bit sRGB. Which under X11 isn’t even possible to support, as again, Xorg only sees one single screen it’s drawing on, and it’s up to the lower levels of the stack to split that.EDIT: Answering the most common question which is asked all the time as my comment is getting some visibility here:Now why does wayland break screenshot and keyboard tools? Because &#34;every program is a keylogger by default and can see any event, look at the contents of any window&#34; is a major security issue, especially as it means the entire security model of screen lockers or containerized applications is useless.Under X11, basically every application you run can trivially escalate itself to root. As even your Zoom client can just listen to your key events when you unlock your screen or use sudo in your terminal, save your password, and tada it can elevate itself. Under X11, there is no security whatsoever, and no separation of privileges.EDIT2: Why is sandboxing applications important? (a) more and more proprietary software is also released for linux, which you probably shouldn’t trust. And (b) if e.g. your XMPP client is compromised, you don’t want the attacker to gain root.EDIT3: Yes, screenshot tools and screensharing still works. I can use KDE Spectacle under Budgie or Chrome, and Slack, Teams, Discord, Jitsi all work just fine. OBS requires a patch, but also works nicely. It’s not impossible, it just requires software using it to be updated."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I review a lot of technical software documentation. This is one of my go-to resources for explaining how docs should be organized. These ideas are generally accepted among software technical writers; you may just hear them use slightly different words for each doc type. E.g. I use &#34;overview&#34; instead of &#34;explanation&#34;. I&#39;ll also mention that this framework isn&#39;t comprehensive; there are other types of critical documents that aren&#39;t explained here, such as release notes. I think the key breakthrough with Divio&#39;s framework is getting authors to think about docs in terms of desired goals and outcomes: learning-oriented, problem-oriented, etc.Edit: I suppose you could argue that release notes fall under the category of reference-oriented, but when I look at the guidelines for reference docs it&#39;s clear that the Divio people were thinking about API references."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of the origin of this work is from Jacob Kaplan-Moss who did the original refactor of the Django documentation. He wrote up the concepts here in 2009:https://jacobian.org/series/great-documentation/Daniele Procida built on this and formalized it through this resource, which is really amazing and definitely the best resource for writing docs that I know of."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been working on an ongoing rewrite for the Redux core docs [0], including writing a couple brand new comprehensive tutorials from scratch [1].  In the process, I collected a bunch of notes and resources on useful docs writing advice [2].  My two favorites by far are this Divio docs writing guide, and the Vue docs writing style guide [3].  Excellent resources![0] https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/issues/3592[1] https://redux.js.org/tutorials/index[2] https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/issues/3609[3] https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/contributing/writing-guide.html"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Sites are not detecting a portrait screen and deciding that they&#39;re displaying on a phone.  Someone who switches their monitor to portrait, or resizes a window to be taller than it is wide, is still going to get the desktop view.In this case the author is scaling their resolution, and so their browser is presenting itself to sites as 720px wide.  Sites see that and show a layout optimized for a screen of that width.  Those sites are acting correctly.The author&#39;s proposed solution is for sites to use DPI instead, but this would thwart the preferences of users who use scaling because they want the whole site to look bigger."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like I must be missing something, because I don&#39;t understand this author&#39;s point at all.&#34;Lots of websites think “Vertical Screen == Mobile User”!&#34;
No, they don&#39;t - They think a 720px wide screen is a tablet user, which is probably a fair assumption.I could equally write &#34;Just because I browse zoomed in 500% doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m on a mobile&#34;When you zoom in, things get bigger, so fewer of them will fit on the screen... You have a choice between horizontal scrolling, or the website showing you the version of itself designed for smaller viewports.Looking at the &#34;How it should render&#34; screens - I just checked the Guardian site, and that is exactly how the website looks at 1080px wide. The author admits that because of their zoom solution they are running at an effective width of 720px, so maybe just.. don&#39;t do that??The proposed solution doesn&#39;t seem to solve anything, because physical size of the screen isn&#39;t the full story, it also depends on how far away from the screen the user is - which the browser can never know."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a product manager, my immediate response is... not worth the time.You&#39;ve chosen to have a unique setup, which is fine, but your use case represents some absolutely miniscule fraction of users. On top of that, it&#39;s not even that websites are unusable, just that they&#39;re not ideal.When you decide to do weird/special/unique stuff, don&#39;t expect the world to adapt to you. You can rotate your monitor back or live with it. The idea that companies should spend engineering/QA/PM resources to deal with this is... vain."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The author&#39;s success commercializing something that he needed chimed with me.I feel like this is a common thing - kinda like the old adage you&#39;d hear at school that goes something like &#34;if you have a question about something, chances are at least a couple of other people in class have the same question&#34;.I wonder how many startups that are &#34;think of it as an uber-for-....&#34; are there because of actual genuine &amp; real needs that people have, or just that people think will make them rich.A decade-plus ago I was in the same situation as the author - a problem that I had and no obvious simple solution that I could find.  I ended up admitting that the thing I was looking for didn&#39;t exist, so I made it (website in this case so very small risk/outlay).  It made a boat load of income from ad revenue back when CPMs were better (still exists these days but revenue is way way down on what it was - perhaps less than &lt;5% - and my regular work salary these days  totally eclipses even what it was at its peak anyway).There must be so many of these sorts of stories on HN - someone scratching their own itch, only to find out that others have the same."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just read your whole journey since quitting google and it was very inspiring, thank you :) Glad to hear you still feel like it was the right choice.
I am now where you were 3 years ago: I just quit my well-paid SWE job without any concrete backup plan and all I have been dreaming of for years is being an entrepreneur.
It either happens now when I&#39;m still young, or never, I figured.However, I am still quite unsure how to actually get the ball rolling. 
My current game plan is to just brainstorm for a week or so and then start building the best idea I came up with during that week, then give myself a release deadline of one month for an MVP and see if I can raise some interest.But after reading the paragraph about ideas[1] I am not sure anymore if this is a smart approach or not... 
What do you think, what&#39;s the best thing to do to get to that initial spark?[1]: https://mtlynch.io/solo-developer-year-2/#pursuing-the-right...(sry, non-native speaker)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Regarding the first paragraphs where luddism is mentioned several times; Lord Byron, father to Ada Lovelace the first programmer, was one of the few on the House of Lords to defend the Luddites:&gt; But the police, however useless, were by no means idle: several notorious delinquents had been detected; men liable to conviction, on the clearest evidence, of the capital crime of poverty; men, who had been nefariously guilty of lawfully begetting several children, whom, thanks to the times!—they were unable to maintain. Considerable injury has been done to the proprietors of the improved frames. These machines were to them an advantage, inasmuch as they superseded the necessity of employing a number of workmen, who were left in consequence to starve. By the adoption of one species of frame in particular, one man performed the work of many, and the superfluous labourers were thrown out of employment. [...] These men never destroyed their looms till they were become useless, worse than useless; till they were become actual impediments to their exertions in obtaining their daily bread.There is a lot of proganda use of &#34;luddites&#34; as anti-tech when luddites main grief was regarding income and inequality.[1]: http://www.luddites200.org.uk/LordByronspeech.html[2]: https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/byron-was-one-few-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A comment I made on this when it was posted a few days ago:I am surprised that this was regarded as a close decision. I guess a lot depends on wording, but when one person is predicting the dollar will be worthless, and the person in the role of judge claims that given global economic uncertainty, it&#39;s a &#34;close&#34; question, I wonder if they&#39;re just saying that to be diplomatic.Obviously there&#39;s a lot of uncertainty, but one way to think about it, is that it can get so much worse than it currently is. And it seems like the predictions being wagered over were pointing to the &#34;so much worse&#34;. I think the same holds for the environment, and for the proposed war between rich and poor.I get the temptation to treat those as close, because there&#39;s tensions that you could imagine leading to some worst case scenarios. And so one might want to acknowledge the tension, and you want to put that acknowledgment into some sort of partial credit. But I think that way of thinking gets all confused and hair splitty, and comes from a place of thinking everything&#39;s a trick question, and not wanting to be perceived as overlooking nuances.Anyhow, credit to all parties involved for formalizing their discussion and getting a bet out of it. I think those kinds of conversations are valuable, and I think it helps to get people thinking about what it takes for beliefs to be true over the long run."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Has Tech Destroyed Society?I recently watched the documentary The Man Who Saved the World[0], about Stanislav Petrov, who one day in 1983 made the decision to ignore the early warning system computers telling him the USA had fired 5 missiles at the USSR.[1] It seems had he followed orders, a report to his superiors would have resulted in mass retaliation. The decision was in his hands.In the movie, as well as a reenactment of the incident, the real Petrov visits the USA to speak at the UN, and visits Kevin Costner, his favourite actor. Costner asks him how many people would have died if not for his actions that day. You expect him to say millions.  Petrov explains that everyone on the planet would&#39;ve died.They visit a disused missile silo in the USA and Petrov explains to a guard there that just one of those missiles had more explosive force than all the weapons used in WW2. According to this page[2], in 1985 the USA had 21,000+ nuclear weapons, USSR 39,000+.It&#39;s very chilling, to say the least. It makes humans seem so very crazy, to create the possibility of that situation in the first place. Petrov explains emotionally to the guard that the Russian people wanted peace, and thought the USA wanted to attack them.I can&#39;t help thinking about that, reading about Whether Tech Has Destroyed Society?[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_Who_Saved_the_World[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983_Soviet_nuclear_false_alar...[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_nuclear_weapons_sto..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Anybody knows if Scaleway it&#39;s better than the parent company?I was an online.net costumer for a lot of years for a personal project, and a happy one, but then they changed the contract unilaterally, which included the billing going up almost 75% with another changes in the ToS. And look I get it, sometimes prices rises, and you can always change providers, so the problem was not that... but the customer service and poor communication.I only notice the change, after my credit card notified my of a higher charge than the ones I&#39;m used to. There was not notification about it in the dashboard. And after a lot of tickets with representatives, they told me under the excuse of &#34;ram / hdd prices are going up&#34; the notice was send through email, and probably gmail mark it as spam... and then the nightmare to cancel begin.After telling them to cancel the account, they told that under the new contract (that I didn&#39;t accept) they could only do it if I got charged another extra month, even if from the start you always payed one month in advance, plus paying the setup fee at the beginning.Look I get it, hardware it&#39;s messy and prices can go up to stay in business, but this attitude of &#34;I am altering the deal, pray I don’t alter it any further&#34; was the one that made me look for another solutions, and be skeptical about Scaleway despite in paper being a good alternative to Digital Ocean (that let me tell you, DO customer service it&#39;s gold in comparison to what I got from online)."</p>

But as others have mentioned, I&#39;ve found it extremely difficult to understand specifics of the proposal or to see concrete progress, based on publicly available resources.The best place I&#39;ve found is Ruben Verborgh&#39;s blog (he&#39;s a researcher who&#39;s affiliated with Solid). For example here&#39;s a nice post which goes into more detail on the ideas behind Solid:https://ruben.verborgh.org/blog/2017/12/20/paradigm-shifts-f...2) In terms of applications, I&#39;d personally like to see more of a focus on productivity applications, rather than so much focus on social media. Better interop between cloud SaaS apps would be valuable to businesses and professionals, and would sidestep many thorny challenges like decentralized moderation.As a concrete starting point: what if I could store my Google Docs text files on my own storage layer, and edit them in realtime using a variety of editor apps? This would resemble my ability to edit a .txt file on my computer in vim or TextEdit, but would port that metaphor to the world of modern online collaboration.Here&#39;s a short Twitter thread I wrote on this topic:https://twitter.com/geoffreylitt/status/13552551626260684823) I&#39;m very curious to see more incremental paths from the current web to a decentralized approach. For example, what if we could start annotating existing websites with private data and sharing those annotations P2P, rather than starting over from scratch?I&#39;ve explored this a bit with my Wildcard project, where users can store annotations in a &#34;spreadsheet&#34; that is linked to a web page:https://www.geoffreylitt.com/wildcard/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Every now and then this gets shared again and every time I am struck by what a terrible job the front page does of explaining what Solid is and why anyone would want to use it. Like, okay, yeah, &#34;control my own data&#34; is a nice pitch in this day and age I guess, but... what can I do with it? &#34;Any kind of data can be stored in a Solid pod, including normal files like you might store in Google Drive or Dropbox&#34; - that sounds kinda useful, where&#39;s the link to SolidFile? Is there even a SolidFile app or is that just a thing someone could make with this protocol?Hell, where&#39;s the front page link to check out the list of any apps using Solid? It&#39;s like two or three random clicks to find this page (https://solidproject.org/apps) if you are curious, and it&#39;s super uninspiring - why does one of the apps in the &#34;Showcase&#34; section at the top not even have a description?Solid always just feels like a solution looking for a problem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This post[0] by Ruben Verborgh helped me understand the problem Solid is trying to solve:&gt; In December 2019, Google and Facebook proudly announced a major milestone, which was echoed in news media all around the world: it is now possible to copy a picture from Facebook to Google Photos. This news came in mere months after we celebrated the 50th anniversary of another technological feat: the moon landing of 20 July 1969, when millions of households witnessed Neil Armstrong take a giant leap for mankind.&gt; So let me get this straight: two of the largest tech companies in history make headlines because in 2019, they move a single photo over the whopping distance of 11 km it takes from the Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park to the Googleplex in Mountain View, whereas in 1969, we sent live video signals from 380,000 km away on the actual moon?&gt; If those two companies, both widely hailed as pinnacles of technology, genuinely consider this to be innovation they are proud of, the only logical conclusion is that data-driven innovation today is fundamentally broken.&gt; The problem is widespread and not limited to technology or social media. Any sector that requires personal data to deliver services, from retail over insurance to health, suffers from the damaging effects of siloization. Companies increasingly need more access to data, but they won’t get there if they keep on collecting that data themselves.[...]0. https://ruben.verborgh.org/blog/2020/12/07/a-data-ecosystem-..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is mostly nonsense. There is nothing wrong with there being more shares short than shares outstanding. It just seems problematic, until you think it through.Person A has 1 share of company Y. Person B borrows 1 share of company Y from person A, and then sells it into the market. This is called a short sale. But person B just sold their borrowed share. Now that share is owned by person C. Person C can now lend it back out to person D, or to person B again, and the process can repeat infinitely. The idea that short interest is constrained by shares outstanding is just a fundamental misunderstanding of how the short market works.Shorting behaves the same way that fractional reserve banking does, and there is a &#39;money multiplier&#39; like leverage effect in the process. There is nothing nefarious about this, and it certainly isn&#39;t &#39;countfeiting&#39;. Short sellers provide an important service to capital markets, maybe the most important service: they help to identify mismanaged or fraudulent companies. The idea that attacking short sellers is attacking wall street is completely backwards. Most of Wall Street hates short sellers, because they drive down the prices of companies and confidence in markets (in the short run, in the long run, they increase it)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, it seems like none of the top commenters here have put in at least minimal effort to read and understand this.The author does not complain about short sellers per se or about the fact that more than 100% of a stock&#39;s float can be shorted. That is all nice and fine. Instead what the author does complain about is that fact that the (supposedly regulated) mechanisms for shorting a stock are fraught with loopholes and exceptions that make it possible for brokers and the DTC to create stocks &#34;out of thin air&#34; for the short sellers and never neutralize. This dilutes the company&#39;s stock in the process and thereby damages the company&#39;s shareholders.It is an issue that, if true, should absolutely be brought to public and regulator&#39;s attention."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author seems to be really upset about this, but I don&#39;t understand why. Nothing they are describing, if you ignore histrionic language like &#34;counterfeiting&#34;, seems especially nefarious. Maybe I am misunderstanding. Basically, a short is when A borrows from B a share of corporation C with the promise to return a share of corporation C at a later time, plus some cash interest. A naked short is where instead B gives cash equal to the value of a share of corporation C minus some interest to A, with the promise that at a later time A will deliver a share of corporation C to B. The second activity seems functionally equivalent to the first, and I don&#39;t understand why I&#39;m supposed to be outraged by either."</p>
