								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think a proper way to solve this issue, not specific to python but languages running in a VM in general, would be to have some sort of language support where you specifically define what access rights/ system resources you allow for any given dependency.Example of defining project dependencies:  {
    &#34;apollo-client&#34;: {
      &#34;version&#34;: &#34;...&#34;,
      &#34;access&#34;: [&#34;fetch&#34;] // only fetch allowed
    },
    &#34;stringutils&#34;: {
       &#34;version&#34;: &#34;...&#34;,
       &#34;access&#34;: [] // no system resources allowed for this dependency, own or transitive
    },
    ...
  }

It would probably require the language to limit monkey-patching core primitives (such as Object.prototype in javascript),
and it would be more cumbersome for the developer to define the permissions it gives to each dependency.
These required permissions could be listed on the package site (eg npm or PyPI) and the developer would just copy paste the permissions when adding the dependency.
But if you upgrade a dependency version and it now requires a permission that seems suspicious (eg &#34;stringutils&#34; needing &#34;filesystem&#34;), it would prompt the developer to stop and investigate, or if it seems justified add the permission to &#34;access&#34; list."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In a previous HN discussion on the topic of rogue Python packages, readers had suggested bubblewrap and firejail for sandboxing. They limit the access a script and its packages have to your filesystem and network.I think that&#39;s the better approach - just assume all packages are malicious by default. Can&#39;t rely on scanners because of the large number of packages and attacks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I started to develop only inside VMs, with a full Desktop, IDE, browser etc. inside the virtual machine.There have been to many contaminations of major package repos lately. Only one typo in an import statement up the dependency chain and you’d be compromised."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"For some of us (me included) living in a racist society is like a fish swiming who does not notice water.  I only noticed when I became intimate with a person from a minority race and saw how they were treated.  That is when I noticed I live in a racist society.I love the economist.  Their writing is so good, they are biased but know it, and acknowledge it.  Biased, but not bigoted.  nYet this article misses the point, IMO, or racial quotas in professional schools.  They have the liberal individualistic bias, and have not noticed that one. It is their water  (I am a liberal myself, but I have had that particular bias removed by my experiences.)Here (Aotearoa) the point of quotas is not to allow some groups the same access to the privilege of the profession, but it is to help the consumers of professional services get what they need.For doctors, lawyers, architects, accountants (yes) etcetera being from a similar community as your clients is very helpful for your clients.  This is not a benefit to the individual professional, it is a benefit to the community.There is a secondary benefit to the professions themselves.  A cultural milieu helps bring new ideas forward.Whether or not the system in the USA is fit for purpose or not, I do not know.  But when deciding I hope the American judges think not, only, of benefit to the individuals but the wider effects on our communities."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the most pernicious consequences of this fixation on race is the definition of a person by an arbitrary social construct. Although they all check the same box, they have very different experiences and cultural backgrounds:* Black descendents of slaves vs African immigrants [1]* Chinese Americans vs Hmong Americans (a higher poverty rate than Black Americans! [2])* A Korean who grew up in Koreatown LA vs one who grew up in Utah* A Boston Brahmin vs an impoverished White Virginian whose family members were targeted by eugenic boardsThat said, Affirmative Action can reasonably make those from marginalized groups feel more welcome. In elementary school for example, I felt very out place among the largely affluent members of my accelerated math class. By contrast, I related much more to the mischievous truants who would later go on to be low-level criminals.[1] - https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/24/us/top-colleges-take-more...[2] - https://tcf.org/content/commentary/misleading-data-policies-..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For the youngens here on HN: TomTom was once one of the leading manufacturers of GPS navigation systems for cars - purchased as an accessory that was stuck to the wind screen. This was in a time before every car had a screen built in, and before everyone had a smart phone with Google Maps in their pocket.I guess that product is a prime example for becoming irrelevant by society progressing. I actually still use an old TomTom in my old car that doesn&#39;t have a screen (well, it does, but didn&#39;t come with a GPS built in - adding it after the fact would have been around 1000£), since I don&#39;t have a smart phone. But it has been years since I updated the maps, probably wouldn&#39;t even be supported any more?!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked at Tele Atlas/TomTom until 10 years ago. There is literally nothing new in this announcement except that they are going to &#34;steal&#34; data from OSM now.sensor derived data, user generated content, camera vans all of that is not new. All this existed when I left, so did the people mentioned in this announcement that are still running the show. I always hoped they would eventually realize that they need a fresh top management, but they seem to just keep doing the same old stuff with the same old people until the final collapse of the company."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Of all the fundamental shifts in my life that smartphones have enabled, having an ever-present map with GPS has been subtle but gigantic. I (we?) interact with cities so differently now"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I see what this app is about but at the same time it enforces information overload which is an instant turn off for me. What&#39;ll happen if I were to use it: I&#39;ll pile up more and more stuff I&#39;m interested into, I&#39;ll receive news about all things I&#39;ve subscribed to and eventually I&#39;ll get annoyed from the &#34;spam&#34;. Then I&#39;ll unsubscribe realizing that information overload can&#39;t be handled with apps, I have to solve that problem in my head. In the mean time Obsidian does the job for me if I&#39;m really really interested in something - I write it down and it&#39;s still not 100% that I&#39;ll come back to it later. That&#39;s a no go for me with all the apps that are used to create a &#34;personal encyclopedia&#34;. Engineering wise I can&#39;t say anything but good about the app. Keep it up someone might see things in a completly different way that me, there still might be a big market for this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This seems really well built. It&#39;s fast and responsive. It looks nice. But I just don&#39;t understand what I would use it for.It seems like the idea is to build a database of people, movies, Wikipedia articles and such and then be able to find them via search/links. But I&#39;m not at all sold on why I need this in my life.Is there a way to make the value clearer? Am I just not in the target audience? Who is going to see this and say &#34;TAKE MY MONEY&#34; and why?I&#39;m thinking of products that were instant sign-ups for me...Spotify: For one price, listen to all the music on Earth whenever you want. TAKE MY MONEY!Gmail: Fast email with 2 GB storage. This was such an instant sign-up they had to make an invite system to slow people getting access.Maybe could add something like Lichess: Chess training and games, with modern UX, offered open source as a public good. I mean, if you&#39;re at all interested in chess, that&#39;s an instant sign-up, right?Trying to say, this idea of presenting a clear value isn&#39;t limited to big players like Spotify and Gmail, but can also be done by smaller companies if the value presented is really clear.What should someone see that makes them instantly recognize they need this in their life, because that&#39;s what I&#39;m totally missing here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s a beautiful branding. The UX seems to be very intuitive. I would love to try it without registration. Since you store the data in the browser, have you considered offering a fully offline version that doesn&#39;t need registration for users to get hooked? I would like to postpone syncing until the data becomes valuable.To me, it would also be important that the data is stored in an encrypted form on the server and that the key remains in the browser and has to be stored by me.Personally, I would like to have the option to discover people who work on similar notes, think travel app [1] for mental journeys. It would also be nice to have some social features like voting on links or sharing notes or sets of notes so that others can annotate them. Bonus points if those social features use an open protocol so that users from other note taking apps can join.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33344734"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is Bart, Proton CTO here. For clarity, the issue mentioned here only impacts Proton Mail Bridge, our desktop IMAP/SMTP gateway to Proton Mail encrypted email.The fact that Bridge and its client can become desynchronized sporadically for some users is a high priority issue we have been working on. Bridge is open source, and as a result relies upon open-source components, and the root cause is an architectural issue in a library that Bridge uses to implement IMAP. When there are network issues, this library returns errors to email clients.Unfortunately, there are hundreds of email clients, and some email clients don’t handle errors properly, and this leads to desynchronization.Our error tracking shows this does not happen often (1-2% of Bridge users) and the symptom is usually incorrect display of messages or read/unread status which is fixed with an inbox resynchronization. There are cases where a combination of a desynchronized mailbox and a specific series of user actions can lead to accidental email deletion, but this is far rarer than desynchronization. Our implementation tries as hard as possible to avoid this. If you find you are missing an email, our implementation works around the issue by placing it in a users’ All Mail folder.As Bridge is open source, updates on this issue have always been publicly posted on GitHub. Addressing this issue at the source requires replacing the core IMAP library. Unfortunately, there are no FOSS IMAP libraries that are sufficiently well maintained. Therefore, the solution is to build our own IMAP library called Gluon, which we have been focusing on since this issue was reported to us. You can follow the progress of this open-source project here: https://github.com/ProtonMail/gluonWe are not refusing to fix the problem. The only possible solution is writing a new open-source IMAP library which we can maintain ourselves to ensure this class of errors cannot occur again. We have doubled the size of the team working on this this year so it is a priority for us.We’re confident that this addresses the main sources of desynchronization and will be available in the beta version of Bridge by the end of the year."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For a bit of context/back-story, Richard, who opened this issue, later also wrote a blog post about the whole ordeal:https://blog.sigma-star.at/post/2022/07/protonmail-adventure...In short: The idea was to move from a custom mail server to a paid, hosted solution. ProtonMail was chosen, with the bridge being used to get mails into a local mail client. Issues with the bridge eventually cropped up."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I didn&#39;t know what exactly is proton mail bridge. This is what I&#39;ve found:&gt; Proton Mail Bridge is a desktop application that runs in the background, encrypting and decrypting messages as they enter and leave your computer. It lets you add your Proton Mail account to your favorite email client via IMAP/SMTP by creating a local email server on your computer.Source: https://proton.me/mail/bridge"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I find uncanny about this is how closely this resembles random philosophical/artistic discussions one can find on YouTube - or even what I encountered in college dorm rooms.It&#39;s in fact the illogic of the conversation that makes it more realistic. The reality is that in many deep conversations, people talk about a shared topic, and sometimes even make a coherent point, but also tend to frequently talk past one another and fumble with the thoughts they are trying to convey.Even as as we listen, we don&#39;t focus on each word with the same degree of emphasis, but rather highlight those parts that are most salient to us while thinking of our own response."</p>

Every such scheme has generally failed because they refused to emulate the one key piece of California law that is necessary for a startup ecosystem to exist – banning noncompetes.&#34;But I&#39;ll spend money to train my employees and they&#39;ll just take those skills to go work for a competitor or start their own business!&#34; Yes, that&#39;s a feature of the system, not a bug."</p>

Not to mention you’ve only programmed on Mac/Linux so far &amp; windows is totally different, has a different compiler, different ways to install libraries, different C++ standard features supported, etc.I like C++, and tooling has come a long way, but it’s so much easier to download rust/Python/node and you’re basically set on every platform &amp; immediately ready to go.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who has been painfully self-teaching C++ for the last ~1.5 years on and on, these are my hangups:- The features that make C++ decent are often found in C++ 20/23, for which there are woefully few resources- Code taking advantage of coroutines and generators isn&#39;t commonplace yet, rare to find examples- C++ 20 concepts are a near mirror copy of Rust Traits and enable composition that&#39;s an alternative to inheritance, again difficult to find examples of- C++&#39;s way of &#34;implementing&#34; interfaces (IE iterator&lt;T&gt;) by having a magic defined set of type aliases and methods is not intuitive for me- Writing code to control things like parallelization and thread scheduling that&#39;s portable across libraries is difficult. I think std:: executor is supposed to fix this but if I&#39;m manually scheduling threads and I want to use IE oneTBB it&#39;s not obvious how to do this.- Dependency and package management is a nightmare. Need to condense CMake + vcpkg into a Cargo like tool and make it a standard- error messages are indecipherable. GCC 13-dev colors make this a bit better but human-written &#34;ELI-5&#34; errors succinctly explaining the problem and suggesting a solution (like Rust)- flags like &#34;-fsanitize=address,leak,undefined -fanalyzer -Wthread-safety -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=&#34; should be baked in to a default &#34;dev&#34;/&#34;debug&#34; mode newbies shouldn&#39;t need to know/think about- Profiling and instrumenting/monitoring should be a few CLI flags with nice UI visualizers (IE LLVM X-ray)- I have to Google what headers cstd/std stuff comes from half the time"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The most sensible use for AI that I can see at this time is for supporting humans in their work, but only where the system is set up so that the human has to do the work first, with the AI system looking for possible errors. For example the human drives the car, and the AI brakes when it senses dangerous conditions ahead, or the human screens test results for evidence of cancer and the AI flags where it disagrees so that the human might take another look. The opposite scenario with AI doing the work and humans checking for errors as is the case here will lead to humans being over reliant on less than perfect systems and producing outcomes with high rates of error. As AI improves and gains trust in a field, it can then replace the human. But this trust has to come from evidence of AI superiority over the long term, not from companies over-selling the reliability of their AI."</p>
