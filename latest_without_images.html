								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Regarding questions in the comments: Assuming allotments in .dk works roughly as in .se, they are designed not to be actual homes.You&#39;re not allowed to use them as your listed place of residence; authorities require you to have a &#34;real&#34; residence as well. This can of course be circumvented by claiming you live with a friend and listing yourself at their address, but it&#39;s illegal and measures will be taken accordingly if you&#39;re found out - you&#39;ll surely lose your allotment, if nothing else.Allotments are concentrated to specific areas, typically on municipal or county land rented by a co-op consisting of the inhabitants. Nowadays, most co-ops have installed municipal utilities (water, electricity) but not plumbing for human waste, which means most of them still have outhouses. Outhouse waste management is of course also heavily regulated. Often these utilities, at least water, are turned off during winter.The permanence of allotments is fleeting; many of them are continually moved or chopped off in order to make room for actual residential buildings. They are however very popular among apartment dwellers who move out to their cosy little allotment houses at the first sign of spring.Regarding the OP, nice work! Looks great."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice little house!
I did exactly the same, with the same costs, and lived there happily for several years during my studies at University. It was a great time and a good place for a single young man with a dog.I used a wood burning bath stove with a 100 liter copper tank to store heat for the night. It worked great. The 100 liter of water kept heat for many hours and the tank surface radiated it slowly into the room. This was much more convenient than a simple wood stove. I had only to add wood one time per day in autumn and two times per day in winter."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is the first time I&#39;m hearing about the Framework laptop and… damn, it looks enticing.Unfortunately, 13&#34; is definitely too small for me (in terms of ergonomics). Are you planning on releasing models with a larger (and matte) screen in the future?Also, could the keyboard &#34;module&#34; in theory be fully customized by the community (so as to support ergonomic layouts similar to ErgoDox, include a trackpoint etc.)?Finally, why only 4 expansion slots? AFAIU there&#39;s no Thunderbolt card(?) yet, so I need every USB slot I can get my hands on and 2 (4 - 1 HDMI or DP slot - 1 PowerDelivery slot) would definitely not be enough!"</p>

The DIY kit instructions and the construction of the machine itself are very well thought out.I am very excited for a future where we can measure the lifespan of our personal electronics in decades rather than months.Congrats to the Framework team!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I see the founder @nrp replying to a few comments here.@nrp, can you comment on upcoming models? Would love to have a 15&#34; or 17&#34; model with the same swappable ports but with a beefier processor and much larger memory capacities.The larger frames might allow for more ports, but I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;re limited by the number of PCIe lanes on these processors.I think a Ryzen offering would also be welcomed.Lastly thanks so much for this product and for first-class Linux support."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Lenovo left a sour taste for me after they pushed a BIOS update through Windows Update on my daughter&#39;s Flex that bricked the device (in the middle of a school-week, while she was doing online school).There were dozens of reports of the same problem from other owners of that model, yet they refused to acknowledge the issue was theirs or offer any self-serve option (I remember most laptops nowadays can re-flash the BIOS from an attached USB with specific format and layout, but I presume they saved a couple of cents by removing that feature from the Flex models). Luckily the laptop was still in warranty and I got it &#34;fixed&#34; after 6 weeks, but will never purchase another Lenovo product again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Gentle reminder that Lenovo jumped the shark quite a while ago. The whole Superfish debacle, the spyware, the crapware, the endless stream of shitty decisions. Year after year, the hardware gets worse. Customer support gets worse.The sad thing is that they&#39;re still better than everything else out there. Which says a lot about the laptop industry in general."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I recommend Schmidle’s recent book “Test Gods” if you are interested in Virgin Galactic and test piloting. Schmidle is not an engineer and I would have enjoyed a deeper dive into Virgin Galactic’s design choices, but it is a great book about (among other things) the tensions that emerge when a complex technical project is overseen from a distance by utterly nontechnical, PR-oriented upper management. The company’s communications and business strategies make a lot more sense knowing that the people calling the shots do not comprehend in the slightest how their product works.For many reasons (some alluded to in this article, many more in the book), SpaceShipTwo is an inherently risky experimental test craft—with death always waiting on each side of a narrow envelope—and it always will be. Management is willfully ignorant of this. Engineering leadership has done what they can to make the vehicle safer (at the cost of performance), but the intractable issue is that any one mistake by a pilot is likely to be fatal (and already has been, in the 2014 accident). Voices like Stucky and Ericson who wanted to acknowledge the inherent danger of the vehicle (which doesn’t mean grounding it) have been ignored and ultimately removed. The company’s business requires the vehicle to be understood to be safe by the public. The chickens will come home to roost."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Brilliant well written article. Not without bias, but you can see through the words on the page and into the immense pressure that team at Virgin Galactic must have been under to get their boss into space and to beat Bezos, all for the inflated ego of one man. Branson did put his life on the line to achieve that accolade though, which was a gutsy move."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; “ A private program can’t afford to lose anybody,” Branson said.Worth noting that Virgin Galactic is currently the only private space program to have killed anyone so far. This quote is from before the fatal 2014 crash, but the FAA makes it pretty clear that a virgin galactic had a cavalier attitude towards crew safety[0] back then too. Combined with this article, that paints a picture of Virgin Galactic as a genuinely unsafe company that is going to kill a lot of people if it’s not stopped. Manual processes, no safeties, high pilot work loads, and rockets do not mix well.0 - This was caused by a design that explicitly assumed that highly trained test pilots were incapable of making mistakes.  The design required manual activation, had no failsafes, and the pilots were not told that activation at too low a speed would cause the vehicle to break apart. A breathtakingly bad design for a spacecraft."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Mozilla VPN advantage: a company far more reputable than almost any other VPN provider for doing all the things people say they want a VPN for.Mozilla VPN disadvantage: Mozilla is probably far less tolerant of all the things most people actually use a VPN for."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;FVP-02-014 General: Cross-site WebSocket hijacking (High)The provided staging build contains the Mozilla VPN WebSocket Controller, which exposes a WebSocket endpoint on localhost. No additional authentication is required to interact with this port, thus allowing any website to connect and interact with the VPN client. At the beginning of the audit, Mozilla assured that this WebSocket server is only part of the staging build. However, later it was revealed that Mozilla would like to reuse this connection for communication with a browser extension in the future. Thus, Cure53 decided to report this issue.&#34;A classic one.Also interesting:&#34;On Linux and macOS, a helper shell script is called by the privileged daemon which sets up WireGuard and network configurations. This script is extremely critical for security and should normally get most of the security attention. However, prior to the test, Mozilla has announced that it will be replaced soon and, as such, does not warrant substantial reviewing efforts. This - in Cure53’s opinion - is rather unfortunate in relation to its criticality. Cure53 therefore recommends that the upcoming changes get comprehensively reviewed in terms of security before they are shipped in production releases.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For me, Erlang was the ladder to functional programming. Once I’ve mastered Erlang to be able to write gossiperl (http://gossiperl.com, not maintained in a long time), all immutable programming became easy. Maps, flat maps, recursion, no side effects, all became clear.After Erlang, I’ve enjoyed Scala a lot. Especially Akka.I do tons of go now and when I need actors in go (not very often because channels are rather straightforward), I use proto.actor: https://github.com/AsynkronIT/protoactor-go.Erlang is awesome. I can definitely recommend the “Designing for scalability with Erlang/OTP”: https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-for-scalabili.... This is the book which finally made me “get it”."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I gotta say I really enjoy these blogs. This and the Go one are really well done. Stylistically I love the look and the art is great too!Then the content is enjoyable, and the length of the posts seems just about right too.Where do I subscribe?Also, technically speaking, having shipped Erlang a few times in 3 different products (although all of them were between 2000 and 2010), that I&#39;ve had the least amount of trouble developing them the REPL experience is (was?) awesome with all the Emacs integration. The ability to basically shell into a remote node and poke around live was extremely handy.People didn&#39;t like the binary logging but it seems systemd forced it down their throats anyway later. Also, I provided really easy tools to read the logs using the runtime, so they didn&#39;t care much in the long run.It was really easy to write pipe drivers for programs written in Haskell, Python and C++. I even used the Java integration back then.OTP was like a dream come true, and when you&#39;re building out an SNMP MIB, MNesia made that so stupidly easy - I couldn&#39;t believe how much faster I was going than the folks trying to plug into NetSNMP.I wish I was still working on that project sometimes. It was my favorite."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I found this to be an accurate write up, though my experience has been Elixir, which inherits all of the traits of Erlang (to my knowledge), most notably the BEAM / OTP.Side note: That&#39;s a really cool graphic that looks to be Joe Armstrong, Robert Virding, Mike Williams with telephones? Where&#39;d that come from?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I went down a similar hole with a UniFi Dream Machine.udm-utilities [0] basically allows you to run all kinds of stuff on it through podman.Went from trying to teach it to mimic my ISPs router to get internet working, to banging my head against IPv6 prefix delegation, to now running adguard, homebridge and a bunch of other things across different VLANs on it.All in all, I am happy with the result, and happier that I got dragged out of my progrmaming bubble to learn proper networking with IPv6.[0]: https://github.com/boostchicken/udm-utilities"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve gotten into networking and very much enjoy seeing how others approach the problem space at the scale level! It&#39;s gotten more important with not just the explosion of online threats, smart home devices etc., but also just because there is more and more value to be extracted from a high bandwidth WAN link via your own private services. That said I definitely strongly recommend against using anything UniFi based for routing/gateway tasks at this point (author mentions their AIO custom hardware UDM thing). They have significant issues now in WiFi and even switching, but at least remain kind of workable there. But the company has been an absolutely depressing development dumpster fire for years now and the trajectory still appears aimed straight down. And for whatever reason routing/gateway in particular is an area that only ever briefly got much oxygen there. So for a greenfield situation I&#39;d be wary.There are lots of enormously better solutions for that. Personally I&#39;ve dumped all my UniFi gateways (including some of the &#34;next generation&#34; ones I had for testing) and moved to OPNsense running on decent SuperMicro 1U edge systems (excellent value, quiet, regularly available dirt cheap on ebay and the like). But there are many great options there including VyOS, OpenWRT, or even just running straight OpenBSD if that&#39;s what you like. Router/gateway is one area where I thinking devoting real metal, preferably with higher reliability hardware and extra remote management options (like IPMI), is worth it. It&#39;s an important linchpin for a typical network, and while virtualizing it is possible and definitely desirable at large scale it&#39;s not where I want to add more moving parts without a team behind it. Everything else can go tits up while I mess with it or there are odd interactions and as long as the gateway/routing is still solid odds are I can recover without much disruption or having to physically be there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For anyone who wants to go a similar route I can highly recommend OpenWrt as the OS. Not only does it run on cheap routers, but also on big x86 machines and even in VMs and/or containers. For example, I run OpenWrt on my desktop in a LXC container to manage networking (Wifi, bridging firewall for bridging VMs into the network, general firewall, etc.) through the nice webui. It gets direct to access the WiFi adapter and the host gets access through a bridge connected to the container via a VETH interface.It comes with nice addon packages for stuff like Wireguard, all kinds of tunnels/VPN, adblockers, runs containers and a ton more. I even run it on a VPS as container with it having exclusive access to the &#34;physical&#34; NIC. The parent OS isn&#39;t directly accessible at all. Makes firewalling a breeze. The only open ports are for the Tor relay and Wireguard, through Wich I connect to the webui/ssh and do everything else.Of course, my router also runs OpenWrt..."</p>

I remember regularly using AOL&#39;s built in web browser (which was just a wrapper around IE) to surf the web. The reason my family switched away from AOL was because we could get faster internet through our cable company. It had nothing to do with FTP, fingering, or &#34;discovering the world wide web&#34;.&gt; The business people decided that there should be a way to make something like AOL, even though everyone thought Web sites were amazing and didn&#39;t want to go back.Again, this just doesn&#39;t line-up with how I remember things.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It seems like I completely mis-remember things...IIRC, in addition to being an &#34;online portal&#34; to online content, it was also an ISP. Back in those days, most internet access was via a Dial-Up modem. If you wanted to get online, your computer had to make a phone call. Where we were, dialing outside of the region defined by our prefix (the 3 numbers after the area code) was considered a &#34;long distance call&#34; and was like 10 cents per minute or something. Connecting to the internet ran up your phone bill ~ fast! if you did not have a LOCAL ISP. IIRC (which is questionable), AOL had toll free numbers, but they&#39;d charge you for your time online - so your internet bill came from your ISP only and not from ISP + Phone Company. Part of AOL&#39;s marketing gimmick &#34;first 1,000 hours free!&#34; or some such amount of time to get you to sign up.This was nearly 30 years ago, and I didn&#39;t really understand how it all worked back then, and my parents paid the phone bills (not me!) so my recollection may be full of partial-truths or downright falsehoods. But point being - I think the article really understates AOL&#39;s role in being an ISP (especially for rural folks who didn&#39;t have local ISPs)."</p>
