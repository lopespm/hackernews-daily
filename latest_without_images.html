								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We are seeing a long term consolidation between hearing devices and headphones.On the headphones side, we are getting smaller, truly-wireless headphones with some ambient sound features (such as noise cancellation, and iOS hearing features). New trends like AR would just accelerate the change due to the need to solve all day worn audio devices.On the hearing aids side, almost every hearing aid today acts as an always connected set of headphones for your mobile phone (and has been like that for years on iOS).Deregulating this could bring the tech industry innovation to hearing aids through natural progression of headphones technology.This trend would make hearing aids not just target hearing impaired people, but also individual with normal hearing. For example, features such as protecting your ears against a sudden loud noise, silencing a loud restaurant so you can have a quiet conversation or improving the audio of a soft speaker could be useful for everyone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"How much would you pay for:*Hearing test* Hearing aid fitting* Usage counselling* Follow up adjustments* Annual retest of your hearing* Replacement of lost hearing aids* Unlimited repair for 3 years
??======
I got out of the Audiology field in 2015.
At that time all the above was included for every hearing aid we sold (Prices varied from $750 / ear - $3600 / ear.When I was in that field many companies tried &#34;pay as you go&#34; models, instead of bundles.You know what happened? 
People paid the minimum (test, and fit)
the never returned for repairs or re-tunings.And then complained to everyone that &#34;hearing aids don&#39;t work&#34;.Buy a hearing aid today from any major provider in Canada and you get:Initial testInitial fittingFollow up testsFollow up re tunesCounsellingrepairs - including full replacement in case of lossBatteriesIn-clinic repairs and cleanings.100% return, and in some cases $0.00 3 month trial period.There is far more to fixing your hearing issues that just amplifying sound. Sadly, most people wait too long before trying a hearing aid, and give up because they hear too much noise.Imagine returning your eye glasses because you still see ugly people.I truly wish hearing aids were far cheaper, and that was a very hard part of my job and one of the reasons why I changed careers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are a number of healthcare areas in the US that have been protected by regulation, but it’s increasingly unclear if this is good for patients, consumers, or public health at large. The increasing sentiment seems to be probably not.Vision care is another area I’d expect to see more changes and disruption coming down the pipeline. Vision care is very important and advanced cases require special skills, but it’s also unclear why many routine checks couldn’t just be done by a family doctor.The US requires one to see a “doctor of optometry” to get a basic single vision prescription. That industry used to make its money turning around and selling you glasses from the same office but that whole industry has been turned upside down by online retailers like Warby Parker and such. Why the US can’t follow the models followed most elsewhere in the world is unclear, but it would remove a lot of extra steps and costs in getting a basic care of glasses. Ophthalmology (medical doctors) are still very much a thing but most countries don’t have this model of needed a “prescription” from an optometrist for a basic pair of single vision specs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A friend and I did a &#34;guided&#34; psychedelic session earlier this year. We did it individually over one weekend. It was great. She did it for more therapeutic reasons. I did it more for philosophy/spiritual reasons. But the two main things I took away are 1.) Guided sessions are qualitatively different than recreational sessions, and 2.) It is such a crying shame that this isn&#39;t an accepted &#34;tool in the toolbox&#34; for therapists.It&#39;s not about having crazy life altering, world-bending experiences (though that can happen). It&#39;s just about helping you get into a state of mind that allows for an effective therapy session. Sort of like... would you want to do your therapy session in a crowded bar, next to your mom? No, probably not. We all recognize that such a setting would not be conducive to good therapy. So similarly, we should be able to recognize that having the right setting, both mentally and physically can affect the quality of your session. Psychadelics can do exactly this.It&#39;s also worth noting my friend has done &#34;regular&#34; therapy for 2 years, and she felt like there was a step change after the guided session. Her therapist noticed it as well.When you consider that pain meds have ruined literally millions of lives through addiction, and that also virtually (maybe literally?) no one has ever died due to overdose of psilocybin, it&#39;s very confusing why one is prescribed all the time, and the other is considered incredibly dangerous. The U.S.&#39;s perspective on drugs is so very backwards."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was a participant (ie, research subject) in one of the previous rounds of studying psilocybin for smoking cessation at Johns Hopkins.I was randomly assigned to the non-psilocybin &#34;control&#34; group. I still successfully quit smoking -- the &#34;cognitive behavioral therapy&#34; and just general support was great. The researchers showed genuine care, it wasn&#39;t like being a lab rat.Because the study was designed with a &#34;crossover&#34; component, I still got the option, which I took, to return 6 months later for a psilocybin session. The session was interesting, but I wouldn&#39;t say life-changing. Probably. I am still a non-smoker, over 2 years after quit date, did the 6-months-post-quit session help? Maybe?Ask me anything! Although I&#39;m not sure what else there is to say!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My dad is a professor of psychiatry at JHU medical school and has been telling me about this psilocybin study for years.  He was always pretty strict about me doing drugs growing up, but now he&#39;s excited about the amazing results they&#39;re seeing in this study.  He&#39;s even been asking me about my own hallucinogen experiences that I had growing up. The world is truly changing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The DOJ press release is clearer than this article is:https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/former-netflix-executiv...Some fun details:Kail did his criming through a shell LLC he set up called &#34;Unix Mercenary&#34;.He took between 10-15% of the total billings for each of the companies he hooked up with this scheme. None of those companies were charged (more&#39;s the pity).They got him on mail fraud, wire fraud, honest services fraud, and money laundering. The victim of the fraud was, of course, Netflix itself.Additional fun facts from PACER:He&#39;s seeking to exclude his shares in Sumo Logic and Netskope from forfeiture, arguing that they were largely the result of his own hard work, which takes some serious chutzpah.All of this apparently happened back in 2014 (the conviction is recent). If you&#39;re wondering what Netflix thought of all this, Kail apparently left Netflix for a job at Yahoo, from which he was fired after Netflix found out about his scheme and told Yahoo.Kail&#39;s sentencing memorandum is a fun read (again: chutzpah). For instance, this gem:Further, though Mr. Kail complained of problems with Sumologic (as one would see with any new startup), the product itself was “useful,” according to Ashi Sheth. (R.T. Vol. 8, p. 1670-71). As described below, at the time, Sumologic saved Netflix from paying for a far more expensive and inferior product called Splunk."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One item seems to have caused a lot of confusion in the comments so I will take a stab at clarifying:It is perfectly legal for Netflix to ask for options or any other consideration in exchange for the contract. Companies do this sort of thing frequently. They know that merely signing a large contract with a large firm will increase the value of the contractor.It is not legal for someone working for Netflix to ask for shares in their own personal capacity as individuals. That is what runs afoul of the law."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hey, I&#39;m the author of the article -- just wanted to point out that what made this story interesting to me is the implication that this kind of conduct could be very widespread. Prosecutors definitely hinted at that. If anyone knows of any similar stories, I&#39;d be very interested in hearing them. christie.smythe@businessofbusiness.com"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Just as important as recycling these batteries is making it possible for older EVs to have their batteries replaced years down the road with 3rd party batteries.In 2031, it should be possible to by a long-past-warranty 2021 EV, replace the battery pack (with one made from recycled EV batteries!), and have it just-work.   Just like you can replace the engine of a classic car today if you are so inclined.It should be possible because the electrical connection of the batteries to EV drivetrains are relatively simple - although I&#39;m sure that will take a lawsuit (like was launched against Nespresso to allow 3rd party coffee pods) for EV manufacturers to release the specs required for this to happen.It would be unfortunate if EV batteries were non-serviceable except by the manufacturer after they were out of warranty, like phones are today.   Instead, battery replacement would potentially allow the tertiary used EV market to flourish, and make them more accessible to people of modest means."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We need to design devices such as batteries for recycling and long life from the design phase of the products. Solid-state Lithium batteries will probably be easier to recycle due to no sandwiching. &#34;The immediate benefit of switching from a liquid to solid electrolyte is that the energy density of the battery can increase. This is because instead of requiring large separators between the liquid cells, solid state batteries only require very thin barriers to prevent a short circuit.&#34; This separator material complicates recycling in conventional Lithium ion batteries.Instead of assuming we have endless resources we should design all products to recyclable from the start design phase. This is to lessen global warming and environmental impact."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Thanks Google. Think I’ll be buying this.I want as little to do with Google’s services as possible in my life, but they really deserve credits for making a modern usable smartphone that is reasonably open. There is just one single feature I will be buying this for - the 5 years of software updates. While good image processing is definitely a pro, all of these software you’re presenting features I really don’t give a damn about. Just give me a phone that is meant to last a little while - and allow me to run what I damn please. This looks to be like a continuation of the Pixel 5, which allows you run your own software like /e/OS and CalyxOS aside to just being a lot less of a walled garden on the stock ROM.The Android market is completely dire, and no vendor can be trusted to provide openness, reasonable taste or security updates. They sell you a phone, and once you’ve clicked buy they’ve already stopped caring. So last year I switched to an iPhone 12. I needed to vote with my wallet to get a phone that lasts. But although I get what’s appealing about iPhones and the walled garden, I started feeling claustrophobic. Feeling claustrophobic about what I can tailor about my browser, how easily I can run Game Boy games, what ads I can block, and Apple’s stated intents to actively incriminate you by scanning your photos on a personal device. I will continue to recommend those phones for most people (pending what they’re going to do with trying to incriminate you), but it’s not for me.Finally here’s a seemingly good Android phone with 5 years of support - from the only phone vendor outside of Apple who appears to give a damn about that aspect. Don’t get me wrong: 5 years is still too short in my view, and not as long as Apple provides support for on their stuff [1]. But the market needs change, and I’ll put money towards that.[1]: The iPhone 5S has just hit 8 years of _kernel_ security updates last month with iOS 12.5.5. One can dream on the Android side, but I’ll take 5 years in the current market."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hate the trend that the &#34;pro&#34; versions of all these flagship phones need to be an XL Phablet monstrosity. Human hands haven&#39;t gotten any bigger. I have owned most of the Nexus &amp; Pixel phones throughout the years. After having the Nexus 6 as my daily driver for 2 years, I have always opted for the smaller option ever since.I would totally pay flagship prices for a regular ~5.5-6&#34; phone with flagship specs, and I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the only one. Make it 50% thicker if there are space/heat concerns, but making it wider and taller just makes it super difficult to use consistently with one hand. I also say this as somebody with larger-than-average hands!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I couldn&#39;t wait any longer so I purchased a very expensive Samsung S21 Ultra ($1200) because no Google phone could lure me away from my fading Pixel 2 XL.My mistake, because the Samsung phone had preloaded software that took considerable effort to remove (more than most people could/would deal with). It wasn&#39;t the software itself that bothered me, but rather that there were notifications for apps I don&#39;t use that I could not turn off. That&#39;s enough to make me hate a company for a long time.Bloat my phone all you want, but notifications take my brain-space, not my drive space. At least with a Google phone I have a semblance of control over the core function of the device. Looking forward to the Pixel 7 or equivalent once this Samsung device has served its purpose."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve always felt like there were two types of frameworks. Both types make the first x% of work relatively easy, but then the two types differentiate based off of how easily it is to drop down and go custom.A framework with strong primitives makes it easy to create custom functionality that is still consistent with the framework&#39;s conventions. But a framework that relies too much on magic makes this much harder. It&#39;s like all of a sudden you&#39;re surrounded with old Mainers saying &#34;you can&#39;t get there from here&#34; while you desperately try to cobble some kind of solution using ancient lore documented once long ago in a forgotten scroll."</p>

Hindenburg is the real deal.One challenge may be that, like the Mafia, Tether keeps its inner circle and employs family members. They have ~15 employees for a 70 billion dollar operation.The CTO’s wife is a manager, and the CEO’s daughter works for an unnamed crypto family office, which may be related.Their counterparties in Chinese commercial paper may not know they are counterparties due to proxies.Still, the statements are out there. Zeke Faux from Bloomberg got a copy of their records somehow. They’ve had to give them to the New York Attorney General, and their accountants in the Cayman Islands, among others. And other counterparties may have bits and pieces.Someone may be tempted by this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It may be counterintuitive, but the best thing that could happen to Bitcoin would be for Tether to collapse in a cloud of dust. Tether is continually cited as a large risk factor to Bitcoin by people who have gotten past the &#34;it&#39;s not real money&#34; objection.But I think it&#39;s worth considering what happens if the collapse never comes. If government investigation, findings of wrongdoing, admission of lies, and punishment aren&#39;t enough to shake Tether users out of their trees, then what would, exactly?Ethereum allowed a claw-back of funds lost fair and square to a defective contract. Where is Ethereum now? Oh yeah, near an all-time high and a market cap approaching half a trillion dollars.What non-users don&#39;t get is the fanatical level of devotion by users. It waxes and wanes with the Bitcoin halving cycle, but always comes back stronger than before.If Tether did somehow implode and users left in droves, something else would come along to take its place and within a year or two and the entire Bitcoin ecosystem would come roaring back stronger than ever."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Since the article mentions it, the amount of carbonation in any given beverage actually varies by a lot. The traditional measurement of carbonation is in &#34;volumes&#34;, which is the amount of space the CO2 would take up at standard temperature and pressure (32F and 1 atm). Coca Cola is usually packaged at 3 volumes; if you took all the CO2 out of the soda it would occupy 3x the volume of the soda it came from.Alcoholic beverages on the other hand have a pretty wide range of regular carbonation levels. On your lower end you have stouts and Scottish ales at 1.9-2.1, and on the high end you get your dubbel and heffe weisen at 3-3.5 volumes. Champagne is regularly in the 4.5-6 range, which necessitates a different bottle and closure design to handle the 2-3x pressure it contains compared to beer.On a particularly dumb note, ciders are limited by law to 0.64g per 100ml, or 3.2 volumes. Above that level they cease being ciders and instead become a sparkling wine. This is very important because natural cider is taxed at $0.226 per gallon, while sparkling wine is taxed at $3.30 or $3.40 per gallon depending on how the carbonation is added. This is a difference of roughly 30 cents per standard bottle, or $1.79 per six pack; enough of a difference to make similar products more attractive on the market place shelf.https://www.ttb.gov/tax-audit/quick-reference-guide-to-wine-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Putting gaps in is also a useful trick to have up your sleeve if you&#39;re 3d printing internal threads.  If you print threads as continuous bodies, the filament on each layer is effectively a ring which is (because of thread geometry) less supported for part of its length. When it contracts slightly as it cools, it can pull the overhang section of the thread away from the body of the object, and you end up with loose filament strung across the gap.If you cut gaps along the thread, when it prints you&#39;re effectively building a lot of small separated ledges out from a side wall. You don&#39;t have that cooling/tensioning effect and there&#39;s nothing to pull the filament away from where it&#39;s laid down so you end up with a cleaner thread.That&#39;s as long as your retraction settings are well tuned, mind - continuous thread is one long extrusion with no retractions, whereas thread with gaps is potentially lots of islands, depending on how your slicer reacts to the geometry."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Great article.I was actually responsible for invalidating another maps-related patent from the 1990s, in Germany. I was in Patent Litigation and I also remember having a &#34;ART+COM&#34; folder in my email, but that&#39;s about all I can remember. I don&#39;t think the case was very active by 2014.Anyhow, there&#39;s something Avi said that I have to comment on:The test for patent-worthiness is: “would it be non-obvious to someone who is skilled in the art?” I’d been doing “stupid programmer tricks” like this since high school, as have many others in my field.If only it were so simple! You would think that &#34;hey, that&#39;s just a stupid programmer trick!&#34; would be enough to render something obvious, but you&#39;d be wrong. That&#39;s what my paper [1] is about.No, to call &#34;obvious&#34; the combination of references A and B, there usually has to be some &#34;teaching, suggestion, or motivation&#34; in the literature that it would be a good idea to combine A and B.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"A Jury in Delaware decided already that Google Earth doesn&#39;t violate the 1995 Art+Com patent. So the thing is settled.But the fact remains that Art+Com had a working system in 1994 and the Keyhole founders had learned about it working at Silicon Graphics.As it looks like there were multiple teams in the US working on something like or comparable to Terravision. Heck, I wrote a program in 1984 showing the world as a ball with the contours of the continents at the ZX Spectrum. I bet hundred&#39;s if not thousands of people did that as well, it is not that hard and requires only a little trigonometry.I have no further insights into the story, but folks here should at least respect that a small group of hackers and and artists build a working system a good decade before Google Earth was published. I have yet to see any demonstration or video that comes near to Art+Com&#39;s TerraVision in 1994. There are papers written at the same time, a DARPA project working for a single military installation and a lot of work done shortly after TerraVision had been publicly demonstrated, but so far I have yet to see a video from 1994 or before comparable to Art+Com&#39;s TerraVision."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This post is quite nice in naming the people who did all the improvements. During this time, I was at a company trying to fit browser tech into consumer electronics, so we had to build the technology to run on actual inexpensive and cheap systems. Which became a core unmentioned technology, now called AJAX. Several engineers went to keyhole right at the time of the Google purchase, and did very well. Also remember Earth did little for Google, it was all maps - which had no flying demo, it was just 2d (ish) and useful."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a front end developer, I am really happy to see resources like this.Developing for the browser is a real challenge. I think working with html / css /js has been a neglected skill for a long time - most software engineers look down on that type of work and its rarely covered in comp sci course work.Still, its good to see a lot of progress has been made, this book included.My only critique - why use python instead of node.js?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was interested to see that this uses the DukPy wrapper around Duktape for the JavaScript interpreter: https://browser.engineering/scripts.htmlThis made me start digging into whether this was considered a &#34;safe&#34; way of executing untrusted JavaScript in a sandbox.It&#39;s not completely clear to me if DukPy currently attempts safe evaluation - it&#39;s missing options for setting time or memory limits on executed code for example: https://github.com/amol-/dukpyThere&#39;s a QuickJS Python wrapper here which offers those limits: https://github.com/PetterS/quickjsI&#39;m pretty paranoid though any time it comes to security and dependencies written in C, so I&#39;d love to see a Python wrapper around a JavaScript engine that has safe sandbox execution as a key goal plus an extensive track record to back it up!"</p>
