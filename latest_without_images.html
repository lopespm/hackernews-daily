								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is an incredible time for knowledge management tools. Just a couple of years ago I was pulling my hair out trying to get a local wiki to feel like a native app, and now we have a dozen great options to choose from.I started using Obsidian when it came out last year, and it instantly clicked for me. I immediately migrated 20 years of notes to it.What differentiates Obsidian from all of the other tools in this area, is that they have made extensibility a top priority. The sheer breadth of plugins, themes, and other community-driven tools that have been generated in 18 months is spectacular. It makes it easy to recommend Obsidian because you can shape it into whatever you want.There are a handful of plugins like Dataview, QuickAdd, Kanban and Periodic Notes that make Obsidian an incredibly powerful environment for thought.I made a theme for Obsidian called Minimal that attempts to make the app feel more native, especially on Mac:
https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal...and published a couple of my own plugins and a Web Clipper bookmarklet: https://gist.github.com/kepano/90c05f162c37cf730abb8ff027987...The Obsidian community is just so fun, friendly, and collaborative, that you can&#39;t help but get involved and work on making the ecosystem better."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I built a simple journal solution for myself two years ago. It sends an email every day and I can reply to it, and the response is stored in an SQLite database, in plain text. The db is on a remote server but copied to Dropbox every day (and in any case all the emails also exist in my sent folder).It is surprisingly effective at storing not just what I did with my day, but random thoughts and ideas, solutions to bugs, etc. All I have to do is type something every day.In 2 years I have typed around 150k words. For reading he whole thing is just one plain html page, searchable in the browser.I&#39;m currently experimenting with documenting my reading, while the book is being read (instead of a summary at the end). We typically forget what we expect while we read, and only remember the final impression. Taking notes at the end of each reading session, not just about what I just read, but also about what I think will happen next, and revisiting that later, is surprisingly interesting."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"IPFS needs to decide what it wants to be. Is it about being a decentralized caching layer? Is it about permanently storing content? Is it about replacing my web server? Is it about replacing DNS? Is it about censorship resistance?Right now it does none of those things well. The client chews through CPU and memory when seemingly doing nothing. If I try to download content, it is far slower than BitTorrent unless I go through a centralized gateway. If I add content it takes ages to propagate, making it utterly unsuitable as a replacement for a web server. There is no system to keep content alive so links will still die. The name system is byzantine and I don&#39;t think anyone uses it.Unfortunately, they are now unable to pivot because they did that asinine ICO. The right thing to do is to give up on the FileCoin nonsense and build a system that solves a problem better than anything else, but that is no longer allowed because they already sold something else to their &#34;investors&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like IPFS, I really do, but whenever I try to use it, it&#39;s either too slow to become usable or sometimes it plain doesn&#39;t work. I pinned a whole bunch of files on IPFS a while back to experiment with it and the system seems to work, but every time I try to fetch those resources from a location that hasn&#39;t cached the content yet, it takes several seconds to show me the HTML/JSON/PNG files.HTTP may be inefficient for document storage, but IPFS is inefficient for almost everything else.I like the concepts behind IPFS but it&#39;s simply not practical to use the system in its current form. I hope my issues will get resolved at some point but I can&#39;t shake the thought that it&#39;ll die a silent death like so many attempts to replace the internet before it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Pretty interesting. A lot of people here are focusing on permanence, but for me the main difference on addressing by content vs by host name is the loss of authorship it opens up for the web. Since a research paper of essay is referred to by its hash, the owner effectively gives away all control of the work when it&#39;s first published. There will be no editing, no taking down unwanted work, and no real way to build an interactive website that allows dynamic linking to other materials by the author.It&#39;s interesting how the same people promoting the &#34;creator economy&#34; also tend to promote the cryptocurrency space and IPFS without an ounce of self-awareness. IPFS sounds awful for creators of all kinds in the same way as BitTorrent was awful for artists. I can definitely see a use case for IPFS as a file storage for trustless systems such as smart contracts, which are designed as immutable, trustless systems."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Incidental and subjective opinion; but I do think that The Restaurant at the End of The Universe is the best book in the series.The commentary is deeper, the jokes are funnier and the story arc feels a lot less random whilst still being surreal. The scenes at the end of the book with the Golfrinchans is a masterclass in humourous writing with a truly nasty vein of bleakness.It also features the ultimate question, of course."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was 9 when he published Hitchhiker&#39;s guide. I&#39;d just started reading and would go on to spend my teens reading ANYTHING I managed to lay my hands on. And throughout my teens everyone went on and on about Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide, and it just didn&#39;t... push me to read it. I eventually read it after being consrcipted. And it left me feeling as ambivalent as I felt before reading it.As the comments here evidence, people read much into it, and the number 42. This is great. I felt books like The Ugly American [0], Honey Badger (Robert Ruark) and King Rat [1] had more to offer. My opinion hasn&#39;t much changed - but I feel the problem lies with me, in that depth and meaning are what I value.Is humour the entirety of the draw for Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide, or  (probably more likely) have I missed something?[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ugly_American[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Rat_(Clavell_novel)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Schopenhauer used an equation with the answer of 42 to make a metaphysical point in “The World as Will and Idea.” I suspect this is the meaning Adams had in mind:As time has only one dimension, counting is the only arithmetical operation, to which all others may be reduced; and yet counting is just intuition or perception a priori, to which there is no hesitation in appealing here, and through which alone everything else, every sum and every equation, is ultimately proved. We prove, for example, not that (7 + 9 × 8 - 2)/3 = 42; but we refer to the pure perception in time, counting thus makes each individual problem an axiom. Instead of the demonstrations that fill geometry, the whole content of arithmetic and algebra is thus simply a method of abbreviating counting. We mentioned above that our immediate perception of numbers in time extends only to about ten. Beyond this an abstract concept of the numbers, fixed by a word, must take the place of the perception; which does not therefore actually occur any longer, but is only indicated in a thoroughly definite manner. Yet even so, by the important assistance of the system of figures which enables us to represent all larger numbers by the same small ones, intuitive or perceptive evidence of every sum is made possible, even where we make such use of abstraction that not only the numbers, but indefinite quantities and whole operations are thought only in the abstract and indicated as so thought, as [sqrt](r^b) so that we do not perform them, but merely symbolise them.I tried to add this on Wikipedia a while ago, but was overruled by an editor.Source: https://gutenberg.org/cache/epub/38427/pg38427-images.htmlMore on Schopenhauer: https://www.locserendipity.com/TitleSearch.html?q=Schopen"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I interviewed Arthur Whitney in 2009[0], Roger came up again and again. (He only appears in the transcript once, but Arthur spoke of him several times, always with great fondness.)  Roger clearly had an outsized influence on Arthur -- in addition to his particularly close relationship with computer science pioneer Ken Iverson.  Condolences to his family -- and to his close friends like Arthur, who I know must be grieving this loss.[0] https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1531242"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of his memorable blog posts was on generating permutations in array languages[1]. In his spoiler explanation he comments about generating permutations of 0..4 starting from permutations of 0..3 and a &#34;magical matrix&#34; to do that, and then discusses:&#34;What is the “best” perm function I can write in APL? This “best” is a benchmark not only on my own understanding but also on advancements in APL over the years.&#34; and then shows one he wrote in 1981, one from 1987, then &#34;I worked on perm from time to time in this period [1990-2007] but in J rather than in APL&#34;, then one from 2008, and one from 2015, and where future improvements might be found. In a video talk on it he says &#34;some of these sub-expressions can be improved, but the APL language cannot yet express the thought that I have&#34;[2]. I just like that pattern of returning to the same problems and polishing both the language and solution over multiple decades.[1] https://www.dyalog.com/blog/2015/07/permutations/[2] https://youtu.be/e0rywC7-i0U?t=2254[3] talk is taken from his writing here, I think: https://www.jsoftware.com/papers/50/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I suspect the dissenters and Dan are not as far apart as one would expect. What I see in the dissent is a rejection of the specific brand of Silicon Valley rah rah productivity cult. There&#39;s a lot of mysticism in SV style productivity, whether it&#39;s the new hottest app or the latest lifestyle craze. It&#39;s also almost always directed at squeezing more work out of someone who&#39;s already working far too much. What Dan&#39;s proposing is a much more concrete, much more grounded sense of productivity. It&#39;s the difference between trying to get an overworked line cook to fulfill the job of 3 regular workers and watching a master chef work with no extra movements, no wasted energy.I&#39;m sympathetic to the analogy of practice. Too many people are extremely static in their assessment of their skills. They make overarching claims like &#34;oh I&#39;m just not good at cooking&#34; or &#34;I just can&#39;t type very fast&#34;, when they can remedy these issues with practice. Of course they aren&#39;t obligated to do so, but it&#39;s a useful mindset to see weaknesses as potential places of improvement instead of permanent failings. It&#39;s also true that if you&#39;re racing against someone who doesn&#39;t see it as a race, you&#39;ll win. Granted they probably won&#39;t care, but sometimes people get to the end, realize they did care about the race, and were just never clued into the fact that it was a race."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem I have with discussions about “productivity” (including 10x engineer chest-beating) is that no one ever defines what they mean by the word. Is it lots of lines of code? Is it clean design and architecture that’s easy to maintain and extend? Responding quickly to business needs? Making a lot of money in a short time?Too often, people arbitrarily choose what they’re good at, or what someone else they admire is good at, call that “productivity,” and then come up with a post-hoc rationalization of why that’s good.Note: I only skimmed the article, so consider this a comment on productivity discussions in general rather than the specific article.(Oh, and a pet peeve: the agile concept of “velocity” originally introduced by Extreme Programming is absolutely not a measure of productivity. It’s a way of predicting your capacity for the next iteration. I’ve taken to calling it “capacity” instead of velocity for that reason.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who also tracks time in some amount of detail (to bill clients for it), communication, and _written_ communication in particular takes a surprising amount of time. All those Slack threads you might not even think twice of engaging in can easily destroy half your working day, even if you ignore the cost of context switching. Emails take longer than you think. Design docs take _much_ longer than you think. Code reviews take longer than you think also.For me at least coding seems to take less time objectively than subjectively, but it&#39;s also quite obvious that most of my time is not spent on coding, sadly. A good chunk of it is completely unproductive bullshit that simply has to happen because that&#39;s how the company chooses to operate. I tell them it&#39;s not the only way to do things, but they insist on wasting ~1.5 person days a week on &#34;standups&#34; and &#34;scrum&#34; (the team is 12 people, excluding me). They could _easily_ move 50% faster if they shed that bullshit and just gave people sizable tasks and some degree of autonomy and personal responsibility. Instead it&#39;s down to who can _appear_ the busiest during standup."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Going to give a guess as to more pragmatic reason this came about: they don&#39;t have a requirement or test for it.Some engineer was asked to make a feature. That feature happened to break 3rd party seeking. It probably wasn&#39;t intentional, just incidental.Because they have no internal requirement to support this, nor anyone/anything testing for it, it silently broke.It was probably not malicious, even if it feels like a step backwards to this extension developer.Whether it _should_ be fixed of course, is a different matter, but when I see statements like &#34;DRM vendors REALLY want you to buy a smart TV&#34;[1] I frown, as it is contains an assumption of intent that I suspect isn&#39;t there.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28896614Edit: The title of the article (and original title here) is &#34;Netflix&#39;s new player is an open web nightmare&#34;. My response is written in response to this sort of inflammatory language."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sorry, a little off topic gripe about the article itself. I have gigabit internet and still noticed the two images for this article loading line by line, top to bottom. Upon inspection I see they are using massive (5.67mb &amp; 3.6mb) .png images with a resolution of 2832x1838. However, the maximum size they are ever displayed is 836x546.It took me less than 1 minute to do a quick and dirty optimization bringing them down to less than 100kb each. Here you go author:https://i.imgur.com/WGk8dBS.jpg

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The boolean tracking appears to be something like an asset state machine / tracking running in the virtual player. Manually seeking the video tag is likely an unexpected change triggering an exceptional transition in the logic.The thing to keep in mind here is that the seeking timeline of a video tag element does not need to represent the actual media timeline when you are using MSE. It can represent any time the virtual player running in JavaScript wants to maintain and is usually more related to the buffer timeline and ensuring pts continuity across segment appends. Netflix has historically had relatively simple streams which may have allowed this to be the actual seek time, but looks like some deeper streaming changes are landing. For a more complicated example take a look at how multi-asset vod and live streams in a single video tag surface times.I don&#39;t work for Netflix, but do work in the field and since it&#39;s relatively small know some of the folks over at Netflix. They definitely aren&#39;t out to break things purposely, it&#39;s more likely not a case they exercise and broken by a change like someone else has said. If you want to patch the functionality it may be worth exploring the dispatch of mouse clicks on the seek bar. That probably does a translate to time and then calls the virtual player seek API which would be the new hook point you want."</p>

The idea is very entrenched in the rust gamedev community, but for a turn based tile based game there&#39;s extremely little benefit and a lot of added complexity. Bob Nystrom has an excellent talk on roguelike architecture [0] and rust as a language itself doesn&#39;t prevent any of these approaches.

It is hard to talk both about rust alongside video game design techniques.I put it down after reading 1/4th of it.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"1. S3 Standby/suspend support.If your laptop supports that, you can close the lid and it will power ~everything except the RAM down (sometimes a USB port still charges). In &#39;new&#39; laptops, including almost everything Tiger lake and Intel, S3 is being phased out for Microsoft&#39;s &#34;Modern Standby&#34;, known as S0ix (or sometimes InstantGo). This is much more like a mobile phone, where it stays on but attempts to use as little battery as possible.So, peripherals might shut down, but you might still be able to get critical Windows Updates or receive an important notification -- all while your laptop is unplugged, lid closed, in your bag overnight. This is pretty bad for heat, battery, and often not what you might expect. My new laptop uses about 15% battery overnight, just doing nothing.In the future, perhaps this mode will work as well as S3 used to for battery life, but finding your laptop fans on while it&#39;s closed inside your bag and getting really hot is not fun. This applies to lots of laptops currently.2. A good screen. Brightness that goes high enough to be seen outside (400, or more) - and it&#39;ll usually auto turn down the rest of the time to save battery. Hard to go wrong on a Mac, but really variable screen quality across other brands and models. You&#39;ll spend a lot of time looking at the screen."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"0. Linux compatibility, I am not super picky about getting everything to work perfectly but I should be able to trust that the software I prefer to use will run and my laptop will connect to wifi and play audio properly and so on.1. IPS screen (mostly a given nowadays, but this wasn&#39;t always so)2. Trackpoint, I hate trackpads. Pretty rare option so I could possibly be convinced otherwise if the trackpad is particularly good.3. Decent keyboard, any laptop will always be primarily a text processing machine for me.
 (tablet version)
4. User serviceability, with battery and RAM being highest priority but expandable storage is nice too, and all other replaceable parts are a nice bonus.5. General ruggedness, the whole point of a laptop is being able to travel with it and it&#39;s the kind of tech I expect to last me for years.6. Battery life, though I am not super picky about this.7. Everything else including performance, higher resolutions than 768p, thinness, appearance, touchscreen (roughly listed in order of preference).Posted from my trusty Thinkpad X230t which is the only laptop I&#39;m aware of that ticks nearly all my boxes. It&#39;s bulky and makes a vacuum cleaner noise when compiling and the battery only lasts 4-5 hours of normal use, though. Still, good enough for web browsing, various forms of text processing, watching videos, listening to music and the vast majority of what you might use a computer for.I did look into the Framework laptop recently but while it&#39;s probably the closet things in a long time the keyboard doesn&#39;t look good and there&#39;s no trackpoint (nor even physical mouse buttons)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; if I&#39;m missing on any new developments since 2015Yes, you missed something huge.Apple Silicon M1 or nothing.  It&#39;s just too good.  Low power consumption allows the laptop to actually be used as a laptop.  The power use-to-performance ratio is unmatched by anything on the market. Apple is breaking us free from decades of stagnation on the hardware front.Nothing else on the market comes close. I expect this to change in the future. Will happily switch to a linux laptop once an energy efficient alternative to x86 becomes mainstream for linux.  There&#39;s just no way I can go back to x86 after tasting the sweet nectar of M1."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I worked in Python for years and while I suppose I&#39;m glad for any improvement, I have never understood the obsession with true multi-threading. Languages are about trade-offs and Python, again and again, chooses flexibility over performance. It&#39;s a good choice! You can see it in how widely Python is used and the diversity of its applications.Performance doesn&#39;t come from any one quality, but from the holistic goals at each level of the language. I think some of the most frustrating aspects from the history of Python have been when the team lost focus on why and how people used the language (i.e. the 2 -&gt; 3 transition, though I have always loved 3). I hope that this is a sensible optimization and not an over-extension."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wonder how many folks think they&#39;re writing thread safe software with ease, and are unaware that they are leaning on the GIL?Could be that the impact of this change is far broader than just a few key libraries."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; These changes are major enough that a fair number of existing Python libraries that work directly with Python’s internals (e.g., Cython) would need to be rewritten. But the cadence of Python’s release schedule just means such breaking changes would need to be made in a major point release instead of a minor one.Maybe time to rethink? https://www.techrepublic.com/article/programming-languages-w...If this is as promising as it sounds, it seems Python 4 now has its &#34;thing&#34; and is on the horizon. Or at least may become a serious thing to talk about"</p>
