								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have used Apache Guacamole to access running GitHub Actions workflows as remote desktops. It worked super well for testing GUI apps on other operating systems that I didn&#39;t want to deal with setting up.It&#39;s also nice if you want to run a GUI application in someone else&#39;s sandbox.https://github.com/jstrieb/ctf-collab/blob/9300c57364f71fe29..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We adopted Guacamole for access to some of our Windows server production environments; the great thing about it is you can put your corporate SSO / authorization model into a web app to control access and not have to disclose credentials to service accounts to developers. You can also tap off a feed from the guacd that represents a complete screen recording and save it for audit trail purposes.The only issue we&#39;ve had is that FreeRDP (that underlies it for connectivity to Window servers) is a bit fussier than the native RDP environment, or at least we&#39;ve had challenges getting equivalent compatibility across old/odd Windows configurations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Using it mainly because of the paranoia of just exposing RDP to the internet. Http(s) is very convenient to add more layers of security, in my case via NGINX (both as LXC containers in Proxmox). I&#39;m using a wildcard domain *.myhome.tld pointed to my static IP. Guacamole is hosted at try_guess_me.myhome.tld, with NGINX basic auth same for all subdomains (further protected by fail2ban). So in total 3 tokens are required (subdomain and basic auth username and password) just to get to the Guacamole login page, where additional username/password + 2FA are required. I used to expose RDP directly for years, but after a chat with a colleague before vacations and a purchase of a NUC for a homelab server decided to strengthen the security slightly.RDP is still much better user experience, so once when I needed a longer session I used Guacamole to access my router admin interface and temporarily expose RDP directly via a random port and a very strong password. I&#39;m still not convinced that the latter combination is not enough, but it&#39;s better to be safe than sorry."</p>

Then a punch is not only a punch,
And finally a punch is just a punch&#34; (heard from Bruce Lee)Basically it means that in the beginning we punch like we can.. then a martial arts student learns the proper and different ways to punch.. so a punch is no longer just a punch... Is a lot of instructions..
Then to sheer practice and repetition the right way to punch becomes second nature.. so the right way to punch is the only way so it&#39;s only a punch again.So coding it&#39;s just ifs and loops...

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"ADSL, being essentially a form of alternating current, will pass through an air gap. I was enlightened on this by an AT&amp;T tech who pointed out that one of my ADSL lines had several breaks and could not carry DC but the ADSL signal still came through. The other line was dead so I was running essentially on one wire with an earth ground. Here is an interesting discussion:&#34;Phone line with 1 broken wire still gets ADSL2&#34;https://forums.whirlpool.net.au/archive/9yzp5wr3Anyway, my hat is off to the people who designed and implemented ADSL."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a terrible description of what the law actually does.  Let&#39;s shine some light on the FUD.  The law, H.R. 3684 (as enrolled), defines an &#34;advanced drunk and impaired driving prevention technology&#34; as a system which can do /one/ of the following:1. &#34;passively monitor the performance of a driver... to accurately identify whether that driver may be impaired... and prevent or limit [car] operation if an impairment is detected.&#34;2. &#34;passively and accurately&#34; detect whether someone&#39;s BAC exceeds the Federal limit, and prevent or limit car operation if it&#39;s detected.3. Both.This will apply only after the DOT finalizes a rule describing what all those things actually mean in terms of manufacture.  The law requires that the Secretary publish this rule within the next three years, unless they think it can&#39;t be done, in which case they can push it out another three years.  That rule must give car manufactures at least another two years to implement the requirement.  It also gives the DOT an out to say that it can&#39;t be done, in which case in 2031, they need to write a report to Congress to say why it can&#39;t be done.In software terms, this is a user story that was just submitted for development.  It&#39;s Congress asking the executive branch to do some work, but not actually forcing them to do so."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find the way American law-making is done to be fascinating. As far as I can tell the US is the only country on Earth where politicians are able to &#34;bundle&#34; completely unrelated things into a single piece of legislation. It definitely doesn&#39;t happen here in the UK in any substantial way (laws get amendments added on but they&#39;re always at least somewhat related to the main part), and I&#39;ve never heard of it anywhere else in the world.It&#39;s a truly interesting thing to read about from a negotiation perspective, but it must make the process of actually getting things done in politics really hard."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A couple quotes from the article that stood out to me:&#34;More pressing than the privacy concerns, though, are the safety issues. Including an automatic kill switch of this sort in a machine with internet access presents the obvious scenario that a malicious agent could disable your vehicle remotely with no warning.&#34;and also:&#34;...by 2026, vehicles sold in the US will be required to automatically and silently record various metrics of driver performance, and then make a decision, absent any human oversight, whether the owner will be allowed to use their own vehicle. Even worse, the measure goes on to require that the system be &#34;open&#34; to remote access by &#34;authorized&#34; third parties at any time.&#34;What could go wrong..."</p>

&#34;Ok so this just happened. Buckle up.About a month ago my wife broke her pixel phone. It couldn&#39;t be turned on so we couldn&#39;t wipe it.We contact Google and used the device care to get an RMA.Today someone posted nude pictures of my wife and I to her social media accounts. They accessed her Google account and tried to lock us out. They used her PayPal to send someone $5 (a test probably).How could this happen? Well Facebook and Instagram show logins from Texas. The old phone still showed on our find my phone app and it was in Texas. Guess where we sent the phone for RMA? The last ping from the old phone (which was today) was the same as the place we shipped it. The exact location down to the very building. Clearly they fixed the old phone and since it wasn&#39;t wiped, was still logged into her Google account.I called Google and they basically said &#34;woah that&#39;s fucked up we&#39;ll get back to you&#34;. We filed a police report but I don&#39;t expect they will do anything.What are my options here for sueing Google? I know that sounds insane but this breach of trust and privacy is egregious. Hundreds of people have now seen my penis including our friends kids. It&#39;s really fucked up.Any advice on what to do here?&#34;my big question is whether this phone is password enabled.  also this stinks because i know the first comment is &#34;well do a factory reset&#34; but if the phone doesn&#39;t turn on, etc. then i don&#39;t believe that is possible (short of possibly ADP which is out of the reach of 99% of people)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve worked in these contract cellphone repair/refurbishment facilities many years ago, the big warehouses where telecoms and manufacturers send these warranty phones to be triaged and repaired, and let me tell you, something like this is not surprising at all. Most of the people there did good work, but all it takes is one. Personally I&#39;d never send my phone in to repair, and I&#39;m skittish about buying any refurbished phones."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I read a history of the NSA recently [0], and what struck me is that every time the NSA&#39;s code-breaking techniques were invalidated, this was due to a US agent leaking secrets to adversaries.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I see this kind of thing happening all the time, facilitated by third parties.For example, a few months ago I found this funny video of some trombonists playing Bruchner in unusual situations[1] that had been uploaded on 14th September 2015 and noticed it had an obviously-bogus copyright claim for the music (&#34;Song: Calling You (Live), Artist: FUN, Licensed to YouTube by (on behalf of FUN); Songtrust, Sony ATV Publishing, and 2 music rights societies&#34;), with a link to where this bogus &#34;song&#34; had been uploaded[2].The &#34;song&#34; proved to be a video consisting of the original trombone video&#39;s soundtrack played twice, over an unrelated static image, that had been uploaded on 13th May 2021—six years after the video it was ripping off.There was enough information on the &#34;song&#34; video to find out that it had been supplied to YouTube by a company called TuneCore[3] who according to their website offer to &#34;SELL YOUR MUSIC WORLDWIDE: Get your music on Spotify, iTunes/Apple Music, Tidal, Amazon Music, TikTok, Tencent &amp; more&#34;.I contacted TuneCore in July to point out that their service was being abused, but got a semi-automated reply to the effect that unless it was _my_ copyright that was being infringed they weren&#39;t interested.  I replied, and also responded to their automated did-Jira-help-you-today survey, in both cases pointing out that they were (however inadvertently) involved in fraudulent activity but (unsurprisingly) never heard back.I see now that the TuneCore &#39;song&#39; video has been made private, but the original trombone video still carries the false copyright claim.So frustrating.[1] https://youtu.be/rY0m2cLH1m8[2] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-577Wp8yBQ - now private[3] https://www.tunecore.com/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Maybe worthy of its own post but there&#39;s another kind of overt scammer on Youtube. It goes like this:They find some technically hip, well known content and create a new channel with a very similar name as the originator. Create an exciting full screen ad for a crypto currency faucet scam, with price charts and crawls. &#34;Live&#34; stream the original content inset into the ad.Here&#39;s one example: https://cryptoplayboys.blogspot.com/2021/11/spacex-scam-live...Even if you report these things, they don&#39;t get removed very quickly. They&#39;re getting tons of views so why would YT care? The original content holder would care about being associated with them and should sue for defamation though."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have been a professional artist for about twenty years and it is my considered opinion that any &#34;rule&#34; given out to beginners is actually a warning: violate this rule and making something that looks good becomes a lot harder, so you should probably better make sure you&#39;re not violating any other &#34;rules&#34; unknowingly.If you know damn well that you&#39;re violating multiple rules then sure, go for it - break your perspective, fill the drawing with tangents, shade with black, etc, break the fuck out of these rules, and you can end up with something pretty good. You have to know your shit backwards and forwards to really pull this off; go look at how solid Picasso&#39;s pre-Cubist stuff was, for instance.There are good reasons to choose to use black and there are good reasons to avoid using it; this article talks about several. IIRC, one of the reasons painting teachers traditionally like to tell you to avoid it is because most commonly available black pigments can very quickly ruin the saturation of any other color you mix it with, ending up with unpleasantly grey shadows. But if you do more graphic work that treats each color as a largely separate entity then a lot of solid black can make stuff positively glow."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"#000 on my screen isn&#39;t going to be pure black either.  There&#39;s ambient light, the black level on the monitor, etc.  Several of the examples of saturated grays in this article are low-contrast UI that&#39;s hard to read.  Please don&#39;t do that.&#34;Words on web pages aren&#39;t black&#34;.  But they should be #000 or close to it.  Let the user&#39;s screen and environment determine the rest.Interfaces are artificial constructs designed to be as readable and understandable as possible.  Looking at the color of shadows and physically dark things is unhelpful for designing readable interfaces with sufficient contrast."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a design background and have written a lot of CSS, and I have opinions so just interpret this all as a personal preference if you want.* It&#39;s basic floor/ceiling stuff. Once you go #000000, you can&#39;t go any darker. Are you 100% sure the thing you&#39;re making #000000 is the absolute darkest thing on your site/app you&#39;ll ever need to declare?* Conversely, never use white! Modern macOS sucks at this! A large window of Mail.app in light mode is pretty blinding. What if you want to add a subtle highlight to a button border on a white background? #fafafa was always a go-to white for me because its easy to remember.* Shadows are really never black and your CSS shadows will look better if you don&#39;t default to black. Toggle &#39;tint shadows&#39; on the _excellent_ css shadow palette generator: https://www.joshwcomeau.com/shadow-palette/. Play with background colors, you&#39;ll see.* Your design will never please everyone, especially anything close to a majority on certain tech news aggregators."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I had an algorithms class (6.006 or 046?) with Silvio Micali, who I learned partway through the semester was one of the first authors about these things.Anyway, he was a great professor. When talking through algorithms, he&#39;d always start with say, an n^4 solution. Then cut it down to n^3, call on people to help out, etc. I remember it being something like this (in an Italian accent that we really enjoyed)&#34;And now we&#39;re at n^2! Pretty good you might think eh? After all, we were at n^4 just a few minutes ago, this is much better? But, the human mind is a wonderful thing! It is so creative and some people thought about it, and they got n log n! Amazing. I know you are thinking, n log n is always as good as it gets in this class. Well I don&#39;t want to go into the details because, it is horrifying! But actually some people, they did even better! And you know as I said, the human mind is amazing! So maybe one day, you will do even better.&#34;Also I sat across the aisle from him when Eliezer Yudkowsky came for a talk and only realized it when he answered a question EY asked the audience.This kind of turned into me reminiscing but my point is, the guy who put these out there and did a lot of work on them is a great undergrad professor and that makes me happy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not an expert, but coming from a logic background, I always think that ZK proofs are fudging the idea of &#34;completeness&#34; (and &#34;soundness,&#34; for that matter). For example, in [1] (Definition 1.1):&gt; We note that the constants 2/3 and 1/3 are arbitrarily chosen for simplicity. We can always amplify the completeness probability to 1 − negl(λ) and the soundness probability to negl(λ) with repetition.But that&#39;s not completeness in the metamathematical sense. That&#39;s a statistical boundary on what it takes to &#34;convince&#34; someone (or &#34;gain knowledge&#34;). But that&#39;s a stochastic redefinition of a pretty hard-line property of proof systems. In other words, you could theoretically have no knowledge and just get astronomically lucky to an arbitrary degree (whatever degree it would take to cross that proof threshold).[1] https://crypto.stanford.edu/cs355/18sp/lec3.pdf"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A while back I came up with a third ZK Where&#39;s Waldo protocol [1] that avoids the need to watermark the page or search Alice for contraband, and also has the (usually desirable) property that it&#39;s only convincing to Bob.You instead have Bob randomly choose whether Alice must a) pull off the screen, revealing the original page, or b) punch a hole through to Waldo, but not both. Then you can do any number of rounds of this, with Alice putting the page in a random position each time.It&#39;s only convincing to Bob because bystanders (or rather, anyone not part of the random number generation for which challenge to use) can&#39;t rule out the possibility that they conspired to have Bob always pick the challenge that a faker Alice could solve. (Show the original page when the uses the real one, punch a hole when she uses a fake page.)[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15323790Edit: That original comment gives the &#34;magic formula&#34; for coming up with such ZKPs as well."</p>
