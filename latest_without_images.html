								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"After the Affordable Care Act went into effect I signed our company up for our state&#39;s marketplace. While browsing our plan options, I noticed the url used a scheme like marketplace.org/employers/341/plans.aspx. Of course, I tried changing the number in the url to 342 to see what happened. To my astonishment, it loaded up the next company&#39;s plans, including a list of employee names, ages, plan cost, and SSNs.After I shopped a few other companies to see how our plans compared, I notified the marketplace operator via the only link on the website for customer service. Within about an hour, someone from their IT department rang me on the phone and started grilling me about how many other plans I browsed, and insisted that I clear my cache and browsing history, and notified me that they would be watching to make sure nobody at our IP address didn&#39;t access any other plans while the issue was being fixed.I was pretty surprised at his response, and assumed they would be more grateful for exposing a pretty basic flaw, but I guess a natural human tendency in these situations is to try to externalize the blame. Perhaps it&#39;s more difficult to hold yourself accountable than it is to assume that others who&#39;ve found your shoddy work are malicious actors."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Quote from the St Louis Post Dispatch article is even more groan-worthy:&#34;In the letter to teachers, Education Commissioner Margie Vandeven said “an individual took the records of at least three educators, unencrypted the source code from the webpage, and viewed the social security number (SSN) of those specific educators.”I guess webpages are kinda like encryption for idiots."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the article, it sounds like nothing even remotely questionable was done by the reporter who found the flaw:&gt; &#34;According to the Post-Dispatch, one of its reporters discovered the flaw in a web application allowing the public to search teacher certifications and credentials. No private information was publicly visible, but teacher Social Security numbers were contained in HTML source code of the pages.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Often overlooked things when discussing esbuild here:1. It&#39;s not just a faster replacement for a single %tool_name% in your build chain: for the vast majority of cases, it&#39;s the whole &#34;chain&#34; in a single cli command if you&#39;re doing it right.That is, you don&#39;t just stick it inside, say, webpack as a faster replacement for babel (although you can). No, you look carefully through your webpack configs and its myriad of plugins, ask yourself whether you really need to inline css in jsx in png while simultaneously optimizing it for IE 4.0, realize you don&#39;t, through out the whole thing, and use esbuild instead.I have two 50K+ LOC projects using esbuild, and I would use it even if it was slower than webpack/babel/tsc simply not to worry about the build chain breaking due to an update to some obscure dependency or plugin.2. It is fast because it&#39;s written from scratch to do a set of particular things and do it fast, not just because it&#39;s Go and parallelized.If you look at the commit log you will notice a lot of performance tweaks. If you look into the issues, you will find a lot of requests for additional features rejected, often due to possible negative performance impact.3. The most impressive part about esbuild development is not just that it&#39;s one guy writing it: it is the level of support and documentation he manages to provide alongside.The release notes alone are a good course into nitty-gritty details of the web ecosystem: all the addressed edge cases are explained in detail. To top it all off--all opened issues, no matter how uninformed they seem, find a courteous response."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Work on esbuild started at the start of 2020. It is primarily authored and maintained by Evan Wallace, who, in addition to making this tremendous contribution to the JavaScript ecosystem, is the CTO and co-founder of Figma. Incredible output."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Bun [1] is a JS bundler based on esbuild’s source, but written in Zig. And it is about 3x faster than esbuild. I think its author Jarred is on HN as well.Probably worth a submission on its own but I am just waiting till it is fully open source.Edit: ( Deleted those Stats, since it may not be a fair comparison and it was probably not meant to be a fair benchmark in the first place. The details are still in the linked tweets. I do not know the author or am I in anyway affiliate with Bun. )I am also wondering how much of those optimisation could be used on ESbuild. Since Rails 7 and Phoenix 1.6 will be using esbuild and not Webpack.[1] https://twitter.com/jarredsumner/status/1390084458724741121"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ll admit that I was wrong about GitLab.  I had the chance to invest in them way back in the day, and passed.  My thought at the time was that no open source company had ever been super successful except RedHat, which was more of an outlier than a pattern.  And my other thought was that they are competing against GitHub, which was extremely popular and well funded.I honestly didn&#39;t think they stood a chance.I&#39;m happy to have been proven wrong.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used to work at Uber&#39;s Amsterdam office at a time where the remote nature of the office (from SF HQ) was a struggle for some teams because of strong dependencies on teams located at SF HQ.Sid came to the office and talked to us about some strategies Gitlab used for remote work, timezone differences etc.Not only the talk was very helpful, Sid was an incredibly clear communicator, calm and humble. He really seemed to be a great leader and someone it must be nice working with."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Syncthing works brilliantly! The web UI is excellent, warns you when you&#39;re about to do something ill-advised, and stuff like QR codes makes adding clients and folders fairly easy. The separation between folders and devices is handled well. You can easily have half a dozen shared folders between several computers with any mix-and-match combination including which one is &#39;authoritative&#39; and so on.I used to use it on Android to keep my &#39;camera roll&#39; synced to my desktop. I preferred setting the ignore file to exclude android&#39;s thumbnails directory, but otherwise it worked great. I&#39;d take a photo with my phone and almost before I could open the shortcut on the desktop, boom, the photo was there, since the android client detects changes in the filesystem.I also used it to sync my password database, and a cross-platform notebook app&#39;s database. Worked flawlessly for all of them.Ditto for a folder shared between my MacOS laptop and Windows desktop.Lots of controls, especially in the forked android client. Don&#39;t want the sync client to run on any network other than your home network? Done. Don&#39;t want your syncthing clients to try and do NAT transversal / discovery outside whatever network it&#39;s on? No problem.The biggest bummer is that there&#39;s no iOS client. Had to switch to Nextcloud, which so far has been working OK, but the number of people that have problems with the iOS client is quite high (problems such as syncs being so slow it takes days to sync a camera roll), and it&#39;s generally sluggish and doesn&#39;t work in the background (yes, I know, Apple&#39;s fault.) However, Nextcloud does allow me to sync contacts and calendars (I think. I haven&#39;t tried to set it up yet.)One warning: Sycnthing really does not like it when you delete the dotfile folder inside the shared folder(s). Don&#39;t do that :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have switched from Nextcloud to Syncthing. The former was a resource hog that was eating up too much everything on my modest VPS.I share the files on my local network at home between phone, laptop and desktop. My only issues so far:- I need to manually start Syncthing on the devices, whereas Nextcloud was always running on boot. Not sure if I should start it every time, especially on the Android phone which cannot sync while away from home. I do not want to empty the battery while outside of my LAN, + the persistent notification &#34;Syncthing is running&#34; is annoying.- I need to power up at least the laptop or desktop to backup my phone data. One solution that I will try is to install a headless Syncthing instance on my NAS. This way the phone can always sync to the NAS every time, and then laptop/desktop can sync from NAS when needed.The joys of peer2peer! At least, I am sure that my moderately sensitive files are not leaving my local network to be stored on my VPS, which can be hacked someday.I also need to figure out how to install Wireguard on my router to allow to access my NAS from my phone while on a trip, but that&#39;s another story."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a funny story about this plugin.The team I was working on was developing a new product with the word &#39;cloud&#39; in the name.  We were deploying database changes to facilitate the new product.  This was a long time ago, and the organization still deployed things by hand, so there was no tooling for us to automate the deployment.  Part of the deployment process involved pasting some SQL to create the tables and populate the initial data into a JIRA ticket for an administrator to run in production.Said administrator was a fan of the cloud-to-butt plugin, and dutifully copied and pasted the SQL that they saw, like we instructed.  When our code failed, an inspection of the production database revealed the culprit.  Fortunately, &#39;cloud&#39; and &#39;butt&#39; are close to each other, alphabetically, so we didn&#39;t need to search very long.We never let that admin live that down."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Generally I&#39;d say product reviews are one of those ideas like passwords that work but don&#39;t survive introduction to the general public and mass use. The problems of authenticity are obvious, but I&#39;ve also noticed that people who rely on word of mouth from their friends and colleagues are generally happier. And why wouldn&#39;t they be? A colleague tells you this e.g. monitor is perfect for your line of work so you get it and find it also good. No fuss, nothing nerve wracking, no time wasted. Compared with reading through dozens of reviews that even when authentic raise good points that are maybe entirely irrelevant to you.I try to buy stuff in shops now. It&#39;s more expensive only if my time spent on reading reviews is free. And these days it&#39;s not even more expensive to buy in real shops anyway."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a rule, I always check the four, three, and two star reviews since they have the least propensity for a scammer to create and waste time.  1 and 5 star reviews usually are an inane mix of &#34;They&#39;re TERRIBLE&#34; or &#34;FANTASTIC&#34; with no additional information, whereas the 2,3, and 4 star reviews will normally go into specifics that warranted the stars being removed.  Not only that, but they are normally much fewer in number meaning that a sufficiently popular location with real reviewers will have enough 2, 3, and 4 star reviews to give me a relatively transparent view of the good and the bad that I can read quickly.  Mixed into this analysis is to scan for made points rather than worry about the star rating."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a small side project (a Google Docs plugin) that makes a trickle of money. One of my competitors launched one day and somehow they had 10 5-star reviews already, but the gSuite marketplace said they had only 3 users. One of those users had the same name as the author, but wrote their review as if they&#39;d just stumbled upon it that day. Another literally had the name &#34;Fiverr User&#34; on their Google account next to their review.I think this has become so common that many people assume it&#39;s a necessity of doing business. Maybe it is. Since I don&#39;t depend on my project to survive, I choose not to do these things, or even to give discounts to incentivize reviews. Many platforms don&#39;t care at all, and don&#39;t even try to combat fake reviews.EDIT: Another thing worth mentioning: the natural review rate for these plugins is really low. Maybe half a percent of users leave any kind of review, at least in my experience."</p>
