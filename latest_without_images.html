								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The title is slightly misleading, and so is Linus&#39; response here. This RFC never claimed to be in shape to be immediately mergeable into the mainline kernel as-is. Miguel (the author of the patch) has replied to this mail (and in other places in the thread) that the Rust alloc() is currently called only as a temporary measure to speed up development, and all panic() calls from allocation failures are just as temporary. This is all because the Rust code that hooks into the kernel memory allocation functions is not yet usable.The main point of this RFC is that &#34;the [in-kernel Rust] support is good enough that prototyping modules can start today.&#34; There&#39;s no point in making long arguments about alpha-quality design shortcuts on an alpha-quality prototype that are also explicitly mentioned by the patch authors to be of alpha quality.See e.g. https://lkml.org/lkml/2021/4/14/1130 and https://lkml.org/lkml/2021/4/14/1023EDIT: Thanks for the child comments; it seems that Linus is simply not aware of all the specifics and is asking for more information and/or decided to look at the code before reading the full mail thread."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I would love to see is Rust in the kernel, with a caveat. That caveat is something akin to Erlang&#39;s OTP supervision trees. Erlang has a similar philosophy to Rust in that if something erroneous happens the process fails. The difference is that Erlang OTP is designed to have supervisor processes of the worker processes. The only thing the supervisors do is monitor the processes under them and control when, if, and how those processes are restarted on failure or other conditions. The supervisors themselves have supervisors, right up to the root supervisor for each Erlang application.Rust got the language and the tooling perfect, but Erlang got the services and service infrastructure perfect.  The more I think about it the more I think I should shut up and put up. In other words, apply my knowledge of Erlang and OTP to create a gen_server in Rust as a jumping off point for a OTP like Rust framework, perhaps called OARS (Open Advanced Rust Services).  This is definitely bigger than one person. If you&#39;d like to join me on this journey then reply to this comment and I&#39;ll send you project details by the end of the weekend."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Aside from Linus&#39; reaction, there are some really interesting pearls in that thread, for example:Regarding code style[1]:&gt; The more you make it look like (Kernel) C, the easier it is for us C people to actually read. My eyes have been reading C for almost 30 years by now, they have a lexer built in the optical nerve; reading something that looks vaguely like C but is definitely not C is an utterly painful experience.&gt; You&#39;re asking to join us, not the other way around. I&#39;m fine in a world without Rust.CoC was already brought into battle[2]:&gt;&gt; I could be mistaken but you seem angry. Perhaps it wouldn&#39;t be a bad idea to read your own code of conduct, I don&#39;t think you need a browser for that either.&gt; Welcome to LKML. CoC does not forbid human emotions just yet. Deal with
it.These ([3] [4]) messages have an interesting perspective about maintenance.&gt; I&#39;m sure about one thing, the C bugs we have today will be
fixable in 20 years. I&#39;m not even sure the Rust code we&#39;ll merge today
will still be compilable in 10 years nor will support the relevant
architectures available by then, and probably this code will have to
be rewritten in C to become maintained again.Linus wants to see a real, working kernel driver instead of Android Binder[5]:&gt;Would there be some kind of real driver or something that people could
use as a example of a real piece of code that actually does something
meaningful?[1] https://lkml.org/lkml/2021/4/16/118[2] https://lkml.org/lkml/2021/4/16/143[3] https://lkml.org/lkml/2021/4/16/181[4] https://lkml.org/lkml/2021/4/16/283[5] https://lkml.org/lkml/2021/4/14/1091"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Ok, so let me see if I understand this correctly:I run a website with no trackers, no ads, nothing at all to do with Google or any other company in any way.
You come along, with Google Chrome, and visit my site.
Google adds the fact that you visited my site to their massive dataset (as well as who-knows-what-else)
And to opt out of something I have never been asked to be involved with in any way, I need to contact Google and ask them to please leave my site alone?Am I understanding this shit correctly?Whether I like it or not, my site, by proxy, is participating in Google&#39;s data mining?If my guess is correct, how the actual fuck is this not illegal?Edit: Ok, I guess I&#39;m off the mark here with my assumptions so I&#39;ll put my pitchfork down.Google are just using your Chrome browsing data, matching it with site id&#39;s (or hashes?) and then analysing the shit out of it for their gain.As a website owner, nothing has changed other than I can tell them not to use my site as part of their analysis... that sound about right?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Let me get this straight: even if my site has no ads or trackers, Chrome will now use my visitors data for advertising and surveillance???Does anyone else see FLoC as worse than the current state we&#39;re in?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Has nobody bothered to read anything about FLoC?The purpose of this permission is to prevent embedded third-party content from using FLoC. Besides that it’s a no-op.FLoC does not track arbitrary websites, it tracks sites which retrieve the FLoC cohort via JS. So instead of dropping a unique third party cookie, and associating it with the data on the page, sites can now retrieve a k-anonymous cohort id and associate it with the data on the page. If you’re not doing that (or serving ads) there’s nothing you need to do.That’s not to say that FLoC doesn’t deserve criticism just that most criticism I’ve encountered is not grounded in reality."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is really huge news. Starship has in about 18 months gone from a Elon standing next to a steel grain silo duct-taped into the shape of a rocket, to all the eggs in NASA&#39;s moon basket. The thing I kept thinking - and I have to believe was considered within NASA - is given the rapid progress SpaceX has been making along with the delays in Congressional funding, SLS, BlueOrigin&#39;s other projects etc ... if NASA hadn&#39;t selected SpaceX there was at least some chance they&#39;d go ahead and do their own private Moon landing mission before NASA&#39;s, a massive egg-on-face moment.There are still major risks with the Starship program so I don&#39;t think anyone should be 100% confident they can pull this off, but the massive side benefit is if they do NASA will have proven out a generic system, fully reusable and with orbital refueling, that can with minimal modification cost-effectively send humans to Mars and much of the rest of the solar system as well. A Model T or 737 in space. The original Artemis plan never made much sense as a Mars &#34;proof-of-concept&#34;, but it actually does now.If at some point say 2025, NASA says to the President &#34;we can get the first human on Mars in 4 years for $15 billion&#34; I have to imagine any American president being eager to sign their name on that accomplishment and give the JFK speech, &#34;We choose to go to Mars in this decade, not because it is easy, but because it is hard; because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one we intend to win&#34;To me that&#39;s the real takeaway here: this is implicitly a huge NASA bet not just on the Moon, but Mars and the rest of the solar system. Finally."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The biggest news IMO is that there&#39;s only a single winner.   There was a lot of pressure to make Commercial Crew a sole contact to Boeing, and it now appears that Boeing is going to deliver Starliner two years later than SpaceX delivered Crew Dragon.  So going with two winners saved NASA&#39;s bacon.    It&#39;s surprising to see them only choose a single winner here.  Yes SpaceX may be considered a safe bet, but ten years ago it was Boeing who was considered the safe bet.   Things change over years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have to say, I am completely skeptical of Blue Origin&#39;s ability to do anything in a reasonable amount of time and that they will amount of anything but Bezo&#39;s hobby. At least until they change their approaches.That said, it&#39;s a very secretive firm with an unknown amount of progress.I&#39;ll believe in Blue Origin when I see it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The important parts:&gt; The Court ruled that when consumers created a new Google Account during the initial set-up process of their Android device, Google misrepresented that the ‘Location History’ setting was the only Google Account setting that affected whether Google collected, kept or used personally identifiable data about their location. In fact, another Google Account setting titled ‘Web &amp; App Activity’ also enabled Google to collect, store and use personally identifiable location data when it was turned on, and that setting was turned on by default.&gt; 
The Court also found that when consumers later accessed the ‘Location History’ setting on their Android device during the same time period to turn that setting off, they were also misled because Google did not inform them that by leaving the ‘Web &amp; App Activity’ setting switched on, Google would continue to collect, store and use their personally identifiable location data."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The Luca app really is a complete train wreck. And what&#39;s worse is that the federal governments don&#39;t even have any direct control over the app itself, they just bought access to the contact tracing data for 12 months from the company operating the app. Meanwhile the company controls the app and all connected user accounts and can repurpose it in whichever way they see fit (and they already announced they have plans for the app beyond the pandemic).It&#39;s absolutely mind-boggling to me how our government(s) can get the idea to &#34;rent&#34; contact tracing data from a private company like this, it just reeks of corruption. I wasn&#39;t a big fan of the Covid tracing app in the beginning, but in retrospect the concept of that app seems miles ahead of the current situation with the Luca app."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a hiring manager, the things that stand out to me in your post:- You said you quit a job at EA, quit a job at IBM, dropped out of college your freshman year. You may have valid reasons for leaving each of these, but you have to see this from the manager&#39;s perspective: You had 3 different great opportunities that all came to a dead end at the beginning of your career. You need an alternate narrative.- You talk about applying to Google, Facebook, Airbnb, Palantir, and other companies known to be very competitive, yet the only real job experience you list in your post is low level customer support. Nothing wrong with aiming high, but you need to also be applying to jobs that are a logical next step in your career. It&#39;s extraordinarily difficult to jump from customer support to FAANG engineer, so have a backup plan.- You spoofed e-mails to manipulate executives into meetings. This kind of thing sounds clever in movies or from anecdotes in the 90s or 2000s, but in this era everyone is on high alert for phishing attacks and security breaches. Read the room, and don&#39;t commit computer fraud during your application process. Big companies have systems in place to catch these things and you&#39;ll get blocked in short order.- No mention of your network. Do you have any contacts or friends or acquaintances anywhere in the industry? Even people you knew briefly from school? People who you worked with in the past who moved up? Reach out and ask if they have any advice for your job search. Going forward, make a point to stay on good terms with the people around you. You can help each other as your careers progress."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Have you tried asking any of the jobs that rejected you&#39;re getting rejected?Honestly, just a guess, you&#39;re probably giving off bad interpersonal vibes/people don&#39;t really like talking to you. Half of interviewing is just being very personable/being able to talk comfortably with other people. Generally in this space (this space meaning those interested in tech/startups/etc) sometimes people struggle in this area but really shine in tech. I would encourage you to spend some time reflecting on your interpersonal skills.Some other red-ish flags from your post - you kinda seem like you might struggle just doing exactly what you&#39;re asked to do. Bringing up how frequently you quit things for various reasons or finding issues and bringing them up with your superiors&#39; superiors, spoofing numbers to get in touch with very very senior people. Lots of lower-tiered jobs literally just need people to show up and do what they&#39;re asked. A part of getting a &#34;first&#34; or &#34;entry level&#34; job is accepting you&#39;re there mostly to learn, not to teach/move outside of your lane. The fact that you would even bring up Bill Landreth seems like you might not necessarily see yourself how the rest of the world sees you.I&#39;m not trying to offend you - I really hope you can line something up soon. I apologize if this feedback seems cold - I think reflecting on things like this can be hard because you have to face things about yourself you may disagree with or not realize. Unfortunately interviewing is such a biased game, you kind of have to play your opponent (meaning, be the person they want, not the person you are).Happy to chat through any of this stuff if you have questions. Wish you all the best."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Your writing is not strong, i can tell you did not attend college. Written communication is important in tech.Your applying to those companies with 0 experience or college degree is unrealistic. The entry level is extremely competitive and you have nothing to make you interesting to hire. They get thousands of applications for those jobs.You are still young, plenty of time to learn, but I recommend taking a step back and rethink your strategy. There are plenty of companies that do not get thousands of applications for jobs.Let me put it bluntly: you are not qualified to be a software engineer. There is no reason anyone would currently hire you, unless you are personable and fun to talk to.You show immaturity in the way you handled the flaw in the system you described. Calling your boss&#39;s boss because you think you are right is childish.Additionally, you do not understand how to get a software job, you do not have realistic expectations for what kind of jobs you are qualified to acquire.A few years ago my brother, who is in his thirties, was stuck in a dead end job he hated. So he took some classes in 3D modeling. He worked hard, built out his portfolio, networked, and eventually landed a job at a world famous video game studio making AAA games at an interesting role that builds his skills.What he did not do was blindly apply to jobs he was not qualified to do with zero training"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It’s a simple equation:
So long as there is more money in mining BTC than there is cost in energy to mine it, mining will proceed.No entity in the world can control the price of crypto. But, we can and already do regulate energy production.I think we need a carbon tax, that is specifically a financial disincentive towards any means of energy production that directly pollutes the atmosphere.Seriously, what are the current best arguments against levying such a disincentive?Moreover, if energy were priced correctly (its toll on the climate priced in) would BTC become higher in value? That is, we have a supply, increasing at a rate fixed between the arbitrage of energy and mining efficiency. If energy were to become more expensive, the growth in supply would slow. Assuming demand remains constant or continues to grow as well, the only way for price to go is up."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Easy solution: tax carbon emissions.Who cares if you’re using energy to mine Bitcoin? Or if you’re using it to play video games?

How can Google own the entire ads market and still be allowed to compete in it? Obviously for-profit companies will abuse their positions if it&#39;ll earn them more money, and fines ends up being the cost of doing business instead of deterrents.How is Apple allowed to disallow any other web browsers on their mobile devices? We already went through this with Microsoft in the past but suddenly it&#39;s different?How can Amazon be allowed to sell competing products in their own marketplace, when they own the actual marketplace? They should have been forced to divide their business long time ago. Of course they are gonna use metrics from competitors that only they have access to, in order to make their own product line get better.Why is Google allowed to rank their own products in front of more general results? Try searching for &#34;Earth&#34; on Google and see what the top hit is. Is that really a fair ranking? We don&#39;t even know, because no one knows how their algorithm is working, but one thing is clear, Google products consistently rank higher than anything else in the search engine.The list goes on.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;A year after initiating the investigation, we received testimony from the Chief Executive
Officers of the investigated companies: Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook, Mark Zuckerberg, and Sundar Pichai.
For nearly six hours, we pressed for answers about their business practices, including about evidence
concerning the extent to which they have exploited, entrenched, and expanded their power over digital
markets in anticompetitive and abusive ways. Their answers were often evasive and non-responsive,
raising fresh questions about whether they believe they are beyond the reach of democratic oversight.Although these four corporations differ in important ways, studying their business practices has
revealed common problems. First, each platform now serves as a gatekeeper over a key channel of
distribution. By controlling access to markets, these giants can pick winners and losers throughout our
economy. They not only wield tremendous power, but they also abuse it by charging exorbitant fees,
imposing oppressive contract terms, and extracting valuable data from the people and businesses that
rely on them. Second, each platform uses its gatekeeper position to maintain its market power.By controlling the infrastructure of the digital age, they have surveilled other businesses to identify
potential rivals, and have ultimately bought out, copied, or cut off their competitive threats. And,
finally, these firms have abused their role as intermediaries to further entrench and expand their
dominance. Whether through self-preferencing, predatory pricing, or exclusionary conduct, the
dominant platforms have exploited their power in order to become even more dominant.&#34;Well they&#39;re not wrong..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Amazing.I never thought I would say this, but I actually implemented an FTP server in 2020. This was needed to support firmware updates to specific hardware (Electric Vehicle charging stations). Apparently embedded software developers choose FTP whenever a spec doesn&#39;t specify how binary file transfers should work.It was kind of amusing getting FTP to work in a modern cloud environment. I run a single Kubernetes pod with a Node.js based FTP server optimized for one thing: Transferring files between FTP and Google Cloud Storage. A series of ports are specified in the Docker file to enable passive FTP transfers.Even more amusing was the number of varieties in which FTP was implemented by different hardware manufacturers. I regularly had to dive into the FTP libraries to add support for crazy edge cases (tcpflow in kubectl exec -it is your friend!). Example: one device added a newline in the middle of a command (USER\n myusername)..The latest curve ball I received this week is that a certain firmware version of a Qualcomm modem chip cannot deal with the size of the IP packets coming from our FTP server... Fun stuff!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From rfc801 (transition from NCP to TCP/IP) :
&#34;FTP: This is specified in RFC 765.  It is very similar to the FTP used with the NCP.  The primary differences are that in addition to the changes for Telnet, that the data channel is limited to 8-bit bytes so FTP features to use other transmission byte sizes are eliminated.&#34;So FTP is older than the standardisation of byte size :-)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"If it&#39;s not broken, why fix it? I go to goodreads for the high-quality book reviews and community. I literally don&#39;t care about UX or fancy algorithms. I&#39;d rather use an old algorithm called &#39;talking to someone I know&#39; for book recommendations. Right now it feels like a clunky old site made for books reviews and I like that feel. I don&#39;t want some Amazon product manager who only cares about monetising (where can I smack ads?!) to touch it thank you very much. And god forbid some UX person gets hold of it and redesigns it in the boring/minimal feel (so it loads fast and we can smack lots of ads on it)."</p>
