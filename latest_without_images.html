								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Notably, of those bug reports, fewer than 1% (only 3 bugs) were specific to the Linux version of the game. That is, over 99% of the bugs reported by Linux gamers also affected players in other platforms. Moreover (quoting from the OP):&gt; The report quality [from Linux users] is stellar. I mean we have all seen bug reports like: “it crashes for me after a few hours”. Do you know what a developer can do with such a report? Feel sorry at best. You can’t really fix any bug unless you can replicate it, see it with your own eyes, peek inside and finally see that it’s fixed. And with bug reports from Linux players is just something else. You get all the software/os versions, all the logs, you get core dumps and you get replication steps. Sometimes I got with the player over discord and we quickly iterated a few versions with progressive fixes to isolate the problem. You just don’t get that kind of engagement from anyone else."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yep we find a variant of this with our python open source data science users who normal businesses would hate:- Across all Python envs (Jupyter, streamlit/plotly, flask/Django, ...), they report way more bugs, and often from our free tiers, which sounds low ROI.. but our community caught all but ~2 significant bugs we fixed this year that our internal automated testing missed and would have otherwise gone to our Enterprise and gov users . They are happy to exchange a tiny bit of GPU or viz burps for new features faster, as long as we are responsive to their reports! That also pushed us to a better dev cadence which wouldn&#39;t have worked for our Enterprise users. More subtle, we have more confidence for deploying wider features/APIs which would otherwise be too underused + risky for the same reason.- they are often doing innovative new things with our stack, which originally meant feature requests for non-repeatable sales.. but ended up stretching our flexibility into wider applicability, and they can clearly tell us areas to advance the visual, analytic, etc sides of our R&amp;D and package it up for the rest of their internal analysts. Almost like a multiplier for conversations with our more operationally focused no-code/low-code users, and helps us see around the corner for them in the AI+API+customization sides!- most of our technical partnership discussions now go through our OSS client repos. Rather than PowerPoints with BD people that don&#39;t have staff to do things, a product dev or sales engineer/architect or devrel blogger will think, &#34;oh our customers would benefit from better interactive visuals on our data, let me whip something up quick with that package&#34; and we help them take it from there- open source data users like PyData developers and data scientists, compared to say the # of SMBs out there or general enterprise employees, is small and almost by definition doesn&#39;t pay for most software... but they end up being attached to projects that do, and influence much of their organization that definitely does!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great article, though he&#39;s benefitting from a specific slice of Linux users that are great to work with.On the other end of the spectrum, try releasing a php plugin for Wordpress, OpenCart, Magento, etc.  I released a mildly popular, open-source, free add on in this space.  The Linux users there are decidedly less technical, but still doing it themselves.What I got for &#34;bug reports&#34; was mostly terrible, few details/logs/etc.  And a weird entitlement thing where people had really high support expectations over something that was open source and free. Even a few expletive-laden emails.  I did receive a few really helpful reports, pull-requests, and thank you emails...but they were very much the exception."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"249. The speed benefits Google marketed were also at least partly a result of Google’s throttling. Google throttles the load time of non-AMP ads by giving them artificial one-second delays in order to give Google AMP a “nice comparative boost.” Throttling non-AMP ads slows down header bidding, which Google then uses to denigrate header bidding for being too slow. “Header Bidding can often increase latency of web pages and create security flaws when executed incorrectly,” Google falsely claimed. Internally, Google employees grappled with “how to [publicly] justify [Google] making something slower.”I’d be seriously ashamed at this point if I was a Google employee assigned to AMP."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"What a read. Almost every single paragraph in the document leaves me speechless. For example, quoting from the document:&#34;Google likes to claim that it will “never sell your personal information to anyone,” with Google CEO Sundar Pichai deceptively claiming that such a policy is “unequivocal.” But Google leverages  intimate  user  data  and  personal  information  to  broker  billions  of  daily  online  ad  impressions between publishers and advertisers that target individual users based almost entirely on  their  personal  information. Internal documents  confirm  that  Google  knows  its  users  are  deceived by its misrepresentations, even as it reaps billions from ads that use personal data to target those  users.  In  Orwellian  terms,  it’s  a  beautiful  thing  for  Google,  the  destruction  of  words  like “sell” and “personal.”&#34;Or:&#34;Google presents a public image of caring about privacy, but behind the scenes Google coordinates  closely  with  the  Big  Tech  companies  to  lobby  the  government  to  delay  or  destroy  measures that would actually protect users’ privacy. Of course, effective competition is concerned with both price and quality, and the fact that Google coordinates with its competitors on the   quality metric of privacy—one might call it privacy fixing—underscores Google’s selective promotion of privacy concerns only when doing so facilitates its efforts to exclude competition.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"So it seems to me the most pressing issue is still creating a viable alternative to Google Search. I&#39;ve tried to use Duck Duck Go and even Bing in the past but I&#39;ve just not found the quality of the results to be nearly the same.However - recently I&#39;ve found G Search is getting steadily worse. They&#39;ve made UX changes that make it harder to view cached pages, and it seems to ignore search operators frequently.This is the biggest foothold to their dominance. YouTube, Gmail, Maps and everything else is in a supporting role to this core product.Who is actively working on this and what is proving so challenging? What is stopping us from creating a viable Google clone, with the same level of high quality results?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The article mentions Process Explorer. Since Sysinternals were bought by Microsoft many years ago and the tools are distributed directly via Microsoft, such tools are unlikely to have an issue being signed.A brief history of the process for those not following it. Originally for kernel-mode drivers, you needed a code signing certificate cross signed by Microsoft&#39;s root. This means that the certificate follows a chain up to a standard CA _and also_ one Microsoft use to approve that CA to issue kernel-mode certificates. It was not sufficient to have a certificate capable of signing code, even with MS&#39; OIDs for that.Then, around Windows 10 I think, Microsoft announced that one would need to acquire an EV certificate. You would then be required to submit the driver package via sysdev.microsoft.com and after spending time in Ballmer&#39;s Brewery, it would come out signed by Microsoft.It was technically possible to use the old mechanism at this stage too, provided the end user did not have UEFI secure boot enabled. IF secure boot were enabled, the kernel would: a) if the driver was signed pre-Win10, accept it, b) if it was signed post win-10 RTM date and by Microsoft, accept otherwise reject.Thus the only mechanism to realistically get your driver working on all Windows out of the box is to submit via sysdev. You can&#39;t realistically ask users to disable secure boot, even if this is entirely possible on all x86 motherboards.Finally, the cross signed roots expire soon and I think some already have. Microsoft have decided that this mechanism will now be retired, and all drivers must be signed via sysdev from now on. You still require an EV certificate as well, to sign the package.This is a bit of a mixed bag. On the one hand, Microsoft have repeatedly signed the shim maintained by redhat in order to allow Linux distributions to boot directly on secure boot-enabled hardware (UEFI binaries also go through this process and always have). Microsoft have their keys in the default keychain because they bothered to be involved in the process, unlike linux companies like Redhat. So on the one hand, they&#39;re being quite friendly to open source.On the other hand, the push to EV certs rules out individual developers like myself[1]. I could register a company but... that entails effort and expense for a hobby project. And now hobbyist projects like this run the risk of being rejected by MS.I mostly believe this is an attempt to reduce the number of code signing cert leaks that result in people writing malware, and lock down the Windows kernel a bit more, but still. It is a shame.[1] This is because most CAs won&#39;t issue EV certificates to individuals, even if those individuals happen to have detailed knowledge of cryptography and all the pkcs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"An immensly powerful and useful tool. Can&#39;t live without it. Hopefully the situation resolves soon.What is it with MS these past few months? It&#39;s like they&#39;re trying to throw away the little community goodwill they managed to build up over the years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Keep in mind this has happened because people agreed that they can&#39;t (normally) run code not singed by someone else (Microsoft) on their own system for “security” reasons. Well, it was not security, it actually was a way to keep keys to themselves, and hold the user system as a hostage. And it has been explained many times by many people.If you care about software freedoms, even just a tiny bit, you wouldn&#39;t touch “Microsoft open source”, and you wouldn&#39;t be happy about your friends using any of it, like you wouldn&#39;t be happy about seeing them with a heroin syringe. That is going to explode spectacularly one day."</p>

They were instead simply buds - still too immature. Exactly how you execute an idea is often far more important than the actual idea. This isn&#39;t some catchy phrase, its how people take failing businesses and rework them to massive profits.I agree that more iteration was required. Focusing on a particular set of real customers is also a useful activity. Real people have real needs. Developers often have no clue what people want because people in general have problems and your shiny thing is weird and wonderful and they don&#39;t (yet) understand it.eg That time tracker... omg. Plenty of people use worse. Plenty are better. Its minimal, but a start.

Most of them didn’t solve a problem that other software hadn’t already solved. The most interesting one I think was the appartment notitication one. Especially that today there is such a race if you want to find a good and affordable appartment. It’s just too bad the author wasn’t able to create something simple for this. At the end of the day, you have to try 10 ideas to get one off the ground. But you also have to give them a serious shot, which doesn’t seem to have been the case here. You often will have to invest actual money to get your idea out there and popular. Unless it’s a one in a million that will go viral on its own."</p>
