								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Professionally, I do embedded and robotics, but once a year I find an excuse to create a simple web application (to stay updated). Every time, I get impressed by power and simplicity of the web technologies in general. In JavaScript those are things mentioned in the article + WebComponents. For CSS those are flexboxes, grids, and animations. In my opinion, React made a revolution with hooks and contexts. I love the direction in which the web world has been going!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"JavaScript is a great browser scripting language because it&#39;s the only browser scripting language.  That&#39;s a whole realm of good times, and people can and should go nuts with it there.The problem started a decade or so ago with Node.  Too many people only learn JavaScript, become psychologically dependent on it, and they all collectively took it too far outside of a browser.ECMAScript is a general purpose standard, but it was invented retroactively.  Node is not ECMAScript in a server-side ECMAScript engine, it&#39;s JavaScript in a browser JavaScript engine.  That&#39;s just too much of a force fit, and has wasted too much potential for me to say anything positive about it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"10 years ago JavaScript was an ugly language, with its clunky prototypal inheritance and so on. Modern JavaScript is a beautiful language, however, especially when enhanced with static typing as in TypeScript. So much so, that Stanford has replaced Java with JavaScript for its introductory programming course [1].[1] https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs106j/handouts/01-GeneralInf..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"At this one industrial customer I visit every week for a full day, my Verizon cell phone date/time time will suddenly change back by 19 years, six months, and some days (I don&#39;t have the exact value).  This has been going on for almost a year. My pet theory was that law enforcement turned on a stingray nearby back in 2020, it came up with a default date of 1/1/2001, and has been running ever since.  Steel building with warehouse plus office space. No one in the building is running one of those cell phone boosters that plug into customer internet and act as a mini tower. My newish pixel 4 and my previous Moto phone both demonstrate the problem.  I don&#39;t have the fortitude to call Verizon and work through support to get to someone who would understand the problem.  Has this happened to anyone else?  Any other theories on what it is?  (My workaround is to turn off updating date and time from the network)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"    ”There are no open source LTE stack to learn from”

That is not true, srsRAN is a opensource LTE project.
That has both cell phone and tower versions. Runs on SDR boards like the limeSDR."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On a related note, this same mechanism can be used as a fallback for GPS to determine device location.I have worked on an IoT device with builtin SIM in the personal alarm space. Often when a device is indoors no GPS fix can be found, but the GSM module can report all celltower ids in range with signal strengths. These can be used to triangulate the device location. Google has an API for this where you can pass celtower ids and signal strengths.edit: and of course similar triangulation fallbacks/methods can be applied to WiFi AP&#39;s or Bluetooth Beacons, if you have a database with APs or beacons and their location. This database can be externally sourced but also built automatically by sending celltower ids/aps/beacons along with GPS fixes. I assume this is one of the many things Google is doing with their fleet of Streetview cars."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It seems pretty silly to get all up in arms about copying other peoples&#39; stuff. That&#39;s how humanity has innovated throughout the ages: Copy what works and innovate on top of it.None of our inventions arise from a vacuum. Cars are still as wide as Roman chariots for good reason. Power transfer uses the same base principles as were in play during the dawn of steam engines and before. Energy conversion has been an iterative process for centuries, with the odd leap and bound.Industrial espionage exists because it works, and everyone does it because it&#39;s a cheap way to come up to speed with the leading edge of human knowledge rather than unnecessarily duplicating effort.Crying &#34;No fair!

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"First, this is an interesting take, and I think there is some kernels to consider in it. However, the author is painting very broadly with a large brush and smudging a lot. I have been happily using PyCharm/IntelliJ since what feels like the dawn of time. It is a perfectly complex and rewarding Fancy Tool. People still use IDEs for C/C++ this whole time, etc. I think the author is taking their personal journey and experience and extrapolating a bit too much about trends in the industry. I found myself nodding along at times and then saying &#34;What?&#34; the next sentence.My thoughts:* JIRA, still heavily used in many, many places. Not even close to being replaced in them.* Evernote vs. Markdown: I have been using org mode and or plain text notes for over 20 years. Markdown was a welcome addition to the arsenal, but I tried the Evernote/Microsoft Notes back in the day... just went back to plaintext for notes+todo, it has worked forever and is good enough. Org mode is a very nice and &#34;Fancy&#34; tool on its own. But also easy to get started with.Just some examples. I don&#39;t mean to be overly critical, it is an interesting and fun article about the tools we use as technologists, but it could do with a lot better grounding all around."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Visual Studio was “disrupted” by Sublime Text and TextMate,no it was not. people didn&#39;t migrate from VS to Sublime, they migrated from notepad++ to Sublime. I have never met anyone
who stopped using IDEs once they started, except maybe for VSCode with a few hundred plug-ins to reconstruct an IDE piece-wise (but with much less &#34;integration&#34; between the different plug-ins)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Geopolitically this makes a lot of sense. Will be interesting to see how China reacts as it moves forward.If Intel is serious this time about letting third parties into their fabs then it could be quite the reversal of fortune. However, as I&#39;ve said in the past Intel is most likely to do this with &#34;alternate&#34; process streams, in order to not expose their full capabilities to competitors.High hopes but low expectations. Real estate in AZ could be a good investment though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So they had talks with the EU and disagreed so the news is they are not building a factory in Europe.   I do wonder if the talks had gone amicably, would the story say EU then.I do appreciate for many the terms EU and Europe are interpolatable but in reality they are not.Do also keep in mind that such actions/statements by companies can often be a case of political bargaining and TSMC in effect telling the EU - look we don&#39;t want to be messed about, if your serious then now is the time to decide and if not, we will not delay things any further in your endless talking.Another article upon this matter: https://www.itpro.co.uk/hardware/components/359547/tsmc-eu-c..."</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27173728">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think the big number 1 that trumps all others when building a person website is: focus on writing content.This is by far the hardest part. All the other stuff: it&#39;s just tangential. Wordpress, Blogger, Jekyll, Hugo, Medium, hand-written HTML files: IMHO it doesn&#39;t really matter if you don&#39;t have any content. Just use whatever is easiest to get started with and gets out of your way when writing. For me, personally, it would be writing Markdown in Vim and converting that. For other people, it&#39;s something else.Later, when you actually have some content going you can start focusing on tooling, layout, and so forth. Converting things to another platform usually isn&#39;t too hard. But chances are, you will never actually get any content going. I&#39;ve seen a lot of people create personal websites, write one or two things on it, and then basically don&#39;t do anything with it.I&#39;ve built some websites for various friends/non-profits over the years, and about 90% of the time they never actually wrote any content. These days I ask people to write content first, and then I&#39;ll build the website for them. Most of the time I never hear about it again. That&#39;s okay, it&#39;s really hard to write content and a lot of people (myself included, before I had more experience with this sort of thing) tend to be way too optimistic about it and underestimate just how hard this can be.And people will read your website regardless if your content is good. Is Paul Graham&#39;s website the peak of web design? Not really. People still read it. Dan Luu&#39;s website? Pretty much the most basic HTML file you can get. Still widely read.That being said, if your goal is also to learn more if you&#39;re young or inexperienced: then sure, muck around with these tools all you want. I learned a lot from building my personal website over the years in all sorts of tools (geocities, hand-written HTML, shell scripts, PHP, Python, PHP again but this time with MongoDB, back to shell script, and finally settled Jekyll) and for much of this time I didn&#39;t have a lot of content. That was okay, because I learned a lot from the process."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It’s a good example of how each person’s experience guides their sense of simplicity.This person felt like Wordpress was too complicated, despite it being a system you can use to set up a site with literally no coding at all (using Wordpress.com or one of the many hosting providers with one-click installs). You can live-swap themes to see which one you like, again with just some clicking.Meanwhile he is hand-editing .htaccess files to get the URL structure he wants and switching from JPG to WebP (a change with no real-world SEO value) to try to help SEO.This is not to condemn or criticize! It’s just that when people have experience with having their hands directly on software development, they may be more likely to prefer a web stack that mimics that feel. “Easier” for a coder is going to be different from “easier” for an artist with no coding experience. Look how many artists use Squarespace or Wix for example, which did not even make the list for this effort apparently."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you&#39;re building a personal website from scratch in 2021 (especially a blog), I strongly recommend Hugo (https://gohugo.io) over Jekyll. I had used Jekyll for a decade and very often hit random quirks that have been completely eliminated with modern Hugo. However, there&#39;s a bit of a migration process if you are moving from Jekyll to Hugo despite both being Markdown-based blogs.If you want a more advanced framework for a personal website, I recommend Wowchemy (https://wowchemy.com/) on top of Hugo, which gives the tools needed out-of-the-box like lazy loading/SEO/object-oriented collections, albeit with a massive learning curve."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I remember this article from a year ago. It&#39;s a beautiful piece of prose that really stuck with me, thanks for sharing this again.The first year of my PhD program is ending, and I feel like I&#39;ve been adrift the whole time: floating by without much direction, not doing much more than the bare minimum. I&#39;ve been needing to reevaluate my priorities and find what I should really be doing. I&#39;ve already decided I won&#39;t end up in academia, I couldn&#39;t win the endless pile of tasks. Not sure what I need to learn from this article but learning to make the most of the rest of your life is high on my list :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this piece is really about identity, and what happens when you establish and associate so deeply with an identity that when something challenges it (e.g. the passing of a job opportunity) it turns your world upside down. The author claims to have found peace in motherhood and that the job she was seeking wasn’t even that great, and perhaps the interviewers single minded, and maybe the entire process a little absurd.What I find interesting about this is that looking through the lens of ones ego, this seems like the logical way you would cope with losing a job - just convincing yourself it wasn’t ever really what you wanted"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"People keep saying this is beautify written and stuff, but I feel like I just read a research paper in a topic I don&#39;t know about. Am I just dumb, what am I missing here? I feel genuinely confused about what I just read."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Eh, I can’t be bothered to care. Cellebrite hoards 0-days so they can use them to hack phones. They know about exploitable vulnerabilities but aren’t saying anything about them because they profit from insecurity. Thing is, just because Cellebrite knows about a thing doesn’t mean, say, China’s CCP or the Russian mafia or anyone else doesn’t also know about that thing. You and I are less safe just because Cellebrite wants to profit off of those vulnerabilities.I just can’t work up the ability to sympathize with Cellebrite. The law may have something to say about Moxie’s writing, but in my opinion he has the clear ethical upper ground in this argument."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I disagree with this. Signal isn&#39;t hacking Cellebrite by creating a malformed file that causes Cellebrite&#39;s software to implode.I would be interested in seeing this go in front of a court because Signal isn&#39;t directly targeting any specific person, and the files are fine until they are processed through a specific broken pipeline.If I put a fake USB port on my phone that was a USB zapper to kill the device it&#39;s connected to, it would not be illegal and it would be on the people seizing my phone to take responsibility for it. You cannot repackage vulnerabilities for police and then turn around and play coy because you&#39;re not able to keep your software up to date.In the defense attorney section, the argument shouldn&#39;t be about the PoC but the fact that the PoC shows that Cellebrite&#39;s software is outdated and could be compromised. You can specifically ask for the backup that was extracted from the mobile device to be analyzed by third party software."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wouldn&#39;t find a website where professional lawyers opine on startups and programming especially compelling.I don&#39;t find HN threads where tech folk opine on what their opinion of how the law should be interpreted to be especially compelling either.This is especially true here where I note that the author of the post folks are commenting on has an incredibly notable credentials and frankly it&#39;s somewhat ridiculous for lay-folk to be arguing with someone with such bone fides:Riana [Pfefferkorn] was the Associate Director of Surveillance and Cybersecurity at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society. Prior to joining Stanford, Riana was an associate in the Internet Strategy &amp; Litigation group at the law firm of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &amp; Rosati, where she worked on litigation and counseling matters involving online privacy, Internet intermediary liability, consumer protection, copyright, trademark, and trade secrets and was actively involved in the firm&#39;s pro bono program. Before that, Riana clerked for the Honorable Bruce J. McGiverin of the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico. She also interned during law school for the Honorable Stephen Reinhardt of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.
