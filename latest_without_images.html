								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think the GPU claims are interesting. According to the graph&#39;s footer, the M1 Ultra was compared to an RTX 3090. If the performance/wattage claims are correct, I&#39;m wondering if the Mac Studio could become an &#34;affordable&#34; personal machine learning workstation (which also won&#39;t make the electricity bill skyrocket).If Pytorch becomes stable and easy to use on Apple Silicon [0][1], it could be an appealing choice.[0]: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/47702#issuecomment...
[1]: https://nod.ai/pytorch-m1-max-gpu/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is insane. They claim that its GPU performance tops the RTX 3090, while using 200W less power. I happen to have this GPU on my PC and not only it costs over $3000, but its also very power-hungry and loud.Currently, you need this kind of GPU performance for high resolution VR gaming at 90 fps, but its just barely enough. This means that the GPU will run very loudly and heat up the room, and running games like HL Alyx on max settings is still not possible.It seems that Apple might be the only company who can deliver a proper VR experience. I can&#39;t wait to see what they&#39;ve been cooking up."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"First of all, I&#39;m sorry to learn the author got cancer; I wish her all the best and continued strength.Many contributors have already made good suggestions how to reduce the risk of getting cancer, or how to deal with it; but I found most posts quite _technical_.Speaking in general terms, cancer is not a disease like a common cold. The human body sooner or later is bound to decay, which pretty much starts once one is fully grown, and mutations get less often corrected by the wonderful repair processes our bodies are equipped with. Occasionally, mutations lead to uncontrolled growth of malign tissue, some incidents of which are bound to lead to death, others not.And while it is absolutely a good idea to life healthily and to take care of one&#39;s physical and emotional well-being, one should also never deny that we are all mortals, and cancer as well as traditional diseases can and eventually will wipe any individual out. I am at peace with that, for we need to make space for the next generation (only adding people to planet earth would not be sustainable, as resources are scarce - imagine nobody would ever die). Being on this planet for a limited time period makes it more important to make the right choices, because we have only one life.Because it is a statistical process, we can forecast how many are affected, but not which individual, and everyone can try to minimize one&#39;s chances to be affected, but this does not mean they will live forever. And it&#39;s not just cancer, there are many ways one may pick the unlucky straw: it is not widely known, but the number of people who die from a heath attack in their 20s is significant. Make the best of every minute you have, and live it as if it were your last."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is one of the things where it matters more how healthy/unpolluted your environment is.I&#39;d dare to say that a not-so-phisically-active moderate-smoker living in a less polluted environment has way lower cancer risk than a bio-vegan athlete buddhist monk living in a polluted industrial hellhole.I&#39;d wish we lived in a world where we could actually address chemical, air-particulate +/- microplastics pollution seriously, and stuff like PFOAs that are still used round, without having it be totally overshadowed and drowned in noise by the &#34;fight climate change&#34; crowd or the &#34;extinction rebellion&#34; nutcases....like in, I&#39;d rather have a petrol/gas plant to replace a local COAL power plant FAST, than a nuclear alternative that would take 20 years to get funding and have the delayed-as-usual building process finalized. And I&#39;d rather have all the hydro and windpower we can built asap, and we can figure out later if we really care about the western-golden-lyre-bird or whatever going extinct because of dams or windmills. In the end, tbh, I&#39;ve come to terms with a +5/7 C deg global warming (100y timeframe) happening, but not with me or loved ones dying 20 years earlier of cancer because of chemical and particulate air pollution or god-knows-what from the latest untested and unidentified pan or sportswear coating!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Individually, a person can reduce their cancer risk with a few things like not smoking, and avoiding sunburns, etc.  but that does not eliminate the risk of cancer. It&#39;s not a disease that primarily comes from unhealthy living.That said, there is a toooon of cancer that we can prevent as a society though better public health messaging and better environmental laws, such as creating housing and cities that ban cars, so that we are not continually exposed to pm25 risks."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I tried being a Twitter user for a bit last year, mostly because a lot of engineers I admire use it to communicate about interesting topics and also their work. But after a while, I realized even they will pollute my feed with politically divisive topics, whether it be from them retweeting something, or liking a tweet, or even entering into the fray themselves -- Twitter will find a way to get me to see it. For a while, I resolved &#34;OK, if anyone retweets this stuff, I will simply unfollow them&#34; but eventually this felt self-defeating.I know a lot of folks in my field side by the stance that everything is political, even code. Call me irresponsible, but I&#39;ve honestly led a much happier and stress-free life living in the fantasy world where that is not the case, and I can enjoy my hobby in open-source without Github issues becoming a shouting match that spans 200 comments from people who aren&#39;t even invested in the codebase.EDIT: typos"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Never pass up a chance to keep your mouth shut&#34;Words my Dad taught me as I was growing up, but only really sank in the last 5 or so years ago."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article or ones like it are, IMHO, long overdue.  There is a bias online for people who are always online.  It sounds obvious but &#34;tech&#34; companies and people online ignore or have a blind spot for people who remain offline.  &#34;Tech&#34; companies and avid internet users generally see the world through their computers. If something is not represented online, then it is unlikely to register with them as being relevant.  For example, as alluded to this by this Axios article, the opinions of people who do not express their opinions online.It is rare to find someone online advising readers to ditch their pocket computers and disconnect their laptops.  It would be like a newspaper pre-internet advising readers to stop buying newspapers.  Therefore, everything read online must be weighed against this self-serving bias.  Web traffic is the lifeblood of Google, Facebook and their ilk.  If people go offline, the losses would be substantial.  The civilised world can survive offline, as it did when many of us were born, and for centuries before, but Big Tech and their wannabes cannot.  This is because, generally, they are only internediaries (middlemen).   They sit on a computer network, observe and manipulate traffic of the people who use it.  These companies want people online 24/7.  As the article states only a minority of people have complied.  Contrary to the title, this offline majority is neither new nor silent."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I would like to highlight just how much Apple is focusing on their customers and use cases right now. It seems that they&#39;re targeting products to what their professional customers actually want. And in this case, it&#39;s a 3.7&#34; little thing that can process 18 streams of 8k video (fully specced out). That&#39;s kinda crazy, and they&#39;re doing it at a price point that&#39;s competitive compared to all of the companies out there.Bravo Apple. I&#39;d love to see what they have in store for designers and programmers next."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"More and more I see the M1 chips and I wish Mac worked seriously well for gaming. Would love too see something like Proton but for Mac (given up hopes for native support).I hate that I have my gaming PC and then my Mac for everything else.I have to wonder though what their plan is for the M2. Are they laying the groundwork for when the M2 comes out all of these variants will be ready at the same time? Or a gradual upgrade but the same series (Normal, Pro, Max, and then Ultra) for each."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Looks like all the people saying &#34;just start fusing those M1 CPU&#39;s into bigger ones&#34; were right, that&#39;s basically what they did for the top of the line new M1 CPU (fused two M1 Max&#39;es together).And since the presenter mentioned the Mac Pro would come on another day, I wonder if they&#39;ll just do 4x M1 Max for that."</p>

For Black children nationwide, one in four residing in pre-1950 housing and one in six living in poverty presented with an EBLL ≥5 µg/dL.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was recently horrified to learn that the baby glass bottle I had been using with my baby had lead paint on it. https://tamararubin.com/2021/12/sailor-themed-glass-nuk-baby...Apparently, it&#39;s considered to be acceptable by current standards. Despite the fact that babies will obviously touch the bottle (and the paint) and then put their hands in their mouth. I bought glass bottles because I wanted to avoid plastic thinking it&#39;d be safer and I was reassured by seeing that they were manufactured in Germany :(I think we still have very far to go in terms of toxic substance exposure."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the most heartbreaking things I ever learned about was the high levels of lead in Mexican candy.

Just devastating.https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221499961...&gt; Our results indicate that more than 15% of the population will experience a decrement of more than 5 IQ points from lead exposure. The analysis also leads us to believe that lead is responsible for 820,000 disability-adjusted life-years for lead-induced mild mental retardation for children aged 0 to 4 years."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Large-scale storage clusters like Hadoop, Cassandra, ElasticSearch are generally slow, expensive, hard to set up properly and require a lot of monitoring to stay healthy. Use them only when other solutions won&#39;t do.If your data will fit in a set of text files or a cluster of relational databases, use those. Even if you plan on storing a gazillion TB of data, it&#39;s faster to iterate app logic on nimble storage solutions first, before entertaining something bigger.Where the large scale storage clusters shine is when the sheer scale of data won&#39;t fit in anything else, i.e. there&#39;s no other (sane) choice."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I did a vaguely similar thing once. We once upon a time had a EMR / Hadoop based process that simply joined a some thousands of files of a few kb-ish from S3 each into one big file totaling 20GB or so. It worked, but took a while. After a bit of mucking with it, I noticed that the built-in tools for it used the wrong S3 API for the purpose. I wrote a simple dumb single-threaded Ruby script using the right API, and it ran like 4x faster IIRC.Same lesson - before you reach for Big Data tools, make sure you&#39;ve fully explored simple conventional solutions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Kevin Mandia was always incredible at finding a grade A talent pipeline of IR professionals that enabled Mandiant to always be the folks that responded to the incidents &#34;that mattered&#34; (his words).Their APT-1 report (https://www.mandiant.com/resources/apt1-exposing-one-of-chin... they released in 2013 was at the time unprecedented and brought awareness to nation-state sponsored hacking to a much broader audience than ever before.As someone who worked there in the early days (a little over 100+ employees) as an entry-level peon, I always felt I had the ability to walk into Kevin&#39;s office at anytime and tell him something I thought was important and get attention and respect back.While much of the organization has changed in the last 3 years, the constant has always been Kevin and the amount of work they put in to recover from the disastrous FireEye acquisition, preserve the brand&#39;s integrity, and to parlay that into such a positive acquisition for the employees and shareholders is an incredible outcome.Congratulations to both Google and Mandiant."</p>

Buyers in other countries are in competition with Americans for this oil, so if you really want to keep the price low in America, we should have such a tariff.  Why should we give away our natural resources like this?Additionally: in these emergency times, a reasonable argument could be made for price controls."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Oil&#34; isn&#39;t one product. It differs widely in chemical and physical properties (viscosity, how much sulfur and arsenic is present, etc.) depending on how/where it was produced. Different refineries are setup to refine different grades of oil and the oil is often blended before shipment to meet the specs the refineries expect. It is often cheaper for the US to import the right grade of oil than it would be to  reconfigure the domestic refineries to process all the domestically produced oil.This is also why there are several oil &#34;prices&#34; that you will see quoted, the most common two being WTI and Brent."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;overseas oil, even after shipping costs, is often cheaper than domestically-produced crude + domestic shipping cost&#34; (emphasis mine).One reason that domestic shipping cost is so high is that 1920 Jones Act[0] prohibits shipping between US ports with non-US ships. This drastically reduces competition and increases prices. Hawaii are particularly hit by this, with estimate $1800 per year per family in extra cost [1].[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jones_Act_(sailor_rights)

This is the future, may not seem like it to everyone but this is a part of actually new and extremely useful, passively scalable technology. Imagine (good) unkillable zombie databases- so long as the name of a piece of data is known (its hash)..  someone, somewhere, might make it possible for you to answer your query, without even needing to setup a server setup.. that’s _it_! Not to mention it might be faster than the original source.Pretty damn powerful. The next level above this is a search index that lets the user generate their own results, using their own machine learning algorithm or ranking weights of their own preferences, bc they would have direct access to the DB index and features. People could wrote anti-ad plugins. There could be foss upgrades all the time. Nobody would have to spend a particularly crazy amount of money on storage if they could all just cache the bits they’d needed themselves. Quite remarkable imo!!
