Kudos to HN for being a place  where I can find things that just bring some silly fun to my life.I remember in the early days of the Interwebs, there was so many sites just like this one. You didn&#39;t have to go to FB, IG or some other content mill to find them. Plus, when you did find one, it had the same feeling of excitement as finding a $5 bill on the sidewalk.Here&#39;s some other great sites.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is an observation that goes back to at least Cicero.[1]Cicero on the primary goal of oratory:&#34;As, therefore, the two principal qualities required in an Orator, are to be neat and clear in stating the nature of his subject, and warm and forcible in moving the passions; and as he who fires and inflames his audience, will always effect more than he who can barely inform and amuse them...&#34;Cicero describes the problem the OP reports:&#34;But let us return to Calvus whom we have just mentioned,‚Äîan Orator who had received more literary improvements than Curio, and had a more accurate and delicate manner of speaking, which he conducted with great taste and elegance; but, (by being too minute and nice a critic upon himself,) while he was labouring to correct and refine his language, he suffered all the force and spirit of it to evaporate. In short, it was so exquisitely polished, as to charm the eye of every skilful observer; but it was little noticed by the common people in a crowded Forum, which is the proper theatre of Eloquence.&#34;Nuanced communication not working at scale, 2100 years ago.[1] https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/9776/pg9776-images.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Whenever articles like this about communication crop up, I like to remind people of Wiio&#39;s Laws[0] - from 1978:    1. Communication usually fails, except by accident.
    2. If a message can be interpreted in several ways, it will be interpreted in a manner that maximizes the damage.
    3. There is always someone who knows better than you what you meant with your message.
    4. The more we communicate, the worse communication succeeds.
    5. In mass communication, the important thing is not how things are but how they seem to be.
    6. The importance of a news item is inversely proportional to the square of the distance.
    7. The more important the situation is, the more probable you had forgotten an essential thing that you remembered a moment ago.


Just to reiterate, these laws are over 40 years old, predating any kind of social media or internet-based communication - and they&#39;re still 100% valid.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiio%27s_laws"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As another example, Amazon teams communicate product launch requirements via a future press releases including a FAQ (per description in the book &#34;Working Backwards&#34;). Its a communication intended for the masses with a built-in disambiguation addendum.Our natural languages uses incremental inquiry to disambiguate context as opposed to using strong protocol. In &#34;Working Backwards&#34;, it&#39;s the communicator&#39;s job to solicit questions from co-workers via pain-staking detailed reviews in meetings (&#34;Bezos scrutinizes every single sentence&#34;). I think of it like constructing a representative survey of ambiguity, and then putting answers in the FAQ that help increase clarity. The more detailed and representative your survey, the more helpful your questions/answers will be to communicate nuance.With regard to disambiguating through protocol, Organizations evolve jargon to increment protocol, which probably increases semantic alignment somewhat as group size scales. If you read about the history of language, the Rebus principle created protocols of formal alphabets; protocols like grammar gave us formal writing rules. Protocols like TCPIP let our computers talk. Protocol creates more rigid commitments for communication, but also increases potential semantic alignment. As a thought experiment, if we learned to dynamically and deliberately develop jargons en masse, it might create the channels to disambiguate context and communicate nuance at scale."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I‚Äôve been reading some variant of this, for many years.One of the reasons that I hated being a manager, was because the job involved a lot of sitting around, waiting for stuff to happen.I couldn‚Äôt work on my own projects (because I was on paid work time), and it would have been irresponsible, in the extreme, to put myself into the critical path (because it was no guarantee that I would be able to reliably work). I sometimes tasked myself with projects for work, but they were almost always ignored by my company, and that hurt.I‚Äôve heard that being a soldier in a combat zone is long hours of idleness, punctuated by short periods of terror and stress.That pretty much describes my time as a manager, without the ‚Äúterror‚Äù part (and the bullets and explosions).It sucked.I now work at home, on my own technical tasks. I get a lot done. My personal productivity is through the roof.I take a lot of breaks. Sometimes, I even nap.But I don‚Äôt have a time clock. I will often start coding, at 6AM (sometimes, before I even get in the shower, after my morning exercise), and will continue to code, until I hit the sack. I often test my software, while I‚Äôm sitting in bed, and will enter issues, from my iPad.When I have a problem that I‚Äôm chasing, or I am in the middle of a big implementation phase, I can work for many hours, straight. I will barely come up for air, and I feel absolutely exhausted, when I finally step back (nap time!).I‚Äôm not particularly concerned about a measured life. I get a lot done; far more than I ever did, when I was being paid.And I‚Äôm having a blast."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Valuable prospective, but (as is the gist of half my comments here): People are even more different than you think.RescueTime wrote a similar post, but +100 data:https://rescuetime.wpengine.com/work-life-balance-study-2019...Look at the second histogram. The average is roughly aligned with OP‚Äôs summary, but there is huge variance. These comments have already devolved into people telling each other they are lying, or about to burn out - all I ask is humility in the face of our messy shared reality.Thank you for listening to my TED Talk, I guess"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article resonated with my experience as as software developer.At my first place, a small outsourcing shop, employees were required to log daily activities so hours per day roughly fit to 8 and 40 per week. From the beginning and unlike most of coworkers, I measured my time precisely with https://github.com/Klaster1/timer-5 and soon understood that doing 8 hours per day doesn&#39;t happen much and often involves staying late, so instead I simply adjusted the reported numbers to look plausible. In four years, I only received positive feedback on my productivity. What was the management thinking, I have no idea, just like the article says, this was a farce all around.When I changed the company, the habit to measure productivity stuck. Nowadays, I start working somewhere at 9 and finish at 18, and result is still the same - honest 8 hours of work activity per day happen at best once a month, the average week sums to 30-34 hours. Code-related activities never take more than 3-4 hours per day, that includes both coding and reviews. I get the impression that some of my colleagues might spend more time on the job, but low productivity was never a topic of my performance reviews, management seems content with what they get."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m pleased to announce that Black is finally non-beta software! :party:!Change log:  https://black.readthedocs.io/en/latest/change_log.htmlGoing forward we&#39;ll follow our stability policy (https://black.readthedocs.io/en/latest/the_black_code_style/...).Work continues as usual with bugfixes and enhancements, but style changes are now introduced under our new `--preview` CLI switch. This allows us to evolve Black&#39;s style without too much disruption to users that want consistency. The default style is updated yearly.Thanks to our maintainers for orchestrating the efforts, especially to our most recent reinforcement Batuhan (@isidentical) who was responsible for our match statement support! A hearty thank you to all of our contributors for pushing Black forward, and to our users for being the reason we do it!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not a big fan of automatic code formatters, unless they get somewhat more configurable. One simple example is line length. Usually a code formatter will break long lines, for example a function call with some arguments. But what if I have a log call there? Do I want to have that log span 3-6 rows, just because the silly formatter thought it is a long line? Well it is a long line, but I don&#39;t want to break it into multiple lines, as that would give that log call waaaay too much space. When the log call spans multiple lines, it distracts from the bits of code between log calls. Another example is, that these code formatters are often configured wrongly in people&#39;s code editors to reformat everything in the whole file. That adds lots of changes and people do not afterwards separate their commits for &#34;only reformatting&#34; and the actually important bits of their changes.As PEP8 already says: &#34;A Foolish Consistency is the Hobgoblin of Little Minds&#34;. An automatic code formatter is the epitome of consistency, as it applies the rules everywhere the same way. In many places it might give some benefits, but in others it will ruin the original code formatting. I am experienced enough to format my code in a readable way and I don&#39;t need it reformatted, just because someone has to try out some tool. Especially log calls. Those are a pet peave of mine."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember we migrated 2+ million LoC to being formatted by Black at Dropbox.Our Livegrep instance with a custom Git blame implementation always crashed at the commit made to do the migration :-) We had to pause our merge queue because we didn&#39;t want to run into conflicts, and I remember the `git push` ended up taking a while.There was only one change that we had to make to Black to get it working on our codebase - https://github.com/psf/black/commit/024c9cab55da7bd3236fd887...Glad to see it&#39;s now stable."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So True !
After 25+ years of coding, I know one thing. I STILL don&#39;t know how to &#34;code correctly&#34;.And apart from a few gifted individuals (Rob Pike, Fabrice Bellard Bobby Bingham [ffMpeg team] etc) I&#39;m HIGHLY suspicious of ppl and programmers who claim &#34;they can program correctly&#34; and that &#34;this xyz is the correct way/stack/method/arch&#34;.Background:CS grad, start coding at around 13 (thank you dad !) I am well versed in C,C++,PHP,Go,TypeScript and to a lesser degree Java and a few bits and bobs in between F#,Haskell,LISP...The above is not to brag (not that it&#39;s brag worthy after 25 years you bound to pick up a few tools) just to put it in perspective.On Code quality:
I&#39;ve noticed it&#39;s easy to agree/identify the &#34;extreme cases&#34; the VERY VERY BAD CODING and the very very GOOD CODING. But most of the coders and codebases falls somewhere in between where the code-quality-water quickly gets murky.PS2. Oh and on &#39;code reviews&#39;: It would be cool if code-reviews were done &#34;anonymously&#34; i.e I should not know until the very end WHO wrote the code. Helps to keep any personal biases at bay - my 2cents.The best thus far advise I&#39;ve seen on code-quality guidelines is from a comment on HN:&gt;I try to optimize my code around reducing state, coupling, complexity and code, in that order. I&#39;m willing to add increased coupling if it makes my code more stateless. I&#39;m willing to make it more complex if it reduces coupling. And I&#39;m willing to duplicate code if it makes the code less complex. Only if it doesn&#39;t increase state, coupling or complexity do I dedup code.Source: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11042400Sure I might just be a dumb idiot or completely not gifted in the &#34;art or science&#34; of coding. :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Coding is a highly subjective and creative endeavor. &#34;Clean code&#34; is akin to &#34;well written&#34; for writers. Sure, you can analyze and even be able to define some good practices, but because we are always creating something new that has never done before, and the field is infinitely complex, no rules can be set in stone and applied across everything.In my opinion there&#39;s nothing wrong with calling code clean, we don&#39;t have to analyze every line of code we write. There&#39;s just too many things to consider and viewpoints to take, we&#39;d be trapped in analysis paralysis forever, as you can continue it to no end. There&#39;s never a point where the analysis will be &#34;done&#34;. You just have to be able to recognize when the analysis reaches a point of diminishing returns, and when moving on is the better option. Sometimes just calling it &#34;clean&#34; is enough."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Uncle Bob Martin definition of &#34;clean code&#34; from his book &#34;Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship&#34; is a set of rules that absolutely are not at odds with one another. If you follow them you will end up with code that&#39;s really nice to read and easier to maintain, and, most importantly, that you can confidently change.There&#39;s a decent summary here - https://gist.github.com/wojteklu/73c6914cc446146b8b533c0988c..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Commenters in this thread are making a lot of generalizations about tax structures and so on, but it important to keep in mind this is a special case at a number of levels.  Pittsburgh has an unusually large number of bridges.  These bridges were built during times of relative wealth when the local steel and related industries were doing well.  Since the decline of American industry Pittsburgh has scaled way back and had to rebuild itself as a medical and technology center.  This recovery is mostly a success story, but the infrastructure cannot be maintained.  For example, the greater Pittsburgh area has some of the first suburban areas to be completely abandoned with services withdrawn, Penn Hills being a poignant example of this.  Obviously no bridges should be coming down, but there is a real problem here of how to build and maintain a modern city that is smaller than the older one that it replaces."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Its stuff like this that scares me. Pittsburgh claims to have more bridges than any other city in the world.[0] You&#39;re driving around here, and you cross little ones without noticing.

The rivers are big here.[0] https://www.bbc.com/news/av/magazine-30187252Edit: not bridge related, but a sinkhole opened downtown over 2 years ago, also swallowing a bus: https://www.post-gazette.com/news/transportation/2019/10/28/..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lot of talk about the Federal government need to step into a city and manage the bridges.Cities have (often highly) paid inspectors to do just that, inspect bridges and make recommendations, and issue warnings.  As noted by PascLeRasc et al. the degradation of the bridge has been reported to the city.As for funding through Federal government, my experience has always been:The resident pays their Federal tax.  The Fed takes their administrative cut.Fed allocates remaining funds to the State. The State takes their administrative cut.State allocates remaining funds to the City (or county).  The city takes their administrative cut.City allocates remaining funds to contractors to fix the bridges.Put it in an other way, humans value things exponentially more when their own sweat went into the things, than if it was just given to them.  By coming at State level, residents have a closer connection and understanding where the money came from, and would demand higher accountability.Just my opinion."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is nice initiative and any attempt to make mathematics more accessible is a  value added to society in my book. However, saying you will learn &#34;mathematical thinking&#34; by watching 1.5 hours of passively watching, even Professor Tao, is quite an overpromise. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a subject that requires more hands on practice and thinking than math, especially higher level math, so this is more along the lines of edutainment. So in my mind, how valuable this course is depends on what this content replaces for you. If watching this series replaces something distracting then its great, but if it replaces actually doing problems and working out proofs, then it&#39;s not worth it.Finally there&#39;s a celebrity aspect to Masterclass that&#39;s a bit strange. Like these guys are famous, and because they&#39;re famous, they are the most worthy to teach you something.Some series you should check out that are free and IMO provide much better value for time:Academy of Achievement: https://achievement.org/
* Some good lessons with Eric Lander, Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos and Demis Hassabis3B1B: https://www.3blue1brown.com/Numberphile: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoxcjq-8xIDTYp3uz647V5A"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Watching the trailer, makes me think that people who may enjoy this series will also enjoy a book called &#34;Aha&#34; by Martin Gardner (from probably 40 years ago)[0].It has a lot of amusingly illustrated insight problems that show you how thinking about a problem differently simplifies getting to the answer a lot.  It&#39;s probably aimed at advanced teenagers, but in fact the lessons there are some that even many adults probably have not come across before.  I mean, I haven&#39;t watched the Masterclass, but I imagine Terrence Tao isn&#39;t teaching multimanifold group theory or something anyway, so this is the kind of insightful more daily-math problems he&#39;s helping people to understand how to think about.[0] search your favorite, ahem, LIBrary GENeric source of books to find it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My first reaction to this blog post was kind of negative because Master Class is not free. I watched the teaser video and it&#39;s actually pretty inspiring. As someone who has done undergraduate Computer Science level Math, but completely forgotten most things about Math except for simple Algebra, I am going to try this.The cost is ‚Ç¨16/month which is cheaper than Netflix. I just cancelled my Spotify recently so this is affordable for me right now.EDIT: The problem I see with Master Class as a subcription service is... if you watch Master classes on everything you are getting a broad education rather than a deep dive. I guess it&#39;s more for entertainment though."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recently quit Twitter (almost[0]) and have been much happier ever since.It seems (to me) that the way Twitter increases &#34;engagement&#34; is to show you the tweets that will upset you the most, so that you can either reply with an angry thing of your own, or furiously &#34;like&#34; other angry responses.I tried to unfollow a lot of people who tend to post about controversial topics but Twitter keeps showing me their tweets or similar ones from other people. It also insists on showing me things that are popular but that don&#39;t concern me (such as sports).There doesn&#39;t seem to be a way to see only the tweets of the people you follow. And even if there was... random thoughts and bits from people I don&#39;t know are seldom interesting, and very unnecessary.At some point I thought I was addicted to Twitter; but it turned out it&#39;s the easiest addiction to get rid of.[0] &#34;Almost&#34;: I didn&#39;t delete the account: I just logged out and stopped using Twitter completely."</p>
