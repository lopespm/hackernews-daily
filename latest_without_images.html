								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In Germany Amazon pressured third-party sellers to use their fulfillment/warehousing service, which would reveal to them where those sellers source their goods from. They then just went to those sources and offered them a better deal, cutting out the third-party seller. So basically third-party sellers are doing free market research for Amazon: They take on the entrepreneurial risk and if they&#39;re successful Amazon will know exactly how many goods they sell to which customers and from who they get those goods. They can then use that information in their own product strategy and simply take over the business of their most profitable sellers. Really clever strategy IMHO, albeit not very fair."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;we decided to only partner with the manufacturers of our reference product.” - so not only are they copying a product and ranking their replacement above the original, they also put themselves into a position to influence the manufacturer of the original."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The grocery stores I visit do the same in the Netherlands, maybe even worse, especially the biggest one here, Albert Hein (Ahold), is very skilled at it. They copy the most popular products, sell them slightly cheaper, similar designs as the most popular brand, then go on and display their products at eye height and move the big brands down. Yet every court case against them they&#39;ve won. And the sentiment is far less negative about them than Amazon. They have a similar significant market share (35% of grocery market) as Amazon here. Maybe in the end, it&#39;s slightly more ethical since their strategy is mostly at the cost of the big corporates (Unilever) who can handle and fight them and not the smaller companies; and arguably, the consumer wins in the end."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"APT&#39;s progress bar does have issues though. When you shrink the terminal when the progress bar is visible, you&#39;re going to have gibberish in the terminal. That&#39;s because the terminal commands to move the cursor by lines work on visual lines, not semantic lines, so they aren&#39;t invariant under the operation of resizing the terminal window. That&#39;s a really rough area of Linux terminals: when you resize a window, the terminal is going to rewrap the lines according to semantic lines (based on line feed characters), so it&#39;s clear that all major terminals understand this distinction, but the terminal API doesn&#39;t give applications access to moving by semantic lines, so we&#39;re left with bugs like these.I think PowerShell has the concept of progress reporting specially recognized? That sounds like a good idea. It could be used to render a GUI progress bar and leave the pipeline alone, for the objects. That&#39;s just my vague idea, since I didn&#39;t spend much time with PowerShell."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those who wonder how these &#34;\033[1A...&#34; notations are specified, look up &#34;ANSI escape code&#34; on the net, e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s good to know the underlying low-level terminal commands that make this work like this article explains. But I guess most people will use a terminal abstraction library that has a higher level API to move the cursor, clean the screen etc.Terminals are complex beasts and they can do powerful things. If you&#39;re interested in this, I can recommend reading the source code for Tmux, JLine3 and some other libraries shell formatting or TUI libraries."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"One strange aspect of this: It happened slightly before midnight.  Generally speaking meteors are more common in the morning hours, between midnight and noon.  Those of us between midnight and noon are on the &#34;front&#34; side of the planet at the earth moves around the sun.  That is why most are seen in the early morning.  They are still there during daylight but we are less likely to see them.  After noon we are moving onto the &#34;lee&#34; side, the back side of the planet that gets less meteors.  This one hit just before midnight, right at that line between front and back sides."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Technically, when someone does a Google search for “Williams Sonoma Cast Iron Skillet,” they probably would have clicked on one of the first 10 organic results, EVERY ONE OF WHICH leads to their website. But, y’know what ol’ Billy Ma’s performance marketers couldn’t then do: prove their value to their bosses.&gt; [picture of that search term and williams sonoma ads with shopping links]The main problem here is that if Williams Sonoma was not advertising on that search term, Lodge and Food52 etc etc would, and then those companies would be above the Williams Sonoma organic placements.The spend is necessary in a defensive way because Google creates a bidding war even for the hyper relevant.edit: I just checked and if you search &#34;williams sonoma skillet&#34;, if WS was not paying for [green] then the very first &#34;result&#34; (ad) would be Food52 [red] https://imgur.com/a/9Nnxs6hI just tried &#34;airbnb paris&#34; and the first result is, somewhat predictably, an ad that is not airbnb. But the second one is also an ad, this time from airbnb. So they clearly didn&#39;t keep their spend dialed down to zero, and are aware of the need to advertise on their own keyword."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are so many holes in these arguments that you could drive a truck through it. Which is so infuriating, because a big part of my professional career consisted of watching all of Rand&#39;s SEO videos and really appreciating them. I really thought he was a genius. But then over the past few years, he started sharing more general views on entrepreneurship, and those takeaways just didn&#39;t really make much sense. Basically, his own VC-funded company turned into a shit show and suddenly he started advocating against VC in general (as opposed to taking an honest look at the mistakes that his company made). So in the past few years, I tried to reconcile in my head: how can a genius make such imperfect conclusions? My initial takeaway was that he&#39;s blinded by his own mistakes and shifting the blame, which seems perfectly reasonable and understandable. Frankly, I would probably feel and act the same way.But after reading this article, it finally dawned on me. He makes imperfect conclusions in everything he touches, it&#39;s just that in some fields those conclusions can be more easily proved to be wrong than in others. SEO is the perfect field where a polished presenter can get away with imperfect conclusions for years - trust me, I know, I made a living for years in this field, and I am very familiar with the nature of this work. Most of the time, you have no idea what the black box really does, and instead you&#39;re just trying to guess what might have happened. Most importantly, there are many ways to skin a cat in SEO, and just because your approach is net positive doesn&#39;t mean that you truly are delivering the global maximum (or that the net positive gain was ROI positive). In short, it&#39;s impossible to know who&#39;s right and who&#39;s wrong, and Rand&#39;s videos convinced me that he&#39;s right, but I am no longer sure. I just rewatched one of them, and can easily see how his conclusions are just... opinions.While we may or may never find out if his SEO opinions were the global maximum, we can quantifiably demonstrate that his opinions on content marketing are not solid. This whole essay he wrote can be replaced with &#34;hey performance marketers, don&#39;t trust the platform numbers and instead do your incrementality studies.&#34; Platforms like Facebook will give you those for free if you reach a certain spend level, and you can also get them from 3rd party providers like measured.com. In other words, if you&#39;re a performance marketer and you&#39;re not conducting incrementality studies, then you&#39;re very early in your career and are not following the best practices. Simple as that - no need to extrapolate from there and reach all sorts of additional conclusions (which is obviously a pattern in Rand&#39;s behavior) - calling into question a perfectly investable marketing channel, conflating the needs of a public company with everyone else&#39;s needs, using words like scam, etc.I am really disappointed to have to write this, but you would have been better off not reading this article. If Rand is really advocating that the majority of entrepreneurs should follow his advice and focus on PR instead of performance marketing, then perhaps an honest thing to ask would be - how is that working out for his own company? AFAIK, SparkToro is nowhere close to replicating the growth of his previous company, which is honestly disappointing for someone with such a huge reach and name recognition."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Related: I happened to be acquainted with a founder of one of the major coupon sharing sites, after they’d sold it for a rumored 8-9-figure sum.It didn’t make sense to me that it could be so attractive to brands to promote coupons there. People have already decided they want to buy the product; why would you want them to go hunting for a big discount after they’re already sold?He told me that the people who like it are the advertising staff and consultants, so they can generate evidence for their to their bosses/clients that their campaigns are working.I get that it can be partially effective. Sometimes I’ll think “I’ll buy this product if I can find a coupon that gets the price under X”.It’s just a funny old world when an advertising professional is motivated to spend money with a third party to give their customer a big discount on a product they’ve already decided they want, in order for the advertising professional to justify their existence."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; The idea of implementing a CPU core inside an FPGA is not new, of course.Indeed. I took a computer engineering class in undergrad. The capstone project was implementing from scratch a multi-pipeline RISC CPU (including the ALU and a very basic L1 cache) in Verilog that we flashed to FPGAs that we then programmed to play checkers using hand-compiled C. The FPGA was easier to flash and debug than the Spartan-6 mentioned in TFA but was significantly more expensive as well.It was a brutal class, but it totally demystified computers and the whole industry in a way that made me feel like I really could understand the &#34;whole&#34; stack. Nothing scares me any more, and I no longer fear &#34;magic&#34; in software or hardware."</p>

The chip shortage and general lack of breakthrough gains in processing aside from Zen has stalled the upgrade cycles a bit, giving Framework time to dig its heel into the ground without being having to deal with new internal components.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The best cold starts are those which aren&#39;t noticed by the user. For my blog search (which runs on Lambda), I found a nice way of achieving that [1]: as soon as a user puts the focus to the input field for the search text, this will already submit a &#34;ping&#34; request to Lambda. Then, when they submit the actual query itself, they will hit the already running Lambda most of the times.And, as others said, assigning more RAM to your Lambda than it actually may need itself, will also help with cold start times, as this increases the assigned CPU shares, too.[1] https://www.morling.dev/blog/how-i-built-a-serverless-search..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My experience with cold starts in Azure Functions Serverless is pretty awful. Like most other Azure services, their affordable consumer grade offerings are designed from the ground up not to be good enough for &#34;serious&#34; use.Cold start times compared to Lambda are worse, and in addition, we would get random 404s which do not appear in any logs; inspecting these 404s indicated they were emitted by nginx, leading me to believe that the ultimate container endpoint was killed for whatever reason but that fact didn&#39;t make it back to the router, which attempted and failed to reach the function.Of course the cold start and 404 are mitigated if you pay for the premium serverless or just host their middleware on their own App Service plans (basically VMs)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At my last job we built an entire API on top of serverless. One of the things we had to figure out was this cold start time. If a user were to hit an endpoint for the first time, it would take 2x as long as it normally would at first. To combat this we wrote a &#34;runWarm&#34; function that kept the API alive at all times.Sure kind of defeats the purpose of serverless but hey, enterprise software."</p>

Balena manage all the complicated stuff around rolling out updates, keeping the OS up to date, logging etc, and give some nice debug tooling.
