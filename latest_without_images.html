								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a Swiss working in Bangkok (I&#39;m fluent in Thai). So I&#39;m quite a bit acustomed to people cheating in many situations of life. When we started hiring a couple of Indian coworkers for management level as well as data science roles, I became close friends to the whole group.Whenever we discussed frauds like that, I always said that we shouldn&#39;t think people (or Indians in particular) wanna game the systems and not everyone would act in malicious self beneficial ways, tricking systems like that. But: Whenever I held this position in our discussions, my indian friends smiled at me. They were the ones saying that you usually can&#39;t trust a bunch of people to follow rules there. That most would simply game the system for their own benefit. I tried arguing that this is probably the same for all human beings, if they just have the chance and live in a system where there are no (or little) consequences of doing this.
They kept arguing that it&#39;s part of the indian mindset to just game systems like that, from state schemes, to work to anything.
It&#39;s shocking how one nation can see themselves in such a negative way.I still believe though that Swiss or Indians or whatever nation doesn&#39;t matter. Humans will game systems if the circumstances are right."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"These days it might be better to teach new users about ‘git switch’ and ‘git restore’ (added in Git 2.23, released 2019-08-16) rather than the two overloaded meanings of the confusing ‘git checkout’ command.https://git-scm.com/docs/git-switchhttps://git-scm.com/docs/git-restore"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"About 8 years ago, I blogged a very brief guide to using git for a solo developer. A lot of people seemed to like it.A couple times since then, I&#39;ve noticed there was something I was using that wasn&#39;t in it, but that could be added without making it significantly longer or more complicated. So there were a couple of updates.I did another one today, and had the thought that since this guide now includes the benefit of 8 years of practical experience in actually using it, while still essentially being &#34;Git In Two Minutes&#34;, it might be worth posting to HN. So here it is.It doesn&#39;t say anything about github. It really is for a solo developer who wants to start using git in a very painless way. With the additional goal that you can profitably use git for years without going beyond the described features.https://www.garyrobinson.net/2014/10/git-in-two-minutes-for-..."</p>

Some times however you&#39;ll want 15&#39; clearance so that you can drive delivery trucks to the stores under them. But overall it just makes a lot of sense. In California at least I&#39;ve seen these projects get killed by squabbling between the person willing to fund the work, the management company/developer that currently has the lease rights to the location, and the underlying land owner who is leasing the land to the developer. I have suggested to my representatives that perhaps something like the &#34;you must approve this sort of plan&#34; laws that would facilitate California&#39;s commitment to becoming 100% renewable."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For engine nerds, you should check out Automation - The Car Company Tycoon Game [1]. It is basically a car builder simulator where you go through every aspect of developing a car - chassis design, suspension, engine..I spent hours tuning and building exotic engines. 6 liter turbo inline 3? 1 liter NA V12? Only your imagination is the limit.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQpfvliszx4Bonus: You can export your vehicles directly in BeamNG.drive and test them on the track."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sounds amazing, would love for something like this for racing sims (CPUs these days have more cores than good uses for those cores...)For the gotchas - I&#39;d guess that the exhaust manifolds would make a huge difference in terms of sound, and they seem hard to simulate. For example, engineers tune the individual per-cylinder exhaust distance - this way, the exhaust fumes from each individual cylinder align nicely once the exhaust from each cylinder merge into the final exhaust pipe. Otherwise, if, for example, the firing pattern is 1-5-..., then the air from cylinder 1 might arrive to the exhaust pipe at the same time as air from cylinder 5, given high RPMs and limited speed of sound.And the fluid dynamics of the cylinders are something that is extremely critical to modern cars, too. And I&#39;d guess that this is where things like misfires can be simulated.Disclaimer - this is all based on my highly unsophisticated mental model,"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"80,000 Hz rigid body simulation! That&#39;s amazing. Seems like the only output of the simulation that&#39;s used in sound generation is the graph of exhaust pressure. He&#39;s adding white noise to the output. I wonder if it would be possible to replace the white noise by reading the vibrations of the various rigid bodies directly out of the simulation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In studies such as these with huge intersubject variability, and probably also quite large intrasubject variability from day to day on many scales, it makes sense to look at change from baseline for individuals in the various groups rather than just differences in raw scores between treatment groups.It seems by a cursory glance that most analyses done were of the latter kind, and I think then a study such as this, with low N, is expected to not show very much effect of any kind. (Since the intersubject variability and potentially also the natural intrasubject variability for most measured scales seem higher than any expected treatment effect).I am almost certain that e.g. none of the approved and quite convincingly working SSRI:s would have shown any efficacy in a study with this design and similar N."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m sort of surprised they didn&#39;t extract/synthesize psilocybin directly and administer that. Decades ago, I grew a few batches of P. Cubensis.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"(It&#39;s strange that we&#39;re using the term microdose, even in scientific contexts - prefixes have meanings - it should be called a decidose.)Anecdotally, I&#39;ve had a degree of short term success treating my depression with smallish doses of mushrooms, but I&#39;ve never had the continuing access required for a microdosing regiment.It&#39;d be nice if the government were willing to come to the table on this, but alas.That said, every time that I&#39;ve had a months long lift, it hasn&#39;t been a small dose, but an epic dose that often cast me into a night of turmoil.(Which would make the rigours of double-blind testing completely ineffectual.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Thanks for the kind mention!I am Stephane, the person behind that website/project. I see a lot of people having concerns about the title - Background Sound Canceller - and they are right. That title is not mine, but poster&#39;s own.I describe my project as &#34;Background Noise Generators&#34;, or sometimes as as &#34;Non-Distracting Noises and Music&#34;.They are not sound cancellers but sound maskers.The idea is to create a noise you like, to mask a sound that you don&#39;t want to hear. Your colleagues, tinnitus, ... anything.Because these noise generators are designed to be non-distracting, there is a big chance that your brain will not even hear them after a couple of minutes... but they will keep masking the nuisance you wanted to het rid of in the first place. That is the magic exploited by the project. Create these sonic &#34;focus bubbles&#34;.Happy listening."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I expected a website offering to use your microphone to record, invert and cancel background noise via the speakers. Turns out the website is offering prerecorded sounds instead, not really cancelling anything. Still though, surely someone has tried my idea? It would likely need some adjustability to match the phase delay between microphone and ears-via-speakers but I guess it could work."</p>

Please known that VLA is about the typing not about the storage.The line:    typedef int T[n];

is the essence of VLA-ness, not `int A[n]`. The array of VLA type can have any kind of storage one wants.It can be stack    T a;

It can be heap    T *a = malloc(sizeof *a);

It can be even infamous alloca()    T *a = alloca(sizeof *a);

Please stop talking about this &#34;VLA is stack-base vector&#34; crap because it means that one does not understand what VLAs are about. I admin that automatic VLAs are pretty much always wrong but this use case is a tiny bit of the realy functionality of VLA types.VLA were added to language to handle multidimensional arrays.And the really shine at this task. Even C++ has not good alternative for it. Vector of vectors is a really crappy data structure.A few examples when working with square matrices:- allocation on stack    float A[n][n];

- allocation on heap    float (*A)[n] = malloc(sizeof(int[n][n]));
    ...
    free(A);

- indexing    A[i][j]

- passing to functions:    void add(int n, float A[static n][n], float B[static n][n], float RES[restrict static n][n]);

    ...

Please show me something as simple, effective, self-documenting and elegant in C++."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; So Google Duo is being rebranded to Google Meet, and the existing Google Meet app is sticking around for a bit. That means there are now two apps called &#34;Google Meet.&#34; Google has a help article detailing this extremely confusing situation, calling the two Meet apps &#34;Google Meet (original): The updated Meet app&#34; and &#34;Google Meet: The updated Duo app.&#34; The &#34;Google Meet (original)&#34; app will someday be put out to pasture; it&#39;s just sticking around while Google rebuilds the meeting functionality on top of Google Duo. Did everyone follow that?I&#39;m in stitches; dying of laughter over here. Folding together apps to reduce the number of chat apps if probably a good thing, but renaming them to an existing name while the old app is still around? Even Microsoft had the decency to tack on &#34;for business&#34; when they were butchering Skype&#39;s branding!On a more serious note, I&#39;ll be interested to see how this affects the business side of things; will Google Workspace keep Meet, and what Meet will it be?EDIT: Reading through the linked help article, they talk about Google Workspace under the section for the new &#34;Meet&#34; nee Duo and not under the section for &#34;Google Meet (original)&#34;, so I guess they have or will transition it.
