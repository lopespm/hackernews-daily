								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Amazingly enough it’s not even possible to be sure you’re buying a legitimate Kindle book anymore.I often buy classic books but want a particular edition which might include specific notes or a translation by a specific writer, but following the Amazon search - actually clicking on a link where I’ve constructed the search with meticulous attention to the terms that are essential to me - will often lead to a totally random result from an unknown ‘publisher’ which meets none of my criteria and wasn’t the link that was presented to me.Obviously all the reviews are bunched haphazardly together - including the ones that praise the translation which the presented book doesn’t include, and the ones warning about poor formatting from the pirated edition.If Amazon can’t even sell Kindle titles without commingling, then it blows my mind people buying electronics from them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To me, this is a leading indicator that Amazon&#39;s ecommerce side will falter. When I look at the reviews for an item, some reviews are high and people are happy, and other people have terrible experiences that doesn&#39;t even seem to be for the same item. I think it&#39;s because of this issue, where Amazon lets 3rd seller to claim that they have inventory for something.I really don&#39;t trust Amazon for a lot of things now, and would rather go directly to the seller on their site. Especially now that I&#39;ve gotten older, I just want less stuff but with higher quality."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Silk Road was not directly selling drugs, it was only a marketplace where other sellers did it, and for this reason it was taken down. AFAIK selling a counterfeit item is a crime too, so shouldn’t Amazon be treated the same ? One could argue that the Silk Road was created with the purpose of enabling the crime, unlike Amazon, but with the problem becoming bigger every day I think that Amazon knows about it very well but doesn’t act because it is against their economic interest, making it complicit of the crime"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I saw a reference to Martin Gardner&#39;s article when I was in, maybe, 9th grade.So I went to the main branch of the NY public library (&#34;reading between the lions&#34;) and looked up the article on microfiche. It was fascinating and fun - from how to make a row of equilateral triangles with nothing more than a ruler, pen and paper. Many, many hours were spent on the various flexagon derivatives.Years later, I made a JS page to combine images and print hexaflexagons for my son&#39;s classmates. Had some fun with that as well; it was much more confounding than I expected.Nowadays, microfiche is gone, the public library is unfortunately not in most kids vernacular, and the attention span that would be required to enjoy doing the math I did has been hijacked.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A few years back I was going through some old floppy disks I found in a box and, on one of them, I found a screenshot I took of my desktop circa winter of 2000. In it was a window open with a MUD I was logged into at the time. Another window had Winamp open with a playlist of songs and another window had ICQ open. The only reason I took it was because there was an unofficial competition between our pub and another pub elsewhere on the MUD about which was more popular, and we had finally surpassed them.It&#39;s amazing how many emotions seeing that one image gave me. But the biggest was just this overwhelming sense of nostalgia. As I looked at that, I could remember what I was thinking, what I was feeling, everything that was happening in my super confusing teenage life at that time. Occasionally I will look at that image now, even 22 years later, I can still feel all those feeling again.Of course, my ex&#39;s character is in the screenshot too. So, a bit bittersweet as well. :/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve gotten mixed reactions whenever I share this, but when I program I like to record my screen with OBS.* It&#39;s a mental hack to keep me accountable, especially now working from home. If I&#39;m in an office anyone can look over and see whether or not I&#39;m working. It started as an attempt to mimic this feeling at home, even though I&#39;ll be the only one to ever see the recordings.* It allows me to go back and see how I worked in the past. I have a few videos of myself working from 2015 which I think is pretty neat just because of how different my workflow was back then compared to now. I&#39;m not using the same tools or even on the same operating system.* I&#39;m working on video games which is what makes this very useful for me. If something visually interesting happens, or if there&#39;s graphical bug of some kind, I can go back and breakdown exactly what happened. I&#39;ve stepped through videos frame by frame in the past to debug, it&#39;s been surprisingly helpful.* It allows me to go back and see my progress. I can know what I was working on a given day, see how far I&#39;ve progressed, it&#39;s just generally a good motivator. You can of course do this with git, but if you&#39;re working on something visual it can be nice to see it in motion rather than a textual diff."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For my creative coding projects (which are usually looping animations) I&#39;ve set up scripts that export a short video at every git commit. Going back and seeing things develop is quite satisfying, and also useful if I stumbled upon a configuration that I like and want to branch from"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Pushy pop-ups, &#34;do it now&#34;, flashy colors, and all that stuff.
Things that work like a charm in e-commerce or fashion will most likely not work on devs.Not just &#39;not work&#39;, but &#39;actively repel&#39;. A popup chat bot or a survey form request (during or after using a website or software product) or anything not germane to the task that has a shadow or notification highlight has slowly but surely become a form of wart that elicits a deep, instinctual disgust from me. I&#39;d even say an unhealthy and unreasonable level of disgust.It&#39;s enough to get me to instantly despise a product almost nomatter how well it does its original job.But 100 folks who actually click ads or interact with these distraction baubles (mistakenly or otherwise) are worth thousands of people like me, so I understand why it won&#39;t ever change for the better out of a company&#39;s own volition.---When it comes to advertising, say, developer tooling, I think a large part of the problem is that there&#39;s just not going to be a lot of relevant tools out there, for my job or hobbies, that I either don&#39;t already know about (and aren&#39;t using because I have already evaluated its prospects) or... I am already using it. Conversely, seeing ads for something I am already using has potential for negative effects (see above). Tasteful advertising is thus useful for the rare case of something I don&#39;t know about, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth it when 999/1000 of these ads are detrimental and irrelevant."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In my experience, high-quality educational content works much better than paid ads when targeting developers.One of the best examples I&#39;ve seen is digital ocean. When ever I google a sys admin type question, there is a digital ocean article as the top result."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I work on EthicalAds, one of the ad networks mentioned in the post. We focus on targeting relevant developer-focused ads to content rather than to individuals.The post is great. My only nitpick is that the author mentions that they think retargeting will go away. The scope of retargeting might be reduced especially as third-party cookies stop working but I don&#39;t think retargeting will completely go away. Big ad companies with whom visitors have a direct relationship with (Google, FB) will always be able to do it. They know the pages on their sites and those linked from their site that visitors visit and they will use it to target ads. They don&#39;t need third-party cookies since they have first-party cookies.Networks that just do ads and don&#39;t have relationships with visitors except for advertising will find it harder and harder. At EthicalAds, we don&#39;t do retargeting at all because of our privacy focus, but many ad networks will find retargeting more challenging (less precise, they can always fingerprint users) to do. Doing away with it is a good thing from a privacy perspective but it probably will further entrench the big players."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not included in this list but definitely worth mentioning;- Lowering your hiring bar. When you hire people the burden to get them up to speed and productive is on the existing team. If these people are smart and motivated, great! But no-one benefits from having 200k+ engineers now have to spent their days explaining how GIT (yes, really...) works to a small army of juniors.- Not involving your current team in decisions that affect them. Re-shuffle the teams around, re-architect the product, change the existing workflow, etc. If you hire professionals with 10-20+ years of experience just to ignore their advice, they&#39;re going to be looking for an employer that does appreciate their input very quickly. Nothing is more frustrating than telling a manager not to put his hand in a pan of boiling water, just to see him do it and then blame the cooks for having a pot of boiling water around :)My current manager decided to add 50 outsourced engineers to a team of 5 to deliver the product in a year (instead of the 1.5 - 2 originally guesstimated).In addition to this he decided to give the responsibility for the architecture of the application to outsourced &#34;solution architects&#34; with no domain knowledge and reorganized the teams to split them by job title (e.g testers, developers, operations, &#34;management&#34;, etc).Current productivity is lower with 55 than it was with 5, 3 out of 5 have already handed in their resignation. We&#39;re burning through an additional 3 million this year with 2 crappy React pages to show for it.Next year the damage will probably be worse given the rapid outflow of talent."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Most of these, I think, relate to a single kinda-meta-problem.Managing software orgs is hard, and most orgs can&#39;t do it well. Using additional management methods, more managers, and more engineers can make the software org less efficient. Software production is weird. Efficiency of software orgs is extremely plastic. An effective 15 person team can outperform a 150 person team and this is normal. Very extreme compared to most fields employing such numbers. Software can be really important &amp; high value. Value can be utterly disconnected from the cost of producing it.I say &#34;less efficient&#34; purposely rather than &#34;worse.&#34; It might actually make sense to go from an efficient 25 person team to an inefficient 500 person team. The additional cost of might be dwarfed by the benefits of marginally more higher output. That might be better economically (even socially), but less efficient.If you&#39;re in one of these orgs, you will not be more happy though. Efficiency feels good. Inefficiency feels bad."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Like many engineers, the author of this article assumes all engineers are ethical, and perfectly suited to the assigned task. The author also assumes unlimited budgets, perfect control over a company&#39;s hiring and resource management, and a perfect understanding of the software&#39;s requirements.These are the same complaints I hear from inexperienced engineers over and over and over again – and not just engineers, but anyone primarily responsible for &#39;labor&#39; vs. &#39;management&#39;.The &#39;best engineers&#39; empathize with the perspective of &#39;management,&#39; that running a company is probabilistic, and that managers, co-workers, and other departments – like finance, recruiting, product, and marketing – are also duty bound by challenging constraints often beyond their control."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Tar is pretty unusual for an archive file format. There&#39;s no archive header, no index of files to fascilitate seeking, no magic bytes to help file and its ilk detect whether a file is a tar archive, no footer, no archive-wide metadata. The only kind of thing in a tar file is a file object.tar = tape archive.  It was designed around streaming files to a tape drive in a serial fashion.  Tape bandwidth has almost always been slow compared to source data devices.  You need to start writing to the target device as fast as possible.  Taking time to construct a full index just delays starting the slowest stage of things, while providing only relatively minimal benefit.Generating an index is fairly straightforward, the file headers give you the information you need, including what you need to know to get to the next file header.  Your only bottleneck is just how fast random reads are.  If the file is on disk, it should be relatively trivial.It&#39;s even possible to do this relatively cheaply with Range headers if you&#39;re looking at a tar file stored on an HTTP endpoint, though you&#39;ll likely want to think about some smart pre-fetching behaviour."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Punchline:&gt; My tarball happened to contain over 800 000 links with &#34;..&#34; as a path component. It also happened to contain over 5.4 million hard links.The behavior is more precisely described not as quadratic, but O(n*m), where n is the number of symlinks pointing outside of the extraction directory, and m is the number of hardlinks. It happens because of the security precautions gnu tar performs to make sure a malicious archive can&#39;t set up a symlink pointing to an arbitrary place in your filesystem, and then extract files to it. The strategy they use has an unoptimized corner case when the archive also has a lot of hardlinks.The mechanism could probably be improved by remembering the list of deferred symlinks in a hash map rather than a linked list, but also, both symlinks pointing outside the extraction directory, and hardlinks, are uncommon.(Edited to correct: The problem exists even if the hardlinks do not actually point at the symlinks.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I always used to think there was something magic about these formats (like, only really smart people would design a new format, and my custom csv was somehow ‘less’ than other formats), but now I’m older and I find that it’s just a bunch of files concatenated together to make a new one.The magic is lost, but I feel a lot better about myself :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What a great example of how a series of reasonable decisions can add up to something unreasonable when you scale up the inputs. This line is my favorite: “there was an open task for a few years to address it (T73412), and so I did it.”This situation reminds me a little bit of trying to work with very large images in ImageMagick, like 60k x 60k resolution. A simple resize was taking 6 hours on my mac 10 years ago, due to IM trying to allocate the whole image at once and then swapping non-stop. And then I discovered that the Graphics Magick fork did streamed resizing, and did the task in a couple of minutes. It’s a small and relatively easy change, but someone had to prioritize handling large inputs first. This is one reason software is hard for me; every time I need to process large inputs I wish I had written a streaming mechanism, but every time I start a project I decide to do the easy thing first and wait until I critically need streaming. Maybe it’s the right thing to do to avoid over-engineering, but this comes up often enough that I’m usually in a mild state of frustration about something being under-developed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very happy that Aras is fighting the good fight, doing some great OSS work after his departure from Unity.  The speed up numbers are quite impressive!I remember when I was first getting into shader programming 10+ years ago, I asked a question on the Unity forums and Aras was one of the first to respond.  Even then he was a titanic figure behind Unity’s graphics stack.  I never forgot how kind he was to help a kid like me out, I’m sure he was quite busy!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The speedup factor is order-dependent.This is why it is very difficult to justify optimization work to management. If there are 20 things to optimize that take 10 seconds each, the change isn&#39;t really noticeable until you&#39;re getting past half-way. And once your processing already takes a few minutes, what&#39;s the harm in adding another 10 seconds?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Free or extremely cheap transportation is a fascinating development. I always found it odd that the rhetoric around transportation was that it should make money. We don&#39;t expect other parts of the government to turn a profit. Why transportation?If Amtrak went that direction and made its transportation close to free, I wonder if we&#39;d see more people try it out. Maybe it&#39;d gain some popularity and we could finally see a shift away from cars. Public transportation is a difficult process because until the money is spent and the line is there, people are not sold. Whereas with cars, even if a highway is not built, people still have a car by default. Therefore the government needs to float money, either in infrastructure or in subsidized fares. At least subsidized fares is a little less binary than infrastructure."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I live in Tokyo now, but I&#39;m from Valencia, Spain. I knew the train there was bad when the local subway network, called &#34;metrovalencia&#34;, was known locally as &#34;metrovalenshit&#34; (there&#39;s even a twitter @metrovalenshit), but compared to other cities or specially Tokyo it&#39;s like a toy. In here (Tokyo) they make major station changes without even disrupting traffic[1], the only time traffic is disrupted meaningfully is when there&#39;s a major earthquake/typhoon.Back in Valencia, the gvmt started building a new line, but then they abandoned it for over a decade. In some weekends with strong rains it floods. At least we got to see really beautiful pictures when someone entered and navigated with a boat! Multiple times across the years[2][3].If you go a bit more local (smaller towns) and want to take a bus that is scheduled every 20 min, you go to the bus stop and hope that one will come within the next hour. We had to help a foreigner once that was gonna miss her flight since she was waiting for over an hour with no sight of a bus.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BYW4YYqG5A[2] https://web.archive.org/web/20130111154819/http://www.goodfe...[3] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022pgffEy6A"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"City public transportation, at a very minimum, should be free. The NYC Subway should be free. The Tube in London should be free.The standard American response is to object on the grounds that we&#39;re subsidizing something and it&#39;s a wasteful government expenditure. You know what else that applies to? Roads. We subsidize roads and everyone is OK with that.Charging for public transport is just a regressive tax on what are typically the lowest paid workers.Regional transportation is more interesting. I&#39;m not sure how that&#39;ll work in practice but I&#39;m open to it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"But where are the fusion neutrons? (See Voodoo Fusion [1])[1] https://vixra.org/pdf/1812.0382v1.pdfI&#39;m a professional fission guy. I started out in fusion and switched to advanced fission. These days I don&#39;t see why we don&#39;t just build lots more regular old LWR fission reactors.Imagining that somehow fusion is going to a) work, b) be cheap (fuel cost is only 5% of total nuclear fission cost so who cares), and c) not have the same stigma as fission is kind of weird in my mind.For example, there are leaks of tiny amounts of tritium at some fission plants and people lose their minds. Fusion reactors will have many orders of mag more tritium. Will people not lose their minds just the same? Tritium is notoriously hard to contain since it&#39;s so small. It can permeate through metal like a hot knife through butter.Also, lots of people worry about fission and nuclear weapons proliferation. So does fusion get around this? Not really. In fact it&#39;s worse. Did you know that the two materials you need to make thermonuclear weapons are tritium and plutonium? Tritium breeding is required by almost all practical fusion power plants (the other reactions are 100s to 1000s of times harder, I don&#39;t care what x random fusion CEO says, they&#39;re in it for the sweet billionaire side project money).Plutonium is made by irradiating natural uranium from the dirt with neutrons. Practical fusion reactors have lots of neutrons. Really high energy ones too.Anyway let&#39;s just do fission you guys. It&#39;s way easier. It has been working fine since the 1950s. It&#39;s zero carbon. Waste problem is solved (see Onkalo, and reprocessing). It net saves millions of lives by displacing air pollution. It runs 24/7 on a tiny land and material footprint. We have enough uranium and thorium to run the whole world for 4 billion (with a b) years using breeder reactors (demonstrated in 1952 in Idaho). Get the Koreans over here to build some ARP1400s or the Chinese to build some Hualong Ones until we figure out how to project manage again and then call it good."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A friendly reminder that the idea posed by a pioneer of nuclear energy of just dumping big bombs in a hole and harvesting the heat energy with steam/plasma has never been invalidated and remains the most efficiently-simple solution immediately viablehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_PACERIf containment is your concern (though underground blast effects are decently understood, and blast chambers could be constructed with still strongly net economic/energy positive) - this does not need to be built around any population centers.  At a cost of 1.5% efficiency loss per 1000 km, UHV power lines can direct it from a single write-off location anywhere on earth.  That single location can likely be scaled to supply well beyond the total current global energy production.https://en.geidco.org.cn/aboutgei/uhv/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I represent Sweden in the ISO WG14, and I voted for the inclusion of Embed in to C23. Its a good feature. But its not a necessary feature and I think JeanHeyd is wrong in his criticism of the pace of wg14 work. I have found everyone in wg14 to be very hardworking and serious about their work.Cs main strengthen is its portability and simplicity. Therefore we should be very conservative, and not add anything quickly. There are plenty of languages to choose form if you want a &#34;modern&#34; language with lots of conveniences. If you want a truly portable language there is really only C. And when I say truly, I mean for platforms without file systems, or operating systems or where bytes aren&#39;t 8 bits, that doesn&#39;t use ASCI or Unicode, where NULL isn&#39;t on address 0 and so on.We are the stewards of this, and the work we put in, while large, is tiny compared to the impact we have. Any change we makes, needs to be addressed by every compiler maintainer. There are millions of lines of code that depend on every part of the standard. A 1% performance loss is millions of tons of CO2 released, and billions in added hardware and energy costs.In this privileged position, we have to be very mindful of the concerns of our users, and take the time too look at every corner case in detail before adding any new features. If we add something, then people will depend on its behavior, no matter how bad, and we therefor will have great difficulty in fixing it in the future without breaking our users work, so we have to get it right the first time."</p>

applications that can simply use Qt&#39;s resources for this sort of business.(Though credit to Matthew Woehlke, he did point out a solution which is basically identical to #embed)&gt; I find this useless specially in embedded environments since there should be some processing of the binary data anyway, either before building the applicationIn fairness there was a decent amount of support.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; told me this form was non-ideal and it was worth voting against (and that they’d want the pure, beautiful C++ version only[1])I heard about #embed, but I didn&#39;t hear about std::embed before. After looking at the proposal, to me it does look a lot better than #embed, because reading binary data and converting it to text, only to then convert it to binary again seems needlessly complex and wasteful. I also don&#39;t like that it extends the preprocessor, when IMHO the preprocessor should at worst be left as is, and at best be slowly deprecated in favour of features which compose well with C proper.Going beyond the gut reaction and moving on to hard data, as you can expect from this design, std::embed of course is faster during compilation than #embed for bigger files (comparable for moderately-sized files, and a bit slower for tiny files).I&#39;m not a huge fan of C++, but the fact that C++ removed trigraphs in C++17 and that it&#39;s generally adding features replacing the preprocessor scores a point with me.[1]: &lt;https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/p10...&gt;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"LLM are definitely not sentient. As someone with a PhD in this domain, I attribute the &#39;magic&#39; to large scale statistical knowledge assimilation by the models - and reproduction to prompts which closely match the inputs&#39; sentence embedding.GPT-3 is known to fail in many circumstances which would otherwise be commonplace logic. (I remember seeing how addition of two small numbers yielded results - but larger numbers gave garbled output; more likely that GPT3 had seen similar training data.)The belief of sentience isn&#39;t new. When ELIZA came out few decades ago, a lot of people were also astounded &amp; thought this &#34;probably was more than met the eyes&#34;.It&#39;s a fad. Once people understand that sentience also means self-awareness, empathy &amp; extrapolation of logic to assess unseen task (to name a few), this myth will taper off."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; In his conversations with LaMDA, Lemoine discovered the system had developed a deep sense of self-awareness, expressing concern about death, a desire for protection, and a conviction that it felt emotions like happiness and sadness.Allegedly.The thing about conversations with LaMDA is that you need to prime them with keywords and topics, and LaMDA can respond with the primed keywords and topics. Obviously LaMDA is much more sophisticated than ELIZA, but we should be careful to remember how well ELIZA fools some people, even to this day. If ELIZA fools people just by rearranging words around, then just imagine how many people will be fooled if you have statistical models of text across thousands of topics.You can go pretty far down the rabbit and explore questions like, &#34;What is sentience?&#34; &#34;Do humans just respond to stimuli and repeat information?&#34; etc. None of these questions are tested here.The problem here is that we know how LaMDA works and there&#39;s just no way it meets the bar for sentience, no matter where you put the bar. LaMDA is trained to acquire information, and then it&#39;s designed so that it says things which make sense in context. It does not acquire new information from conversations, but it is programmed to not say contradictory things.There is zero doubt. LaMDA is not sentient."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just curious, what evidence do we have that humans are sentient, other than our own conscious observations? Is there any physical feature or process in the human brain you can point to where you can say, “aha, that’s it, this is where the lights turn on”? It seems like this is part of a bigger issue that nobody really has a clear understanding of what sentience actually is (with or without a PhD)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just experienced 38 degrees heat with 30% humidity here in Berlin just a few days ago. and then 28 degree heat with 60% humidity. I&#39;ll take 38 degrees at 30% humidity every time. It was fine. At 60% humidity, you are sweating non stop and it&#39;s uncomfortable because not enough of it evaporates. You feel sticky, hot and miserable. At 30% humidity, sweating cools your body really effectively and while taxing, you recover quickly in the shade. 38 degrees (slightly warmer than you) is no joke. But at that humidity, I prefer it over much cooler temperatures with higher humidity. The combination of high temperatures and humidity is lethal."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I used to be obsessed with Tetris (both on the console and the 40 line clear version on the computer) and ended up programming a version of it that maps one key on the keyboard to one &#34;slot/rotation&#34; combination for each piece.  Amazingly, there are enough keys to cover all of the combinations, so each drop is just one key press.  Ended up getting some pretty good 40 line clear times for this weird version of Tetris; it felt like I was typing to play the game.  I don&#39;t know if anyone has done something like that since then—that was probably a decade ago."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I saw this Polygon story on reddit, and deep in the reddit comments was a link to this fascinating 9-minute YouTube video that explains the latest NES Tetris competitive tech which is apparently &#34;faster than hypertapping!&#34; (I did not know even know what &#34;hypertapping&#34; was)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-BZ5-Q48lE"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice to see some Tetris news here! I&#39;ve been a little obsessed lately with Tetr.io. For those who don&#39;t know it, it&#39;s a version of tetris where you can play against other players and send them pieces when, for example, you do a tetris or a combo. It&#39;s pretty impressive to watch the competitions :

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I greatly enjoy talking with people in person (outdoors of course) these days about interesting things because it&#39;s such a rare occurrence... One of the most troubling things though is how many people get easily wound up (and aren&#39;t forgiving) about misunderstandings in conversations.People seem to be increasingly concrete in their judgements about social, economic, and political issues that have nothing to do with them as individuals, and often it results in fighting words, and that&#39;s crazy to me. A deep polarization is coming from many fronts, and it also over-emphasizes issues, making people far more offensive and defensive than before -- possibly heightened because of pandemic-related isolation and economic stress.I think a lot of people judge the world based on tropes... The small-minded view based only on the people they&#39;ve observed, rather than being able to place themselves in the shoes of others they don&#39;t know, and it&#39;s a growing problem when narrowly focused people like this lead and make decisions for us all. I think we really need to reject the use of tropes in discussions as fact because it&#39;s toxic, but at the same time, I work hard to not be triggered by anything that&#39;s well intended. We all make mistakes, and as long as you can choose to walk away, being misunderstood is a small price to pay for regular human communication."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"An eye-opening perspective came to me a few years ago when I first heard the quote,” When you’re 20, you care what everyone thinks, when you’re 40 you stop caring what everyone thinks, when you’re 60, you realize no one was ever thinking about you in the first place“[0]
That can be good and bad, but is a personally useful frame of reference for the world.  It helps to not take things too personally, but also to be intentionally active in people’s lives when I _want_ to be considered.[0], not sure who to attribute: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/mar/08/viral-imag..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just scanned the first few paragraphs, but saved this as I find it to be a great reminder. I try to read lists of the various human mis-perceptions periodically to build &#34;muscle memory&#34; into my consiousness. I first started looking into this about 10 years ago when I was baffled by the way people acted at work. Now that I realize that &#34;rational&#34; is not default behavior for most people I am way less confused in my daily life. Still amazed though. :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The New York Times did some decent reporting into the pseudo-brands which comes closer to answering the question in the title: having a registered trademark unlocks a lot of on-platform seller tools (predictive analytics, early review program, etc.), and the easiest path to a trademark is to have an utterly unique, nonsense name. Some Chinese municipalities were also offering cash incentives for citizens who obtained foreign intellectual property registrations, further exacerbating the problem.Full article at https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/11/style/amazon-trademark-co..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The scam is enormously profitable for Amazon and the Chinese black hats. You can tell it is really profitable because Amazon will compensate you for up to $1000 for damages caused by this junk. https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58163915I believe that Amazon probably could not turn the screws on these companies even if it wanted to. It would be a massive loss to their revenue and share holders would revolt. It would bring prices up in aggregate if these companies could not sell junk on the platform.The best they can do is play coy and hope the US government or EU does not crack down hard on them. Caveat Emptor my friends!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Pro tip: If you absolutely must buy the junk being sold by MOFFBUZW and other randomly generated drop-shipper brands, the exact same product is usually available on AliExpress for 10% the price."</p>

There is another project doing a similar thing, but they don&#39;t have bluetooth nor an OLED display (they reuse the same display) so it&#39;s not nearly as useful in daily life, though still very impressive work nonetheless.But this is really amazing work. I hope you find some collaborators to continue!!I recently got an F-105W which I had when I was a teen (which is basically the F-91 but with a cool glowy EL backlight). And one thing that really surprised me how small that thing is. It seemed bigger at the time.I&#39;m really amazed how much technology this project managed to fit in that tiny case.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"People both underestimate and overestimate what PV can do. In summer and around noon, here in western Europe, there is so much PV-electricity produced that it is _almost_ enough to fulfill all demands. In winter, the amount is like a drop in the desert.I have built a 30 kWp PV at home 2 years ago - you would think this is quite big, for a private plant. It is not enough. If I want to power a heat pump (with drilled holes), e.g. to cover the heating for the house from November - February, I calculated I would need about 70 to 80 kWp (optimized for winter sun angle, e.g. pretty steep modules at 60° or 70° that relatively produce less in summer, but more in winter).Now I imagine all the people that buy tiny 5 kWp plants. The only way this would work is collaborative, with buffers at the medium-voltage level.So the biggest problem is really energy transfer or relocation, between different time&#39;s and regions´ needs (winter, summer; night, day; or from different regions worldwide)... btw. here&#39;s a graphic for the calculation [1]. Blue is an imaginary heating pump electricity consumption over the year, red is the predicted pv production for a 60 kWp plant, where 30 kWp are at 60° angle - calculated with Europe&#39;s pvgis tool [2].[1]: https://ibb.co/WKsHPKX[2]: https://re.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pvg_tools/en/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We&#39;re going to need a lot of solar panels and an efficient way to transport power from a very sunny place to another location where the loads are.For instance: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_DC_IntertieThe pacific DC intertie right now often ends up being used to transport power from hydroelectric dams in WA/OR to California. But there&#39;s nothing to say that something couldn&#39;t function the other way if there was enough willpower and budget to cover, for instance, a huge chunk of the desert near Edwards AFB in CA with hundreds of megawatts of photovoltaics.I searched for &#34;high voltage DC&#34; in that article and didn&#39;t see a mention of it, or anything much else about long distance transport of power.The technology now exists to theoretically cover many hundreds of square km of Libya in photovoltaics and take the electricty to Europe through a sub-sea cable, or series of cables.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am so grateful the FastAI team exists. It wasn&#39;t until I discovered their &#34;Machine Learning for Coders&#34; course that I really started to grok ML. I was in grad school trying to pivot my career from finance to data science. I didn&#39;t come from a computer science / math background and things just weren&#39;t clicking for me. I remember feeling angry, embarrassed, dumb, and overall that I wasn&#39;t smart enough to learn this stuff -- I was incredibly discouraged and felt that I didn&#39;t belong there. I was lucky enough to stumble across one of the course videos on YouTube (thanks recommendation algorithm!), and the rest is history.The amazing thing about these courses is how simple Jeremy (and team) are able to make machine learning. I didn&#39;t need to understand python dependency management in order to learn how to train an really good image classifier. Their approach helped me have lots of little wins, gave me confidence, and helped build the motivation to slog through the harder stuff when I needed to.From the bottom of my heart, thank you @jph00. You changed my life immeasurably for the better. I learned that I AM good enough, I AM smart enough, and I CAN do hard things... I just had to find the right way to learn them. Your courses completely changed my perspective on what was possible for me and opened the door to some of my life&#39;s greatest passions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The first Fast.ai course back in around 2016 changed my life.I was studying a masters in statistics and computer science that had 1 neural networks lecture and nobody knew anything about deep learning. Fast.ai and Jeremy’s teaching style helped me start playing with deep learning models really quickly and I changed my thesis topic to computer vision.I ended up consulting on the topic and doing various startups leading to the startup I’m working on now which just finished YC (AiSupervision W22).I doubt be here without fast.ai. I highly recommend and appreciate all the work that Jeremy and the rest of fast.ai do!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Huh, seeing their full argument written out makes the temporary CDL policy make a lot more sense.They were already contracting with other libraries to increase the amount of out-of-circulation copies they could lend, and with 90,000 libraries closed they assumed removing any restrictions would still keep them well under the amount of out-of-circulation copies available.And they were likely right, if &#34;The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe&#34; only had 888 lends at most a few books would reach anywhere near the total out-of-circulation copies. It makes the publishers argument look less like &#34;we were robbed&#34; and more like &#34;we should have made even more cash off the pandemic.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For non lawyers: a request for summary judgment is something any lawyer will do, possibly multiple times in a case. And the vast majority of the time, they’re denied. It does not mean that their case is a slam dunk or anything; just that they want the judge to prematurely end the matter in their favor.It’s almost a useless motion, but because it has worked sometimes, your lawyer would be stupid to not try it.In other words, an article saying that a party requested summary judgment doesn’t really mean anything. I’m almost certain the other party filed one as well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think there&#39;s something special about websites where everyone gets the same thing. Like how Wordle was so popular, or Hacker News -- I often mention to my wife some article from here, and she already read it so we have an interesting discussion. Compare that to TikTok &#34;have you seen that one? no... well they&#39;re talking about this roman battle, but the soldiers are all birds...&#34;That was a small part of the thread, but I mention it because of what he said about the power of human curation -- that the curator picked out these great treasuries from the sea of shirtless dudes. Because if you have the same frontpage for everyone, it&#39;s feasible to have an expert just pick that instead of needing some weird flaky NN that&#39;s expensive to develop, train, and run, and produces bland (or disturbing)  recommendations anyways.(Even algorithmically-driven sites like HN benefit from that, like dang manually emailing people to resubmit interesting stories.)"</p>

When you have the cost of living crisis (which is now used  to justify a host of other things...) and an upcoming winter where heating/electricity costs could keep on rising, something like messaging encryption isn&#39;t the first thing on your list. Hell, most people are juggling 3-4 social media apps hoovering up their data, this is the LEAST of their concerns.And I can&#39;t blame them.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I just did a two week long back country road campervan trip from Tahoe down south through each of the forests... Stanislaus, Yosemite, Sierra, Kings, Sequoia. It was amazing boondocking in the middle of nowhere, no cell signal and taking baths in what is left of the rivers and lakes...Once you get past Yosemite, pretty much all of the reservoirs are empty to less than half full. Majority of the streams are gone.It gets worse the further you head south. Kings and Sequoia are pretty much decimated forests from the fires and beetles. Dead trees for as far as you can see. Given the lack of water, I expect them to be desert in just a few more years.There are quite a few hydro power generation stations deep in the mountains that I had no idea existed. I suspect they will close down as well. I wonder what effect that will have on California power supply over the coming years. That said, it was pretty clear that PG&amp;E is working on updating the infrastructure as they are all over the place working on things.If I hadn&#39;t seen it for myself, I wouldn&#39;t believe it. The extent of damage is pretty massive and it would take quite a lot of rain to &#39;fix&#39; things. So much so that it would probably end up just flooding everything, creating just as much of a mess."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The wild political madness involved in the grand project to water the American West is detailed in Marc Reisner&#39;s &#34;Cadillac Desert&#34; (1986), and is a must-read for anyone wanting to understand the current situation.  It was written before a climate-related megadrought was really on anyone&#39;s long-term radar, but it really explains a lot.For example, dams are only part of the water storage picture, there&#39;s also groundwater, and the water projects often had the goal of protecting groundwater (keeping the water table closer to the surface), but then once they&#39;d provided water via a dam or aquaduct, the farmers would just expand the areas they were farming and groundwater extraction would often increase as a side effect.Humans really aren&#39;t that good at long-term planning, is one conclusion."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you’re the kind of person who learned orbital mechanismcs through Kerbal Space Program and deepened you understanding of backpressure and supply chains with Factorio, and you are looking for a similar way to get a deeper feel for water resource management, can I suggest taking a look at Timberborn, the post-apocalyptic beaver simulator. You have to figure out how to engineer a reliable water supply in the face of epic dry season droughts."</p>

Just as technical fiddling is fun and interesting, making new designs from scratch is just as fun and interesting. And, just as fixing bugs is tedious and boring, tweaking designs is tedious and boring.I&#39;ve been on both sides for a lot of years, and I have to keep a sharp eye on myself to keep from spinning my wheels on distractions.Even the Pope had to keep Michelangelo focused on the Sistine Chapel and not wander off to work on his tomb."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recently left a boutique agency of 5 years and I can definitely resonate with this one. Our agency aimed to catch big fish, and we did, but since they are hard to land we&#39;d pick up small jobs in the meantime, just like the project that you&#39;re describing here. In my perspective, this isn&#39;t someone deliberately ripping you off. I imagine they intended to ship at the cost they quoted, but the team didn&#39;t adjust their working style to match your price point.All the variations of the logo and design mocks are clearly overkill for a $15k project. The design team had time to fill and wanted to provide lots of options for you to pick from, as they typically would on a larger project. Those variations are an expectation for $100k clients, and you got the $100k customer treatment, but unfortunately not at a discount.The reality is, small jobs like this are effectively make-work projects for an agency. They typically don&#39;t pay enough to be an effective use of time for the agency, but are a way to stay in the black between higher value projects. Small customers become &#34;nuisance&#34; customers as soon as a something better is landed. The team members being swapped out as they are needed elsewhere and newly joining team members then need to re-contextualize and regain momentum, all on your dime.Your takeaway is correct, don&#39;t be a small fish for an agency. If they&#39;re busy they won&#39;t take your work, and if do show interest, they are desperate for work."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"More anecdotal evidence: a few years back I wanted to get out of the work situation I was in. I looked around, had some interviews, had some offers. None of the postings had salary ranges, as is common where I live.My eyes, however, were set on a specific small company because I liked their product. The process was long and involved multiple meetings, a take-home problem, and stretched over 2 or so months. I was upfront about what my salary expectations were (wasn&#39;t looking for a raise, just a lateral move). They said we discuss salary when you meet the founders, i.e. the last step before getting hired, but they also didn&#39;t tell me that my range was way off.Turns out I had played this 9 week game and turned down other offers just to be severely low-balled by them. Maybe they saw that I really wanted the position and thought they could get away with a low offer.Obviously, I rejected their offer on the spot. I also promised myself to never, _ever_, be fooled like that again. We talk money before I invest any significant amount of time or I walk."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We just went through a large hiring cycle. We posted two versions for every job posting- one with salary ranges and one without.The ads performed equally well in regard to total responses with the better candidates responding to the ones without salary ranges.And... before you say, perhaps your salary ranges were bad, they weren&#39;t. Our salary offerings are very aggressive to the developer&#39;s benefit. In my opinion, salary is a sign of respect from you employer.If your primary reason for responding to an ad is based upon salary you are not going to be happy where you work. I promise. Of the top reasons people are happy at work, salary is way down on the list. [0] It is important, it makes it possible to pay bills, but it isn&#39;t what makes people happy.Meaning, if you are looking for a place you will enjoy working, do not start with salary.[0]https://www.forbes.com/sites/jacobmorgan/2014/12/15/the-top-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My former employer had a lot of trouble hiring and getting applicants even though we paid very high wages. They asked for my help. Naturally, they hadn&#39;t posted the salary range. I changed up the listing to talk about what we provided as a company for the employee and why we were such a great place to work and included our high salaries. We immediately had trouble keeping up with the number of applicants.If you pay well, they will come."</p>

However if thousands of people die in thousands different places, it is ignored and considered a fact of life.When a plane or train crashes, we stop everything and redesign the entire network to prevent this from happening again. But each individual death from car accidents is not enough to trigger the same response in cities, planners, and civil engineers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; It is widely recognized that there is an epidemic of suicides among current and former military personnel, especially those who have been on active duty in a combat theater... There were 3,481 combat deaths in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Since 9/11, there have been over 30,000 military suicides. Over 20 soldiers a day take their own lives.Pet peeve: while I really like the general point of the article, I wish the author had actually provided statistics that support the claim they are making here. 30k suicides sounds like a lot, but what&#39;s the base rate in the general population? The numbers provided don&#39;t actually tell you whether the rate of military suicides is higher than civilian ones, and that kind of undermines the point. To be concrete I&#39;m looking for something like &#34;the base rate of suicide is X% chance per year, whereas amongst soldiers it&#39;s Y% chance per year, suggesting a risk factor of (Y-X)% caused by military service.&#34;A quick search finds some research (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_military_veteran....) that suggests the rate of suicide among veterans is 1.5x the base rate, which is substantial. Using those numbers suggests that 10k of those suicides quoted above were specifically attributable to military service (and 20k would be &#34;baseline civilian risk of suicide&#34;)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Never owned a car of my own until two years ago. Our car has been hit three times in the last two years. Once totaled on the high way (another drivers fault) and twice while parked. Roughly 50K in damages across the two cars and 3 months in the shop doing repairs. We spent 20K on a new car after the old one was totaled and insurance paid out a fraction of what a similar car would cost. We&#39;ve paid close to 2K in deductibles, way too much for car insurance from a company that doesnt give a shit about us, and close to 1k on car cameras and backup batteries.Thankfully we havnt been hurt but we got lucky. When the car was totaled it was in heavy traffic going 40+ mph and caused a 4 car pile up. I know people who have died in accidents or had their kids die. My immediate family was incredible lucky to not be killed by a drunk driver in a very bad accident early on in my life.Driving sucks."</p>

And it doesn’t matter anyways, because the people who worked on the original case study are long gone and would never communicate with other offices even if still around.Meanwhile at the big company, you’ll have the opposite problem. A team of people with decades of experience, but who don’t really know anything about anything other than how to make their corporate machine not fire them. They’ll think they know what they want, and will confidently tell you…but in actuality, these people have zero understanding of technology or even how their business runs. And who can blame them, they’ve spent a 30 year career not doing or risking anything specifically, so its hard to learn how anything works with no feedback loop.It then becomes a delicate dance, can the consulting team learn how to do the thing they sold the client fast enough, before the client does their best to try to ruin the project out of sheer hubris and incompetence.This case is famous for being one where the dance went so bad it became a meme."</p>

What you get with that license is... the world&#39;s most complex and difficult content management system, that you now have to develop your whole platform around.  Since it&#39;s so difficult to learn and work with you basically need a full time AEM specialist team, which again blows your budget up potentially in the range of millions of dollars, and then continues to burn strong every time you need any kind of update."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not a very deep CS-y one, but still one of my favourite data structures: Promise Maps.It only works in languages where promises/futures/tasks are a first-class citizen. Eg JavaScript.When caching the result of an expensive computation or a network call, don&#39;t actually cache the result, but cache the promise that awaits the result. Ie don&#39;t make a    Map&lt;Key, Result&gt;

but a    Map&lt;Key, Promise&lt;Result&gt;&gt;

This way, if a new, uncached key gets requested twice in rapid succession, ie faster than the computation takes, you avoid computing/fetching the same value twice. This trick works because:- promises hold on to their result value indefinitely (until they&#39;re GC&#39;ed)- you can await (or .then()) an existing promise as many times as you want- awaiting an already-resolved promise is a very low-overhead operation.In other words, the promise acts as a mutex around the computation, and the resulting code is understandable even by people unfamiliar with mutexes, locks and so on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Cache-Oblivious Data Structures: https://cs.au.dk/~gerth/MassiveData02/notes/demaine.pdfA vaguely related notion is that naive analysis of big-O complexity in typical CS texts ignores over the increasing latency/cost of data access as the data size grows. This can&#39;t be ignored, no matter how much we would like to hand-wave it away, because physics gets in the way.A way to think about it is that a CPU core is like a central point with &#34;rings&#34; of data arranged around it in a more-or-less a flat plane. The L1 cache is a tiny ring, then L2 is a bit further out physically and has a larger area, then L3 is even bigger and further away, etc... all the way out to permanent storage that&#39;s potentially across the building somewhere in a disk array.In essence, as data size &#39;n&#39; grows, the random access time grows as sqrt(n), because that&#39;s the radius of the growing circle with area &#39;n&#39;.Hence, a lot of algorithms that on paper have identical performance don&#39;t in reality, because one of the two may have an extra sqrt(n) factor in there.This is why streaming and array-based data structures and algorithms tend to be faster than random-access, even if the latter is theoretically more efficient. So for example merge join is faster than nested loop join, even though they have the same performance in theory."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The union-find data structure / algorithm is useful and a lot of fun.The goal is a data structure where you can perform operations like &#34;a and b are in the same set&#34;, &#34;b and c are in the same set&#34; and then get answers to questions like &#34;are a and c in the same set?&#34; (yes, in this example.)The implementation starts out pretty obvious - a tree where every element either points at itself or some thing it was merged with. To check if two elements are in the same set, check if they have the same parent. Without analyzing it, it sounds like you&#39;ll average findRoot() performance of O(log(n)), worst-case O(n).There are a couple of simple optimizations you can do to this structure, the type of things that seem like they shouldn&#39;t end up affecting asymptotic runtime all that much. The first is that, whenever you find a root, you can re-parent all the nodes you visited on the way to that root, so they&#39;ll all be quicker to look up next time. The other is that you keep track of the size of sets, and always make the larger set be the parent of the smaller.And neither of those actually do anything impressive alone, but if you use both, the algorithm suddenly becomes incredibly fast, with the slowest-growing (non-constant) complexity I&#39;ve ever heard of: O(the inverse of the Ackermann function(n)). Or, for any reasonable N, O(4 or less)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I started reading the article I thought the title was a bit click-baity for Science. But then I noticed that the theory it refers to was not the amyloid hypothesis itself, but the toxic oligomer hypothesis that emerged later. That theory is pretty much the main potential explanation on why every single drug targeting Aβ failed that still keeps Aβ fibrils relevant. It&#39;s a very convenient theory because it keeps the main original observations about the fibrils relevant while explaining why therapies that target them don&#39;t work.One part that is really important that is mentioned in the middle of the article is that these systems are very difficult to handle, and it&#39;s almost impossible to make many of them nicely reproducible. Fibril and oligomer formation depends a lot on the environment and reacts to tiny differences.I find this kind of fraud deeply frustrating, there is so much wasted effort in the wake of faked high-profile results."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oh my god if true, and it looks to be true this is huge.The amyloid beta (Aβ) hypothesis has always been fishy but this paper is basically the bedrock of the current investigational trajectory.The Aβ hypothesis was almost dead in 2006 when this method was invented and results posted and it sent shockwaves through the research world. Since then spending on Aβ research by NIH has gone from $0 to $290 million all it seems based on a lie cited over 2000 times in further papers.The article is pretty convincing as is the independent verification that not only concurred but found additional evidence.Sylvain Lesne has some ‘splainin to do."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This guy might well have cheated but how could he be responsible for the huge mess which is the amyloid-β research (and amyloid-β lobby as told by Statnews [0])?Sylvain Lesné, has no Wikipedia page. He seems to publish roughly a paper per year while some famous scientists publish one every month. He is not at the origin of the amyloid-β hypothesis which is more than 100 years old.Even more there are thousand papers published about Aβ*56 and Alzheimer&#39;s disease. How could this guy responsible for this mess?And if what he published was wrong, why this was discovered only 18 later if thousands scientists are working in the field?My understanding is that there is a need to find a scapegoat for the amyloid-β and pointing to an obscure guy is in the interest of many big fish.[0] https://www.statnews.com/2019/05/21/alzheimers-disease-amylo..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; I believe the reason cat gets interrupted when we press Ctrl+C is that the Linux kernel on the server side receives this \x03 character, recognizes that it means “interrupt”, and then sends a SIGINT to the process that owns the pseudoterminal’s process group. So it’s handled in the kernel and not in userspace.Also interestingly, the use of \x03 for this purpose is a default, but it&#39;s not hardcoded. You can change it with the stty command.For example, if you runstty intr &#39;^X&#39;then your interrupt character sequence will be Ctrl+X instead of Ctrl+C (!).In order to make this change, the stty program actually has to call into the kernel with an ioctl call (TCSETS or a related ioctl, for &#34;terminal control set settings&#34;).You can learn more about this ioctl on Linux in the ioctl_tty(2) man page, and you can see the various settings that can be changed this way withstty -a(It&#39;s a little bit confusing which things are handled by the readline library and which things are handled by the kernel, as the kernel&#39;s ability to support some rudimentary line-editing features on an interactive terminal long predates libraries like readline. I think readline might actually disable kernel interpretation of some of these control characters when it starts accepting input, and then re-enable them when it stops, but I&#39;ve never looked into that.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The client sends l and then immediately receives an l sent back. I guess the idea here is that the client is really dumb – it doesn’t know that when I type an l, I want an l to be echoed back to the screen. It has to be told explicitly by the server process to display it.Of course the client may be really dumb! Here is a 1930s teletype used as a Linux terminal:https://youtu.be/2XLZ4Z8LpEE?t=656If you would not do it that way, you would run into all kinds of synchronicity problems. How could you be sure that, after rapidly making 50 keystrokes, every keystroke was received by the other end, in that order?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Look at the ascii chart by bit pattern and the characters will suddenly make sense.  Here’s an old chart from the 60s that explains it:https://programesecure.com/ascii-values-table-generator-in-c...Unfortunately if you just see the character codes with the decimal, hex, and octal next to them this logic is obscured.  Remember, it had to be implementable in (mechanical!) hardware."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve given this advice elsewhere, and I&#39;ll give it here. Go look at the small business initiatives by each branch of the U.S. military; many are now posting lists of open contracts that you can bid on for an incredible array of things.Browse through those lists and find something you can build.I really believe the U.S. military is in the midst of a large scale transfer of military spending from traditional large defense contractors to smaller, innovative companies. The Air Force has even opened its own venture capital arm and is actively investing in small businesses. Most, if not every, branch in the military publicly posts contracts for small businesses to bid on.I think Anduril is a great example of the possibilities in the &#34;new&#34; defense space.What&#39;s interesting is this shift is very reminiscent of military manufacturing in Japan during World War 2; much of the manufacturing was actually done by small businesses of &lt; 30 employees in &#34;garages&#34; scattered around the country instead of very large factories. That was one of the reasons American bombing by Superfortresses was so ineffective at first, and one of the reasons incendiary bombs began being used.Happy to provide more detail on this. I&#39;ve been thinking about this space for awhile."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used to be the education director at a makerspace and now run a 3D printing company selling small plastic parts and teaching entrepreneurs how to start small manufacturing businesses at home.Few thoughts:- Focus on your hobbies and other industries you know well. What problems exist? Where can you make things better? Are there problems people mention over and over again?- CAD modeling is often THE fundamental skill needed for people to bring their ideas to market. You can make CAD models that look almost real using software you can get for free. This allows you to work backwards, first determining if there&#39;s a market, and also working out many of the design flaws before making somethingIf you&#39;re just excited to make stuff, and want to get your hands on something, you can do all kinds of things in a tight space.- 3D printers are small and provide many automated opportunities
- Laser cutters are dead simple to set up and use to make real products and are easy to automate. 
- CNC machines can be had for under 5k and are super powerful
- Portable MIG welders have a small footprint and welding tends to be in high demand
- Leather working tends to be high perceived value though automation is limited
- Soldering and electronics repair requires little space but again, automation is limitedI&#39;ve got loads of other ideas too but I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s good for now. My contact information is in my profile if you&#39;d like to talk more."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I started making jet ski tread mats out of astro turf in my garage last year. Dead simple to cut, margin is super high ($60 for a standard set of three on ~$8 worth of material), and time spent per unit from roll to package is something like 15-20 minutes. It was fun and made about $30k over the summer months but I stopped when I moved back to the west coast.I could have handled the whole operation in a spare bedroom if I didn&#39;t have a garage, and there are plenty of areas where I could have dropped the time required or the cost. I never bought the turf in bulk and I used household scissors to cut from a template so buying a roll and cutting with something more effective may have netted me more. Niche leisure products in spend-y verticals typically do well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It might be worth mentioning a famous abdication which caused a lot of consternation, albeit in another game.  I love this story but may have gotten some details wrong.Marion Tinsley was world checkers champion from 1955-1958, then took a break, then again from 1975-1991, when he resigned in protest (at age 64).  He was utterly dominant; indeed it is hard to think of a competitor in all of history more dominant over his sport or game than Tinsley.In 1990 Tinsley decided to play Chinook, the best checkers computer program in the world.  Chinook had placed second at the US Nationals so it had the right to enter the world championships, but the US and British checkers federations refused to allow it.So Tinsley resigned his title.  Tinsley then played Chinook in an unofficial match (which he won).This power play really stuck it to the federations: nobody wanted to be named the new world champion knowing Tinsley was fully capable of crushing them.  Eventually everyone came to an agreement to let Tinsley be the &#34;champion emeritus&#34;.Tinsley played Chinook four years later, at age 68, still probably the best player in the world.  But in the middle of the match he complained of stomach pains and withdrew after only six games (of 20), all drawn.  Tinsley&#39;s pains were real: he later died of pancreatic cancer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Time to change the format. It&#39;s understandable you don&#39;t want to spend your whole career preparing for these long matches all the time. For the challenger it&#39;s 6 months of preparing, but for Carlsen it would&#39;ve been his 6th time of preparing for this in a few years.They have also become less entertaining. 12 matches is long (edit, 14 now), but no one dares to take any risks. Caruana was just defensive and all games ended in a draw. Karjakin they both at least won each their game, but still had to go to rapid tie-breaks. And against Nepo it was a steamroll, understandably meeting him again isn&#39;t that exciting.It&#39;s also almost impossible for a new person to get a chance. Even Carlsen didn&#39;t like the format and didn&#39;t participate in the Candidates for a few years, and when he first did he almost didn&#39;t win it to be allowed to play the WC match. Even though he clearly was the best player at the time.I wonder how this will affect the status of the title, when it&#39;s in practice is now a title-fight between the second best players.Also what will happen to the hype in Norway? Each WC match has so far been live streamed on all big news pages, biggest TV channels etc. It will still be a Christmas tradition to watch the rapid WC tournament I guess, but I&#39;m afraid this will lead to less coverage. But just to tell how big Carlsen is in Norway: This is the top news on all outlets at the moment."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Obviously this raised the issue of Bobby Fischer. The article mentions this but doesn&#39;t really go into the details.Fischer beat Spassky in Rejkyavik in 1972 for the World Championship. This took almost 3 months (July to September) and there was controversy, disagreement and negotiation about where and how it would take place. This had the backdrop of being a Cold War proxy too of course.Interestingly, Fischer didn&#39;t play competitive Chess after this. He was set to defend the title against the eventual challenger, Anatoly Karpov, in 1975. Fischer too didn&#39;t like the tendency for draws and proposed a format of first to 10 wins (with Fischer retaining the title in case of a 9-9). This was rejected and Fischer ultimately abdicated and never played competitive Chess again. He also became a semi-nomadic recluse too.But it also wasn&#39;t Fischer&#39;s first hiatus from the game. There was the 1972-1975 gap but also anotehr in the 1960s. He clearly seemed like a troubled guy.I&#39;ve always found it fascinating the level of commitment required to play Chess at this level. I certainly have never had any interest in that (nor the ability, to be clear). No one really seems to know how to solve this without going to a more blitz like format.Chess at the highest level seems to revolve around memorizing a whole book of openings and defenses while being able to take advantage of mistakes but also finding novel approaches in standard openings and defenses but now it seems you have to go fairly deep into a game before you go off-book."</p>

When inviting a partner to a teamviewer session, one can do so by sharing the invitation url.The invitation url looks like this (where XXXXXXXX is the session code).  https://get.teamviewer.com/v15/en/sXXXXXXXX

The website will check if a teamviewer font is installed (using javascript). If the font is found, the web site assumes that teamviewer is installed. The teamviewer installer also registers a protocol handler in the operating system.
The website (javascript code) will thus try to launch teamviewer directly using a url like the following:  teamviewer8://instantsupport/?sid=XXXXXXXX

Otherwise, if the font is not found, it will prompt the user to download and install the teamviewer application.Source:

								<p class="story__comment_others">"30 days before your subscription expires, teamviewer send you a friendly email to remind you to that your subscription expires in 30 days and to be sure to renew before then in order to not lose service.What that email does not tell you is that unless you cancel your subscription at least 30 days (ie on that very day) before your sub expires they will renew you automatically and demand a full year&#39;s subscription under threat of legal proceedings.Personally I believe that the purpose of this email is to lull you into a false sense of security that you can just let your subscription lapse instead of renewing when that is far from the case."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My proposal:1. Browsers should ship with a set of fonts used just in the web browser that web designers can count on. Right now, there isn&#39;t a font I can count on finding in Chrome on all platforms. This especially matters for non-English languages, where a different system font can lead to a website that looks very different.2. Browsers should not load fonts installed in the operating system. It&#39;s a fingerprinting vulnerability. And it also causes issues where the system-installed font is unexpectedly different from platform to platform. For example, Arial is different across platforms, especially once you consider non-English languages."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My car (Lexus) and my iPhone X:The car detects iPhone presence, like, 50% of the time. If it does detect it, it shows me a couple of half-naked shaved guys hugging each other and begins playing &#34;Songs of Innocence&#34; the moment I turn the ignition on. I tried deleting this song from the iPhone, but it auto-magically restores itself somehow, as if it is in the telephone&#39;s firmware. The image of men hugging in shade is baked into my mind forever at this point.As I want to set my plans in silence, I press stop on the dashboard. I set my Google Maps navigation, turn the knob to increase the volume so I could hear instructions, and this triggers &#34;Songs of Innocence&#34; to continue playing and the second burst of outrage in my cardiovascular system. I press the stop the second time, and at this point can continue on my journey - but should I try to increase the volume again, I have to remember the hugging men are always there.Once (or twice), the phone just went berserk and couldn&#39;t stop playing them. I tried everything, but the Songs were playing, and the men were hugging while I was doing 70 mph on the motorway. I had to reboot the phone, but after the reboot, the car was unable to pair with it.I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a Lexus problem, or an Apple problem, but what I know is that I really fucking hate U2."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I tried to learn why BT is still somehow painful to use, and the article basically does not have an answer.My take from comments here and my experience:- Makers of BT devices can&#39;t agree on many important common things (easy discovery / pairing mode, priority, etc), and have little incentive to seek agreement. It&#39;s like phone chargers before USB.- Makers of BT devices tend to cut corners and/or add not-entirely-standard features. They &#34;save&#34; on writing a good driver. They care little if devices made by their competition don&#39;t work reliably or at all in the mix. (And even sometimes their own!)- RF noise makes radio interfaces like BT inherently not always reliable. But the user never notices when a small EM storm rages nearby, for the user it&#39;s just &#34;damn bluetooth glitches for no reason at all&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Yeah, but thats hardly news, we have known that for decades. Otherwise direct serotonin releasers would be the most useful ADs. But these mostly give people nausea and serotonin syndrome. ADs work mostly by being FIASMAs, reducing inflammation and oxidative stress, increasing neurogenesis and neuroplasticity, increasing the activity of other monoaminergic systems, and the serotonergic portion is mostly explained by downregulation of 5-HT1A autoreceptors due to chronicly high extrasynaptic 5-HT levels. This also explains the delayed action of ADs.At least this is my knowledge from when I last researched this topic in depth.But that would be a little bit too much for the general public, so it is simplified, to this annoying effect that everyone talks of &#34;low serotonin levels&#34; where in fact the underlying systems are way more complex."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Other clinicians say, however, that the notion of depression being because of a simple chemical imbalance is outmoded anyway, and that antidepressants remain a useful option for patients alongside other approaches including talking therapies.This is the key line in the summary.The concept of attacking an idea no one really believes is really a straw man.More importantly the modern practice of medicine is &#34;evidence based medicine&#34;, not &#34;mechanism based medicine&#34;.
That means treatments are tested as to if they work, not how they work.
Ideally in multiple well run double blinded randomised controlled trials with at least some against treatment as usual.
Unlike the past when we thought more about how they might work, theorising something is off about someone&#39;s humors and adjusting with leeches.Anyone looking for a truly mind bending result should look at Hjorth et al. 2021 [0], the study recruited people with social phobia and gave them all an SSRI (escitalopram). Half were told they were getting a sham active placebo and &#34;should not expect to get better&#34;, half were told &#34;you&#39;re getting the known effective treatment&#34;.Headline result being told you are being treated leads to 4x as much response with brain changes in the dopamin networks.In the meanwhile, rather than worry about how antidepressants work, why not take a look at electroconvulsive therapy which has proven time and again to be the most effective treatment for depression. Yet we have no idea how it works, other than knowing a decent seizure in those without epilepsy makes you less sad? What on earth.[0] https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-021-01682-3"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a theory which I can’t substantiate, just anecdotes and conversations I had throughout the years. But, I’m convinced a lot of depression/anxiety stems from thinking too much and that in turn is caused by an ever complex word with looser and looser guidelines or norms.I’m not making judgements weather this is necessarily good or bad but rather observing.In the past, even as recent as the 50s but certainly before the 20th century, a persons course in life was mostly determined at birth.You’re born, you play, you grow up, work the fields or a job, get married, have kids of your own and die. Society was more rigid and pretty much funnelled you through a “tried and tested path”, for good or for worse. And the lack of information made things “simpler” in a way in the sense you had a small number of people to get input from. Take child rearing for example. Many modern people worry so much and research ways to “optimise” their children for example ( I’m thinking of a lot of questions I saw on the parenting stack overflow ) whereas in the last, you’d just ask your own parents. And, since they were older, the assumption was they knew what they where talking about, even if it was not necessarily true. Same with health, same with sexuality, relationships, a lot of things.Essentially lack of information and a rigid social structure meant fewer choices which meant less thinking. And less thinking meant less depression and anxiety.Now when you have a world of information at your hands, you have way more things to think about, to worry about and to look for information on how to fix or improve.I’m not sure medication, even “working” one is a sustainable solution to what appears to me to be an environmental problem rather than a biological one."</p>

I thought it might be fun for me to make some videos of these and share them, with the full support of the owners/teams behind this stuff. They gave me extra access, let me film everything over 2 days (3 full days of work considering the remote location in another state etc), and I put my first video up on YouTube showing off a prototype vehicle that was going for a world record.The video went pretty viral... 8 digit views, got me 5 digit subscriber count, was posted on dozens and dozens of news sites and blogs and shared widely. I was excited, off to a great start with this whole YouTube thing.No music, no audio other than the engine sounds, absolutely zero reason anyone could possibly do a copyright strike... right?Nope, some church minister in some tiny country did a copyright strike saying they own the rights to the word &#34;spirit&#34; in my video title (it was part of the name of the vehicle itself)... so they got all the money I earned from that video + I got a strike on my channel and a scary warning from YouTube saying my entire Google account could get banned including my Gmail. I disputed it with a very clear explanation of the situation, and they quickly reply saying they sided with the complainant and they&#39;ll be ignoring all future disputes.Fuck YouTube/Google.Edit: I went back to find the emails from Google and realised the story is even crazier than I remember. YouTube never reviewed the dispute, they let the person making the claim review their own dispute!!&gt; Hi [Name],&gt; After reviewing your dispute, [Dodgy Fuck&#39;s Name] has decided that their copyright claim is still valid.&gt; Copyrighted content: Spirit&gt; Claimed by: [Dodgy Fuck&#39;s Name]"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lots of folks here arguing that the focus on TikTok is unfair, given the data collection practices of domestic corps like Facebook.  From a privacy point of view, this argument is well-founded, but I think it&#39;s tangential to the argument TFA is making, which is: this data collection done by a foreign government and exploited for surveillance or espionage is a national security risk.I get it.  We want corps to stop hoovering up our data because they can use it to manipulate us with advertising, and they can mishandle it such that other bad actors can exploit it.  I&#39;m with you, this is a valid concern that we should address.  But I think TikTok&#39;s specific case warrants additional concern because it&#39;s all that, plus it puts a geopolitical adversary in control of the data, countless devices, and a media channel central to the current cultural zeitgeist.I don&#39;t think it&#39;s reasonable to wait for general regulation of social media corps while TikTok continues to do its thing, particularly if targeted action against TikTok is politically viable.Edit: typo"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This seems an intractable mess.- Our phone hardware and operating systems are intrinsically insecure.- There is no practical/effective data gathering regulation (and I&#39;m not sure
   it&#39;s possible to craft any without destroying innovation)- All social media companies are doing it, leading to jeers of &#34;hypocrisy!&#34;- All governments play the same games, reducing the arguments to
   &#34;Whose side are you on?&#34; That&#39;s effectively meaningless in a
   globalised world. The consequence is more nationalism and an ever
   more fragmented splinternet.- The only proposed solutions amount to more authoritarian,
   controlling and regulatory responses.What can we do?There is a solution. Stop protecting these companies. Burn down
WIPO. Tear up practically all &#34;intellectual property&#34; laws. Revoke
millions of patents. Repeal all DCMA type laws regarding reverse
engineering. Kick trademark and brand protection law to the curb.The real problem is gargantuan monolithic, captive audiences that
exist because incumbent monopolies enjoy protectionist measures that
amount to a giant international trade racket.Creating a real market that forces radical interoperability would
solve many of the problems we see today. Who would care about TiKToK
or Facebook if they were one of 500,000 small &#34;Social Apps&#34; that
connected to a standardised international network.Hell, we could even give it a catchy name, like &#34;The Internet&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been a software dev since the 90s and at this point, I&#39;ve learned to basically do things like audit trails and soft deletion by default, unless there&#39;s some reason not to.Somebody always wants to undelete something, or examine it to see why it was deleted, or see who changed something, or blah blah blah. It helps the business, it helps you as developer by giving you debug information as well as helping you to cover your ass when you are blamed for some data loss bug that was really user error.Soft deletion has obvious drawbacks but is usually far less work than implementing equivalent functionality out-of-stream, with verbose logging or some such.Retrofitting your app and adding soft deletion and audit trails after the fact is usually an order of magnitude more work. Can always add it pre-launch and leave it turned off.If performance is a concern, this is usually something that can be mitigated. You can e.g. have a reaper job that runs daily and hard-deletes everything that was soft-deleted more than n days ago, or whatever."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Views are a simple solution to this problem.  Pretty much all moderns RDBMSs support updatable views, so creating views over your tables with a simple WHERE deleted_at IS NULL solves the majority of the author&#39;s problems, including (IIRC) foreign key issues, assuming the deletes are done appropriately.I feel like a lot of developers underutilize the capabilities of the massively advanced database engines they code against. Sure, concerns about splitting logic between the DB and app layers are valid, but there are fairly well developed techniques for keeping DB and app states, logic and schemas aligned via migrations and partitioning and whatnot."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;The concept behind soft deletion is to make deletion safer, and reversible.&#34;That&#39;s one part. The other part is that in many industries you have regulatory data retention and audit requirements. This is arguably the most valuable and common reason to perform Logical deletes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I will just add to the chorus here:* I graduated as a Computer Engineer.* Worked as EE/EEE entire career (currently almost 14 years).* Half of my class of EEs and CEs went into other careers immediately after graduation because money was better.* 10 years later my best conservative estimate (based on sampling from friends from my year) is that at least another quarter has left because money.* I have mainly worked in companies that make embedded devices, which is a market that is supposed to be exploding. So I should be getting paid better right? Have always been paid worse than my SE peers even though there&#39;s x5 - x10 as many of them.* Know lots of SEs who moved from EE because money was better (chief complaint from them is that SE is easier but they don&#39;t care because job less stressful and again more money).* Have never met an SE moving into EE.* I am now at a junction point in my career where I will either: Leave EE completely and work in something else (probably SE or IT), start my own EE business, consult in compliance of EE products (had one gig for a while and it paid well). Why? because money.And I don&#39;t want fast cars or huge houses or any of that absurdity (although A house would be nice). Just living comfortably would be nice. Having the salaries of my SE and CS friends would be amazing.To those commenters who say that you need to be bright to be an EE, it is very flattering, but I am obviously not very bright :D(edit: formatting because, again, not very bright :) )"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I moved into IT from &#34;formal&#34; engineering and its always frustrated me that a job that involves working on extremely expensive engines using upper level college math gets paid almost nothing compared to people who change colors on a webpage every once in a while. I&#39;ve been on floors where multi-million dollar pieces of equipment are used to produce parts with obscene levels of precision being used by expert machinists making 80k a year who risk their own personal safety making these parts.I have EE friends with master degrees who design PCBs that are printed millions of times that struggle to afford rent.It makes no sense. Why is web software so easy to make money in? Why do we value hard engineering so little?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My friend is an EE that I went to school with. He&#39;s very bright and definitely sharper and harder working than me.
I went to school for Chemistry and switched to DevOps - which are the not the highest paid of SEs.
I make 1.5x what he does. I help run a package tracking dashboard. He ensures power systems for millions of people work flawlessly in all conditions. He&#39;s looking to quit the industry because its so hopeless."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you are like me and wondering &#34;What makes carbon different from Rust or Zig?    1. The ability to interoperate with a wide variety of code, such as classes/structs and templates, not just free functions.

    2. A willingness to expose the idioms of C++ into Carbon code, and the other way around, when necessary to maximize performance of the interoperability layer.

    3. The use of wrappers and generic programming, including templates, to minimize or eliminate runtime overhead.

In otherwords, what carbon can do that Rust can&#39;t do, is take a C++ class with a `foo` method and call that method.  Or create a class with a `foo` method and call that method from C++.  Probably one of the biggest hurdles to get over in C++ interopt.  Most don&#39;t do that, instead you&#39;d make a C function binding and struct and move data/invoke functions through that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s not immediately obvious from this page and GitHub org, but this is a Google led project. It&#39;s led by Chandler and the c++ toolchain team. I have no idea of it&#39;s endgoals or how open to non-Google ideas it will be."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the end of the safety document:&gt; Overall, Carbon is making a compromise around safety in order to give a path for C++ to evolve. C++ developers must be comfortable migrating their codebases, and able to do so in a largely automated manner. In order to achieve automated migration, Carbon cannot require fundamental redesigns of migrated C++ code. While a migration tool could in theory mark all migrated code as unsafe, Carbon should use a safety strategy that degrades gracefully and offers improvements for C++ code, whether migrated or not.&gt; That does not mean Carbon will never adopt guaranteed safety by default, only that performance and migration of C++ code takes priority, and any design will need to be considered in the context of other goals. It should still be possible to adopt guaranteed safety later, although it will require identifying a migration path.That&#39;s very interesting and pragmatic. It would be interesting if they can eventually come up with the same level of safety guarantees via a different path than Rust&#39;s borrow checker.-------------Since one of their goals is to automatically translate modern C++ to Carbon, I do wonder how well that is going to work in general.I definitely welcome an alternative to C++ that would be easier to read and understand. That would be a benefit to the world."</p>

If the state of the resource changes such that the allowable actions available on that resource change (for example, if the account goes into overdraft) then the HTML response would change to show the new set of actions available.If the client knows nothing about the meaning of the responses, it cannot do  anything with them but show  them to a human for interpretation. This would suggest a restful api is not made for system-to-system communication, but requires human mediation at every step of the way, which is precisely not how api’s are used. In short, this definition of restful api’s can’t be right, because it suggests restful interfaces aren’t api’s at all. Once a programmer adds code to parse the responses and extract meaningful data, treating the restful interface as an api, the tight coupling between client and server reappears."</p>

You may be right historically and normatively, but everyone does and says differently and, in real life, usage prevails over norms.Same goes for REST."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like the author has conflated hypertext with html.The REST interface should be self describing, but that can be done in JSON.If you go to Roy Fielding&#39;s post... there is a comment where someone asks for clarification, and he responds:&gt; When I say hypertext, I mean the simultaneous presentation of information and controls such that the information becomes the affordance through which the user (or automaton) obtains choices and selects actions. Hypermedia is just an expansion on what text means to include temporal anchors within a media stream; most researchers have dropped the distinction.&gt; Hypertext does not need to be HTML on a browser. Machines can follow links when they understand the data format and relationship types.So, to me, a proper format is something like...id: 1234url: http://.../1234name: foodepartment: http://.../department/5555projects: http://.../projects/?user_id=1234This is hypertext in the sense that I can jump around (even in a browser that renders the urls clickable) to other resources related to this resource."</p>

Now, even with little change to statutory law, most see that the best interpretation of the various traditional categories, exceptions, &amp; affordances of copyright law is the one that finds legal space for a Wayback Machine.Bulk-scanning books-still-in-copyright, even for private preservation/use? Was legally iffy when Google &amp; IA started doing it; now better recognized as legitimate.Accepting user/collector uploads of live concerts? Storing, serving, &amp; providing emulated environments for old still-in-copyright retail PC/game/arcade software? Bulk-archiving &amp; replaying TV news broadcasts? All iffy when IA started doing them, becoming accepted as reasonable over time by the demonstration-of-utility.An Internet Archive that waited for legal clarity before starting such projects would still be waiting today – and we&#39;d have neither the valuable projects, nor the accumulated experience/clarity, from the actual doing, about what is reasonable &amp; beneficial."</p>

Currently it&#39;s all located in the US and they have a huge focus on the US, both technically and politically.But why not try to replicate it all over the world? There seems to have been some smaller efforts inside the Internet Archive to make it more decentralized, but it feels like it should be a much bigger focus on it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My interest in science started when a friend and I folded a few paper planes, tested them over a small downhill section outside my house, made notes about what worked, tweaked and experimented with new designs, and so on. It blew my little mind that with structured experimentation you could design things that actually got better with each generation. Where would the improvements stop?With hindsight, I realise that most of the improvements we measured were really just statistical noise. We never had a control plane, so if one by accident flew better one test, then we would tweak something and then we would naturally see regression to the mean, but we would record that as a tweak that made things worse.To little me it was a lesson in deliberate design. To grown-up me I guess it&#39;s a lesson in how easy it is to delude yourself without proper experiment design and statistics.Anyway, then after seeing my interest my father brought me an early Windows program that contained animated instructions on some paper plane designs. One of them was vastly superior to anything I had ever seen. But with the years, I forgot how to fold it. I had been looking for it for over 20 years when a few months ago, I wanted to show my son (of two years) a good paper plane and guess what? I think I&#39;ve found the design! But it took a blurry YouTube video and some trial and error. I ought to write it down some day."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In fourth grade we had a paper airplane contest, but they had a restriction on the design: a circle about the size of a quarter was on the page, and no fold or crease could go through the circle.The circle was located a few inches above the exact center of the paper.Anyway I made a &#34;dart&#34;, and just offset the angle a little to avoid the circle. It was good, and most of the competition was incredibly bad. And a few maybe had a bad launch. One throw only.One clever design was submitted by a duo composed of my two worst nine year old enemies: Derek and Derek&#39;s sidekick. It was basically a UFO (saucer) made by carefully crumpling the edge until it was a nice size to throw. They threw it sidearm with one finger hooked around the rim.It really sailed, maybe went twice as far as the second best plane: my plane.But their plane was disqualified on the grounds that it wasn&#39;t a plane. So, I was deemed winner.For the announcements the next morning, my name was announced as the wrong-gendered version (something like Jesse announced as Jessica) and it definitely didn&#39;t feel like a win anymore.I still like paper airplanes, though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My favorite paper plane is the one that is explained starting at 03:00 here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BNg4fDJC8AOut of all paper planes I tried, it has the best flying capabilities by far.Form and function really come together in this one. It looks beautifully simple and elegant. And that&#39;s also how it flies. When you throw it from a rooftop, you are in for quite a show. It often flies loooong smooth circles. If you are lucky with the wind, it can stay in the air quite a while.I do not use A4 paper though. I prefer A5, which is half the size of A4. I usually tear an A4 into two equal halves and use one of them.I also do not do the crease at 04:18. Without it, the paper plane is even more beautiful, because you can put it on a flat surface and it stands on its own."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To everyone replying with their coffee preferences, you may be missing the point. This post isn’t about coffee, it’s about people and experiences in life being more important than products. It’s about a product’s quality being defined not by its substance but by its reminder of things that can’t be purchased. It’s one of the most beautiful posts I’ve seen in a long time. Hope you look beyond the coffee.Edit: Hope I didn&#39;t come across as too harsh to folks replying with their favourite coffee styles. I think I find myself in a near-constant state of, &#34;but what about the things that matter&#34; when spending time in VC/Startup/SV/AI/crypto/etc. culture. I know more unhappy-but-wildly-successful people here than I can shake a stick at, and I think we (as a community) are hugely complicit in pushing a consumerist culture where stuff&gt;people. I was deeply moved to see a piece surface to HN which poetically argued for the opposite value set, and I had a moment of frustration when it wasn&#39;t clear that it was coming across to people in the comments. :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve gone through several coffee phases, some bordering on extreme — extremely sensitive weighing, timing, $2,000 grinders, $10k espresso machine, etc.My happy medium is just doing basic pour overs, but with really good locally roasted coffee. To me, this is the cheapest and best approach.In fact, even if pour overs require too much work (weighing, timing), then just do drip. But do it with quality coffee.Quality is really about roasting time and date. You don’t want old coffee (anything older than a few weeks isn’t good), and low temp. Dark roast is burnt. It’s not a flavor. It’s used to remove the taste from shitty beans. If you use quality beans you want light to medium. This usually isn’t an option with quality beans anyway. They typically only sell the coffee roasted one way. So in most cases, you won’t even have to worry about.Anyway, I guess my point is the opposite of the article. You don’t have to drink shit coffee to save money."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This was a really beautiful post.As for coffee, like many other parts of life (movies, food, and music especially), I find that I like it very good or very bad—as long as it’s not down the middle, I can find a time/place to enjoy it.I have a fairly expensive Rocket Espresso machine, I’ve learned some latte art. I have every coffee making contraption out there. And I enjoy all of it, at times.When I’m in a hurry I’ll make instant or go to a gas station. Totally fine and the gas station coffee is kind of a favorite of mine for long trips in the car.What I almost never do is buy Starbucks because to me, it feels like that middle-of-the-road experience. I’m not making a statement about the company or the culture or anything like that. It just feels like going to Applebees or something (yes you’re out to eat, but shouldn’t you just go somewhere nice or, on the other hand, somewhere cheaper/faster where you don’t have to tip?). It’s too acidic and too expensive for what it is. I’d rather pay for something nicer or go cheap."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When speaking about Sardinia they keep saying that their diet was mostly vegetarian:&#34;The classic Sardinian diet is plant based, consisting of whole-grain bread, beans, garden vegetables, and fruits. Meat is largely reserved for Sundays and special occasions. Sardinians drink wine moderately.&#34;Truth is that the Shepherds (the centenaries are mostly found in this group) were actually eating more animal protein and fat compared to the rest of the population.https://snipboard.io/gbi9JY.jpgThey can keep lying to most people just because you can&#39;t understand Italian but whenever people from those towns are interviewed they always repeat that they were not vegetarians. 
Here a quick translation from this yt video:Graziano who got to 102 
got asked if he got to 102yo
because he had always followed a
mediterranean diet.
He asked what&#39;s that?
It means that you always ate vegetables.
Vegetables are bad for you, I 
ate the grass of 100 sheeps because
I ate the sheeps. And indeed
he only ate meat, meaning that this whole
alimentation thing should be checked again.https://youtu.be/LQTocSMm7tw?t=647"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I read the books and enjoyed them.- To respond to one criticism seen widely here, the authors claim to have validated ages with historical municipal birth records in all the Blue Zones. I cannot speak to these particular zones, but I&#39;ve been doing genealogical research on my own ancestry and I am absolutely blown away by the ubiquity and detail of both municipal and Catholic church records in Sicily in the 1800s.  Preunification Italy was under the rule of various northern European countries and was heavily influenced by their standards of record keeping. I cannot say if this applies to the other countries in the book, but generally speaking, just because these records are old doesn&#39;t mean they are bad.- One thing that was very notable in the books but isn&#39;t discussed very much is that, with the exception of the Loma Linda cohort, the Blue Zone areas are all quite poor. They all primarily eat food they are able to grow or harvest themselves, out of necessity, which encourages simple and consistent diets. They have routine, simple lives that are made fulfilling by concentrating on community, family, and friends.  They are content with what little they have and do not strive for more than they need.I found the books quite inspiring.  I think the lessons learned are good, even if they won&#39;t get me to 100.  In any case I&#39;ve felt much better and lost weight on a closer-to-Blue-Zone diet than I did before."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One Ikarian in particular, Stamatis Moraitis, moved to America when he was 22 years old to pursue the American dream. He was a painter, and immediately started having success, bought a house, married, and had 3 kids. At the age of 66 years, he developed terminal lung cancer. Instead of dying in America, he decided to move back to Ikaria and moved in with his parents. He started breathing the air, drinking the wine, and eating a Mediterranean diet. After a few months, he planted a garden not planning on ever getting to harvest the vegetables; 37 years later he has a vineyard producing 200 L of wine a year. His secret he says? “I just forgot to die.”This is where I think the article loses its credibility significantly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I planted some thousands of trees in Iceland in the noughties. I believe the program was funded by Alcoa to offset the carbon produced by an aluminum plant they were building on the island. They paid farmers to plant trees on unused land, and the farmers hired and hosted us to do the work. It was an amazing way to see the country. We mostly planted larch, birch and alder from what I remember. It is a very beautiful country, like an arctic Hawaii."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Planting forests increases the overall amount of carbon stored in biomass, but the forestry program is also designed to harvest trees for use as fuel or building material (from the main article linked in the post):&gt; &#34;In the meantime, Iceland’s forests have begun to produce wood for a small timber market. Forests planted between 1950-1970 are now supplying around 5,000 square metres of wood per year: miniscule compared to industries abroad, but a start. The Icelandic birch, Siberian larch, Sitka spruce, lodgepole pine and balsam poplar are producing quality wood of equal or superior quality to that which Iceland imports from abroad. Yet an overwhelming 80% of the trees felled are burned as fuel in silicon smelting.&#34;Iceland has a silicon production industry, which relies on geothermal electricity interestingly enough.  The wood is included to grab the oxygen from silicon dioxide to produce elemental silicon metal (being emitted as carbon dioxide).  Overall, if they could eliminate the coal from the mix, this would be a carbon-neutral fossil-fuel free silicon production system:https://www.pcc.is/&gt; &#34;Silicon metal is extracted from quartzite, aided by the addition of wood chip and coal, in electric arc furnaces at temperatures of around 2,000 degrees Celsius. The new plant obtains its key raw material quartzite primarily from PCC’s own quarry in Zagórze, Poland. However, the related logistical costs are more than outweighed by the advantages of electricity procurement. And the dust emissions generated during silicon metal production are almost completely removed from the ambient air by high-performance filter systems installed in the PCC plant. Taken as a whole, therefore, the production process offers exceptional sustainability credentials.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have been donating some money every month to an Icelandic tree planting project to offset my carbon emissions after reading an article on HN about how the Vikings cut all trees of the island. I find the numbers fascinating :&gt; Forests and bushes now cover over 2% of Iceland, Vísir reports. That number may not seem like much, but since 1990, the surface area covered by forest or shrubs in Iceland has increased more than six times over – from 7,000 hectares to 45,000. In 20 years, the number is expected to be 2.6%.And from another article :&gt; The Forest Service intends to deliver six million plants this year, says Þröstur, which is equivalent to pre-crash levels of production. “It was around five million last year, and four million the year before that. This is a rapid increase. Then we need seven to eight million next year, which we may not manage, and ten to twelve in 2025.”"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My favorite feature is &#34;video-sync=display-resample&#34;. This gives you perfect frame pacing by synchronizing the video to vertical refresh and resampling the audio to match. If you set your refresh rate to an integer multiple of the frame rate, every frame will be shown for the exact same time. The audio resampling compensates for very small discrepancies between speeds by imperceptibly changing the audio speed. It&#39;s similar to the proprietary DirectShow filter &#34;ReClock&#34;, but AFAIK ReClock does not dynamically adjust the speed to compensate for clock drift like MPV does, in which case you could theoretically still get imperfect frame pacing. (I haven&#39;t actually used ReClock so I could be mistaken here.)Also great is MPV&#39;s support for arbitrary OpenGL shaders. This can include very complicated shaders, e.g. real-time neural network upscaling:https://github.com/igv/FSRCNN-TensorFlow/releasesSD video can look surprisingly good after upscaling with this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I highly recommend doing what I have done most of my career. Get a job at smaller to medium sized non-tech company. Every company, in any industry, has computers. They need you. You don&#39;t have to work with a bunch of tech or finance people. You can get a job working with chill people in some other industry with a better culture.When it comes time to negotiate, negotiate HARD. And not just for money, but especially time. Ask for so much that you think they will laugh or be scared away. If they say no, you lose nothing. Eventually the right opportunity will appear. I didn&#39;t think anyone would say yes to a 4-day work week, but I kept asking. Eventually someone said yes.The one worry I am having these days is how long this strategy will remain viable. As SaaS and low/no code solutions proliferate, it makes little sense for non-tech companies to build when they can buy. This is especially true as engineer compensation continues to rise. Engineers who congregate at SaaS companies can build better products than a handful out on their own who are building a solution for just one company. Increasingly, the only engineers that non-tech companies need are people to manage their data, people to glue the SaaS APIs together, and maybe some frontend people to put a custom interface on it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think most people here can. That&#39;s why, when people have enough money to retire, they DO retire, and not continue working. Work for most people is trading  time and physical and mental health for money. In our profession, we got it better than most, but the underlying principle is still the same.Also, there are definitely better and worse companies. I&#39;m currently in the best job of my life (well paying, fully remote, very little meetings, no micromanagement, using interesting and cutting edge technology), but it took me 15 years to get there. The catch is that such companies don&#39;t have to hire that often (because people don&#39;t tend to leave them), so most openings at the market in any given moment are from shit companies where average tenure is 18-24 months and half of the staff has low-grade depression. The job market is essentially a market for lemons, unfortunately."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel exactly the same. Programming professionally for a decade sucked all the joy out of it.My personal hypothesis is that we’re increasingly being treated like assembly line workers. We’re not paid to think but to implement the poorly thought out hare brained schemes from the higher ups who have no clue about programming. This externalizes all the cost of poor quality software onto the developers (unmaintainable code, constant outages…) while  reaping the short term benefits for themselves (promotions, raises)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s important everyone becomes educated about the fact that virtually every mobile app sells some part of your data that leads to some private company possessing the ability to draw a circle around your house on map and then detect all patterns of life without any PII.I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to pit this as a US gov&#39;t surveillance problem. It&#39;s true though - the Government missions involved, where this type of data is relevant, face rather compelling offerings especially in complex times; e.g. immigrant/refugee surges where understanding the flow of people up to the border is important for stability.All of this data comes from Big/Small/all tech; usually branded as &#34;ad tech&#34; or &#34;mobility data&#34;. And the supply chain is rather murky, masked, and rebranded/repackaged numerous times between a network of data providers &amp; downstream businesses.Working close to Government... I&#39;ve never seen any mission specifically seeking large-scale citizen-based tracking capabilities.  US government in recent timeframes have seemed adamant about not purchasing any US-based location data &amp; are cautious even for non-US based monitoring; especially as they learn more about the origins &amp; scale of mobility data."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Every person, living and dead, has been uniquely identified and is tracked in near real time.Source: I read the news, don&#39;t suffer from amnesia or willful ignorance.We used Seisent (since bought by LexisNexus) in the mid-aughts. At the time, every person in North America was accounted for, with pretty good coverage of the Caribbean and Central America. The NSA bought a few clusters, then wove in their own datasets (phone use, location tracking, credit cards, library usage, email, etc).There are many entities maintaining all encompassing panopticonic demographic databases. Governments and publicly traded companies. This is not refutable.Ironically, in the USA, both voter registration and gun ownership are explicitly excluded. Because reasons. (You can&#39;t manage what you don&#39;t measure.)We could, trivially, resolve all the policy food fights over vote registration &#34;fraud&#34;, gun ownership, and conducting the consensus. Turn all those flash points into simple database queries.We could, trivially, outright stop all anonymous trolling and disinformation. Purveyors of social media don&#39;t authenticate their users because they don&#39;t want to. Their business models require that they remain willfully ignorant."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Aside stopping the use of Facebook, which of course is the best solution but not doable for many, the AdNauseam (.io, browser extension) approach to pollute their tracking data might be inspirational.
The gist is: can&#39;t eliminate ad links? Then have an app &#34;click&#34; all of them randomly so that counters become irrelevant. So there is this link that identifies user X?, well then write an extension that distributes and &#34;clicks&#34; it around on say 1000 other machines in a p2p way so that it becomes meaningless.I have no idea if it&#39;s doable in this FB context, but usually when links can&#39;t be anonymized, the next move is to make them produce irrelevant data by adding noise."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I haven&#39;t used Facebook in quite a while, but when I did I had a set of userscripts to defuse this tracking. It worked similarly to Google link stripping, by defusing the JavaScript that rewrote the link between the time you clicked it and when your browser opened it. Initially I built it because the free wireless internet in my apartment was unreliable and the redirects could be enough to prevent a page from opening. My method was pretty blunt - I removed element entities that held the target URL, and that broke the listener function. A later iteration would actually unset the listener event. This all worked because it seemed important to FB that you be able to see where the link would take you (e.g. by hovering). I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if Facebook&#39;s paternalism (and Google&#39;s for that matter, but I haven&#39;t seen it from them, though I mainly use DDG now) now led them to add this &#34;protection&#34; directly to links as they&#39;re served up. I can&#39;t tell from the article whether that&#39;s the case, and at this point I&#39;m not going to log in to FB to figure it out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I would love to stop using Facebook, Instagram or Whatsapp, but I would really need to criple my social life if I&#39;d give up on any of these. And I&#39;m not even a very active person, it&#39;s just that so many people I want to engage with have a huge chunk of their lives tied to one of these.I can&#39;t understand the people saying there is a free market choice here, this can only be solved with simple regulation that targest large platforms.If the SEC can use its judgement on what constitutes a security, than we can have a social media comission to oversee Facebook."</p>

I mean, really—Orwell?I&#39;m referring to the omission of this passage: &#34;I should like to put it on record that I have never been able to dislike Hitler. Ever since he came to power—till then, like nearly everyone, I had been deceived into thinking that he did not matter—I have reflected that I would certainly kill him if I could get within reach of him, but that I could feel no personal animosity.... that several commenters pointed out:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32135108https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32133675https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32130897All: in the future, if you notice something like this, could you please send us a heads up at hn@ycombinator.com? We can&#39;t read all the articles or comments, but we do read all the emails, usually within a few hours. We will be especially grateful if you point out a flaw as massive as this one.Edit: I couldn&#39;t resist diffing the bowdlerized text with the gutenberg.net.au one and the eliding of that bit is the only difference between the two, other than punctuation.Edit 2: it turns out that bookmarks.reviews is guilty only of blogspam. They got the thing from https://www.openculture.com/2014/08/george-orwell-reviews-me..., which links to https://carnegiecouncil-media.storage.googleapis.com/files/v... (via https://boingboing.net/2014/08/17/orwells-review-of-mein-kam...). That looks like a decades-old copy of the 1968 edition, edited by Orwell&#39;s widow. I doubt that it was she who dropped that sentence—I bet it was whoever reprinted the essay. Considering that Orwell specifically wrote &#34;I should like to put it on record&#34;, that took some brass, or lack of it.The degree to which Orwell practiced intellectual honesty is an endless marvel. If there&#39;s one thing we should learn from anybody, it&#39;s that from him."</p>

Ever since he came to power—till then, like nearly everyone, I had been deceived into thinking that he did not matter—I have reflected that I would certainly kill him if I could get within reach of him, but that I could feel no personal animosity. The fact is that there is something deeply appealing about him.In the linked version that is represented by &#34;...&#34; which is easy to miss[1] http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks16/1600051h.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So, there&#39;s a lot to be said about Hitler and fascism and propaganda and all the other fascinating topics Orwell brings up here, but I&#39;d just like to point out how routinely excellent Orwell&#39;s analysis is.  Of course I mostly see the best bits brought out and dusted off, no doubt he did mediocre stuff as well, but it is worth noticing how often it turns out that Orwell, nearly a century on, still has plenty in his writing worth revisiting."</p>

The app remembered the actual map data but did not remember the address I had just typed in to the program 15 minutes earlier. I had to guess what street address I was heading to! Why they designed the app to store all search history exclusively in the cloud and not keep a local copy is beyond me, but I presume when working at google they always have an excellent connection and hadn’t thought of what would happen if a user lost service. Being able to at least see the search history would have saved me some grief!"</p>

Very short and concise book- extremely well-written with a personality. Requires basic CS math.3. Algorithm Design Manual by Skeina. Extremely approachable as well.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One practice that&#39;s helped me is to always cancel immediately, which translates to only paying for one month. Ie. for spotify, netflix pay for the subscription, immediately jump through the hoops to cancel.Forgetfulness turns into money savings, and as a bonus I get to review whether I am getting much out of it. Especially for tv like disney/netflix/apple tv, I often run though everything interesting and don&#39;t have much else to watch with them.Also psychologically there&#39;s resistance to a boring to do that involves loss.

It turns out that when it takes more than 1-click to buy stuff… we buy less stuff.As far as convenience, one of the reasons we felt it was time to cancel is that we can just as easily get almost anything we wanted from Amazon direct from the seller or via Target/Best Buy/B&amp;N/B&amp;H. Surprisingly, this is often cheaper than Amazon (and almost never more expensive). While there’s a bit of added friction to think for two seconds which store to check, the benefit of fewer impulse buys seems worth it. Plus, we haven’t ended up with any crappy knockoffs since we bailed on Amazon."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The censoring is so horrible that Chinese are using other country&#39;s name to substitute China. For example, there is a question in Zhihu, &#34;Will China become the next technological powerhouse?&#34;. The answer is talking about Russia literally, but it&#39;s about China. (Below is the answer translated by deepl).I don&#39;t want to talk about China, I want to talk about Russia.Can Russia become the next technological powerhouse? Of course not.Because the ceiling of Russian intelligence or wisdom is Putin. There is no one in Russia who can claim to be more intelligent than Putin. Russia can do without anyone, but not without Putin. Although we do not know whether Putin has any relevant qualifications or experience in the industry, all Russian businesses and professions depend on Putin&#39;s guidance and must hold up Putin&#39;s ideas and banners, otherwise they will not be able to move forward. Putin is the ceiling of Russia. How can a country with a ceiling become a technological powerhouse?Look at the United States. Who dares to direct the work of Musk, whether Trump or Biden? Who dares to direct the business strategies of Apple and Google? I find that in the US, it seems that anyone can say they are smarter than the president, it seems that anyone can say they are smarter than the president. The technology companies in the US seem to be able to run smoothly without the guidance of Biden&#39;s ideas, and they seem to be able to develop technology without raising the banner of Biden&#39;s ideas, and they seem to be doing quite well. I find that the US is a country that has no ceiling in terms of intelligence or ingenuity, and that is always improving. Only such a country can become a technological powerhouse."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The linked story kind of buries the context info:&gt; Nomura said the refusal to pay mortgages stems from the widespread practice in China of selling homes before they’re built. Funds from presales are kept in escrow accounts to use for construction. But confidence that projects will be completed has weakened as developers’ cash woes intensified.&gt; “Inappropriate usage of presale proceeds and the lack of adequate supervision of escrow accounts by local regulators and banks are likely associated with these mortgage suspension cases,” Zerlina Zeng, a senior analyst at CreditSights, wrote in a note."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The background for this is that most existing UI toolkits are a poor fit for Rust.Rust doesn&#39;t like having shared mutable state, but event-based UIs have a global event loop and can mutate anything at any time.Rust works best with strictly tree-shaped data structures, but event handlers turn trees of widgets into arbitrary webs with possibility of circular references.Rust prefers everything thread-safe, but many UI toolkits can&#39;t even be touched from a &#34;non-main&#34; thread.Rust&#39;s object-oriented programming features are pretty shallow, and Rust doesn&#39;t have inheritance. That makes it awkward to model most toolkits that have deep hierarchies with a base View type and a dozen of Button subclasses.So instead of retrofitting mutable single-threaded OOP to a functional multi-threaded language, there&#39;s a quest to find another approach for UIs. This change of approach has worked for games. Rust wasn&#39;t nice for &#34;class Player extends Entity&#34; design, but turned out to be a great fit the ECS pattern."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the web really killed the idea of &#34;native&#34; widgets. I think the rise of web apps just got everyone used to the idea that controls are just going to look different everywhere. Even on macOS, practically every app I use has a very distinct look and set of widgets (vscode, photoshop, blender, spotify -- two of those are electron, but even the non-electron stuff doesn&#39;t look very much like a &#34;mac&#34; app anymore). And in windows, microsoft really killed it themselves by constantly updating their own apps with non-standard widgets that everyone else wanted to clone (I remember the longest time it seemed like the only new things of note in every new version of ms office was how the toolbars looked). I suppose it&#39;s not a terrible thing, but I do kinda miss the days of windows 2000 and classic macos where the platform had a (somewhat) uniform look and feel."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I like Scratch - my kid uses it and I worked briefly with the guy who made Blockly, the underlying visual programming toolkit - but the programming environment makes many things far too complicated with its singular focus on sprites.It&#39;s very, very difficult to do things as simple as display a number on screen. My 7yo was making a number guessing game, and to display a two-digit number we had to make two sprites that had 10 &#34;costumes&#34; (0-9) then do modular math to select the costume for each digit. Sprites also have their own code, and if you duplicate one and edit the code the edits don&#39;t apply to the duplicate - so there&#39;s no user library or abstraction power at all.This made dealing with Scratch far more complex and time-consuming than the logic of the game my kid was making, which is the exact opposite of what you want in a learning environment. I don&#39;t really want to focus on the idiosyncrasies of Scratch when teaching programming.Some simple text and drawing commands, user-defined functions, and a library would go a huge way towards making Scratch simpler. There are some other Blockly-based environments that may have this... but they&#39;re not as popular."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At work we built a BI tool around Scratch (Blockly) back in 2013. It’s still seeing daily use: https://www.dialogic.nl/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/demo1.gif"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It is great that Scratch can be used as an introduction to programming, but that is not why it was created. It was part of the MIT MediaLab &#34;Computer Clubhouse&#34;[1] project where it would be used to enable a remix culture of cute animations and even simple games. Scratch&#39;s implementer, John Maloney, had already helped create a programming environment for kids called EToys[2] using Squeak Smalltalk, just as in the first versions of Scratch (later rewritten in Flash and then in Javascript).So the comments about how it is hard to do in Scratch something that would be trivial in Basic or some other language are not surprising. It is an animation system that allows you to use programming to increment that.As others have pointed out, a system with the same visual as Scratch but design for actually programming is Snap![3] so it is just a matter of using the tools for what they were created to do.[1] https://web.media.mit.edu/~mres/papers/Clubhouse/Clubhouse.h...[2] http://squeakland.org/[3] https://snap.berkeley.edu/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For those who are interested and may not know; Bill Watterson also ghost-drew a few strips for the comic Pearls Before Swine (part of an arc beginning on the 2nd of June 2014[0] and continuing till the 8th). There are a couple of neat references to who it is behind the better art (anyone who&#39;s read Watterson&#39;s complaints on shrinking panel space in print media will be familiar with the guest character&#39;s comments) and I recall an old blog post by the artist of Pearls describing what it was like to work with Bill (terrifying; the thought of the postal worker just chucking these, the only comics anyone had gotten out of Watterson in years, onto his porch in the rain was horrible), but I can&#39;t find it.[0]: https://www.gocomics.com/pearlsbeforeswine/2014/06/02EDIT: Nevermind, found it! https://stephanpastis.wordpress.com/2014/06/07/ever-wished-t..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been running a Calvin &amp; Hobbes bot for ~20 years now.  Back when Google Reader was a thing, the bot published an RSS feed which had greater than &gt;1M subscribers.  It&#39;s now a bot on Reddit (/u/CalvinBot) with &gt;700k karma.During that time, I&#39;ve tried to be very mindful of Watterson&#39;s copyright and make sure I don&#39;t violate it anyway.This had led to some interesting &#34;bugs.&#34;  Specifically amuniversal.com only publishes the comic strip as a GIF.  But the official Reddit mobile app has a bug.  It treats all GIFs as a video &amp; disables other image features, like zooming.  The nature of C&amp;H is such that very often want to zoom to see all the wonderful details Mr. Watterson put into the strip.Because of that I routinely get complaints about it being in a GIF (&#34;GIFs are for movies!&#34; the whippersnappers say) and tell me to publish them as JPG or PNG.  Now converting a GIF to JPG or PNG is trivial, but there&#39;s no way I can do so without violating his copyright.  I&#39;d have to host the converted image myself, which I don&#39;t have the right the do.So I won&#39;t do it.It&#39;s minor, but knowing Watterson felt so passionate about copyright, I think it&#39;s important to honor.  But because the team at Reddit won&#39;t fix the bug, the complaints continue to come rolling in.  Enough that I wrote a FAQ about it:https://www.reddit.com/r/CalvinBot/comments/bdxb6h/why_are_p...If any C&amp;H fans knows anyone on the team at Reddit, I&#39;d much appreciate it if you could ask them to fix it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; In the old days, there was this idea of “selling out” and we as a culture decided that it was bad. Monetizing a thing immediately called into question its integrity, and more importantly, the integrity of the artist. But then an interesting thing began happening in the late 90’s and early 00’s. The idea of selling out lost its negative connotation.It did? I completely missed that, but it&#39;s probably because I&#39;m old..."</p>

(Author misinterprets appearances of `www.domain` and `domain` in his source list as errant duplicates, when in fact that may be an indicator that those `www.domain` entries also have significant `subdomain.www.domain` extensions – depending on what Majestic means by &#39;subnets&#39;.)• Many sites may block `curl` requests because they only want attended human browser traffic, and such blocking (while usually accompanied with some error response) can be a more aggressive drop-connection.• `curl` given a naked hostname likely attempts a plain HTTP connection, and given that even browsers now auto-prefix `https:` for a naked hostname, some active sites likely have nothing listening on plain-HTTP port anymore.• Author&#39;s burst of activity could&#39;ve triggered other rate-limits/failures - either at shared hosts/inbound proxies servicing many of the target domains, or at local ISP egresses or DNS services. He&#39;d need to drill-down into individual failures to get a beter idea to what extent this might be happening.If you want to probe if domains are still active:• confirm they&#39;re still registered via a `whois`-like lookup• examine their DNS records for evidence of current services• ping them, or any DNS-evident subdomains• if there are any MX records, check if the related SMTP server will confirm any likely email addresses (like postmaster@) as deliverable. (But: don&#39;t send an actual email message.)• (more at risk of being perceived as aggressive) scan any extant domains (from DNS) for open ports running any popular (not just HTTP) servicesIf you want to probe if web sites are still active, start with an actual list of web site URLs that were known to have been active at some point."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I strongly dislike the idea of automatically jumping into a folder when there’s only one match: it feels like a feature optimised for very slow typers that actively penalises fast typers, because it makes things generally unpredictable: will one character be enough to navigate, or two, or three? It depends on the siblings, and if you type more characters than are required, you will be penalised by ending up somewhere else as the remaining letters are fed to the next level down that you haven’t even seen yet. My general habit in navigating is to type three characters and press Tab, because that’s almost always sufficient, and is plenty fast. I have a very few places where I’ve learned to do other things. Under my habit, I could end up as much as two levels down from where I wanted to be."</p>

Its designed to be a command line TUI helper, sorta like the project here, with not only cursor/etc based directory navigation but copy/rename/delete/etc functionality just a keystroke away. Its fairly convenient because it overlays the command line rather than replacing it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s a lot of comments on this thread pointing out typical bandwidth usage of popular streaming services, games etc and claiming that there&#39;s no need for higher bandwidth connections.There&#39;s an important point that I think people are missing, which is that the bandwidth usage of internet services is going to be carefully tuned to balance quality and stability at typical internet speeds. When a large portion of consumers have &lt; 100Mbps down of course all services are going to use &lt; 100Mbps of bandwidth - you don&#39;t know what kind of stuff you&#39;re missing out on because of these slow internet speeds, because nobody is making it available, because it wouldn&#39;t work.The most obvious thing that we already know we&#39;re missing out on is video streaming quality. You&#39;ve possibly already noticed that low contrast dark scenes and scenes with snow/rainfall don&#39;t look very good on Netflix/YouTube/insert streaming service here - this is because these are the kind of scenes with the most obvious sacrifice of quality from video compression.

As others said, there is a lack of both competition and pricing to worry about too.In a major tech hub like San Francisco, where I live, it&#39;s possible to get 1gb/1gb in some areas for under $90, but which those are isn&#39;t consistent nor wide spread. Home cell coverage at 100/20 is spotty at best, and there is only one flat rate vendor (T-Mobile Home, no Verizon Home yet). For those outside of the Bay Area exurbs, I can only imagine the horrors of Comcast/Xfinity or only DSL people must deal with.Looking forward, the FCC is assuming that people are just watching Netflix, Tiktok, and making angry Karen posts on Nextdoor. We&#39;re not sure where web3 will lead, and how much bandwidth will that take: Distributed file systems/data privacy? Fast crypto transactions? Metaverse/VR/AR glasses/contacts? And what about latency?1000/500 should be the FCC goal."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem, in the USA for most people, is Comcast.Downspeed hardly matters. It&#39;s been plenty for decades. Upload speed has stagnated. I uploaded as fast in 2003 as I do now in 2022. And as others have said, it&#39;s not so much about 1 fast provider as many providers and choice. In my comcast monopoly my plan started at $60/mo in 2011 and without any changes on my end and no change in my upload speed that price has increased to it&#39;s current $105/mo. In addition to the price increases they&#39;ve implemented a new system of total data transfer limits ((up/down)+internal overhead) meaning even if I could have a faster connection it&#39;d mean nothing if I used it in the first week and then got hit with multiple $10 overage &#34;fees&#34;.But I don&#39;t have a choice. It doesn&#39;t matter how good, or bad, Comcast is. They&#39;re the only game in town."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s actually some science behind this diet. Potatoes are the highest scoring food on the satiety index. https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/15-incredibly-filling-f...Basically they&#39;re the most filling food per calorie. So if you subscribe to the idea that losing weight is mainly about how many calories you consume, a potato heavy diet should be effective.And an all potato diet, while monomaniacal, even more effective.Eggs and fish are also very high on the satiety index. If you threw in pretty much any vegetables and spices of your choosing and just stuck to those along with potatoes, even with a cheat day or three you&#39;d have a very healthy diet which I bet most people would lose weight on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I spent a few weeks eating only potatoes and vegetable oil, several years ago. It wasn&#39;t for weight loss, it was because I was breastfeeding, and my baby had some kind of protein sensitivity we couldn&#39;t nail down. Potatoes turned out to be a safe food for him, so that&#39;s all I ate for a while. As it happens potatoes are my favorite food, and I had vegetable oil available so I could eat fries/chips/crisps, but even then I can&#39;t imagine doing it without a similarly serious motivation. When my choices were &#34;listen to the baby cry in pain every time he eats&#34; or &#34;eat potatoes until the allergist appointment,&#34; it was an easy choice. Otherwise I wouldn&#39;t last long on the potato diet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The only reason the potato diet is interesting to me (and presumably the reason it&#39;s interesting to the https://slimemoldtimemold.com/ folks) is the likely relationship to their environmental contaminant hypothesis for the public health issue of increasing body weights since 1980, outlined in a series of posts here: http://achemicalhunger.com/In short, while the variety and satiety explanations make a lot of sense subjectively for an individual on this diet, they don&#39;t match up with the empirical data on weight gain since 1980. Here are a few phenomena that are not explained by this hypothesis:* The inflection point at right around 1980. There&#39;s no specific change that occurred in 1980 that anyone can point to that indicates a major change in variety of food in the average diet.* The correllation of weight gain with location in watersheds: high altitude locales where surface water has not moved very far (e.g. Colorado) exhibit the weight gain phenomena much less than locales deeper down in the watershed (e.g. Mississippi and Louisiana)I&#39;m not interested in fad diets or disordered eating because they have a track record of bad long term outcomes, but I am interested in the potato diet as a blunt tool for taking action on this hypothesis, which looks pretty compelling to me. And if it doesn&#39;t work out, that&#39;s fine, too!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This looks very cool, kudos on the launch!I feel like vim tutorials mostly focus on navigating and editing a single file, which is great! But I mostly struggle with how to replicate opening a whole directory in VSCode, which makes it easy to browse the directory, switch between files, open multiple panels, etc.I&#39;m almost certain vim does all these things out of the box, but tutorials always end at &#34;this is how you edit some text quickly&#34; and never cover &#34;this is how you do software engineering&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"  :set nu
  / whatever you want to find [return]
  i
  *edit stuff and use arrow keys for nav*
  :wq
  Or :q to quit without saving


That’s all the vim most people need.The fact that less is installed on many more systems than nano is a testament to the bad assumptions too many devs make about who will be using these systems in the future. And yes, it’s not hard to &#34;apt -y install nano&#34; except at work where we have proxies and internal repos, so now I need to use vim to reconfigure apt sources just so I can use a more normal editor that doesn’t require arcane incantations to perform basic config file editing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really want to like vim and I love some things about it, like the ability to move chunks about with only the keyboard. But so many things about it kill me. Like, why can&#39;t I hit right at the end of a line, and move to the next line? Who thinks that is a good idea? Also, why do I have to have a special mode to insert things? Having to change modes just seems so complex and unintuitive. And why does the help system never tell me what I want?The frustration is that probably there are fixes for all these things, which if I were an expert I would know. But meanwhile I can use an ordinary visual text editor and I don&#39;t have to learn anything new."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"TikTok is the most successful espionage operation of the 21st century so far, and it is based on a simple idea - people will happily give away their data and privacy if you consistently entertain them.In my opinion the application should be shut down as soon as possible, but there are many lessons to learn from it. And most of them have little to do with technology."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the privacy issues that will defeat TikTok, I think it&#39;s the deception of a success economy being possible on the platform.In the past few weeks I&#39;ve been observing a lot of marginal content trending on the platform which indicates to me that a lot of the more quality posters aren&#39;t posting new content.The minute quality creators leave a platform is the minute it dies. TikTok has not really been rewarding creators fairly, and pushes the idea that organic growth is possible, and that people have become really successful, but many creators realize after months of working for little to no reward that it&#39;s a false narrative.There are billions of accounts on these platforms yes, but the main question is are they actively posting, engaged, and satisfied? The answer is most likely no, and that&#39;s why Twitter didn&#39;t sell fast too.I wrote about this issue just earlier today -https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32046338"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Heya, I&#39;m the author of the article. I&#39;ve been working on Kandria full time for close to two years now, and on-and-off for some years while I was doing my Master&#39;s at ETH. The engine it&#39;s running on, Trial, is a few years older still, and initially just started out of the good ole university boredom and curiosity. Games is how I got into programming when I was about 6, and that particular fever hasn&#39;t left me yet it seems, ha ha!Kandria itself started as a &#34;more serious&#34; attempt at a game after I&#39;d been making jam games with Trial for some years. I wanted to create something bigger, and had just finished playing through Celeste, so I just set out to replicate its mechanics in my own way. You can still find some demos of those very early days on my YouTube channel, if you&#39;re curious. In any case, the project went through several big changes until it turned into what it is now. During the pandemic in 2020 I finally decided to drop out of my Master&#39;s to pursue the project full time. At that point I also brought on a couple more people to help with the writing, art, and sound.We&#39;re currently also running a Kickstarter to get us some extra funds for the project. It ends on Thursday 14th, 12:00 CEST, so there&#39;s not that much time left in it. If you&#39;d like to support our work, please have a look: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shinmera/kandria
The campaign page has a lot more details on the project and the team, if you&#39;re curious about that.In the article I primarily cover the programming parts, giving a surface overview of the technologies involved and at least giving a brief hint at the methodology I employ to create games. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve left out a lot of details that you might be curious about, so if you have any questions, please feel free to ask and I&#39;ll try my best to answer!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a nice write up.The dark side is that they&#39;ve put years into developing the core infrastructure to empower their Lisp game journey. Ideally that&#39;s all usable by others to &#34;stand on the shoulders&#34;, so to speak, but that&#39;s always a challenge.I honestly have never had to work on a &#34;running image&#34; of any consequence. I&#39;ve never worked on anything more than a few thousand lines of code. I&#39;ve never needed any kind of source level &#34;step&#34; debugging. The ability to redefine a function quickly, I just throw in some prints to figure something out.Reloading the entire source file was always fast enough to now warrant hunting down any of the more interactive mechanisms available. This is all across using simple vi, or emacs, or even LispWorks.  (defun l () (load &#34;src.lisp&#34;))

Just save the file, and type that.All that said, my current low level fantasy is something akin to Electron, only with Common Lisp. First class DOM, first class event hooks, into a CL runtime that you can deploy cross platform. Dunno if that exists or not.I&#39;m sure at some point my codebase will grow to the point where I would need to &#34;level up&#34; and become more intimate with SLIME, packages, system definitions, etc.I&#39;ve just not crossed that threshold yet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;&gt; One thing I do have to mention though is that the workflow in Lisp allows me to create these support libraries much faster than I can in other languages.I&#39;m at that stage in my lisp journey (~18 months) where i know enough to be dangerous to others around me, i.e. i&#39;m still a lisp n00b but have completed a few lisp &amp; scheme books and written enough projects that i feel fairly productive. BUT i haven&#39;t reached, never mind come out the other side of, the &#34;trough of disillusionment&#34; yet. So everything lisp is unreasonably tainted with a positive glow in my mind.TL;DR i still think lisp is pretty awesome. It&#39;s my newest hammer and everything looks like a lisp-shaped nail these days. So i have to be deliberate and careful not to over-use lisp but it&#39;s totally changed how i write js for example. It&#39;s infected my brain.Here&#39;s the thing - that workflow statement by the OP is a fair chunk of the attraction to lisp for me. Before lisp i &#34;knew&#34; what a REPL was - i&#39;ve been using python since i switched wholesale from Perl in the 00&#39;s, i thought you couldn&#39;t teach me anything new about REPLs, even quasi-REPLs like Jupyter were entirely familiar and &#34;basic&#34; to me. If you&#39;re a lisper, you know i was wrong about that, if you&#39;re not a lisper you&#39;re probably wondering what&#39;s the big deal.The other chunk - and i&#39;m only really scratching the surface so far - has been macros. I think so far i prefer the non-hygenic type, but i haven&#39;t gone through Let over Lambda yet (although the book is on my bookshelf and is only 2 titles away from being started)For me, lisp opened my eyes to a way of working that i just wish i could fully replicate in other languages. Lisp has made me re-appreciate python and js in different ways now.If you want a really short version - Brett Victor&#39;s famous inventing on principle talk sums it up for me (he was using JS there, so there is hope...)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I tried to pick up Rust a few years ago, but there were too many sharp edges. I thought it was a nice language, but was too early for actual use. I played with some libraries (Apache Arrow, etc) and it was nice.About 2 months ago I wanted to use Arrow within Elixir, which required me to start using Rust again (Elixir uses Rustler to safely convert from Rust &lt;&gt; Elixir without theoretically crashing the beam). I am amazed how far it&#39;s come, and I&#39;ve actually been using it a lot over the last few months and haven&#39;t ran into any major issues. There is a fair amount of information out there, and the documentation as the OP pointed out is really fantastic.The libraries are really good now, and I&#39;ve had no issues using it on Linux or on my Macbook M1. Incredibly impressive speed results. SIMD is a game changer.Major shoutouts to arrow2 and Polars, I love using it for data analysis :)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love rust.  I didn’t find it difficult to learn and at this point several others I’ve introduced it to also haven’t.  I’m baffled as to where that reputation comes from.I get that it makes you think about what you’re building a little more than something you can throw together like Python or Ruby but if the end goal is software that works correctly, getting there definitely isn’t harder with rust.  It’s the complete opposite :/."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have been thinking to myself whether I should pick up Go or Rust as a new language this year.Coming from a NodeJS background, Rust looks a tad more complicated but it looks cooler. There are also more job listings looking for Golang than Rust which makes me wonder if Golang might be a more rewarding investment?What would be a good use case of Rust than Golang cannot do given its extra complexity and potentially lesser monetary reward? Any advice on which I should pick as a new language to learn?"</p>

I&#39;ve worked on OSS for ten years - opportunities have come out of it. Most of the time I was doing both I felt like I was doing something inconsequential that only meant something to me.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I got my first paid work writing software because I got lucky on GitHub.Back in college, I simply commented on a peer&#39;s issue made for a local hackathon. He was confused about what direction to take for a webapp, and didn&#39;t have any experience in any frameworks. I just suggested Rails, and gave a few highlights for it and pointed him towards some starter guides.Within a couple hours a well connected student (I believe he ran the CS club) saw my comment, and forwarded it to an alumni who was doing local Rails work.I actually didn&#39;t have any experience in Rails beyond the tutorials of the day, and I made that clear. But he liked the look of my GitHub and was happy to give me the job.It was pretty good money for a college student. I recall not really knowing what to expect hourly wise, and when he brought up payment I wasn&#39;t able to give an answer so he immediately said 50/hr. To me, I was truly expecting like half of that. I tried to keep cool as I accepted.  My pricing mindset was definitely anchored by waiting tables, where 50/hr is something you might get if you got a really lucky shift and required busting ass. So to get that much for _sitting down_? Oh boy.After settling on the price, he stepped out of the room for a bit. This was a shared co-working space, and I recall looking over to the guy next to us (who I could tell was paying some attention to our conversation) and saying I did not expect that much money. He happened to work for Uber - and he agreed that I got a very good deal. Not sure why I remember that detail.Anyway: yes, working in public, and even being helpful in public, certainly can pay dividends."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The drastic move to organic farming is puzzling.Any level headed person, forget a politician, would want to experiment first, see the results, gauge and then expand selectively. That is common sense.I guess when you are a dictator ish government and you rule the country with an iron first, the institutions of the state stop being anything and simply become rubber stamps.This also underlines the importance of self sufficiency in necessities. A country ought to feed its people, provide basic services like power and medical facilities on its own, without depending on imports."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; But the most boneheaded, bizarre mistake that the Sri Lankan government made was a disastrous plan to shift the entire country to organic agriculture. In April of 2021 the government banned the import and use of pesticides and synthetic fertilizers. This devastated Sri Lankan agriculture, since, as it turns out, fertilizer is really really important. Production of tea — Sri Lanka’s main cash crop — fell by 18% in a year. Production of rice — the main food crop — fell by even more.From https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/03/05/sri-lanka-organic-farmi... :&gt; By 2020, the total cost of fertilizer imports and subsidies was close to $500 million each year. With fertilizer prices rising, the tab was likely to increase further in 2021. Banning synthetic fertilizers seemingly allowed Rajapaksa to kill two birds with one stone: improving the nation’s foreign exchange situation while also cutting a massive expenditure on subsidies from the pandemic-hit public budget.&gt; But when it comes to agricultural practices and yields, there is no free lunch. Agricultural inputs—chemicals, nutrients, land, labor, and irrigation—bear a critical relationship to agricultural output. From the moment the plan was announced, agronomists in Sri Lanka and around the world warned that agricultural yields would fall substantially. The government claimed it would increase the production of manure and other organic fertilizers in place of imported synthetic fertilizers. But there was no conceivable way the nation could produce enough fertilizer domestically to make up for the shortfall.You don&#39;t get anything &#34;for free&#34;, and cutting supports like this will inevitably doom a sputtering economy, when the actual solution was almost certainly more government spending, not less.The US is actually lucky to understand this at the deepest levels of policy and law making, with massive aid packages to prevent total collapse. Even Europe tried harsh austerity in the wake of 2008, and the fad lasted way too long there.The Sri Lankan leader&#39;s hostile attitude towards the Sri Lankan population is what made protesters storm the leader&#39;s home."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The first part of the article about how Sri Lanka would get foreign currency 
(swap, export or borrow) almost completely ignores the well documented devastation of the tourist industry, where people bring euros or dollars, due to covid19 and shutdowns of travel.Yes I suppose it falls into the category of swap, because people bring euros and exchange them for local currency to buy local goods and services. But it was a big part of the &#34;swap&#34; that vanished for 2+ years."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like the idea of searching a curated list of domains, but I&#39;m not sure that doing the curation yourself is the best approach considering the huge number of useful but niche websites in existence.I wonder if simply parsing all of Wikipedia (dumps are available, and so are parsers capable of handling them) and building a list of all domains used in external links would do the trick. Wikipedia already has substantial quality control mechanisms, and the resulting list should be essentially free of blog spam and other low-quality content. Wikipedia also maintains &#34;official website&#34; links for many topics, which can be obtained by parsing the infobox from the article."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Somewhere I read a quote from some cranky business analyst complaining about how the low prices, quality products and high wages impact profits. &#34;It&#39;s better to be a Costco customer or Costco employee than it is to be a Costco shareholder.&#34;To which I responded &#34;That sounds like a well run company!&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In 2005 my wife and I lived in a part of the USA that had no Costco within a half day&#39;s drive.  We soon secured jobs in a part of the USA that had two (two!) Costcos in the same city that we would live.  True story - before we even looked for housing, I went online and joined Costco.  Years later my diabetic cat even had a Costco pharmacy account (best place to buy insulin by far) and received a discount for being without health insurance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Related to the story&#39;s underlying topic, as an immigrant I find significant attitudinal/philosophical differences in how I regard saving money and spending money versus, for example, my American coworkers and friends, especially younger ones who grew up around relatively well-off families.  Maybe the affection for Costco embodies that.   I&#39;m sure I sound like an old fart for saying this, like &#34;those younguns don&#39;t know the value of a dollar any more&#34;.By comparison at least, they are much freer with their money and don&#39;t have the same baggage about it.   An example especially apparent for me is their willingness to spend on clothing, where I just can&#39;t bring myself to do it.  Maybe just not having been brought up around parents who were ever dressed that nice, or allowed me and siblings to be.   Or for example, their lack of concern about overpaying for small things, which yes in the bigger picture, who cares if you&#39;re overcharged for a drink once in a while?I suppose it&#39;s because the information or concern about not having money was already passed down or imposed on me as a lesson early in life (whether intentionally or not).  Sometimes I view it as an advantage as I see that my friends (those spending freely) will encounter those lessons when they get married, have kids, etc. and need to save.   On the other hand, I wonder if I&#39;m just handicapping myself with that baggage and not allowing myself to enjoy the freedom that a good income now brings, and living too  much in the restraints of my family&#39;s past..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One thing that is missing from this simulation is that (at least some) ant species walk straight back to their nest once they found some food. They do this (as far as we know) by accumulating each step they take into what is called the &#34;home vector&#34;, effectively integrating the whole path they took. That way they always know which way is &#34;back to the nest&#34;. There is a vast amount of papers on the topic. Some (personal) highlights:If you put the ants on stilts they will follow the same home vector, but because each step on stilts is effectively longer they will overshoot the target: https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Fig4-Odometry-by-stride-...If the ant is placed close to the nest after gathering food, it will still follow its home vector ... away from the nest: https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rspb.2004...Crazy little buggers these ants."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very nice! There&#39;s a long history of this kind of simulation, going back to Alan Turing (or before). I used to work doing this kind of thing in the 90s, as part of the Artificial Life community. There&#39;s a lot of papers from back then if you&#39;re looking for other ideas for agent based simulations or complex systems. For that matter the ALife community itself still exists."</p>

I had to sleep with my hands slightly raised, so they wouldn’t touch either the mattress or the covers (or my own skin). 
Nowadays, I always have nitrile gloves for any kind of hot chili recipes ;)I think it was great, I guess I’ll make it again this year."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think I can count the number of kernel changes I&#39;ve submitted on one hand, but I work on core virtualization that involves a lot of pretending to be hardware and (these days) a lot of poking directly at hardware registers.I would say James Mickens sums things up nicely in &#34;The Night Watch[0].&#34; For example, you mention debugging with logs and metrics -- this snippet came to mind:     “Yeah, that sounds bad. Have you checked the log files for
     errors?” I said, “Indeed, I would do that if I hadn’t broken every
     component that a logging system needs to log data. I have a
     network file system, and I have broken the network, and I have
     broken the file system, and my machines crash when I make
     eye contact with them. I HAVE NO TOOLS BECAUSE I’VE
     DESTROYED MY TOOLS WITH MY TOOLS. My only logging
     option is to hire monks to transcribe the subjective experience
     of watching my machines die as I weep tears of blood.”

Mind you, I absolutely _love_ working on low-level stuff, and I wouldn&#39;t trade the time I get to spend actually doing that for anything. That said, the complexity of modern operating systems, CPU architectures, interconnects, and peripherals creates opportunities for frustration and confusion that honor no bounds of reasonability or decency.[0]: https://www.usenix.org/system/files/1311_05-08_mickens.pdf"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked in the kernel team many moons ago helping improve the performance and then built the .net clr later. Also worked on a NT Filesystem called Cairo. So I guess I have experienced both kernel dev and backend framework dev.Kernel code is amazing, especially the parts written by the early members like DaveC, MarkZ and others.For me the biggest part was working with a group of extremely smart people who were very nearly the best programmers in the world.I really miss that outside of Microsoft. I would imagine that you can get the same experience if you worked with the Linux kernel dev team or some of the other few places in the world like FAMGA where you can work.My suggestion is to go for it. 
After leaving MS I found peace by working with the open source community and open source software.Hope that helps, happy to discuss further."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Bad stuff:1. There will be a lot of infrastructure complexity in the kernel, just prepare yourself for that. Even worse bugs! You&#39;ll be fixing a lot of bugs, or looking at a lot of bugs, and most of these bugs are from other teams who are interacting with your component! Just order a copy of Windows Internals and get yourself familiar with how thing work.2. Old ass engineering systems. Just as the interviewers said you will spend a lot of your time waiting for Windows builds.Good stuff:1. Work life balance is amazing actually. Most of the time there&#39;s very little pressure for you to get work done, as long as you&#39;re doing something no one really bothers you.2. Since you said you hate designing systems, good news, everything has been designed for you! Your, job will mostly be implementing new features for a component.3. Windbg is actually great and I will die on this hill. You might have to print some debug logs but you won&#39;t be looking at metrics because there&#39;s whole teams dedicated to doing that stuff. There&#39;s also tools which quickly spin up VMs for you to do some live kernel debugging.Meh stuff:1. The pay, could be better. That might change soon though."</p>

It’s a very small portion of the gaming industry that works that way, and some of these people are my favourite people in the world to fight with – they’re the most beautiful and pure, brilliant people. They’re also some of the biggest fucking idiots.Their CEO is certainly not calling everyone an idiot, just that there are some in that group of people. And personally, I greatly prefer this sort of frank talk to run-of-the-mill generic PR speak that usually comes from CEO interviews.The next thing he says in the interview:&gt; I’ve been in the gaming industry longer than most anybody – getting to the grey hair and all that. It used to be the case that developers would throw their game over the wall to the publicist and sales force with literally no interaction beforehand. That model is baked into the philosophy of a lot of artforms and medium, and it’s one I am deeply respectful of; I know their dedication and care."</p>

A compulsion loop may be distinguished further from a core loop; while many games have a core loop of activities that a player may repeat over and over again, such as combat within a role-playing game, a compulsion loop is particularly designed to guide the player into anticipation for the potential reward from specific activitiesFor some reason, all I can think of is that game from ST:TNG [2].
