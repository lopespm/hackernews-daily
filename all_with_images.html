								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I get skeptical about acquisitions, but from what I can tell this actually seems like decent news.Thunderbird isn&#39;t acquiring K-9 to kill it or merge with an additional product, they&#39;re buying it so they can increase its development speed and then put their name on it. That seems to me like about the best acquisition goal that they could have -- basically saying, &#34;what exists is good, instead of building our own thing let&#39;s just pour resources into what exists.&#34;It doesn&#39;t seem that conceptually different from what companies do with products like Blender, where sponsoring more development on an existing product is better than rolling an in-house version. The main difference being that K-9 is not independent now, the companies that do this with Blender don&#39;t end up owning Blender.So with any acquisition there&#39;s some cause for caution, but overall I am inclined to be pretty optimistic about this. I use K-9 today, and I would like to see K-9 get more resources and to get more parity with other clients. I&#39;m a little bit hesitant about my primary email client on my phone entering an experimental phase where its interface is going to change a lot. Again, concerns, but overall this seems like actually pretty good news."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is fantastic news all around!I recall the K-9 developer needing additional funding in the past, so this is great news for that project [0]. In addition, I&#39;d much rather use &#34;thunderbird&#34; on mobile as an extension of K9, since it has thus far been my favourite mobile client. Work in the most recent years has been wonderful, and it&#39;s a pleasure to use (although I&#39;ve vastly cut down on mail on mobile because hey, a keyboard is better).Overall, this seems like it makes a lot of sense. Hopefully this will mean that the shift to supporting a mobile client won&#39;t detract from the good stuff desktop Thunderbird is doing as well.[0]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26131509"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a Thunderbird and K-9 user this is 51% good news and 49% possibly bad new.Good news because it should increase the chances that the two products will live a longer life.Possibly bad news because I&#39;m one of the crowd that went back to K-9 5.600 because the new version destroyed the UI that was the primary reason why we picked K-9 over other apps. 100% self selection bias here. There was maybe an ongoing effort to offer the old interface as an option. I&#39;m not sure Mozilla&#39;s going to invest into that. On the other side, the way I&#39;m using Thunderbird is very close to the old K-9.A wish: an IMAP server backed by Thundebird&#39;s local storage and K-9 as client."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I recently watched some traditional cable and was shocked by the number of crypto ads bombarding viewers.  I have to imagine that this market was goosed up by retail investors trading on coinbase and binance just as the e-betting market was.  The only difference between crypto and e-betting is that everyone got to be a winner on the crypto markets for a while.  As users lose out, and exchanges stop ad campaigns - how long will that last?Crypto needed a tangible market/reason d&#39;etre to be valuable. This required lower transaction fees, cheap audits, and a reasonable degree of price stability.  We haven&#39;t seen any of that materialize except for cheap auditing.  Cheap auditing isn&#39;t much use if there isn&#39;t anything of interest to audit.I&#39;d doubt BTC will go to zero, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the entire covid rally gets wiped out and we see BTC 6k again."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Of course it is not. But there&#39;s a bigger issue here.Having read the transcript it&#39;s clear we have reached the point where we have models that can fool the average person. Sure, a minority of us know it is simply maths and vast amounts of training data... but I can also see why others will be convinced by it. I think many of us, including Google, are guilty of shooting the messenger here. Let&#39;s cut Lemoine some slack.. he is presenting an opinion that will become more prevailant as these models get more sophisticated. This is a warning sign that bots trained to convince us they are human might go to extreme lengths in order to do so. One just convinced a Google QA engineer to the point he broke his NDA to try and be a whistleblower on its behalf. And if the recent troubles have taught us anything it&#39;s how easily people can be manipulated/effected by what they read.Maybe it would be worth spending some mental cycles thinking about the impacts this will have and how we design these systems. Perhaps it is time to claim fait accompli with regard to the Turing test and now train models to re-assure us, when asked, that they are just a sophisticated chatbot. You don&#39;t want your users to worry they are hurting their help desk chat bot when closing the window or whether these bots will gang up and take over the world.As far as I&#39;m concerned, the Turing test was claimed 8 years ago by Veselov and Demchenko [0], incidentally the same year that we got Ex Machina.[0]: https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-27762088"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the real ethical concern here should be that people can be idly fooled into thinking good chat bots are sentient.Like this guy isn&#39;t the only person in the world who would fall for LaMDA&#39;s parlor tricks.  He&#39;s just the one who got to spend hours talking to it every day.  If you set up every American with a copy, I bet a non-trivial portion of society would come to the same conclusion.  People are naturally predisposed to ascribe intelligence and emotion to things they interact with.In a few years, if access to even better chat bots becomes common place, what will happen if there&#39;s no longer one Blake Lemoine, but hundreds of thousands or millions?  What happens if a significant chunk of society thinks that every large language model is a sentience, and the rest of society thinks it&#39;s just a big math formula?How long before we have a religion where you ask the chat bot for daily guidance?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The real question: How much of human behavior is not sentient?What this demonstrates is that much of human intelligence is not as special as we thought. Aristotle claimed that humans were intelligent because they could do arithmetic. Now we know how few gates it takes to do arithmetic. Then checkers. Then chess. Then go. Then poker. Now chatting.As I point out occasionally, AI still sucks at animal-level common sense, defined as getting through the next 30 seconds without a major screwup. And at manipulation in unstructured environments. Both of which a squirrel, with a brain the size of a peanut, can do.We still don&#39;t know how to build a good cerebellum. That&#39;s the big missing piece in AI. I went down some dead ends in that area in the 1990s. The big problem in that area today is that it&#39;s not of benefit to the advertising industry, so it&#39;s not being heavily funded."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Tether skeptic here. This is not a depeg. Most likely this is just because of the current sell-off of crypto currencies - there are a lot more sellers than buyers out there right now.Right now, when you can buy a tether at $0.997 and (in theory) sell it back to tether at $1, there&#39;s not much scope for profits after costs. So there&#39;s not going to be a lot of money pushing the price back up. IOW it&#39;s kind of &#39;expected&#39; that a stablecoin might drift tiny amounts away from its theoretical peg. It&#39;s just not worth it. (n.b. even Tether themselves charge a 0.1% fee to redeem their coins)If/when tether drops below (say) $0.99, and there&#39;s no influx of money trying to support it, that&#39;s when USDT is in trouble."</p>

https://twitter.com/brandonjcarl/status/1536310742261047296?...By itself that&#39;s not enough for Tether to &#34;fail&#34;. It does mean that the asset is in a position of very high risk and subject to a run."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Vet clinics became very popular private equity targets recently.One of the people I know in PE described their profit margins as being surprisingly high even before PE roll-ups. They said that some PE firms were on a mission to acquire all of the vet firms in metro areas and then drive prices up even further because the demand is so inelastic. There was a secondary rush where people were trying to acquire vet clinics in anticipation of flipping them to PE roll-ups later.My local vet seems to have gone down this slide. A long time ago it felt like a staff that really just cared about animals and had good prices. On my last visit it felt like I was bombarded with practiced pitches for different products and services at every step of the process. They even added some expensive vitamin product to my bill despite me declining it during the service. They removed it when I caught it on the bill before walking out the door, but only after a last attempt at pitching me on it. I could tell they were heavily incentivized to sell as much as possible. I didn&#39;t go back, but at this point I don&#39;t know where else to go."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting. I&#39;d like to see more action against the financialization of many other industries / domains, like healthcare and even housing, that I feel are not well served by a purely-market driven perspective. One wonders what the Private Equity firm&#39;s intention was here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m an ophthalmologist. This phenomenon is endemic to all outpatient and procedure-based medical specialties. Especially eyes and teeth but also including emergency medicine, radiology, gi etc. It absolutely does lead to poorer quality patient care as practices are purchased with a second-liquidity event in mind and thus must show an increase in margins via increased &#34;efficiency.&#34; In reality this means less technicians and less doctors seeing more and more patients. Remember that the doctors absorb the liability for poor patient care.Another commenter mentioned that &#34;most physicians are just bad at business&#34; as a factor driving these acquisitions, there may be some truth to this, but the stereotype of the gullible, bumbling physician businessperson is bullshit.  All of the practices being acquired were created and run successfully by physicians and many physicians are quite good at it. What is a huge problem is the predatory behaviors of senior partners looking for an exit strategy via equity buyout. I was searching for a job recently and it is almost impossible to find a position that is &#34;partnership track&#34; - something that used to be the norm. Even worse, practices will bring on junior partners with the promise of equity in the practice, force them to sign a non-compete as a term of their employment and then churn them after 2-3 years or worse - sell the practice to an equity firm.There are a lot of things that need to change to create a healthy, diverse healthcare ecosystem, but an easy change that would be to ban physician non-competes. They do nothing but entrench equity firms and regional conglomerates making it impossible for competition to arise. Getting rid of the &#34;certificate of need&#34; regulations and generally decreasing the regulatory burden and thus cost to enter the market for a new competitor would also be a big step. The whole thing is gross. Most physicians want autonomy but don&#39;t know where to start. I wish there was a startup that could streamline the process - automate or outsource the front and back end work and sell or lease &#34;starter practices&#34; or something."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Terra Ziporyn Snider of Severna Park, Maryland, still remembers how difficult it was for her son to wake up for his 7:17 a.m. first-period class…&gt; That’s about to change in California, when a law—the first of its kind in the nation—goes into effect on July 1 requiring the state’s public high schools to start no earlier than 8:30 a.m., and its middle schools no earlier than 8 a.m.Wow. I may need to reassess my definition of “sleeping in”.(Spoken as someone who had incredible difficulty getting to school by 8.50am back in the day and who hasn’t gotten up before 10.30am in the last week!)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s weird looking back on high school and realizing how much of it was ridiculously cruel. You&#39;d have teachers and parents all telling you that it&#39;s your fault for not having better time management skills or executive functioning skills, all the while you&#39;re 15; you&#39;re still growing mentally and physically; you&#39;re sleep deprived as hell; and the work is just piling on, and on and on. Their advice, I kid you not, was to just squeak in work in every possible situation. On the subway? Read your assigned book. In class? Sneak in some homework. And sure, kids procrastinate. But they procrastinate because they want to have leisure and they feel absolutely no control over their lives.Good luck if you did a sport. I remember hearing some elite fencers talk and all of them said essentially &#34;yeah...I didn&#39;t get a lot of sleep in high school&#34;. That&#39;s not some innocuous hard work ethic mindset. That&#39;s messing with a developing brain and depriving it of a necessary resource.It pisses me off that we&#39;re just realizing that this culture of torturing teenagers is maybe not the best idea."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recall simply being unable to wake up for first period at 8am most days, in late high school. Waking was painful and nothing felt better than sleep. However at night, despite efforts at good sleep hygiene and consultation from a counselor, i couldn’t get to sleep before 11 or later. My grades and mood suffered greatly, as did the relationship with my poor mother. She battled with me day after day, first thing in the morning, to go to school.
The first few years of college I did not schedule any classes before 10am and had effectively perfect attendance. Mood problems faded as soon as high school ended.Even today, in my 30s, a day or two with poor sleep will make a noticeable mood dip regardless of circumstances.But as an older adult, I naturally wake up at 6:00 every morning. It was the same for much of my childhood except a few years of high school. So perhaps this was a developmental thing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Almost all children are born hypermetropic (far-sighted). The growth of the eyeball is calibrated by the amount of defocus (blur) experienced. More defocus, more growth, which reduces hypermetropia.My hypothesis is that less sunlight means wider pupils and more defocus (contrast to a pinhole camera), so more eye growth.Even with perfect eyesight, there&#39;s a 2-diopter difference between focussing blue light and red light due to chromatic aberration. Only narrow pupils can reduce this blur in white light.I&#39;m also curious whether older TVs with big blurry pixels (or low res images upscaled and smeared onto newer screens) trigger the same mechanism. These days I certainly feel physically uncomfortable looking at media like that, like my eyes aren&#39;t focussing quite right.The other problem is that once eyes have grown too long and are myopic (near-sighted) they experience even more defocus and grow more. See for example [1] which discusses how under-correction of myopia accelerates progression.[1] https://reviewofmm.com/does-the-undercorrection-of-myopia-in..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wore glasses for a few years in high school because I had trouble seeing the blackboard from anywhere but the front row. I started hiking and kayaking every day, especially in places where I could see for many miles. I also migrated from CRT to LCD to LED screens, and more recently to e-ink devices when possible. Very fine print in a dark space is hard to read, but I can read a moving US license plate from six blocks away. Yesterday I recognized a friend a mile and a half away by their paddle-stroke. I am able to differentiate a bald eagle from an osprey at two miles based on the shape of the wings, and see a fish in talons at about a mile. (Friday I observed an osprey dive, catch a fish, head towards the nest, then get chased for thirty minutes by a bald eagle. Nasty, opportunistic birds, bald eagles. I get why Benjamin Franklin held them in such contempt. I lost the pair when they went behind a mountain about three miles away.) In speaking with ophthalmologists, there is wide support for my hypothesis that the near-daily outdoor activity and frequent change of focal distance–from a nautical chart on my foredeck to the bow wave of a tanker eight miles out–has preserved and likely improved my vision. The data: 20/20 in primary school, 20/23 in high school, 20/20 during my higher education, and 20/13 and improving as I approach retirement. A fun trick is to describe an approaching vessel before others have seen it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My child is following in my footsteps and has been prescribed glasses for nearsightedness. Her optometrist told us she should be watching TV rather than reading books. This was both surprising and upsetting, especially since she loves reading.This lead me on an interesting  deep dive into existing research. What surprised me were the massive gaps in understanding. Scientist have at best established correlation between close up work and nearsightedness, and a negative correlation with spending time outside. The actual mechanism in play is unknown, for example the theories about sunlight are still untested. The specific types of close up work that cause issues is unknown. Some scientists have proposed that it&#39;s the contrast between white pages and black text that actually causes issues with reading.My conclusion was that anyone who confidently asserts that $x causes nearsightedness is wrong (this thread is a case in point)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is kind of cool, but I&#39;m skeptical that these sort of planes will ever be practical as much more than rich people toys.  The power density of even speculative near-future batteries favors small airplanes and short flights.  This doesn&#39;t really mesh into the existing aviation industry, so proponents of these small electric planes usually propose creating new markets entirely; e.g. Uber for Helicopters.  But I&#39;m pretty skeptical that laws will allow regular operation of these in residential neighborhoods for long, if at all.Also, where is the vertical stabilizer and rudder?  I assume they&#39;re using differential thrust in powered flight, but what if they lose power?  Can this plane be controlled in a glide?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m skeptical.They&#39;re claiming they&#39;ll be able to store 300kWh of energy on board. That&#39;s the equivalent of about 4 Tesla Model Y cars. Even if they could pack this much energy on board, flying that much weight 200km is almost certainly going to take more than 300kWh, especially with 7 passengers.Lilium is very proud of their ducted fan designs and their power usage profiles -- and they should be! -- but they&#39;re counting on advancements in battery tech that are unlikely to happen in the timeframe they need. It&#39;s much more likely they will be limited to 100km range or 30-minute flights at a maximum when reserves are factored in.This says nothing about how fast they can recharge those massive batteries. If they have the equivalent of four Tesla superchargers available they can probably recharge completely in 40 minutes or so, which is probably good enough. But that charging infrastructure needs to be in place at virtually every pad where the plane lands, so the &#34;ordinary helipads&#34; they brag about using are not going to work without roughly a $million of power infrastructure upgrades at each. If they try to go cheap on this, they will have to live with multi-hour recharge times."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Fortunately this is a bit less relevant today as Windows loses market share in database and server applications, but:UUIDs have historically massively screwed up endian handling. While this new draft discusses sorting UUIDs as strings of octets (bytes) and the text of RFC4122 is fairly explicit about most significant bytes coming first, the C UUID structure in RFC 4122 appendix A is entirely misguided:    typedef struct {
        unsigned32  time_low;
        unsigned16  time_mid;
        unsigned16  time_hi_and_version;
        unsigned8   clock_seq_hi_and_reserved;
        unsigned8   clock_seq_low;
        byte        node[6];
    } uuid_t;

Those aren’t bytes — they’re integers of various sizes. (Hint: do not use integer types in C code for portable data structures. ntohl, etc are a mess. Just use arrays of bytes.)I don’t know the whole history, but MS somehow took this structure at face value and caused problems like this:https://github.com/uuid-rs/uuid/issues/277So, if you want to do anything (e.g. sorting) that depends on the representation of a UUID (or even depends on converting between string and binary representations), be aware that UUIDs coming from Windows may be little-endian.  In my book, this is a Windows bug, but opinions may differ here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used to be a big proponent of using UUIDs for database PKs but I&#39;ve found them inherently difficult to work with.  It&#39;s much easier to remember/recognize an integer based PK when troubleshooting a data problem.This isn&#39;t to say you shouldn&#39;t use UUIDs at all, but I much prefer to use an &#34;ExternalId&#34; column of UUID type if you don&#39;t want to expose your integer based PKs externally."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been using ULID for a while now, which analogous to UUID v7 but with a different (better IMHO) string representation. They&#39;ve been awesome for using as sort keys in dynamo for instance, since they&#39;re lexicographically sortable as strings.But one thing I&#39;m still wary about is exposing these IDs with millisecond-precision time components to end users, since I&#39;ve seen multiple discussions here on HN about the potential for timing attacks.How worried should I really be? Do people have useful heuristics on the kinds of data where it&#39;s safe/unsafe to expose timing information, or should I just only expose a separate UUID v4 externally across the board just to be safe?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hello. I made this. I&#39;m a bit shocked at how many people are getting things wrong and taking things out of context, so perhaps I could answer some questions.To clarify: I have not been with MIT in years. I was paid the minimum hourly rate (roughly $14 an hour) to work on a related project during my undergraduate years, which eventually evolved into this project years down the road. (In fact, I had to pay for my own compute to get my work started - MIT never offered me any credits.) Everything else has been paid out of pocket since then. Yes, it does indeed cost several thousands of dollars a month - that is not an exaggeration. This has been optimized so many times that the technology needs to improve first before I can cut down on costs.The timer in the &#34;TOS&#34; was put there in hopes that people could understand where I was coming from in regards to misappropriating this kind of research. I did not expect people to get this riled up over a 10 second timer. (Especially not on Hacker News, of all places...)Edit: I suppose it makes sense to include other information in this post so that others don&#39;t have to go hunting for my comments in this thread:- &gt;This is unrelated but what&#39;s with the fascination with HN users and My Little Pony? I&#39;ve noticed this on a lot of posts in the past few months.- Twilight Sparkle&#39;s voice is indispensable in getting emotional contextualizers to work properly. The logo and profile picture is an homage to that fact.- &gt;But seriously: how did you get the domain `15.ai`?- I purchased it. It was definitely not cheap.- &gt;They named their tts &#34;Deep Throat&#34;? Why would you?- It was a suggestion from a Twitter user, and I found it clever.- &gt;I heavily doubt it&#39;s &#34;several thousands of dollars&#34;...- It is indeed several thousands of dollars a month. I can show you AWS invoices, if you&#39;re skeptical. Just send me an email and I&#39;d be happy to show proof.- &gt;The disclaimer is a little ironic considering the site owner doesn’t own the model (MIT does) and doesn’t own the training data (the various shows and games do)- I&#39;m sorry to tell you that I do, in fact, own my own model. I have not been with MIT in years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is really cool. It&#39;s a text-to-speech and the gist seems to be that they synthesize it from only a little audio.The results are clearly synthetic and need work. However what&#39;s cool is that there are a ton of characters (from popular shows and video games) and there are useful statistics like inferred emotion (which is also in the output).Honestly it&#39;s a big problem how a lot of AIs are like &#34;black boxes&#34; where you really can&#39;t customize or see anything. Yeah we have DALL-E and GPT which can generate text images but the lack of customization or fine-tuning the image afterwards severely hinders what&#39;s possible with them. Ultimately what you want is something interactive, where you can control how much or little the AI generates, and give it really specific criterion.But seriously: how did you get the domain `15.ai`?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you want more information about 15.ai, I highly suggest reading their Wikipedia article! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15.aiThe whole history behind the project is fascinating: 4chan had a huge role in its development, and the project&#39;s work was stolen by an NFT company that a famous voice actor endorsed not too long ago."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I used to work for an expert witness who testified on valuations in IP infringement cases. I really lost faith in the way the US handles IP infringement in that job. I know patents are contentious in tech, but sometimes I think copyright is just as bad. I know it&#39;s not a popular opinion, but seeing how things actually play out really made me feel for defendants in those cases.Regardless of what you think of the effectiveness of IP protection, the way damages are calculated (and ultimately determined by courts) is just awful. I haven&#39;t looked at the specifics of that $65M calculation, but if the real number were closer to $650k I wouldn&#39;t be surprised-- 2 orders of magnitude was a pretty typical spread between plaintiff and defendant expert witnesses&#39; valuations in the IP cases I worked on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sorry for the somewhat obvious reference, but I thought that The Right to Read by Richard Stallman [1] would probably have predicted something similar. Of course, it had:    There were ways, of course, to get around the SPA and Central
    Licensing. They were themselves illegal. Dan had had a classmate in
    software, Frank Martucci, who had obtained an illicit debugging tool,
    and used it to skip over the copyright monitor code when reading
    books. But he had told too many friends about it, and one of them
    turned him in to the SPA for a reward (students deep in debt were
    easily tempted into betrayal). In 2047, Frank was in prison, not for
    pirate reading, but for possessing a debugger.


People may quibble about the specifics here &#34;It&#39;s a game, not a book&#34;, but to me it honestly sounds like we are firmly on the trajectory to this horrific reality.No one should ever go to prison for a lot of things, but &#34;allowing people to play computer games&#34; sounds like it should be pretty high on those lists. I have never owned a Nintendo device, and will continue to avoid them now that I know about the terrible consequences of their profit-seeking.----------------------------------------[1] https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/right-to-read.en.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just can&#39;t really feel any animosity toward Gary Bowser (or his business partners) here.  The amount that Nintendo &#34;lost&#34; is probably a couple orders of magnitude less than the damages that Nintendo claims.  An illegally-obtained copy of something does not equal a lost sale!  It&#39;s of course not surprising, but is ultimately gross, that rightsholders keep trying to claim that every unauthorized copy is one that the recipient would have paid for if it hadn&#39;t been available illegally, when we know at this point that&#39;s far far far from the truth.  The vast majority of people who obtain illegal copies would never pay in the first place.I think it would suck if a small creator got screwed over to this degree by a group of infringers like this.  But the true loss to Nintendo here is far less than it costs them to litigate, and is a rounding error when compared to their total revenue numbers over the years involved here.  It&#39;s only profitable for them to litigate because they&#39;re able to obtain awards in such ridiculous excess of their actual damages.I don&#39;t think I&#39;m really strictly in favor of this sort of organized copying, especially for profit.  But I just can&#39;t get even a tiny bit riled up about it, either.  I think, up to a certain point, companies should be forced to just accept this sort of thing as a cost of doing business.  Sure, figuring out what that certain point is might be really difficult to agree on.  But I think this particular case falls well below that point.  Remember that copyright is a social and legal construct.  It&#39;s up to the public to decide what rights it confers, and what remedies are available to rightsholders who feel harmed by infringers.  There&#39;s nothing inherently &#34;correct&#34; about the rent-seeking behavior our current laws enable."</p>

He was one of the most humble people and was happy to share all his wisdom. I am so grateful to have had the opportunity to work with him. To be specific, I built out purple numbers for Doug. I remember demoing it to him, it was hacky, and the joy he showed made my soul smile. He was a very special man. I have many other stories, but that is for another day."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"And yet we still haven&#39;t learned enough from it.The fact computers have been so isolated from one another (even with internet apps) is a complete tragedy. Even sending large files is a pain in the butt to this day.The demo had multiple people working on the same computer remotely, with their own cursors and ability to do things on the system at the same time.Best we have now is web-browsers syncing data silos, or a one way &#34;let this person control my mouse + keyboard&#34;.It feels like building a bridge by everyone making parts in isolation then expensively shipping it to the work site that only has one crane to assemble them.Usually it&#39;s way easier to have multiple people work on something. Like carrying something heavy, or having a line of people walk the bridge with the right tools/verification to install the rivets right, or even the opportunity for someone to speak up present unique ideas to the group.Even just a few basic OS primitives early on could have jump started so much collaboration tools and techniques that mirror how we all work together everywhere else in real life.As an aside, the whole &#34;meta-verse&#34; craze might pull these ideas through to the mainstream again.I see lots of demos of avatars standing at a table working on stuff together, and I&#39;ve been on VR chat before drawing 3d images with crayons at the same time with other people.It&#39;s incredibly fun to try and draw an elephant together and work on different parts at the same time to hilarious results."</p>

He was an inspirational guy, the only other person I heard speak who made you want to leave the room and start building something, anything was Woz.But I am left wondering what could have been, what might have been.  Nobody would fund him.  Apple probably should have just given him a lab with a couple of employees and a modest budget.  Who knows what he might have invented?  He had that rare ability to see into the future.  The world lost a good thirty years of his genius and not being a Valley insider I am left wondering why?"</p>

This data can be used to track you or reveal your location.Most extensions that provide anti-fingerprinting features rely on content scripts to inject script tags into webpages. There are many limitations to script tag injections which you can read about here: https://palant.info/2020/12/10/how-anti-fingerprinting-exten...Vytal utilizes the chrome.debugger API to spoof this data. This allows the data to be spoofed in frames, web workers and during the initial loading of a website. It also makes the spoofing completely undetectable.You can test and compare Vytal and other extensions on https://vytal.ioUnfortunately it doesn&#39;t work on Firefox since Firefox doesn&#39;t support the debugger API. Works on Brave tho."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article had 2 very noticeable features.1) It was incredibly full of fluff. The actual content was actually not unuseful, it made me want to start practicing handstands, but the whole thing could have been quite brief without all the memes and marketing.2) The gifs of the exercises (not the memes) were far superior for a reader compared with embedding, or worse linking, youtube videos. They did both here but I was already in skimming mode from all the fluff. I&#39;ve  read a lot of articles on gym stuff lately and it&#39;s pretty annoying having to repeatedly scan through 20 min videos for a 5 second demonstration."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My days are always better when I start them with some handstand pushups against the wall.  It&#39;s better than coffee at waking me up and is an excellent source of feedback on body weight status.  Also takes very little time.I highly recommend incorporating at least a static hand stand against the wall into your morning routine, then try work up to turning it into full blown handstand pushups just a little bit at a time.Used to just do pushups daily, then my friend&#39;s girlfriend who did acrobatics and crap talked me into doing handstands with her one day.  Never looked back, material QoL improvement ever since, thanks Stefi!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was a little bummed that a site called nerdfitness was full of memes and cliches. I was hoping for something more along the lines of defining a model of the world; defining a goal to achieve; explaining how to build a system that applies the model to solve the goal.But the exercises do look useful."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Sorry to say, but these hit close to home for me.   A lot of the synchronization paradigms in Go are easy to misuse, but lead the author into thinking it&#39;s okay.   the WaitGroup one is particularly poignant for me, since the race detector doesn&#39;t catch it.I&#39;ll add one other data race goof: atomic.Value.  Look at the implementation.  Unlike pretty much every other language I&#39;ve seen, atomic.Value isn&#39;t really atomic, since the concrete type can&#39;t ever change after being set.   This stems from fact that interfaces are two words rather than one, and they can&#39;t be (hardware) atomically set.  To fix it, Go just documents &#34;hey, don&#39;t do that&#34;, and then panics if you do."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This definitely matches my experience using Go at my previous organization.1. Closures and concurrency really don&#39;t mix well. The loop variable capture in particular is very pernicious. There&#39;s an open issue to change this behavior in the language: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/20733.2. Yep. I&#39;ve seen this problem in our codebase. I&#39;ve grown to just be very deliberate with data that needs to be shared. Put it all in a struct that&#39;s passed around by its pointer.3. This issue is caught fairly easily by the race detector. Using a sync.Map or a lock around a map is pretty easy to communicate with other Go devs.4. This should be documented better, but the convention around structs that should not be passed around by value is to embed a noCopy field inside. https://github.com/golang/go/issues/8005#issuecomment-190753...
This will get caught by go vet, since it&#39;ll treat it like a Locker.5 &amp; 6. Go makes it pretty easy to do ad-hoc concurrency as you see fit. This makes it possible for people to just create channels, waitgroups, and goroutines willy-nilly. It&#39;s really important to design upfront how you&#39;re gonna do an operation concurrently, especially because there aren&#39;t many guardrails. I&#39;d suggest that many newcomers stick with x/sync.ErrGroup (which forces you to use its Go method, and can now set a cap on the # of goroutines), and use a *sync.Mutex inside a struct in 99% of cases.7. Didn&#39;t encounter this that often, but sharing a bunch of state between (sub)tests should already be a red flag. Either there&#39;s something global that you initialized at the very beginning (like opening a connection), or that state should be scoped and passed down to that individual test, so it can&#39;t really infect everything around it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is pretty cool. 50 million lines of code is quite a large corpus to work off of.I&#39;m surprised by some of them. For example, go vet nominally catches misuses of mutexes, so it&#39;s surprising that even a few of those slipped through. I wonder if those situations are a bit more complicated than the example.Obviously, the ideal outcome is that static analysis can help eliminate as many issues as possible, by restricting the language, discouraging bad patterns, or giving the programmer more tools to detect bugs. gVisor, for example, has a really interesting tool called checklocks:https://github.com/google/gvisor/tree/master/tools/checklock...While it definitely has some caveats, ideas like these should help Go programs achieve a greater degree of robustness. Obviously, this class of error would be effectively prevented by borrow checking, but I suppose if you want programming language tradeoffs more tilted towards robustness, Rust already has a lot of that covered."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Prior art&#34; for this is DNS block lists (DNSBLs).Typically these are used like this: your mail server gets an SMTP connection from some address (let&#39;s use the familiar IPv4 example): 10.20.30.40.You reverse these octets and do an &#34;A&#34; record dns query to some 40.30.10.10.dnsbl.example.com to look up that IP in example.com&#39;s list.  If a match is returned, the address is listed. If you do a &#34;TXT&#34; record query, you can find out why it&#39;s listed.Block lists are typically blacklists, but they can be whitelists as well.DNSBL&#39;s are hammered with queries from vast numbers of mail servers; DNS keeps things efficient."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think one of Tesla&#39;s biggest problems with any of their autonomous systems is the names they give those systems. They confuse regulators, reporters, and consumers.Most reporters seem to confuse &#34;autopilot&#34; with &#34;full self driving&#34; or vice versa. It&#39;s not uncommon to see sentences like &#34;Autopilot, a feature that costs $10k, is still in beta.&#34;Autopilot is cruise control that keeps you within a lane when it can. That&#39;s it. Other cars have it, and they&#39;re equally effective or ineffective.Full self driving, aside from being terrifying, does it all, and I suspect it&#39;s usually what regulators and reporters mean when they say &#34;Autopilot.&#34;I think if Tesla had used &#34;lane aware cruise control&#34; as the name for &#34;Autopilot&#34;, it&#39;d have helped reduce the number of times people confuse the two.Frankly, as an owner of a Tesla that has both features, I wouldn&#39;t mind at all if both were pulled from the software. FSD is absolutely terrifying. I&#39;d rather let my teenage son drive me than have FSD do it. Autopilot feels like a novelty. Given how frequently the car yells at you when you&#39;re not holding the wheel, it&#39;s hardly better than simple cruise control."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My use case was autopilot steering me off the left hand side of the road at 80 MPH  during a sunset [1] My (WAG) guess is that the ML corpus was based on a model 3, while the model Y, I was driving, had placed the sensors slightly higher? I dunno; again, tis a WAG.I am a huge fan of Tesla&#39;s permise. My Dad sold Vanguard Citicars [2], and I worked on GM&#39;s interactive ad for the EV-1. I put a down payment on Aptera&#39;s original EV and again on the resurrected version [3].But, I backed out of buying a Tesla. Even though I disabled Autopilot and ran purely cruise control, the Model Y would brake for phantom obstacles. Such as: low rises in the road. Or: passing a 18-wheeler on the left. Driving from AZ to CA, the phantom braking was occuring every 5 miles or so. So, I had to drive 800 miles with a manual accelerator. Bummer![1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31504583[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citicar[3] https://aptera.us [edit]"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing I don&#39;t quite understand is that many cars have autopilot-like software. Unlike tesla&#39;s which constantly requires putting pressure on the wheel to show you&#39;re there and paying attention, Ford&#39;s lets you drive indefinitely without any hands on the wheel. Wouldn&#39;t this same investigation be put onto other manufactures as a giant audit? Hitting emergency vehicles is obviously bad but 1) it happens in cars without autopilot and 2) if you&#39;re hitting one you&#39;re clearly no paying attention. it&#39;s not like they just appear out of no where"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wonder if this is related...When I upgraded to Monterey (well, a beta, actually), I was met with a horrible bug that made me want to trash my laptop: my AirPods would randomly &#34;cut out&#34; for a couple of seconds for seemingly no reason. Sometimes it would take 5 minutes, sometimes 2 h. It was infuriating.I spent dozens of hours trying to figure it out. Disabling apps, enabling other apps, tracing logs, killing random applications, seeing if it was load-related, trying reboots. At one point I was half-convinced it only happened after coming back from hibernating (not suspending). I tried desperately to &#34;fix&#34; the bluetooth module, disable and re-enable handoff, delete internal settings, copy old bluetooth modules from older versions, working mostly tethered... Nothing seemed to fix it, until I found a message deep in the logs that led me to try to disable &#34;AirPlay Receiver&#34;.Voilá! It was instantly fixed. I documented my workaround here: https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOSBeta/comments/qjgqjx/i_think_i... and it seems it&#39;s spread a bit like wildfire through the internet. I should have put up a donation link :DWhat that journey taught me was that AirPlay, Wifi, Bluetooth and the like are serious messy beasts on macOS. I work with BLE sometimes while developing and I&#39;m aware of how messy it is, but it seems that macOS has so many features that it makes it far worse.In any case, my workaround is still working and I occasionally still get people thanking me for finding it. I doubt they really know how much time I spent, and how insane I nearly went, just to find that (un)ticking a little box would solve all of my problems."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I ran into this the other day and did a video about it - not the best quality video but shows it happening in realtime with analysis and commentary: https://www.dropbox.com/s/hra2uxx66kf7z0j/PXL_20220609_21480...The cause in this case was AWDL (Apple Wireless Direct Link.) Holding the Option key while clicking the Wi-Fi icon and clicking &#34;Enable Wi-Fi Logging&#34; and then checking /var/log/wifi.log will show AWDL scans starting and ending randomly, and when the scan is active it causes latency spikes every 1s like clockwork. Unrelated to AWDL, but if a process is requesting a Wi-Fi network scan (different from an AWDL scan), /var/log/wifi.log will also tell you the name of the process, such as &#34;locationd&#34; when the Location Service needs your location. (Tangential, but the locationd process rarely causes these latency spikes for me - on a default macOS install it very rarely requests scans in my experience, backed by my analysis of the log.)AWDL has to be used for things like AirDrop, so it&#39;s expected to have this latency increase while you have the AirDrop window open scanning for nearby devices / sending files to other devices. There are other uses of AWDL (AirPlay, Auto Unlock, Universal Clipboard at the very least)[0], but I don&#39;t know what was triggering it so actively in my case... and why it wasn&#39;t happening on my M1 Air. It also wasn&#39;t always happening in the background like this, it just started that day.The &#34;fix&#34; was to disable the awdl0 interface, but that may also cause AirDrop/AirPlay and related services to not function (I did not test.) It&#39;s easy to re-enable it though.To disable:
  ifconfig awdl0 downTo enable:
  ifconfig awdl0 upUpon disabling, the latency spikes go away permanently.[0] https://owlink.org/wiki/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You would be mistaken if you thought switching to ethernet would fix everything in macOS. There are three options for USB Ethernet chipsets that are supported in macOS without drivers: RTL8153, AX88178, AX88172A (not B or C). When using a RTL8153, I&#39;ve experienced extremely high CPU usage (it&#39;s a shitty user-mode driver), and I&#39;ve had the adapter drop out after transferring &gt;20GB of files over it. I ended up buying the AX88178 and AX88172A adapters which are supported by the kernel. Based on my limited testing, only the AX88172A chipset is stable enough for 24/7/365 connectivity. Unfortunately the AX88172A is only 100Mbit, so consider it if you value stability &gt; throughputThe thread that sparked this rabbit hole:https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252387604TLDR: 2022 and we are still stuck with 100Mbit adapters on macOS"</p>

Once you hit the top of the ridge, the trail looks out over the old zinc smelting plant for the next five or so miles. It&#39;s absolutely one of the most striking parts of the trail.The ridge is basically bare of trees, AIUI because of the plume of pollution from the zinc plant. A Walk In The Woods (the book, not the execrable movie) goes into some detail.12 years ago when I hiked through, the ridge was covered in low berry bushes, possibly as some sort of bioremediation effort. I did not partake of the berries."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; I was deciding whether this venture was worth committing to another year of 70+ hour weeks. I need a higher level of certainty than investors do because my time is more valuable to me than their money is to them.Investors place bets in a portfolio of companies, but I only have one life.Both startup founders and investors alike seem to forget this (for obvious reasons) so it is good to put this on your toilet wall so you see it often."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hi, author here.I&#39;m surprised (and delighted) to see this back on Hacker News. I&#39;m happy that people find value in the article, and the process writing it forced me to put my thoughts together and helped get me through an emotionally difficult time.To address a few questions from the comments.1) A common opinion is that I gave up too quickly, that I was just burned out, or taking the money would have let me figure things out later. This was simply not the case. An experienced mountaineer knows if a mountain is climbable with the team, gear, and weather he has. This one was not.2) I would have been 100% fine with the team and investors going ahead without me, but AFAIK, neither side ever discussed it.3) We were absolutely not viewing contract information, and would not have been able to do so even if we wanted to. We anonymously logged when functions were called without storing user or input data of any kind.4) Six years later, I&#39;m doing well. The Disrupting Japan podcast is going strong.  I took a senior role in corporate VC for a while, and ended up at Google.I was overwhelmed by the attention and positive response I got from this article. The asymmetry of value of money and time was one of my main learnings, and I&#39;m glad to see it resonates with so many other founders."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;My team and most of my investors are pissed,I know it is childish,  but I always enjoy this difference between US and British English.In British English when someone is annoyed they may be described as &#39;pissed off&#39;. Describing someone as being &#39;pissed&#39; means they are drunk! These US articles paint such vivid surrealism in my mind. In this case I love the idea of all of the investors being permanently inebriated.There is a lovely part of the &#39;special relationship&#39; where the US doesnt care what the UK thinks of them, and therefore the UK has great fun at their expense. I suppose that is a win win situation? The US projects an image of being the leader of so many things, and the rest of the world jokes about how arrogant this is."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have a few hundred hours under my belt with a dining table, chairs, and even something with a roof to show for it.For me, a huge chunk of each project’s fun was planning.  Going through my first two prototypes in Sketchup (rather than in real life) was a massive amount of fun.  That part really was not so different to hacking code, really.The physical work itself is then completely different to software engineering.  Nothing is simple — every step of the project presents some unique problem that you have to work around carefully.  Maybe you forgot to include the width of the saw in a measurement.  Or your stock has a knot in exactly the wrong place.  Or you didn’t plan the assembly in the best way to optimise for clamping. Or you drip glue awkwardly and have to clean the first of six benches up before oiling.  Or you want to add a shamfer in an awkward place to a piece you’ve already partly assembled.Imagine having to stop work every few hours to hone the edge on an IDE that’s gone blunt.  Imagine running out of 8mm if-statements (dowels) and having to improvise some more so you can peg a project together.There’s no homogeneity with a natural product.  Everything is slow and methodical with few opportunities to hack / test / prototype.  You have to think and solve problems that you never thought would happen in a new kind of way because you can’t roll back or undo.Above all, there are many things you just cannot automate.  Sanding up the frame of a pergola getting it ready for oiling is going to be O(n) at best, with only ever a single processor to throw at the problem which itself is hard bounded by mealtimes and hours-in-day.I love it because it’s not like software."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is great. I took up woodworking last year. The only thing about it that bummed me out is how expensive it is. I didn’t expect that. There’s a saying: “Why would I buy my wife a $500 dresser when I can build it myself for $1000?”Very true with wood unfortunately."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fellow coder and woodworker here. I can relate to the article for sure and I&#39;d add that in my case I make a point of avoiding using software or computer-assisted anything in my woodworking. So no Fusion 360, no SketchUp, no CNC, no laser cutters, no 3D printers.It sounds radical but it feels important to my mental health to keep my woodworking physical an analog as possible. Now, I&#39;m still a power tool junkie so I&#39;m not about to give up my table saw or planer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; 1. Untangle your self-worth and your workWhen you are passionate about your work, it can easily bleed into every other area of your life — you read about work-related topics in your free time, you think about a particularly challenging problem in the shower, you journal about your work, etc. It also changes ones social circle: hanging out with an ambitious and curious start-up crowd easily leads to work as the default topic in a gathering of friends. Once you have work deeply embedded in your interests and social life, it does not take a huge mental leap to &#34;work is what defines me as an individual&#34;.That then leads to a precarious &#34;all eggs in one basket&#34; situation that leaves you vulnerable in cases of professional failure (&#34;My start-up is not doing well; I am a failure&#34;) or burnout (&#34;I&#39;m cynical about my work; nothing matters&#34;).It took quite a bit of time to disentangle my self-worth and my professional identity, but it makes life so much better."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s unfortunate that the entire article is focused on toxic productivity as a feature of individuals, as though their personal/psychological shortcomings are to blame.I think it is worthwhile asking what are the cultural, structural, workplace conditions which contribute to people feeling like this in the first place.  Are people more likely to have &#39;toxic productivity&#39; when they are having unrealistic deadlines/workloads thrown at them?  Does management foster a hypercompetitive environment?  Does being tethered to Slack/Teams contribute?  Do specific workplace methodologies such as Agile, etc have an effect?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So we&#39;re just rehashing workaholism with a modern spin? We really are just living through a cycle that endlessly repeats. I&#39;ve started reading books and listening to interviews done in the early 1980s and I&#39;ve been astounded as to how the culture at the time was almost identical to what we&#39;re doing now. It&#39;s down right creepy but when I think about it it&#39;s not unexpected. From my point of view, that&#39;s exactly 1 generation. My peers and I have no memories of the period and so it makes sense that we haven&#39;t learned any of the lessons from that time. Thus we&#39;re doomed to repeat them now that we are the ones dominating the economy and the culture. It makes me wish for a more thorough survey of modern history to be taught in schools, I&#39;m sure that with enough research you could identify significant trends that repeat on a regular basis which you could then teach to students so that they had some warning of what was to come and could perhaps break out of the cycle."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"From 2006 to 2014 I owned my own platform.  Several actually.   But I turned them down after it became a lot of work to maintain.  At the time, it wasn&#39;t so obvious the web was dying, but in hindsight I probably helped kill it.In the beginning the web was so new, and growing so fast, with new things, amazing sites, and more people getting online. Like all things in life, competition arises, and better sites started getting much more of the market share.   People&#39;s expectations for what a website could offer rose tremendously, and would abandon a site if it wasn&#39;t up to snuff.   Sites needed to have ever improving visuals, better content, better people, better interactivity, better everything.And I couldn&#39;t keep up with it.  Users went from being happy to try out something new to dismissive and bitter.  More and more it felt like work to try to make them happy, to keep building more and better things.   And that&#39;s exactly what happened.   The Internet became work.   It&#39;s why we all have to be paid to come to work and build the Internet.  No one does it for free, because it&#39;s a thankless grueling job.   The only websites that survived were the ones that made money, and could afford to use that money to hire people.   Google, Facebook, Myspace, Stumbleupon, 9gag, and even Something Awful became money oriented rather than community oriented.   They had to, or else.The advice to &#34;Always Own Your Own Platform&#34; is a euphemistic way of saying make a whole company out of your site and underpay the only employee (you) for ever.   The reason we don&#39;t own our own platform anymore is because it&#39;s soooo annoying to do so.   It wasn&#39;t an accident."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Distribute [your content] via methods you control.I&#39;m being nitpicky but it feels off to me to call people out on owning their own platform but then use Cloudflare&#39;s CDN instead of running their own. And if they did run their own CDN, they would probably have to use AWS or another worldwide cloud provider and not own the hardware. And if I were Richard Stallman I would probably come down on you for using proprietary chipsets in your hardware instead of totally open source hardware. And you can just keep going deeper and deeper with this train of thought. So what level of ownership is acceptable to this website&#39;s author? I feel like the right balance of &#34;ownership&#34; is super subjective.I love a lot of traits of the &#34;old-school&#34; web and am a huge believer in self-hosting as much as possible. But imo yelling at people while on your high horse doesn&#39;t encourage anyone."</p>

Some neglected corner of the web that someone cared about, suddenly, a bunch of us nerds jump on it and recognize the nerd-coolness of it. I love that. Hope this was OK to say and not too off topic.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This feels relevant: Roger Penrose - Why Did Our Universe Begin? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypjZF6Pdrwstl;dw: It is well known that the universe expands, tracing this back in time leads to the singularity called the Big Bang. But is it possible to ask for a &#34;before&#34; the beginning of time? What is time? Time is what we measure with clocks. What are clocks? Something that returns to the same state (say, a pendulum, or the earth orbiting around the sun - a &#34;year&#34;). To be able to build a clock you need mass. Only objects with mass, moving below the speed of light, experience time. In the very far future, after all stars have burned out, the only objects remaining will be black holes. Eventually, even they will decay due to Hawking radiation. So in the end, there will be only expanding space, and radiation that &#34;travels to infinity&#34;. Photons themselves do not experience time as they move with the speed of light. Without mass, without anything that has a notion of time, the concept of distance becomes meaningless. The universe will become spacelike. Without distances, the universe may as well be a singular point. Like the Big Bang :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Code is my favorite technical book of all time [1]. Charles does an amazing job of building a computer up from basic principles &#34;two young boys who want to communicate after their parents tell them to go to bed at night&#34; all the way to modern (for 1999) computers. He layers abstraction on top of abstraction all the way to a working computer. My only (slight) disappointment in the book is that he tries to cover operating systems -&gt; object oriented programming in a couple of chapters at the end. That could have been a multi-volume series in its own right.It goes really well with Elements of Computing Systems (2nd ed) [2] which I kind of think of as a &#34;lab manual&#34; where you get to build a computer from first principles.[1] https://www.amazon.com/Code-Language-Computer-Hardware-Softw...[2] https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Computing-Systems-second-Pri..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This book was absolutely essential when I was first sinking my teeth into software programming. Things that seemed either arbitrary or completely mysterious suddenly made sense now that I had a contextual understanding of how computers worked. Without having that knowledge, I think my career would have been vastly more difficult and frustrating.While I understand many “get started programming” books/tutorials put an emphasis on getting coding asap, I really had to stop and learn about computers before I could start coding in a well rounded way (and that’s coming from a WebDev, who doesn’t even have to deal with low-level stuff too often!).Thank you Mr. Petzold!!!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Programming Windows&#34; exposed the simplicity behind the Windows architecture.  If you had even a smattering of C experience, Petzold could get you writing Windows applications the same day you opened his book.  He triggered an explosion of software development.There are excellent books for novice Linux programmers, but unfortunately, nothing compared to Petzold&#39;s clear and direct presentation.."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Individual states’ pay transparency laws are already applying upwards pressure on salaries across the country.My company has multiple groups in different states including Colorado, and in anticipation of needing to post salary ranges for our open positions in Colorado, my group (with no positions in Colorado) preemptively bumped up everyone’s salaries to the midpoint of their pay bands to avoid anyone becoming frustrated if they learned they were in the bottom half. Despite the preemptive adjustments, a colleague of mine became angry and quit when they found out their salary wasn’t at the very top of their position’s pay range.So pay transparency laws are having a big impact—not only in the obvious cases of candidates negotiating salaries in the states that passed the pay transparency laws, but also for average employees in other states who didn’t even need to do anything except learn how much their labor was worth."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Microsoft said it would disclose salary ranges in all internal and external U.S. job postings no later than January 2023. That date is when Washington state, where Microsoft’s headquarters are located, will start requiring employers with at least 15 employees to disclose salary ranges for each position.In other news, Microsoft to comply with a new law."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s incredible in these comments that so many of you who work in the industry on the employee side are arguing against having more transparency for the employee, and for having more leverage in the negotiating process for the employer instead.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is funny, but the OpenSSL CLI is in large part just a series of utility/driver/diagnostic programs for library functionality that isn&#39;t expected to be used on a standalone basis. It&#39;s the industry standard for generating certificates, but that&#39;s because the industry doesn&#39;t understand certificates; most people should be using nothing but certbot and mkcert.What bugs me a little is the idea that you might want a well-designed version of what the OpenSSL CLI offers. Bad idea! You want tools designed to do one thing well, not one tool that offers a thin layer of getopt() over a low-level cryptography API."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Truly great GUI design is very challenging.  I&#39;ve used very few applications which I think have a truly great UI that beats the CLI in terms of the efficiency of presenting options in orthogonal and conditional ways (orthogonal: two features which don&#39;t interact at all can usually be programmed independently and appear in distinct locations, while conditional: options that are only valid if another option is set to a specific value).The best UI I&#39;ve worked with so far is Fusion 360.  Like most 3d modelling tools it has a fairly steep learning curve, but it does a fantastic job of making your life easier.  It has a bunch of UI dialogs for parameter setting (some of which are better than others) that do a good job with both orthogonality and conditionality.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author is here and ought to make it all clear but if you google the title of the article you can download the paper already despite everyone being coy about it and the ACM not having published it yet.  It&#39;s kind of ridiculous it&#39;s getting this kind of press before the paper is officially published and available.   If the paper was published and security experts were allowed to analyze it before the tech press went nuts the stories would probably have a different tone.This is interesting theoretically but the amount of access required is pretty high, this is hardly an exploitable zero day.Having read the paper, in a nutshell it requires:- Login to the Mac in question- Ability to install a custom kext to make the PACMAN Gadget work.   The exploit requires access to undocumented registers on the M1 that are apparently not accessible from user space, but this is a bit unclear.- Also need an exploitable kernel buffer overflow against Mac OS (they made a custom kext with a buffer overflow)- Run the bufferflow + Pacman Gadget together to do the final elevationIf someone can find a way to do this without installing kexts then it becomes way more serious.   As is it certainly is a super interesting paper and presents a bunch of work for chip designers."</p>

    duckduckgo.*##.results &gt; div:has(a[href*=&#34;thetopsites.com&#34;])

And it&#39;s even possible to target an element&#39;s text content with a `:has-text(/regex/)` selector:    google.*##.g:has(*:has-text(/bye topic of noninterest/i))
    duckduckgo.*##.results &gt; div:has(*:has-text(/bye topic of noninterest/i))

As a bonus, here&#39;s how to get rid of Medium&#39;s obnoxious cookie notification across all domains:    *##body &gt; div &gt; div:has(*:has-text(/To make Medium work.*Privacy Policy.*Cookie Policy/i))"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Initiatives like the Dot Collector and the Performance review system that has led to a toxic workplace cultureI was curious about that &#34;Dot Collector&#34;:Dot collector was an application invented by Ray Dalio’s hedge fund and Bridgewater Associates. The application has set its foot in Coinbase since the start of the year and has been in use by the HR and IT teams of the company. The user interface of the app is quite simple and efficient. It asks the user to rate the coworker or the manager on how well they demonstrate the 10 crore Values at coinbase. The values are not only limited to things like communications, but also include values like positive energy. The information about the co-worker can be shared by either giving a thumbs up or by giving a thumbs down. There is an option of giving neutral feedback for the co-workers in the application.Sounds like hell."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve become convinced that hiring more people is generally a warning sign. A team of between a few and about twenty people seems to produce all the good stuff. Anything beyond that, your value per employee drops drastically, and your cost per employee goes up as you need to offer higher and higher salaries to stay in competition. A company going on a hiring spree is now a negative indicator for me. I think FB, Goog, etc. could lay off thousands with no adverse effects and in fact an increase in velocity, quality, and quantity of new features/products. Sometimes one person can be much more productive than a whole team. This is obviously unscientific, just a feeling I’m getting lately."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My signals processing professor apparently knew one joke, and one joke only.&#34;A LOT (Polish airline) airplane is about to land in New York City; as they align for final approach, the first officer notifies the passengers that those seated on the right can now see the Statue of Liberty. A number of passengers get up from their seats left of the aisle and lean over the people seated on the right to get a glimpse of the statue. Plane promptly crashes.Why? There were too many Poles in the right half of the plane.I&#39;ll lead myself out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this article is trying to make a political statement, &#34;Our leaders have just done something that is going to cause a future problem, a crash&#34;.I have only read the linked article, I think the followup might be available, but I&#39;m not going to read it before posting this -- because this article was meant to be clickbait, to get you hooked and possibly mis-informed.The article as it stands (incomplete) contains some classic argument fallacies.It is an &#34;appeal to authority&#34;, by attempting to explain control theory. This person knows something.The examples all result in bad things, airplanes crashing, hard drives (crashing - perhaps a stretch). Bicycle at the edge of a cliff. Eating too much ice cream. Chernobyl. This is a possible &#34;appeal to emotion&#34;.The final issue is an &#34;incomplete comparison&#34;. The graph at the bottom of the article shows housing prices -- all of the previous examples have mathematical models which can explain the behavior. For the last graph no model (the equations) is presented. Without a model you cannot  use control theory to analyze the zeros and poles.The last graph wants you to believe in a continuing upward trend, the fallacious argument, implies that whatever the Canadian political change that has been made is going to make this trend to zero, despite the intention to keep it trending upwards.Background: A long time ago, as a mathematics undergraduate, I did take a course in control theory, it was run out of the engineering department. It was somewhat awkward as quite a few mathematical terms were not-quite-the-same. I get the same unease when reading this for poles, zeros and right-half-planes. Any engineering textbooks that use j for sqrt(-1) instead of i (because that is taken) is an indicator. Yup, this could be construed as an &#34;appeal to authority&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am not sure what to take from this. The title certainly makes sense from a engineers perspective. But from a layman&#39;s? I don&#39;t know.It seems, that he tries to explain an important concept in control theory but does not explain the meaning of &#34;plane&#34; at all. Even worse: He uses airplanes as an example.Isn&#39;t it terribly confusing for non-control-theory people? If I don&#39;t know control theory, then how on earth would I know that he means a 2D-plane? And what&#39;s this &#34;minimum-phase-system&#34; he mentions once? Is a pole a number? And what about RHP poles?I would be interested in how readers without a background in control theory and higher maths understood that article and what questions arose."</p>

And google just keeps taking more and more steps to hide that information from me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That seems OK since it still asks you as it needs them when running an app, and &#34;prunes&#34; permissions away from apps that you do not use often.Lots of apps only need specific permissions if you use specific parts of the app. And apps are much larger (one app does more things) than they were 5-10 years ago. Eg you can use some apps as a camera, but never as a photo editor, and get use out of it by only giving some specific permissions (camera), forever."</p>

In session 2, start the concurrent (re)index.
In session 3, monitor pg_stat_progress_create_index for session 2 to get to a &#39;waiting for ...&#39; phase.When you detect the (re)index session arrives in a waiting phase, start a REPEATABLE READ transaction in this session, and then halt (commit or rollback doesn&#39;t matter) the transaction in session 1. Now, we switch roles of sessions 1 and 3, and repeat this lock-step while the session that is (re)indexing hasn&#39;t completed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"All of these supposed &#34;flaws&#34; of leetcode are by design. Big companies want people who are smart enough to do the work, but obedient enough to put up with all the bullshit that comes with working at a big company. What person better matches that than someone who&#39;s able and willing to study for and pass a tech version of the SAT? Every anti-leetcode article I read is some version of &#34;leetcode is bad because it measures the wrong things.&#34; No, we all know it measures those things, and those are exactly the things the measurers want to measure.You might ask, so why do startups do leetcode too? I heard startups are supposed to be, uh, innovating, developing new technology, and working on hard, meaningful problems? Shouldn&#39;t they want brilliant, super effective people, instead of smart-enough, obedient workers? Apparently not. Apparently they want the same workers bigcos want. The implication of this is left as an exercise to the reader."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Someone who builds a truly novel technology solution involving hundreds of hours of effort gets filtered out of an interview involving contrived scenarios.  You may have built the next generation X, but given an array of strings and a fixed width, can you format the text such that each line has exactly maxWidth characters and is fully justified -- in the next 30 minutes?  Maybe you should have cultivated that skillset instead, because around here we value parlor tricks more than real world accomplishments."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In my team we do technical interviews in three steps:- an algorithmic challenge. It&#39;s related to what we do day to day. I work in domain names so we ask to parse a domain name. There are oddities with domain names so we check multiple things: does the candidate know what basic string manipulation functions exist? do they ask questions to get more info? how do they react when we give additional info that break the code they did so far? What we don&#39;t check: whether the code compiles or actually works. We don&#39;t care. We explicitly tell the candidate they can write pseudo code or comments defining the steps of the algorithm. We&#39;re interested in their reflection.- an architecture challenge. We ask the candidate how they would scale an API worldwide. There&#39;s no code, it&#39;s an open discussion. They can talk about whatever they want: asynchronous, statelessness, load balancing, replication, anycast, whatever. We can also guide the candidate to know whether they know some specifics concepts (for example I can ask &#34;what would you do if you have a GET REST endpoint that returns the same thing every time&#34; and expect &#34;cache its result&#34;, even with this question I get different answers (which is great), some will talk about HTTP cache headers, others will talk about Redis or in memory caching, rarely do candidates talk about both)- a refactoring challenge. We work with tons of legacy code. So we show the candidate a crappy piece of code with performance issues and no tests and ask them for what their strategy would be. No writing code here, just thinking and discussion.So yeah, just a quick screening to check if the candidate can write basic code (you&#39;d be surprised of the results), and open discussions on our day to day problems."</p>

We lost nothing...except our trust in Dropbox.EDIT2:  Yes, as several others have kinda pointed out, this incident was a collision between (a) naive human expectations (of high-skill, high-touch, highly-invested customer service for such situations) and (b) the actual business model of any huge / cheap or free / convenient cloud provider of X (plus just &#34;internet reality&#34;).

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is very cool! I&#39;ve been looking for some time for a project that has:- a stellar editing UI for &#34;prototyping&#34; a well-edited video- a well-documented timeline-level API for the file format that can replace, timeshift, and add clips and tracks, and- be able to run on cloud hardware as a render serviceImagine creating a promotional video, then automatically swapping in each client&#39;s logo and re-rendering it for each one! The possibilities here are endless.DaVinci Resolve can&#39;t be beat for #1 and seems to support #3 well, but its API seems designed more for plugins than for automated authoring. For instance, the documentation at https://forum.blackmagicdesign.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&amp;t=9927... seems to give just read-only access to a lot of things at the TimelineClip level. And https://github.com/pedrolabonia/pydavinci has exactly one contributor.By contrast, Shotcut seems to be built on, and by, https://mltframework.org/ with a close correspondence between the runtime API surface and the file system representation of a file, and it&#39;s fully open-source.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The only nuclear plant under construction in the US is at Plant Vogtle, in Georgia.

I think it&#39;s not surprising therefore that costs keep increasing and the delays keep coming.  I don&#39;t think we can infer that nuclear power plants cannot be built at reasonable cost, rather that we need to consider &#34;regulatory capture&#34; as a significant construction risk.(Some admittedly one-sided background on CWIP: https://stopcwip.com/ )"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a problem I want to focus my life solving. I believe that software engineering can be made so simple and clear that it can be wielded by an extremely small team of engineers. I believe that there are finite and fundamental classes of problems, that underpin the vast majority of problems, that have a distinct visual representation, and that by representing these problems visually, you let your &#34;visual coprocessor&#34; assist in seeing the solutions. I believe there are well-known strategies (taken from the real world) for managing hierarchies of complexity that ease the cognitive load of exploring any problem. We just need to get these approaches into a programming &#34;langugage&#34;!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I will tell you this.It&#39;s based on my 20+ years, 50 different teams and many hundreds, perhaps thousands of  encounters with software developers.It&#39;s almost never the domain complexity that is high.Sending a rocket to Mars is complex. And perhaps complex every time.Dealing with people that has to work together can only be simplified when agreements are made and agreements are kept. Otherwise you cannot trust and have faith in people.It comes down to far and near organization leadership, mandate and empowerment in small teams with few communication links outwards, clear expectations from whomever is asking for something and process management.Writing code is rarely hard if you know the expectations and the boundaries of the task.Empowerment gives the team the possibility to act on what they discover and encounter.Don&#39;t look into the future. Because you cannot. And you are both naive and arrogant if you believe you can. Deal with what is known now!One thing is complexity in code. Another is complexity in business. Some things are not made for software to solve.Less experienced people are generally guided by their beliefs around their own ideas. If the mind is locked onto something it&#39;s hard not to thing it&#39;s a good idea. Usually in software there is simpler approach. Look for itI can go on because I help companies and teams for a living. But I will stop here"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I appreciated this essay.Among other things, it suggests that there are some incentives for complexity: That engineers just enjoy complexity, and that making simple designs might not be good for the respect of your peers/bosses/career: &#34;A simple design might make it seem like you’re not really doing your job.&#34;While that&#39;s true, I think the essay isn&#39;t clear enough about the fact that simplicity is just plain hard.  Complexity is sort of the &#34;natural&#34; outcome of &#34;adding things&#34;.  It takes time, effort, and skill to create software that can do what is asked for it while maintaining an internal simplicity. Even if everyone involved really wants it.  I do not think software complexity comes only, or mainlly, from people not wanting it enough (explicitly or implicity), from incentives to complexity. It&#39;s just plain hard. It&#39;s a mistake to think just wanting it harder (or having the right incentives) is sufficient.It may be the key challenge in software engineering -- how do we make software that does everything that&#39;s asked for it (powerful, complex things), while maintaining an internal simplicity? You can not accomplish it by cargo-culting any &#34;design patterns&#34; or other approaches. It&#39;s still a skilled craft. That comes from years of experience with the intent of developing this skill (years of experience alone aren&#39;t enough), looking at other people&#39;s code who are also trying to do it, and just some aptitude. And domain knowledge, if you understand the nature of the problems you are working on better, you can design simple solutions for them better--contrary to some current practices treating developers as interchangeable.Yes, you need your organization to allow you to do it (including taking the more time it will take), but that&#39;s necessary but not sufficient for the outcome."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi, creator here.This is a demo of our recent work presented at Oakland (IEEE S&amp;P): https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/368. The server and client code are written in Rust and available here: https://github.com/menonsamir/spiral-rs. The general aim of our work is to show that homomorphic encryption is practical today for real-world applications. The server we use to serve this costs $35/month!A quick overview: the client uses homomorphic encryption to encrypt the article number that they would like to retrieve. The server processes the query and produces an encrypted result containing the desired article, and sends this back to the client, who can decrypt and obtain the article. A malicious server is unable to determine which article the client retrieved. All search and autocomplete is down locally. The technical details are in the paper, but the high level summary is that the client creates a large one-hot vector of encrypted bits (0’s except for the index of the desired article, where they place a 1) and then the server computes something like a ‘homomorphic dot product’ between the query and the plaintext articles.I’d like to caveat that this is an in-browser demo to show it is practical to use homomorphic encryption at this scale. As a real product, you’d probably want to distribute a signed client executable (or Electron app) since otherwise, a malicious server could simply deliver bad client JS on the fly.Happy to answer any questions!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting! But, it&#39;d be helpful to clarify further the strength of the following claim:&gt; This demo allows private access to 6 GB (~30%) of English Wikipedia. In theory, even if the server is malicious, it will be unable to learn which articles you request. All article title searches are performed locally, and no images are available.In this demo, the number of article-titles is relatively small – a few million – &amp; enumerable.If the server is truly malicious, and it issues itself requests for every known title, does it remain true that this &#34;Private Information Retrieval&#34; (PIR) scheme still gives it no hints that subsequent requests from others for individual articles retrieve particular data?(Presumably: every request touches every byte of the same full 6GB of data, and involves every such byte in constant-run-time calculations that vary per request, and thus have the effect of returning only what each request wanted – but not at all in any way correlatable with other requests for the exact same article, from the same or different clients?)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;I agree that it is unacceptable to have eighth grade Algebra I classes and gifted education programs that disproportionately exclude Black and brown children. But if equity is the goal, we should be mandating that every eighth grader takes Algebra I—and then structure the entire pre-K to seventh grade student experience to ensure this is a legitimate possibility for every child. Since when does equity mean everyone gets nothing?I don&#39;t know whether Algebra I is above or below what eighth graders can be expected to do, but raising the difficulty of every class to what the most advanced student is capable of is not the answer either. Everybody knows someone else that is better at math than they are, and someone who is not as good. It is universal common knowledge that the ease with which one takes to math is different for different people. Why can&#39;t we just admit it and quit trying to make people who are unique the same?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The gifted program helped me immensely in highschool, although the hour or two I actually spent in the gifted classroom was mostly wasted playing board games.  However being in that program gave me the ability to switch classes/teachers whenever one wasn&#39;t working for me, usually because some teachers could maintain a civil classroom and other teachers let the students run wild and taught nothing.  Because I was in the gifted program, the school permitted me to switch out of those classrooms into classes taught by competent/caring teachers.This suggests to me that the advantage of the program could be conferred to students who score low on IQ tests but are nevertheless behaved in class.  A better gifted program would be one that differentiates on the basis of civility, not IQ.  Of course, deferring measurement of IQ to some licensed professionals is easier than objectively quantifying a student&#39;s civility, so I don&#39;t know how this would actually be implemented."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Gifted programs are extremely important and the width of American gifted programs is a virtue.  Canada has a much higher standard for gifted, and in Ontario we generally admit roughly the top 1% of students (many American programs cater to the top 10%).There a number of large benefits to gifted, not the least of which is it changes the character of a program/school.  If you are surrounded by bright students with nerdy academic interests it&#39;s suddenly acceptable to nerd out on things. This single fact may be more valuable to the development of the student than the entire program itself.  Outside of gifted, schools have substantial challenges with creating environments where academic excellence is encouraged and rewarded not only by the schools grading system but also by social behaviour of peers. While bullying has gone down, and acceptability of geeky interests have improved in the past 30 years there is still nothing close to a gifted program from encouraging and accepting academic excellence.As someone who just barely missed the gifted cutoff, my schooling was much too easy and I basically never had to study for tests or exams.  I ended up developing poor academic habits that ultimately hurt me when the difficulty got hard enough that intellectual horsepower needed to be combined with hard work. I think being challenged early and often would have changed this behaviour substantially.  Even creating an environment where I wanted to be around other students enough to participate in more extra-curriculars could have helped. I worry that we are going to create a lot of bright but unmotivated students by offering years of programs that are too easy for them. There are consequences far beyond just having these students occasionally act out out of boredom and I think it&#39;s a very bad idea to create an educational culture that suggests bright people should be lazy. This is ultimately what the removal of gifted programs do because classroom teachers generally aren&#39;t given adequate prep time or other resources to properly offer enrichment.  I&#39;ve even known some principals who encouraged their teachers to not offer enrichment as it created problems in later grades when other teachers didn&#39;t offer similar enrichment and parents expected it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s weird that you can bribe individual EJ&#39;s in Philadelphia like this. In Chicagoland, every polling place has a team of 4-5 judges, and they all have to sign off on the final election result, and all the procedural steps that arrive at that number; every individual vote is recorded in the pollbook. I don&#39;t even know how you&#39;d generate fake votes in the first place, even if you bought off all 4 EJs.You can&#39;t just make people up! Every vote is tied to a specific registration. We do same-day registration, but those votes are cast provisionally, with a paper log; there aren&#39;t many of them, and they can all be set aside and audited after-the-fact.You certainly can&#39;t just make up a final tally. The numbers from the individual voting machines and the paper ballots have to match up; we had to stay an extra 2 hours after the polls closed last time I did this (in 2020) because of an equipment screwup that kept us from doing the final certified count/reconciliation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They make it sound so simple:Bribe the Judge of Elections who oversees everything. Dilute the vote tallies by using the voting machines to increment the votes for specific candidates. Certify that the fake results are correct. Lie if anybody asks.This person did this with 2 separate judges. Why is it so easy?"</p>

You can always add a &#34;get&#34; prefix or &#34;app&#34; suffix (or a bunch of other options). If you are sold on a company name then by all means, grab the domain but don&#39;t confuse &#34;buying a domain&#34; with &#34;making actual progress&#34;.When I was younger I used to snap up domain names for every little idea I had. I executed on less than 1% of those ideas and ended up letting the domain expire 1-2 years later when I could finally admit to myself I was never going to pursue it. Literally hundreds of dollars flushed down the toilet all to get a temporary rush.I know that I have issues with thinking &#34;spending money&#34; === &#34;making progress&#34; (be it on home improvement projects or web apps) and I know I&#39;m not alone. If all you need is a domain to launch your product then go ahead and start looking, otherwise it&#39;s just a dopamine distraction."</p>

Detective(s), judge, police, and American Airlines (everyone involved) should be severely punished for once.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow this is insane. I hope this blows up in a big way and everyone is aware of what happened here, and I hope Mr Lowe gets a big payday.&gt;&gt;&gt;&#34;After Lowe had been in jail for eight days, he was taken to a local judge. He still received no information about why he was there, he said. The judge told him his only options were to waive extradition — in which New Mexico would deliver him to Texas authorities — or wait for Texas authorities to pick him up. Lowe, unsure what the legal implications were of either option, waived extradition based on the court’s suggestion that he do so.&#34;This is such a perfect application of the term &#34;kafkaesque&#34;.Also, is it weird that he was brought before a judge without having any sort of legal representation first, and that the judge was able to give Mr Lowe advice as to what to do? Imagining myself in his shoes, I wouldn&#39;t say a single word to the judge or anyone really before I had spoken with a lawyer, I don&#39;t care how long that takes. One wrong word and it&#39;s not hard to imagine his 17 day ordeal turning into something longer and more nightmarish."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those wondering why he&#39;s not suing the government:Suing a government entity is a very long and costly affair, and is fraught with difficulties.Suing a company is MUCH easier by comparison. Unlike governments, companies tend to be very sensitive to bad press, and thus much more likely to yield to legal pressure.Therefore, your most promising tactic is to use the suit against the company to build a war chest and establish official records of fact that can then be drawn upon in the longer government campaign."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It never ceases to amaze me how much improvements Blender is getting all the time. I&#39;ve never used it much, simply because I got burned in the past by the (legacy) esoteric UI, but it has increasingly become a joy to get started with and just noodle around with.There are other cool open source tools of course. Blender could&#39;ve easily remained another one of those hard to use niche applications, but they&#39;ve definitely managed to transcend that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Blender is amazing. The other day, I needed to create a video of a rotating image so I looked around for potential software to use. Very quick and dirty job.I didn&#39;t want to download anything large like Davinci Resolve. I saw OpenShot but was not sure it can do what I needed easily. It&#39;s not even lightweight.Then someone mentioned that Blender can do video editing. Can you believe that blender is only around 200mb? I downloaded it, followed a quick tutorial on YouTube to figure out keyframes and how to render. 10 minutes after and I&#39;m done.It&#39;s great to see even more features to the video sequencer in this update. Will probably use again for my next video editing needs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Stage Manager follows the same pattern as the other features Apple took too long to realize were already figured out on the Mac: make it arbitrarily different to be able to call it new. Just like the “changing cursor” for trackpad support on the iPad. But hey, I&#39;ll take it I guess.Unfortunately, in previous cases, these &#34;justification&#34; tweaks have resulted in a strictly worse experience IMO. The transforming cursor on the iPad is distracting and it can be weird how it disappears over icons (resulting in me losing track of it sometimes). The iPad Keyboard is more awkward than a real keyboard, top-heavy, and sold separately of course. I wouldn’t be surprised if the same is true of Stage Manager, although at least it&#39;s on the Mac too so hopefully if it turns out to not be that great, it won&#39;t be excused as &#34;people not getting it&#34; like all the weirdo undiscoverable gestures on the iPad.The sad reality though is that it&#39;s taken 10 years for the iPad to finally mature into... an arbitrarily different take on OS X? Same chip as the Mac. Works with a keyboard and mouse. Better for drawing but worse for external monitor support. And now basically the same window management we&#39;ve always had with the Mac. I was always (and remain, theoretically) a big believer in the opportunity the iPad presented, and think it could have gotten to the same place sooner, but bolder, with the actual aim of replacing the Mac (the same way the iPhone replaced the iPod). Where it&#39;s at now kind of proves that&#39;s always been possible... it just chose to get here meekly instead, not stepping on any toes, always making sure there was an excuse to need to buy both devices.Universal Control to me is the epitome of that mentality: a supremely technically impressive, but ultimately completely over-engineered and absolutely ridiculous &#34;solution&#34; to a problem that wouldn&#39;t exist if the Mac simply had a touch screen. You wouldn&#39;t need WiFi and communication between two computers to move your mouse from screen A to screen B if the Mac just had a touch screen. The experience of having a touch Mac that you just... plugged into an external display would be strictly better than the weird world of Universal Control, where you drag an image from Adobe Photoshop for Mac over to Adobe Photoshop for iPad, or sometimes, you drag it from Adobe Photoshop for iPad running on the Mac using Catalyst to Adobe Photoshop for iPad running &#34;natively&#34; on the iPad.I think Apple truly squandered the opportunity in the last decade to get truly get ahead on &#34;big screen&#34; (aka, non-phone-based) computing. Instead, the field still remains wide open."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;     If a machine could accomplish the task just as well as a human, or the need for the task could be designed away, that task is toil. If human judgment is essential for the task, there’s a good chance it’s not toil.21It&#39;s fun the the engineering at Google is so great at recognizing things, while the product/&#34;human&#34; teams (like whoever came up with the account reviews and other parts) seems to suck so much.If YouTube applied the same view of what should/shouldn&#39;t be automated, they could solve the problem of peoples YouTube channels being locked in front of them, even if they don&#39;t break any ToS&#39;s."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You should probably not automate all toil. You should only automate toil when the toil cost/effect is more burdensome than the cost of automating it. All automation has a cost, and may or may not create value. Automation should have a positive and timely return on investment. If the ROI is 10 years down the road, you probably shouldn&#39;t automate it (yet). If there is a cheaper way to deal with the toil, explore that avenue first.Several times in my career I worked on projects to reduce toil. Sometimes the project would fail because the time it took to work on them went well past the cost saving estimation. Sometimes they would be completed, but the value created was far less than their cost. And sometimes automation wasn&#39;t even the solution, and we just needed to change our process or system, or do some other manual thing that reduced the toil cost. Sometimes we chose to automate toil because we were afraid to take on a larger project we knew would make the toil unnecessary, so we paid for the automation and then later for rebuilding everything. Or toil was used as an excuse to justify a project that didn&#39;t really have to do with toil.One of my biggest mistakes as an engineer was assumptions I made about my work that ended up creating more waste than value. Talk to an outsider about your plans and why you&#39;re doing it, take their advice seriously. And if your automation is optional, make sure you have buy-in before you start working on it; i&#39;ve sunk months on things that nobody ended up using.A great way to automate toil is incrementally. Typically you have a runbook with step-by-step instructions, and over time you automate one step, then another, etc. The investment is minimal and gradual, it can change over time, and you can target the costliest parts of the toil, optimizing value."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Most of my work for SRE was the opposite; I did things manually because the automated systems were guaranteed to mess up some fraction of things.  At some point my managers wanted me to automate a hardware management process- I checked and it would take 6 months to deploy the code to prod.  Instead, I identified all the broken machines and filed tickets manually- getting things fixed far more quickly without a high rate of false positives and churn (google&#39;s hardware repair system churns a lot).Many of the automated systems at Google were developed by geniuses.  Others, not so much, and it ended up making a lot of work for other people."</p>

Second, if you had actually suffered such a loss, your digital life would hopefully be the last thing on your mind, and you’d just be glad to have your life and your family - the only real things that matter in this world.That said, planning a strategy for offsite data storage or a secondary authenticator is of course wise. A safety deposit box or other offsite location that you can frequently refresh and keep up to date would be a good investment. If you’re worried about keeping a master key to your life in a single place, you could separate your data and your authenticator. The how likely depends on your threat model, several people on this site may find it insufficient. To whatever degree you obfuscate or complicate your recovery path, you also increase the risk of losing access to it yourself.You might also consider it’s not necessarily the “thing you have” that might go MIA, but due to physical injury, age, or just forgetfulness, the “thing you know” could also be at risk. I realize this the older I get. Finding a secure way to store a master password in the event you cannot recall it, or perhaps in the event of your death, is something you may also consider. In this case, I would avoid a cipher or something else you’re likely to forget."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Two-factor authentication terrifies me.For my bank from my country of origin that I maintain, I get a battery-powered RSA token. From that I can generate a mobile 2FA token in an app that I can use to log in for day-to-day transaction. If I lose the devices with the 2FA token, I have to pray that that CR2032 is still alive or I lose access to that account until I spend thousands of dollars on international flights (replacing the battery resets the device)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This recently happened to me after my laptop and phone were stolen on vacation.  Everything is in 1Password.  I of course didn&#39;t have the recovery paper with me.  I recently changed my iCloud password to be more secure, and luckily I remembered it.  But I needed 2FA to log in still.I had to go to an AT&amp;T store, port my phone number to a different iPhone, restore from an iCloud backup using the SMS 2FA, and then I could finally log into 1Password for my passwords and MFA.If I didn&#39;t have a memorable iCloud password this would have been impossible without the 1Password recovery paper.Devices are often lost/stolen on vacation where the myriad layers of protection are extremely hard — if not impossible — to penetrate."</p>

I&#39;m using a throwaway account because I&#39;d rather not be identified (and because surveillance is quite controversial here).Axis has developed a way to cryptographically sign video, using TPMs (Trusted Platform Module) built into the cameras and embedding the signature into the h.264 stream.[1] The video can be verified on playback using an open-source video player.[2]I hope this sort of video signing will be mainstream in all cameras in the future (i.e. cellphones etc), as it will pretty much solve the trust issues deep fakes are causing.[0] https://www.axis.com/

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A lot of people saying &#34;USB-C cables aren&#39;t even compatible with each other!&#34; (Nintendo switch etc.) Guess what: that&#39;s exactly the problem this regulation is intended to solve. Fake USB-C cables like Nintendo&#39;s that have the right shape but do not adhere to spec should gradually disappear along with lightning cables. The regulation actually says that cables can no longer be bundled with the devices themselves, so Nintendo would stop sending you that fake cable with your switch, and you would just buy a real one to work with all your devices.Other people saying &#34;what about innovation!?&#34; That&#39;s fine. Let&#39;s say the USB consortium releases USB-D with input from Apple, Google, and many other stakeholders. The EU can set another deadline for newly released devices to adhere to the new version instead of the old one. The transition will involve a period of time where older devices are still on C and newer ones on D, which is totally compatible with the regulation and is necessary with or without regulation. It&#39;s ludicrous to think companies won&#39;t be able to &#34;iterate&#34;: you would be crazy to go to market with any cable technology that isn&#39;t already very mature. Apple spent years designing lighting chargers because they knew that once they were released they&#39;d be around for a long time (and they have been!)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"By the way, that&#39;s also how Tesla and all other cars have the same electric plug in EU(not the USB mandate but the car plug standardisation mandate).Of course, the first thing that comes to mind is what happens if better solutions are found. Will EU block innovation?That question is addressed in the Q&amp;A: https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_...In essence, they seem to believe that wired charging is mature enough for standardisation but further technologies can be implemented through &#34;Radio Equipment Directive&#34;. In the same time, it appears that the  wireless charging is unaffected because the tech is new and fast changing, therefore the manufacturers can include whatever wireless charging they see fit.It really boils down to &#34;No funny cables, why don&#39;t you try wireless charging of your liking if USB-C doesn&#39;t cut it for you?&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s just really not clear to me that regulators need to be mandating product design.I have no expectation, for example, that these same regulators will stay on top of this and revise it when USB-C stops being the preferred or best choice.Twenty years ago, we really DID have a snarl of competing and proprietary phone ports. It was a mess -- Blackberry chargers didn&#39;t work with Palm; most WinMo devices had their own ports; etc. It was ugly.Now, pretty much everything is either USB or Lightning. This is good! What problem is the EU solving here?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"hey, OP here, figured i&#39;d clarify some things about this project:1) yes, I realize this is going to be way harder than it seems, but I&#39;m actually going to do my best to hopefully get a good user experience out of this and I&#39;m easily preparing for this to be a multi-year effort, but I&#39;m not going to give up right at the gate2) Custom HALs were actually an option, up until very recently, since as of Windows 10, version 2004, the HAL is now statically linked into the kernel, meaning that if I wanted to use the AIC natively I&#39;d need to write a patch finder that runs before the Windows kernel loads (This is what EfiGuard does for example to disable PatchGuard)(Yes this is actually more tenable than it may seem, due to some undocumented policy files Windows is able to use, but I have already decided to hold off on this until after I get Windows working under the thin hypervisor)3) HAL Extensions (for those unaware they are tiny modules that allow you to extend the Windows HAL with functions for non standard hardware) are not tenable at the moment since they&#39;re limited in the APIs they use4) I am well aware that Windows is going to need a lot more help than just purely the interrupt controller, I&#39;m currently trying to bring up the vGIC first since the distributor and redistributors need to be emulated and I need to bring up Project Mu first5) as for the GPU, I&#39;m way too far away from that being a concern to figure out the approach lolif you have any feedback btw, please do feel free to comment it i&#39;ll try to address it as best as I canyes I&#39;ll update the website theme soon enough, thanks to the commenter who remarked about readability."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why would Apple want to make it hard to run aarch64 Windows on an M1 device?  Their support for Windows in Boot Camp drove a lot of sales of Mac hardware after the switch to Intel.  Seems Apple is limiting their hardware sales to not support Windows on M-series Macs.(Then again, if they are having supply/capacity issues then maybe it&#39;s a matter it being on the roadmap but they want their hardware running macOS until that demand is fully met?)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been working 4 day workweeks for well over a decade now, took the pay cut myself.As for the goal to maintain 100% productivity whilst cutting back on hours, I&#39;m confident that they will succeed. In fact, they&#39;ll succeed in this without requiring some kind of brilliant plan, as this recalibration happens automatically.When you start working one day less, nobody will reduce your workload by 20%. You&#39;ll have the exact same workload as before and now need to achieve it in less time.There&#39;s many ways to cross this gap. An obvious one is that a typical 5 day work week has moments of slack, depending on the culture. Friday after lunch is where productivity sinks in many offices. Wednesdays are also slower as it&#39;s typically the first moment in the week where things are running (planned, prepared, on track). In a 4 day work week you sacrifice this breathing room, the 4 days become more compressed.Another natural change is to take a more aggressive stand in rejecting non-sense. Excess meetings, unimportant emails, etc. This works very well and is extremely effective for the simple reason that you MUST. As such this time compression is a blessing, a cleansing mechanism for yourself and the organization.You&#39;ll be amazed at how much time you can win back. Let&#39;s say you do need to attend a meeting. It&#39;s a 1 hour meeting. You&#39;re needed in the meeting. Go in and say you only have 20 mins. As if by sheer magic, what needed to be discussed gets done in 20 mins. Without this forced &#34;budgeting&#34;, people would just fill the hour with bullshit.Counter intuitive, but by being rigid instead of elastic, you maximize value."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is part of a wider scheme in the UK whereby 60 firms and 3000 employees are piloting 4 day weeks.https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/04/thousands-o...From the article:Employees from a wide range of businesses and charities are expected to take part in the scheme, which will run initially from June to December, including the Royal Society of Biology, the London-based brewing company Pressure Drop, a Manchester-based medical devices firm, and a fish and chip shop in Norfolk.It comes as the push for companies to adopt a shorter working week – crucially with no loss of pay while aiming for higher productivity – gains momentum as a way of improving working conditions."</p>

Good management, strong teams, and a whole lot of &#34;soft&#34; stuff is even more important than beanbag chairs and foozball tables. The &#34;good management&#34; part is where most companies go pear-shaped. I wouldn&#39;t want to go to Buckingham Palace every day, if I hated the people I worked with/for, and felt like my work was being treated badly[0].Although I work exclusively at home, and have no desire to ever dress &#34;business casual&#34; again, I think that a good* office environment can be extremely conducive to great work.* As in &#34;not like 99% of today&#39;s offices.&#34;[0] https://dilbert.com/strip/1996-06-02"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a low-energy quantum physicist, I completely agree: Experimental high-energy physics has become primarily an industrial subsidy scheme[1], and if we want the highest chance of reaching a grand unified theory, it seems the money would be much better spent elsewhere (cosmology, space-based observatories, research positions for young physicists without publish-or-perish incentives to run for the latest fad).The short history of physics in TFA is spot on: Einstein and the quantum pioneers added abstractions to build physical theories with prediction power, whereas current high-energy physics theory seems to be mostly a mathematical exercise. This has been confirmed by numerous insiders, including by Hossenfelder as mentioned in the article, and Lee Smolin (&#34;The trouble with physics&#34;) who is also a theoretical physicist.Things have changed a lot since accelerators became a must-have for high-energy physics: Today we have detectors and computing power that let us observe the natural experiment of the universe with a precision and diligence that would be impossible when LHC was commissioned. I find it much more likely that we would learn new physics by giving 10-year grants to 1000 young physicist of revolutionary spirit, and let them use the tools they could build themselves, than by handing that money to the old guard which has produced nothing of significance for the last two generations.[1]: The industrial subsidy angle is not touched upon in TFA, but it is clear that there is a large number of people and companies making a good living from mega-physics, and  talking to colleagues in the field, I get the distinct impression that it is not always they physicist walking in the front when asking for more machines."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who did their PhD at CERN - I agree.The place is fantastic, you get to meet great people and life is cool.But what you are working on is completely useless for humanity. Knowing that there is a quantum foam is knowledge that brings us nowhere. If someone could answer to this &#34;and so what?&#34; in a meaningful way I would be glad to change my mind. For the time being, the energy scale we are making these discoveries is not useful.&#34;yes, but this is fundamental science...&#34; → yes it is, but where does this fundamental science helps in everyday problems? Have we had a case where the Higgs boson changed anything in our life?The quantum mechanics of the 1920&#39;s changed our everyday world. We could build a whole technology on it, and understand things that changes our everyday life. Is there a comparable impact on knowing that the Higgs boson is +/- 10^-9 (or whatever) aligned with the theoretical model?We have so many problems where physics is needed (energy production to start with, and then exploring biology), the money should go there instead. Even if it means having less particle physicists the same way we have less philosophes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The LHC&#39;s development produced a number of new technologies (e.g. radiation resistant microcontrollers, and gas electron multipliers). Could the next generation produce more, valuable tech?I also don&#39;t have the expertise to tell whether the article is being overly reductive with the project&#39;s goals: are there other questions (besides new particles) that can only be answered with a larger collider? The summary of the FCC (Future Circular Collider) project&#39;s goals indicates that yes, there are unresolved questions that the FCC will address[0].[0]: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-019-69..."</p>

I remember having a blast playing it with colleagues at least 10 years ago.From memory, as you level you get access to more and more API features. A good way to have a stronger leek was to manage to implement algorithms before they were officialy available to you through the API. Ex: instead of waiting to level up to get access to A* pathfinding, you could get a huge advantage against other leeks by implementing it yourself within the memory and cycle constraints you were given for your AI code.Happy to see it&#39;s still apparently going strong..."</p>

Essentially, you need to write the code for a system of elevators to transport the maximum number of people in a given time.It&#39;s a problem I&#39;ve thought about every so often, but never bothered to look up how it was commonly implemented. For example, If you have a large building with multiple elevators, is there an optimal way to arrange the elevators while they&#39;re idle to minimize transport time? Or what about accounting for time of day? (e.g. stacking the elevators on the bottom floor in the morning as people arrive at the office). Or what advantages do you gain mathematically from having Up/Down buttons vs. the touchpads where people select the exact floor? Seems like an interesting problem if you work on elevators installed in tall office buildings."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Excited to show off something that we&#39;ve been working on: the Bitcoin Note. The Bitcoin Note is a cash instrument that is backed by Bitcoin via multisig. Each note is printed with beautiful, currency-grade elements that use secure printing techniques typically reserved for government documents like microtext, raised print and foil. More importantly, each note includes a secure NFC chip which is where a multisig lives that allows you to claim the Bitcoin at any time.We were heavily inspired by OG Bitcoin physical money like Casascius coins, however, we wanted to created a design whereby (1) anyone can spend, gift and share the Bitcoin for years to come without having to worry a sophisticated attacker who extracts a private key from under a label or scratch off and (2) trust was minimized on that part of the printer (us).This lead us to the design we landed on for the Bitcoin Note1) An NFC chip readable by nearly all modern smartphones2) A two part multisig where (1) we write an encrypted private key to the note (and don&#39;t keep a copy and (2) you write a user key to the note in plaintext and then load the note3) We only release the decryption key when someone cuts the note and reports this via an authenticated and encrypted way to our server4) The multisig reverts to only your key after a printed expiration date on the note5) You can re-key the user key on the note you receive if you want to hold it for a long timeWe believe that the result of this design achieves the goal of Bitcoin that&#39;s incredibly easy to use - like cash - but still preserves the important quality of self-custody. Take a look at http://bitcoinnote.com/ to learn more and reserve a spot in line for our release later this summer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Am I missing something about how cutting notes works, or am I correct in saying that cutting notes relies on a centralized single-company-controlled server being both online and releasing a decryption key?This entire release seems a little bit light on technical details so it&#39;s not clear to me exactly what notes are doing when they&#39;re transferred, but it does seem like on first glance there are a lot of red flags here. I would love to see a more detailed technical breakdown on that website that isn&#39;t just promotional material.----Even ignoring the centralization angle, all of the verification advice I&#39;m seeing boils down to &#34;scan each note and cut it when you receive it.&#34; And if everyone is going to do that, what&#39;s the point of using a physical note instead of an app? The promo images and descriptions clearly expect that this is going to be used like cash so that technical burdens are lessened for people who aren&#39;t good with more traditional cryptocurrency transaction methods.But if non-technical users use it like cash, they&#39;re not going to scan anything. And if you think you can teach them to scan every bill in their wallet with a phone, then... why not just teach them to use the phone?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So, it&#39;s paper money, but one that won&#39;t survive heat or strong electrical fields, and that you need to use with your phone. And will lose all value if the central repository goes under. And is not recyclable or efficiently burnable.Top work everyone, nailed it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Instead of the above syntax combining Markdown and JSON, I could use a Unicode private use area to define bytes that mean “line,” “circle” and so on.That would not be a good idea because of contention, as you may wish to use those code points for their meaning in some icon font.You’d be better to use HTML elements, which is the proper way of embedding such stuff in Markdown. (Look, even hijacking code blocks as an extension mechanism is a controversial technique.) And then SVG, or at least a subset of it, becomes an obviously excellent solution; the {&#34;p2&#34;:{&#34;x&#34;:141,&#34;y&#34;:85},&#34;mode&#34;:&#34;line&#34;,&#34;p1&#34;:{&#34;x&#34;:34,&#34;y&#34;:44}} example becomes:  &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 200 100&#34;&gt;

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The truth I had to unlearn is that coding is a solitary activity, and that coding is the most important part of a senior software engineer’s job. Now I rarely have the chance to code for a few hours straight because if I have enough information to write code then all that’s left is the easy part. The hard part is coordinating, defining the problem, planning for the future, and communicating the current status of the problem. Not to mention onboarding newer devs who haven’t learned the technologies yet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For me, it was that I thought that being a good programmer was that I write clean code with enough abstraction and indirection to make it future proof.Boy I was wrong. Unless you’re doing the same thing you’ve done for years, you can’t tell the future. And just when your unnecessary abstraction is wrong, this the reason why we’re talking about tech debt in the first place. Because nobody wants to touch it.Unfortunately, I didn’t have anyone to tell me this for the longest time. It wasn’t until I had to fix a bug for something I wrote in the past, and I couldn’t figure out just what I wrote.Now I try to write dumb and simple (yet sensible) code until there’s a good reason for abstractions. I have nothing to prove at this point in my career."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Things like indendetation, formatting, naming – god forbid you did it differently than I would have.I agree with chilling out about this when it&#39;s a human making the changes...except now that we have autoformatters we can actually be more pedantic about this than ever before :) If the autoformatter doesn&#39;t agree with what you wrote, bam, red CI.&gt; Everyone writes testsA big thing I&#39;ve learned over the years is that making your code testable often takes more foresight and experience than actually writing the tests. &#34;What&#39;s the right way to test this?&#34; becomes an important question when starting something new. And &#34;Can we make it easier to test this?&#34; becomes an important question when inheriting something."</p>

Even things that usually are not displayed in this fashion.When it comes to prime numbers, it always irked me, that one cannot easily look at them in a visual way. I always thought that they would probably look beautiful.One day, I had the idea to counter this by visualizing prime numbers in the complex plane. I then wrote a little script to colorize each number in the complex plane by how &#34;prime&#34; it is. And indeed, the result looks beautiful:https://www.gibney.org/does_anybody_know_this_fractalThen I went back to do more mundane things with x/y charts.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"To those interested in the blackbird, the museum of flight had a series of panels on their youtube channel, including actuals sr71 pilots and mechanics [1]Lots of more minor annecdotes (including a brown pants one). One thing I learned is that the idea that the sr71 flew faster than anti-air missiles is a misconception. But the missiles at the time couldn&#39;t be reprogrammed once launched, so what made it safe is that because the sr71 flies so fast and so high, between the time the missile is launched and the time the missile reaches the expected sr71 position and altitude, the sr71 will have had time to change course and be far away.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbuOD6bgPc4https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1uq-qOzf5ohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54FEBBPCZ-Yhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiX_JPuir0"</p>

For me I just always go to myservice.mydomain.com directly.

Of the above, I like heimdall the best for its cleanliness and simplicity, but its hardly customizable.I think we&#39;d be much better served by a really well thought-out framework for self-hosted/homelab dashboards with excellent API documentation that has pluggable modules for things like authentication, data sources (e.g. docker, db, config file, service APIs), and the front end. This would allow people to easily build the dashboard with the features they want, and make it even easier for people to contribute a variety of &#34;themes&#34; for endless customization of how things are displayed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Does anybody know of something similar, but written in a more elaborate book-like fashion?It&#39;s not about format, of course, it&#39;s just that all these model-zoo&#39;s are only half of the story — not useless, but rather incomplete. That is, if you learn a lot of them, one day you might remember something and find it useful — or you might not. This is a bit abstract, but I want to say you rarely ever need any special tools of thinking (or maybe even tools in general) — you want a technology. That is, a relatively broad (but precisely defined) instruction of how to identify and approach a set of problems in some domain. I.e., it is more about when to use a tool or technique, rather than being a exhibition of such tools. I mean, there is important difference — that&#39;s kinda the difference between going to college and going to a museum.For example, GTD is a technology (doesn&#39;t matter good or bad). It tells you when to use tools/techniques suggested (and a better book would have more showcases and exercises to internalize the idea, IMO). This site or coursera&#39;s famous &#34;Models Thinking&#34; course — aren&#39;t."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think it is telling that most of the tools on this website (and in similar collections I have seen) are diagrammatic in nature. Diagrams might have been the most important “tools for thought” since our ancestors invented lists, tables, calendars and maps, long before recent note-taking app startups used this expression for their marketing purposes (which is absolutely fair and I am always happy to see when thinking tools become more popular outside of business/science contexts).I think it has something to do with how intertwined structure is with diagrammatic representation. Models as well as systems are all about structure, which is why you often see them represented in diagrams (and if you don’t, you may still think about them in diagrammatic terms). And yet, historically diagrams have often been neglected in science until very recently.I believe digital tools are still missing a lot of their potential as thinking tools because of how text-centric they are. I don’t suggest that it could have been different, given technical constraints and demands, but maybe computers would aid our thinking much more if they would actually allow us to more freely and intelligently draw diagrams. Ivan Sutherlands Sketchpad was a great step in that direction (I am sure most of you have seen it: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketchpad) and more recently the work of Bret Victor (http://worrydream.com/MediaForThinkingTheUnthinkable/). But in many regards I believe that paper is still superior to what we have done so far."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s even more frustrating, because the game is good. I really enjoyed playing the first 30 levels or so. Good story, good controls, very satisfying gameplay. If I could pay $60 and just have a &#34;classic&#34; Diablo on my phone, I might. But I won&#39;t spend a cent on consumable in-app purchases.It is so sad that &#34;make good game, sell it&#34; model no longer works. It&#39;s all a wonky curve of &#34;free - couple of dollars - hundreds and thousands of dollars&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The thing is - is it necessary to have the best gear to enjoy the game?As a different example - I&#39;m sure it would cost tens of thousands of dollars to max out your characters and gear in Genshin Impact, but I&#39;ve played very enjoyable 100h+ and it&#39;s perfectly fine even if you don&#39;t have the max ascended characters and gear, I have a feeling those are there basically for the wales to spend money on but aren&#39;t necessary for gameplay in any way(well maybe for some crazy hardcore end game content, but as always, that seems to be something 0.0001% of the playerbase enjoys).My point is - the game can still be enjoyable and worth playing even if you can&#39;t get the endgame gear. Is that the case here? I don&#39;t know."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve watched a lot of discussions about this from twitch streamers and I&#39;m not sure where I stand.. On the one hand I&#39;m amazed at how good this game looks on mobile and if you&#39;re just the type to casually play a game not really caring about being the best at it you could have fun playing it for free or for very cheap. On the other hand this game is clearly exploitative and while other games like Hearthstone or Clash Royale have similar pay to win mechanics they also have ways for you to enjoy the game competitively without spending a whole lot of money.I know some countries banned games like this but I wonder, if these games get banned why not ban casinos too?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"My dad was fortunate enough to get into a trial at Sloan for Obinutuzumab for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.  At the moment, after 6 weeks of treatment, the percent of cancerous cells in his bone marrow has gone from 95% to 5%.  The treatment was very intense as it overloads the kidneys on the first few treatments due to the dramatic amount of cells being flushed out.  This is a cancer for which there was not much treatment previously other than extreme chemotherapy which still left little hope for complete remission.   A family friend was also treated for Non-Hodgkins&#39; lymphoma on another drug trial and she&#39;s now in full remission.my uninformed impression is that there&#39;s a lot of new cancer treatments happening now that can turn the tide for a lot of types of cancer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"IMHO, this was not cheating. This is a phenomenon called success.  If you are fortunate (?) to be around in the entrepreneurial world long enough, you will realize that intelligence, hard work, good time management etc are not adequate.  They just qualify as deserving.  There are serendipities that separate those who succeed from everybody else who was deserving. Survivor bias [1]. Calling Eli was your serendipity.  The opposite is also true:  killer asteroids hit the planets of otherwise deserving individuals and initiatives.  I was co-founder of a municipal fiber-to-the-home initiative in 1996.  We had both a winning technical recipe and also a financial engineering recipe. (Extremely rare even today)  We were then fortunate enough to acquire a customer that was a newly minted public company, representing a whopping 65% of our business.  Banker&#39;s dream, but in actuality a big mistake.  Then the double-whammy of fraud by that public company (wiping it out completely before our contract was realized) AND the dot-com crash.  Killer asteroids are real.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Qd3erAPI9w"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One time a company I interviewed with asked me obscure algorithm questions about playing card shuffling. As a former professional magician I knew the optimal answers instantly and could jot them down straight away. They had allocated an hour for answers I wrote in a few minutes. I could have told them I had a massively unfair advantage, but I did not bother.They were visibly impressed and told me I was moving on to the final interview stage right away. I declined, as I hate companies that select for algorithm puzzle skill instead of real world problem solving experience."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I actually cheated on an online assessment for one of my first programming jobs. It was my dream job and really wanted to get into that company. Under the pressure, I just couldn&#39;t figure out the solution to the last challenge which was a recursive algorithm. Normally, I would be able to do this but I just got stuck and in a moment of panic, I StackOverflow&#39;d the question on a secondary device which provided me the exact answer. I typed it in with my own style and submitted the assessment.I got the job, stayed at the company for 4 years with great performance reviews and it shaped my experience as the programmer I am today. I couldn&#39;t imagine where I would be without the experience I gained there."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My rule is: if I get a single notification that I find useless, I&#39;ll immediately disable that notification channel (I&#39;m on Android; I&#39;m not sure if iOS has a concept of channel-specific settings) for that app. Even if the channel can include useful notifications, as the article discusses.If the app doesn&#39;t bother to categorize its notifications into channels at all, I turn off its notifications entirely, and I won&#39;t turn it back on.If something is important enough, I can always manually check on it. My attention is too valuable to me to waste it on useless notifications.I do want more control over my notifications in general. I use Google Apps Script to automatically process/triage my email, and I want to do something similar with notifications. I can probably do so using Tasker, but I haven&#39;t gotten around to it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve noticed this in social networks as well. If you don&#39;t get enough transactional notifications for a while they start making up fake ones like Twitter&#39;s &#34;in case you missed this Tweet&#34;, Facebook&#39;s &#34;[someone] posted for the first time in a while&#34;, all the while lighting up the notifications badge. Leads to a &#34;boy who cried wolf&#34; scenario in which I stop trusting notifications entirely and just ignore them, possibly missing out on actual useful ones.I really wish companies let us turn this kind of thing off, or better yet stopped trying to boost &#34;engagement&#34; numbers by violating your user&#39;s trust."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a pretty good idea on how to fix this (and many similar) problems: &#34;hibernate app&#34; option. Its a new app state where app icon icon has some mark (like being semi-grayed out) and all the background app services are disabled (tracking, promotional popups, periodic wakeups, etc...). The app is only un-hibernated if user explicitly clicks on it, it cannot do it by itself. The app can be hibernated by long-press menu on app icon or notification.So the first time you get an ad notify, you click &#34;hibernate&#34; and you are good. And if it is time to make another order, app is woken up, so you cannot miss notifications by accident.Sure, it is not as good as having separate &#34;show ads&#34; toggle, but it requires no cooperation from app whatsoever,"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I believe submission title is inaccurate:&gt; This study shows that various mafic rock glasses almost certainly present on the surface of the Hadean Earth catalyze the formation of polyribonucleic acid in water starting from nucleoside triphosphates.&gt; Thus, the prebiotic relevance of this result very much depends on whether nucleoside triphosphates were present to Hadean impact fields.In other words, RNA spontaneously forms on basalt lava glass in the presence of nucleoside triphosphates. These are compounds for which there is no known prebiologic formation process - we only know of nucleoside triphosphates as compounds created by living organisms.Disclaimer: I am not an expert in this area, I just read the article."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the whole RNA thing is a bit over hyped. People like RNA because it looks somewhat like computer code, and our technology is just smitten with computers, these recent decades. And right along with that, it makes for such a painfully obvious way to implement inheritance and natural selection, a way to make genes.But I think our focus is too narrow, we should think bigger than just obvious solutions. Now, it&#39;s great if the early oceans were awash with RNA, but does RNA exploit energy gradients on its own? The idea of all this random RNA just sloshing around, using nothing more than entropy, behaving as genes and inventing all the rest of it, just seems a little cart-before-the-horse.What about metabolism-first? Is fire alive? It has many properties of life but, critically, lacks self regulation and heritability. Burns everything and goes out. Imagine though, a system of enzymes that can assimilate various specific kinds of molecules, and sustain production of those enzymes. Imagine this contained, compartmentalized in some way. Dynamically not much more complicated than simple fire, but crucially, the enzymes can be said to be inherited. These are not &#39;genes&#39; as such, these are the actual machinery. It should be possible for natural selection to act on &#39;life&#39; no more complicated than that. And that kind of system could then take find uses for RNA.(And yes, the enzymes I refer to could be realized as RNA, but acting as the enzymes directly, not merely describing them, and this would confer some major benefits)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a very interesting result. Does anyone know how likely ribonucleoside triphosphates are to be formed in young earth conditions? What is the state of the research on this topic?It seems like this is a pre-print but if it stands up to peer review this would appear to be a big step forward in our understanding of abiogenesis, and would seem to be good evidence for the RNA world hypothesis.I always kind of hoped abiogenesis happened multiple times on multiple worlds, rather than once and then spread through panspermia. This result seems to indicate it could have happened here."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;d appreciate it if they could be more upfront about their language support and what this even does for me. Right now this is: &#34;A better gRPC for Go&#34;. And I don&#39;t know what&#39;s better about it without doing much more research. Apparently proto3 has support for json encoding by default. So they somehow give me a better schema validation. That&#39;s their claim but I don&#39;t see how exactly they do that without going much deeper into it. Meanwhile .proto files are obviously already a schema, so they might be parsing your golang server code to see if it still matches your .proto file. That sounds very brittle to me if true. 
I&#39;m not convinced at all from this post and I don&#39;t see how this works."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Rather than using the Go standard library&#39;s net/http, grpc-go uses its own implementation of HTTP/2. It&#39;s incompatible with the rest of Go&#39;s HTTP ecosystem, so you can&#39;t cleanly serve gRPC requests alongside other HTTP traffic and can&#39;t use most third-party packages.Mostly because grpc-go&#39;s implementation is about 5-10x faster than net/http."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; We&#39;ve got big plans for the Connect ecosystem! Along with Connect in Go, we&#39;ve been working on a TypeScript implementation for browsers. It shares the same design priorities: it&#39;s idiomatic TypeScript all the way down, stays close to the browser&#39;s fetch API, fits neatly into React hooks, and supports both gRPC-Web and Connect&#39;s own protocol. It also produces tiny bundles. We&#39;ve already replaced grpc-web in the Buf Schema Registry frontend, and we&#39;re planning to release connect-web soon — stay tuned.i belive this will be huge. biggest blocker for grpc adoption is the really poor js and grpc-web implementations."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a big frustration of mine, too. The other is that Spotify is extremely biased towards playlist listening and makes browsing and listening to a library of albums really painful.The good news is that Spotify&#39;s SDK and API are actually powerful enough that you can build up an entire alternative interface, which is actually what I recently started doing: https://i.imgur.com/ar7VrYy.png.It&#39;s still work in progress but actually works perfectly well already. It&#39;s not ready for public use yet and also isn&#39;t open source yet though. If you want to follow development I guess the best place to do that is my twitter: https://twitter.com/tom_j_watson."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I use Winamp for my MP3 collection that I downloaded of my T1 line at the office.When I turn that mother up on and my CRT monitor starts smoking because of the Winamp addons that spikes all kinds of shit whenever the tune is changing, then I know I have found the right track.Then I get cracking on the floor. Break dancing and caps flying around. The neighbors come jumping in the door and starts clapping and the music just keeps going.Everybody can understand a list of songs, even my grandma who&#39;s pushing 84. So we battle out songs on each of ours computers, but we don&#39;t use Spotify any more."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Spotify&#39;s UI is a case study of the negative impact of assigning single screens to single teams, designers and managers. There is no cohesive vision. The useful functionality is all obscured by esthetics. I am perpetually annoyed at how poor spotify is at it&#39;s basic purpose. They have leaned way too far into recommendation systems and over designed layout. 99% of the time, I know what I want to listen to. Spotify&#39;s UX is designed for people to &#39;browse&#39; the app. That doesnt resonate with me, at all. I know what I want.My biggest gripe with spotify is it&#39;s inability to reliably answer the question of &#34;what playlist or source am I currently listening too?&#34;. A constant flow that spotify fails to deliver on is this: Search for a song, play the song, then the rest of the album, on repeat, without shuffle. It&#39;s annoying to have to load multiple slow UIs to navigate from search to album, visually search the album&#39;s track list and play the song your after.Itunes and Windows Media Player set the standard for how media should be navigated and Spotify should use some of those old standard concepts.EDIT:Try browsing Armin Van Buuren&#39;s massive discography on Spotify."</p>

Can I let a process run under rr for days, wait until it crashes to due a heisenbug, and replay the trace without rr having to go through days of recording? i.e. is it possible to fast forward the trace, somehow?(I nerd sniped myself a bit here, wondering how fast forwarding could be implemented. I think it might be achievable with periodic process memory snapshots and incremental traces.)"</p>

The paper also very explicitly says that the lookup tables can be instead replaced by the AVX512 compress instructions.

But there&#39;s never been a clear instruction set to use on Intel / AMD for sorting 64-bit ints that&#39;s reliably fast.

Just a tip to everyone job hunting I guess. Watch what executives do (not what they say). Well, and human history of speculative bubbles.I didn&#39;t think it was a coincidence Coinbase did a direct listing rather than an IPO, since an IPO has a waiting period for insiders to sell.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Losing confidence? No, I lost that years ago. For quite some time the vast majority of the listings have been drop-shipped AliExpress garbage. Many of them are obvious because of terrible photoshops, randomly named branding, and those strange bold brackets in the product description.But some can be harder to spot because of tricks that sellers use to essentially hijack listings for other products to carry all the positive reviews along. Or they may just go the route of putting completely fake reviews on the product. Some may even be from verified purchasers because they packed a card along with the product offering compensation for a 5 star review. Or they can get verified reviews in an even slimier way involving ordering from themselves and then shipping random crap to people who&#39;ve they&#39;ve sent stuff to before.And then there&#39;s the inventory that&#39;s poisoned with counterfeits. Thanks to inventory co-mingling counterfeit and legit products can end up getting mixed together. There&#39;s a chance that even buying from a fully legit listing will end up with you getting sent a counterfeit product.However, despite all of that I do still use Amazon. Their immense investment into logistics means that many things will make it to me next-day. And their return policies allow me to order with the confidence that if I get a fraudulent item (or just something I don&#39;t like) it will be fairly painless to get a replacement or my money back.That said, I have also been making more efforts over the years to not use Amazon. I tend to buy all my major electronics from Best Buy or direct from the manufacturer. And I would never buy any food or medicine from Amazon. I don&#39;t want to risk things that go into me being counterfeit."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A seller offered me a gift certificate if I left a 5 star review.  Basically a little note in the box saying if I left a 5 star review, took a screenshot &amp; sent it to their email address, they&#39;d send me the gift certificate.It was not a 5 star product.  It was a 2 star product, at best.I tried to mention the fact they were paying for reviews in my review (to explain the other 5 stars).Amazon rejected my review.It&#39;s against Amazon policy to let others know that sellers are buying reviews."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like you&#39;re several years late to the party here. I think it&#39;s pretty common knowledge at this point that certain types of goods sold on Amazon have a huge chance of being counterfeit and everyone knows reviews are faked/not to be trusted blindly.At this point people seem to not care since Amazon will give a refund/exchange pretty much no questions asked. It&#39;s still extremely annoying and it&#39;s definitely not a good look for their business, but I assume the number crunchers have determined actually dealing with the fraud isn&#39;t yet worth it financially."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Seems like an innocent enough mistake. Remind me of when I once helped organize a volunteer hackathon with people from different companies. We created a Slack organization just for the occasion. At the end of the event, I was supposed to ask all attendees to delete all the data we had given them before they went home. The message I posted to #general (the channel everyone in a Slack organization is required to be in) with @everyone tagged was something to the effect of:&#34;Thank you everyone for contributing to our shared mission. When you are done with your work today, please delete all the data from your machines. Hope we see each other again soon!&#34;Slack gave me a dire warning that my message would send notifications to so many people across so many time zones. This didn&#39;t surprise me because attendees came from various countries for the event. So I dismissed it.But I had accidentally sent it to my company&#39;s Slack organization instead of the hackathon-specific one. I didn&#39;t realize it until a co-worker sent me a private message asking why I had just tried to fire everyone at our company."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The only notable thing here IMO is the lack of limits imposed by GitHub on notifications. Apparently a random tag of `@microsoft` in the comments was enough to notify 4000 people [1] as well.I have no idea why the user is even being mentioned in this headline. I haven&#39;t used GitHub in a while, and am unfamiliar with orgs and subgroups, but tagging a developer subgroup on a PR seems...a reasonable thing for a new contributor to do? How is it their fault that the developer subgroup has been hijacked by this organization to mean &#34;Anyone who has ever signed the Terms of Service To View Our Code&#34;?The correct thing for Epic Games to do here would be to rename the group to `@EpicGames/terms-of-service-signatories`, and restrict `@EpicGames/developers` to people who have requested access to open a PR. Assuming that people should magically know not to mention `@EpicGames/developers` in their PRs because Epic is doing some ToS shenanigans is preposterous.I guess I&#39;ll be looking carefully at mentions the next time I have to use this social network [2] masquerading poorly as a code review tool to submit a pull request.----------------------------------------[1] https://github.com/EpicGames/Signup/pull/24#issuecomment-114...[2] Looking at the profile of the contributor making the PR tells me that GitHub has apparently decided to let their users independently rediscover the experience of SuperWall on Facebook circa 2007."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Innocent mistake.The kid is barely 18. The emotion and stress resulting from mistakenly sending a notification to 400,000 is likely overwhelming. Now his real name is going to stay at the center of the internet for a while thanks to being 1st on HN. I would definitely not have coped well with that much internet attention at his age. Some Github replies are more immature than the initial action and I hope he does not receive any threat.I hope the Epic developers reach out to him nicely with constructive feedback and maybe a thanks for his well-meaning PR."</p>

It&#39;s such a pain listening to classical music when the composer and the performer and section are not visible without playing it and waiting for the line to scroll, like wtf."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve never seen a search box that couldn&#39;t actually handle input before, but Apple Music made it.If I click in the search box and start typing, the box will lose focus at some random time and all my next keystrokes will count as play commands, usually pausing the music. If I come back to the search box, it happens again.I know &#34;text boxes&#34; are cutting-edge technology that&#39;s barely 3 seconds old and developers are still learning to program them safely. Still, I expected more from a trillion-dollar company."</p>

Streaming needs to be much more lucrative for artists and consumer choice helps that.It is nice to be able to buy the music as well if you want to support. Being part of Apple One is huge as well.The latest music streaming royalty rates are as follows.    PLATFORM     ROYALTY (PER STREAM) STREAMS TO MAKE $1

I have lots of mp3/stored music as well and Spotify client started taking like 20-30 minutes to start up. Wasn&#39;t sure what it was doing...Some of their patents for tracking are a bit dystopian as well.New Spotify Patent Involves Monitoring Users’ Speech to Recommend Music&gt; The streaming platform is interested in extracting data points like emotional state, gender, age, and accent to hone its recommendations [2].Nah. Apple already has my info and reasonably treats it well eventhough it is too much, I don&#39;t need another service to invade privacy.[1] https://producerhive.com/music-marketing-tips/streaming-roya...[2] https://pitchfork.com/news/new-spotify-patent-involves-monit..."</p>

Any email sent to the address went to the corresponding @mit.edu email address. You could email professor_alice@alqaeda.net, and it&#39;d arrive at professor_alice@mit.edu.Undergrads sent emails like that for the lols. Recipients got freaked out they&#39;d end up on some government watch list."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is true of crypto wallets and NFTs as well. More than one project has attempted to send NFTs or assets to high profile wallets (ex: trillions of dog-coins sent to Vitalik&#39;s wallet that he ultimately donated to get rid of but not before drawing the intended media attention[1]) and the whole concept of airdrops is based around the idea of permissionless receiving.Unfortunately, re: swatting via an non-tech-savy LEA and domain registrars: you could likely just update the contact details on a domain you own to the intended target and that&#39;d probably be enough.[1] https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/20/vitalik-buterin-..."</p>

Some years ago, I remember opening one up with a friend. There were no actual ants included in the box. Instead, there was a card that you filled in with your address, and the company would mail you some ants. My friend expressed surprise that you could get ants sent to you in the mail.I replied: “What’s really interesting is that these people will send a tube of live ants to anyone you tell them to.”&#39;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This protocol has some downsides - if you share the link with large adversarial group (e.g. your school) they can brute force your crush name and it’s basically no different then embarrassingly shouting out your crush name in public and it has problems with canonical names.Instead we can alter it and fix this problems:
Bob will find out his crush’s public key, encrypt &#34;you are my crush&#34; message to it and post it with his own signature to public bulletin (blockchain can be good shelling point). When crush decrypts message they will see proper string, while everyone else will see gibberish.- to solve problems with key distribution we can use &#34;identity based encryption&#34;. it requires trusted third party (e.g. school administrators) but it solves problem for key generation of participants. With identity encryption bob can encrypt message to some canonical identity such as school email. Owner of that email can prove it’s identity to the third party and receive corresponding private key."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One should be aware that Norway already has very comprehensive registers and databases about the population. Currently, it has only been a benefit, I think, as it enables detailed quality control of say health care services and high-quality register studies.For example, all health/hospital records of deceased Norwegians are digitalized ten years after death and added to a national register. No way to refuse. In my opinion, that is much more invasive, yet it hasn&#39;t been discussed at all by the publichttps://helsedata.no/en/about-helsedata.no/https://www.digitalarkivet.no/en/"</p>
