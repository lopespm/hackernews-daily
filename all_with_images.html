								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Perhaps the main issue is that the guy has a point, nobody want’s to see an uncle.The majority of “influencers” are young women, and only a minority would want to follow a 50 year old uncle. I don’t think there’s much we can do about it, it’s human nature. It does however limit the diversity and world views people are exposed to and sometimes it’s nice to see the world through the eyes of a 50 year Japanese biker."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What really worries me about the DeepFakes stuff is not so much the fakes -- I&#39;m worried about that, but that&#39;s been written about to death -- but that now it adds plausible deniability to anyone caught on camera doing anything.If we had video footage of, say, a politician doing something clearly illegal on camera, then it&#39;s simply the word of the politician against the word of the source -- the latter of whom may need to remain anonymous.That said... the other way around is still the more dangerous, I guess. If, say, a US adversary creates a great-looking video of the US president doing/saying something really heinous, that has the potential to inflame the world long before the truth can get its boots on."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Perhaps the most interesting consequence of this game design is that you can edit the past, changing a single decision while leaving your other choices in place.For example, it&#39;s possible to go back to the beginning of the input box and edit your character selection while keeping the rest of your gameplay in place.Seems like this could have a lot of potential as a puzzle game mechanic."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Somewhat related, I got a new computer this week, and had to boot into windows so I could partition the HD to install linux. This was the first time in 15 years I have booted into a brand new &#34;consumer&#34; windows install (it was windows 10 pro). The &#34;setup&#34; was basically just 10 minutes of them asking in different ways if they could collect my personal data, track my location, send back telemetry etc. Office 365 is the same. I find some new thing every day that I have to opt out of to prevent them stealing my and my business data. Its like they have given up on trying to improve their products (which are basically stable) and shifted into finding more ways to steal data. As much as I dislike google for this, I realize I&#39;m the product there, with Microsoft I thought I was paying to get business tools, not to be spied on. (To be fair, I then installed ubuntu which also wanted to send my data back to canonical)Another example, I bought a car recently that defaults to stealing my personal information and sending it to the manufacturer. I had to call, and provide more information to them, to opt out (and I can only assume they are still stealing information they have deemed critical in some way)Anyway, I&#39;m reminded of all of this because I think the obfuscated cookie consents are just one facet of how hostile consumer tech has become to users. Aided by complex and ambiguous regulations, companies are able to stay within the letter of the law while making it impossible to just be left alone with your purchase and not be tracked and marketed to.If there is a regulatory solution, it has to focus on clarity and spirit, not on just more rules. I&#39;m not aware of an example of something like this working elsewhere.One idea is a heavy tax on advertising. I&#39;ve argued before that there is a lot in common between environmental pollution and the effects of advertising on the public value of the internet, and I would say this extends to tech generally. Charge a 25-40% tax on ad revenue, and make it less economic for companies to pollute."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m reading the book The Divide at the moment. It makes the argument that it takes time and the right conditions to build up an industry - infrastructure needs to be built, education and a skilled labor pool with the necessary know-how as well. To begin with, a fledgling industry in a developing country cannot compete with those of already industrialized countries - these are already so effective that they can undercut newcomers before they have time to become competitive. So the book argues that when developing countries are pressured into free trade agreements (for example by making aid dependent on this), these countries are also forced into a position where they get stuck at the low end of the production value chain, selling raw materials, while buying processed goods from others (often the same role they were forcibly assigned when they were colonies). So much like we allow children time to learn in school before we expect them to compete in the job market, we should allow developing countries to employ protectionistic policies like tariffs, in order to protect and build up their fledgling industries nationally, before fully entering the world market in a couple decades when they are ready."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think it’s good to see raw producers start working up market to make their own chocolate. I think a Ghanaian chocolate brand actually owned by Ghanaians and made for export would market very well.It’s interesting to me how much tasty and interesting stuff in Africa has not been marketed internationally and there’s lots of room for them to grow and develop.For example, fonio [0], is a grain native to west Africa that I’ve never seen in the US but was eaten every day when I was there, as common as rice. It’s gluten-free and could be the next quinoa and a great opportunity to develop a new brand and export finished products rather than just commodities.One of the big opportunities of all this digitization, I think, is that it’s now easier for remote locations to get more value out of their commodities than just exporting raw and having someone else add most of the value.I’m surprised the Swiss aren’t trying to do more joint ventures to develop chocolate making capabilities in Ghana."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really hope Ivory Coast will join Ghana on this, as they did for the LID bonus case. Together they account for over 2/3 of cocoa production. So, they can pretty much reshape the cocoa/chocolate market and break out of colonialistic trade agreements for the benefit of their people."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wish Apple would give Docker some love like Microsoft does. Using Docker with WSL is a breeze, and it runs so much better than MacOS.
And as an advantage you get access to Linux package managers which are so much better than brew. Brew is good, but Linux package managers like pacman and apt are so much better. Having a proper Linux distribution open in one window while I play &#39;Call of Duty&#39; in another, is one reason why I&#39;ve moved to Windows again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love Docker, but I gave up on using it on Mac. I put a lot of effort into fighting it, but ultimately, it seems some of the issues are just too fundamental. I like to call the Docker-for-Mac experience the MacBook Airplane. At some point, your fans will start spinning, your productivity will crash, and you&#39;ll spend the next three hours sifting through open GitHub issues from 2017 where everyone is still complaining about the same problems.I&#39;m all in on VSCode Remote SSH development now. It works extremely well, I barely even notice I&#39;m not programming on my own computer, and my laptop no longer sounds like a passenger jet taking off. It was very easy to setup. Our stack is still very Docker heavy, but using the containers on a remote machine makes it much more tolerable to work with."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Some container disk I/O is much slower than expected. See docker/for-mac#5389. Disk flushes are particularly slow due to the need to guarantee data is written to stable storage on the host.Huh. This could be problematic given that Docker disk performance on macOS was already dreadful on intel machines. I would love to see Apple give this some attention."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am self taught, I worked as a lawyer for six years and four of those were spent prepping for a career change - self-teaching comp sci and software dev in the evenings, then working as a volunteer a few years in. (I come from an engineering family and should have just done it from the start, but oh well.)I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s still on the platform, but about a year into my self studying I took a series of courses on edX that used this system. I think it was called Systematic Program Design, but I could be misremembering. Anyways, the courses were incredible. I completely credit them with beginning to turn me from a coder into a software dev. The system they provide just locked into my brain like it had always been there.I almost didn&#39;t take it because it used Racket, and I questioned its general applicability for that reason. I&#39;m so glad I pushed those concerns aside, because in addition to introducing me to software design principles, it introduced me to Lisp in a way that also completely changed my thinking about what programming itself could be.I&#39;ve now been a paid dev for 2.5 years. I don&#39;t really explicitly use the system from the course in my daily work, but the knowledge contained within it has molded my entire understanding of the field.The course literally changed my life."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My undergrad intro class used this. At the time I found it patronizing and silly and artificially limiting, having coded before (the design recipe, the different &#34;levels&#34; of scheme).But I saw some of the wisdom in the approach when I later tutored the class. People would try to rush into coding problems without doing real analysis of what the cases would be, and had a foggy notion of different parts of program having a &#34;contract&#34;. HTDP and the design recipe makes that muscle memory for beginners which is pretty nifty."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My uncle spent some time in prison in the late 80&#39;s and early 90&#39;s and was able to learn FoxPro while there.  In addition to it being hard to find work having a criminal record, by the time he got out, everybody was transitioning away from FoxPro.As is too often the case, the lure of money from selling drugs combined with not being able to find work meant he returned to prison.  He got out again in the early-mid 2000&#39;s and this time around, there were no courses offered for study.  When he got out that time, he didn&#39;t even know how to use the TV remote.One day, history will look back on how we treat our prisoners with immense shame.  Instead of trying to rehabilitate them, we leave them to rot, and politicians never shy away from an opportunity to make the lives of prisoners more miserable, lest they risk being called &#34;soft&#34; on crime."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really think the point is not how long it might take someone to learn how to use tools, but the impacts of prison. I work with these folks through my company to help them become employed upon release.A few things, it is astounding but believable that when people are released they enter a world that is entirely unknown to them. Not only technology but their relationships and neighborhoods are completely different.In addition,They have no reliable way of getting back on their feet. They usually have zero money, no housing and no job - and there is why you have high recidivism rates. Not only that, but no one wants to hire justice involved individuals, even though significant tax credits are available for doing so - Walmart for example, takes extreme advantage of these.The training programs in prisons will train someone up to a certification, but fall short of letting them get that certification. People have completed their GED maybe 5 times inside serving sentences at different times because doing so can reduce their sentence, it doesn’t help them in any other way.Without the ability to access training for in demand skills, many of these individuals get temp service jobs as flagged for construction for example. Doesn’t make sense to me that we want to rehab people yet minimal opportunities inside are provided to break the cycle.Realize this. People serve a sent and then they are eligible for parole. Many people opt to serve their parole inside, rather than outside. I’ve been told they feel it is easier inside than out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m sure many people here have experienced frustration helping older relatives or friends use computers.  Recently though, I realized, that computers are just way too hard to use.In our pursuit to avoid cryptic black screens with command prompts, a user must now understand that their computer has Windows with all of its menus and functions, a browser window with all of its menus and functions, running a webapp, with all of its menus and functions.  Whenever functionality bleeds into other layers (&#34;how do I print this pdf file&#34;), it is a huge hassle trying to explain &#34;oh, it&#39;s not that print button, its this other print button&#34;.It makes me sad to think that people prefer their &#34;appliance computers&#34; (phones, tablets, chromebooks) over real computers, but I can hardly blame them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have not significantly used Notion, but this isn&#39;t really a replacement for it is it?Notion seems to be focused on wiki and notes, with built in structured data allowing you to setup things like boards and task lists.This seems to just be the boards and task lists without the free form notes and wiki? It pretty clearly replaces Trello and Asana. Notion seems like a stretch from the 5 minutes I poked around in it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just downloaded and tested the standalone desktop app. It has a very pretty and responsive interface compared to Kanboard.I have been self hosting Kanboard on my rpi for my own work, and I think that Kanboard still has many &#39;poweruser&#39; features that Focalboard is missing.If there is an easy way for me to migrate my Kanboard data over to Focalboard, I would definitely give it a shot as a daily driver."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wonder if they have any sales to large enterprises or similar institutions.In my experience, the larger organizations will have a &#34;security&#34; questionnaire required of their vendors, and the person administering it is a droid, incapable of evaluating whether the questions, originally written in the mid-00s and only updated for buzzword compliance since, are applicable to modern security practice today, or to the particular product/service/vendor in question. And no firewalls or routers would be massive, disqualifying red flags on such a questionnaire.Never mind that a KISS setup tends to bring security because of its minimized attack surface. In the minds that write and administer those questionnaires, security only comes from sufficient amounts of the right kinds of complexity.I&#39;m sure it can be done. IIRC, Cloudflare doesn&#39;t use any firewalls, and they do some big business. It just isn&#39;t easy to get past the droids programmed to ensure that all pegs shall be properly square, IME."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice article. rsync.net is one part of my personal computing setup that I never even think twice about. It&#39;s simple and it works, and that clearly applies to the infrastructure too. I use ZFS locally and it has made managing my own data strangely pleasing, and it&#39;s nice to have the same system on my off-site storage too.On the laptop-front, I find myself drifting towards a similar setup to John. I have a hefty workstation laptop but the battery life is dire and it weighs a ton, so I pretty much just run it as a headless machine next to my server now. I&#39;m planning on picking up a Pinebook Pro as an &#34;outdoors&#34; machine to just remote in. I also find myself extremely unwilling to arse about swapping multiple machines on my monitors so being able to keep my work machine separate and secure but operate it from my desktop is a nice compromise."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The idea was to create a tool to sort the named CSS colors in a way that it shows related colors together. So, next time I can&#39;t decide between a few CSS colors, I can just check them here side by side.I&#39;ve created this tool last summer, but I hadn&#39;t shared it here back then. It&#39;s a PWA that I made with pure JS."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is definitely a cool way of exploring CSS colors.But, serious question: does anyone actually use CSS colors except for a handful of the basics (&#34;red&#34;, &#34;blue&#34;) for prototyping/debugging?I mean, the idea of typing &#34;background-color: lightsalmon;&#34; just feels so bizarre to me.Whenever I&#39;ve needed to come up with colors from scratch, I&#39;ll just start with an intuitive best guess -- e.g. &#34;hsl(30, 80%, 50%)&#34; -- and then iterate a couple times till I get what I&#39;m looking for.It seems like even more effort to try to select colors from the CSS palette when it might turn out that there isn&#39;t even a satisfactory one. The CSS colors are still extremely limited. E.g. the distance between neighbors like &#34;dark cyan&#34; and &#34;darkslategray&#34; is huge."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good reminder that in CSS, darkgray is a light gray and gray is a dark gray. Also presumably up is down and wet is dry."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; While our log analysis, conducted from March 5 through March 8, confirmed that this was a rare issue, it could not rule out the possibility that a session had been incorrectly returned but then never used. This was not a risk we were willing to take, given the potential impact of even one of these incorrectly returned sessions being used.It is funny how they make it seem like they are super cautious. When in fact they had no other choice than do it when you rephrase the problem as &#34; there were maybe some people who got the admin right of the github account of some of our customers&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well that&#39;s embarrassing. Passing a mutable dictionary—containing callbacks that could be closed over heaven-even-knows-what, no less!—between threads? And it&#39;s re-used between requests?They are lucky this wasn&#39;t much, much worse.Why does the error reporting service need to call the web thread back anyway?Yet another case where immutable-everything would have prevented this hairball from accreting in the first place."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this issue is relevant for Python programmers as well. uwsgi for many years shipped a default allocation mode for the WSGI environment which just cleared it between requests. One had to switch over to `wsgi-env-behaviour=holy` to prevent it. Holy is now the default but many people still set it to cheap because that prevented some segfaults for a while in uWSGI."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a clever use of fuse/sshfs and chroots to allow you to run programs on remote computers. However, for many workloads, isn&#39;t the network I/O going to outweigh the benefits of remote CPU cycles?I really think this is a clever hack, but I&#39;m not sure how useful it is. Is it really good for the transcoding example? I could see that being good if the remote machine has a better GPU, but I&#39;m struggling to see how this could work for other use-cases. Maybe compiling (which was one of the main use-cases behind Sun&#39;s SGE)?I do most of my work on HPC clusters, so moving compute out to remote nodes is something I&#39;m very interested in... and I&#39;d love to learn more about what kinds of workflows the authors had in mind."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I tried an openMOSIX cluster back in the day when it was fashionable. Cluster-Knoppix could transform a bunch of old pc&#39;s in an instant SSI cluster with almost zero configuration needed. Though I know it is not the most efficient way, I miss the simplicity of it.A shell script that simply launches a new process on the most idle node of a network would be enough to get back some of that experience. Live migration would be even better, almost perfect for that. Hope some day I can easily build a bewolf cluster out of my ARM SBC&#39;s with an experience similar to the old days of Cluster-Knoppix."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"the problem with wanting to write biographies of failures is the same problem with publishing negative results in science: there are too many failures, and too many ways to fail. It&#39;s like entropy - there are so many ways to do something wrong that it&#39;s not very efficient to learn how to do something by enumerating all the ways you cannot do it. Much rarer is success, which is why it&#39;s more worth the time to study. Maybe this is a controversial opinion.Maybe adjacent failures are worth study - studies of people who very nearly succeeded compared to someone who did, where subtle differences ended up being significant. These kinds of things can create &#34;what to watch out for&#34; kinds of guides.In addition - what is failure? Was Nikola Tesla a failure? He died broke... but he still invented AC generators..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Henry Petroski has written several excellent essays and books about engineering failures, why it is inherent in engineering pursuits that there will be failures, why it is important to learn the right lessons from these failures, and why each new generation will forget past lessons.Start with: &#34;To Engineer Is Human: The Role of Failure in Successful Design&#34; (1985)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Amen! I&#39;ve found that 9 times out of 10 successful people follow the same advice and believe the same things as unsuccessful people (at least they SAY they do).

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Thank you for licensing this under a proper open source license. Out of curiosity, how would you feel about a company selling this as a service? It&#39;s obviously legal per the license, but I&#39;m wondering what your perspective is. If you encourage it, do you have any plans for how to ensure everybody are happy and turns a profit from it?I have grown cynical over the years with these kinds of open source challengers as it seems to be a playbook these days to bait and switch, going from a) freely license a competitor to b) build a large user base to c) switch license to consolidate power over the software, make money and slowly kill it.Of course what&#39;s once open source will always stay that way, but if you&#39;re large enough when you branch, your engineering resources alone might be enough to turn people off the OSS fork."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Love it. This (your commercial product) will go in an MVP I&#39;m building. I&#39;ve been using Intercom, which seems like the best option, but it&#39;s just so damn expensive for an MVP and that top tier price is not met by their medium tier product imo.tbh I&#39;d pay even for the first agent (perhaps a free trial would have sufficed), but the Hacker tier does make it a certainty I&#39;ll trial it.Something most tool providers don&#39;t seem to get is that when I&#39;m first building something I&#39;m extremely price sensitive, but once I&#39;ve got going I don&#39;t really care, like a tax if you take X% of my profit but you make my life easier and make it easier to grow that profit, who cares? That&#39;s fine compared to rinsing me when I&#39;m not making any revenue (as with intercom). And if your product is any good, there&#39;s no way I&#39;m going to switch once I get some traction,  as the cost of any tool is ~ zero compared to the cost of employees."</p>

I&#39;ve seen so many long iterations where people flail at a complex shell script for something like a cron job which was immediately flagged by shellcheck.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I want to share my own reactions to the name change since this is a really interesting topic. For context, I&#39;m an African American, so many of my ancestors were slaves.  - The first time it occurred to me that &#34;master&#34; in this context could offend anyone was when GitHub changed the name (and broke my workflow).
  - My immediate reaction was, &#34;this change is by white people for white people,&#34; where &#34;white&#34; means anyone who isn&#39;t black.
  - My next reaction was, &#34;they may be changing the name for the wrong reasons, but the change is brilliant.&#34;

Let me explain a little more. Whether motivated purely by virtue signaling or by more genuine intentions, changing the name doesn&#39;t fix any of the problems that black people face. The article explains this well.What&#39;s powerful about this name change is that it pushes us to alter a habit, in my case one embedded deeply in my fingers, something that I do every day without realizing that I&#39;m doing it. Thus it is a useful reminder of the implicit bias that contributes to the lack of diversity in tech. Never mind that the old name was harmless, the change brings repeated awareness to an important topic, and it reaches a the developer community in a targeted way.So, next time you are annoyed that you have to fix a script or you accidentally type master when you needed to type main, please just take a deep breath, change the name, and remember to reflect upon whether you have are subconscious habits or biases that work against diversity in tech."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very pleased that Audacity is still actively developed. I said it before but I think this can&#39;t be overstated:Audacity may had some quirks over the years but it&#39;s still one of the most (if not the most) accessible tool for audio editing by non-professionals with an adequate feature set. It&#39;s used by community radio stations all over the world since it&#39;s easy to teach and cross-platform while being free."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fantastic. Audacity keeps it simple and does it well, if there was ever a hall of fame of applications, Audacity deserves a spot. Heck, if I were to distribute any kind of &#34;creative suite&#34;, I would always include Audacity, no matter what operating system I was targeting. It is a near essential tool for working with audio, daily, or every now and then.The genius of the application is that it does not try to be more than a waveform editor. Oftentimes, no matter if you are new to audio production or a veteran audio technician, you just need to edit some sound, and Audacity lets you get it done in a easy enough way for newbies, and in a complex enough way for veterans.Maintainers of projects like these should carry themselves with pride. Projects that stand the test of time and continue to deliver exactly what you needed is what makes the IT-world go around."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m pretty sure all of the songs I recorded in high school are gone forever, since I only backed up the Audacity files and not the entire folder. Perhaps this is for the best, but either way I&#39;m glad future emo teens will have an easier time preserving their work."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well done! This looks impressive and really useful. I’ve been looking for a lightweight sprite / spark lib for a while. Clients always, for some reason, are very impressed by little charts in a table row, doing this witha normal size chart lib kills page performance. I was literally including very basic html indicators in a presentation today and client where really impressed! This really solves that issue!And even more. Really great that you van manipulate the elements as css. Most chart libs I’ve dealt with makes non-trivial customization impossible.I’ll probably be building this in as Lowdefy blocks[1].Just curious, did you consider just branding it as sparks.css / sprites.css or something? Going the spark / sprite route just sets the expectations a lot lower imo. Although congrats, you are really close to fully functional charts here! Really interested to see how far this can go.[1] - https://lowdefy.com"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Cool!
I&#39;ll have to take the opportunity to mention my own charts.css[0]. It got some interest on HN last year [1] and I unfortunately dropped the ball and didn&#39;t make any revisions based on the good feedback I got. As people pointed out, I tried to give it a &#34;cute&#34; name using unicode which unfortunately makes it harder to search for.This version (OP&#39;s) is way more polished and almost certainly more widely useful. But mine had the features of (a) being generated from markdown and (b) defaulting to a list presentation of the data under different styles so the data remained accessible.Having more charting options that don&#39;t require javascript to do simple things is a good thing.[0] https://rbitr.github.io/ChartS.css/

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What&#39;s also not being said here is that ~99% of apps on Google Play don&#39;t make money this way either.Due to a combination of Android user&#39;s reluctance to spend money on apps at all and the rampant piracy that Android&#39;s open model makes trivially easy, most developers only way to make money is through in-app advertising, which this change obviously makes no difference to.Google Play is mostly a pyramid scheme. Developer&#39;s can only make money from showing ads and at the same time can only get downloads if they place ads on other people&#39;s apps. And Google just happens to own all the mobile ad companies.This 15% cut ends up &#34;costing&#34; Google virtually nothing.And as for Google &#34;helping developers build sustainable businesses&#34;, the only times they&#39;ve ever reached out to me were to offer me the opportunity to have someone help me spend thousands of dollars a month on mobile ads. Never, for example, to actually take down all the scam apps that use my app&#39;s name, icon and screenshots."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Worth remembering that as good as it is that Google is reducing it&#39;s abusive taxation on third party developers, the primary reason they&#39;re doing this is to try to quiet the majority of developers asking for stronger government regulations against this taxation without actually reducing their profit much, since the large companies which bring in the majority of revenue still have to pay full price.Basically, they&#39;re hoping that this will stop some app developers from demanding the right to use third party payment processors, which would likely be used many of the larger &gt;$1 million revenue publishers.The Android Police article about this cites an example from iOS, that &#34;On Apple&#39;s App Store, the 98% of developers who qualified for a lower revenue share rate were responsible for less than 5% of Apple&#39;s total collected revenue&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Further evidence that developer pressure and legal pressure on smartphone platforms work, that they aren&#39;t a waste of time.Prolonged campaigns for better terms can make a tangible difference, and we should be encouraged by this result to advocate for even better terms. It turns out that when they have real pressure, it is possible for Google and Apple to come up with better terms.Keep in mind that the reason Google is being sued for antitrust isn&#39;t because it was taking 30% -- it&#39;s because it forced manufactures not to install or bundle any 3rd party stores by threatening to remove access to the Play store if any competing storefronts were enabled by default on consumer devices. So this doesn&#39;t change the original complaint, but it&#39;s still a very big win for smaller developers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"EGA Monkey Island is similarly beautiful.I feel EGA forced artists to work within the limitations of the available color palette, and good artists created awesome stuff (like shown in this case). Once they had VGA, some artists rushed to use every color gradient they could get away with, and this ruined their art till they got the hang of it.Something similar happened with the transition from pixel art to 3D games -- games were 3D because they had to, whether necessary or not. And many suffered from it. (Arguably, many still do!)Of course, I hold the extremist opinion that even some CGA (4 colors!) games were beautiful in their own way. I don&#39;t think more is always better, a lesson that seems to be lost on some game developers..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yeah. I never played this game, but the EGA scenes feel evocative and the VGA ones don&#39;t. Similar to the Loom discussion the other day.Mostly it feels like the EGA artist was better at dramatic lighting. For example, in the EGA version of the dead templar, the neck area is pure black for a reason: it makes the skull, the focal point of the image, stand out more. But in the VGA version they decided to paint something there, so the image became less focused."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lots of rose colored glasses here.Yes, looking back on the EGA graphics, there is definitely a level of skill and stylization that I took for granted at the time and have a certain nostalgia for, but when the VGA versions of these games came out they were all mind-blowing and you just kind of had to be there - no one was selecting the EGA option if they had a VGA card.I remember the VGA version of Indiana Jones in particular being awesome in VGA, on a CRT, live in motion."</p>

One worries all these new mechanical muscles (cars etc) will make horses unnecessary. The other horse reminds him that everything so far has made their lives easier - remember all that farm work? Remember running coast-to-coast delivering mail? Remember riding into battle? All terrible! These new city jobs are pretty cushy, and with so many humans in the cities there will be more jobs for horses than ever. Even if this car thingy takes off, he might say, there will be new jobs for horses we can&#39;t imagine.&gt; But you know what happened. There are still working horses, but nothing like before. The horse population peaked in 1915 - from that point on it was nothing but down.&gt; There&#39;s no law of economics that says that better technology makes more better jobs for horses. It sounds shockingly dumb to even say that out loud.

Don&#39;t follow it&#39;s advice to kill yourself, for example).It really should be said that deep learning, in particular, is still just one technology that&#39;s very good at some things, kind of impressive but not functional at other things, and just unable to do other things (actual understanding of biology, for example, seems well beyond them). I don&#39;t think this situation has changed since deep learning began it&#39;s hype cycle (which isn&#39;t to say it&#39;s &#34;nothing&#34;, it just doesn&#39;t seem like to bring us &#34;everything&#34;, a scenario the article literally sketches).Automation has proceeded apace, automation in general has brought us enough resources right now to give minimal comfort to most people in the planet (as people have noted).But automation has generally succeeded in situations where everything is controlled - ie, factories. Self-driving cars are forever five years away given the 5% or 1% or whatever level of unpredictable variable involved. Progress on robots that can interact well with either humans or &#34;the messy real world&#34; even in very limited terms has been painfully slow and I expect this to continue."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; If everyone owns a slice of American value creation, everyone will want America to do better: collective equity in innovation and in the success of the country will align our incentives.I kind of doubt that. At Google we&#39;re paid in part with shares of GOOG, but at Google&#39;s scale that&#39;s just treated as cash compensation. At my level, nothing I do affects the stock price, and most Googlers feel this way.Sure, I want Google to do well, and I want America to do well too. Both of them doing well benefits me. But it doesn&#39;t really encourage me to do something different day-to-day."</p>

So when he says:&#34;I believe a well-diversified portfolio of non-debt and non-dollar assets along with a short cash position is preferable to a traditional stock/bond mix that is heavily skewed to US dollars. I also believe that assets in the mature developed reserve currency countries will underperform the Asian (including Chinese) emerging countries’ markets.&#34;It&#39;s not his avuncular advice.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Trying to speculate on the commercial bond market is exceedingly difficult and risky. Even the experts often take a beating. But using certain sectors of the bond market as a savings and retirement mechanism can be quite effective. Consider US tax-free municipal bonds (munies). They are safe, with defaults at a miniscule percentage of corporate bonds. And many are backed with third party insurance against defaults. Their returns are multiples of US Treasuries, CDs, money markets and savings accounts. And all distributions are tax exempt with the exception of any capital gains. Not very exciting. Sort of like watching grass grow. But it grows and grows.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Along with this, vertical scaling is severely underrated. You can do a lot and possibly everything ever for your company with vertical scaling. It would apply to 99% of the companies or even more.Edit:
Since people are confused, here is how StackOverflow handles of all of its web operations. If SO can run with this, so can your 0.33 req/minute app which is mostly doomed for failure. I am only half joking.StackOverflow architecture, current load (it will surprise you): https://stackexchange.com/performanceEverytime you go to SO, it hits one of these 9 web servers and all data on SO sits on those 2 massive SQL servers. That&#39;s pretty amazing.I want to be clear though, Horizontal scaling has a place in companies that has a team of corporate lawyers. Big. And in many many other scenarios for ETL and backend microservices."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author is not lying. I&#39;ve been learning docker and it is certainly nice to pull and docker-compose up for local dev, but there is a lot to learn when you factor in orchestrators. And when I mean learn, I mean actually learning the nuts and bolts of a Dockerfile and not copy/pasting shit from the internet. While it&#39;s all helpful, its certainly not needed for the project we have at work, nor the &#34;microservices&#34; that our lead thinks we need even though they aren&#39;t even microservices. All we&#39;ve done is split our application into seperate mini applications that don&#39;t talk to eachother at all, essentially 4 web services. Great! Sigh.So why am I learning all this instead of just programming? Programming is what I really want to do all day, just writing code and thinking through software architecture. Because the industry tells me if I don&#39;t learn this stuff I will be decommissioned. Fun stuff."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s super simple and it works for you - yeay! great!
If it will continue to work for you - double yeay!However, as soon as I read, I saw a lot of red flags:- Do you really want to copy from a development computer to your production?  No staging at all? (&#34;go test&#34; doesn&#39;t mean that you have 0 bugs)- Are you really sure that everything works exactly the same on different versions of GoLang? (Hey, a new guy in your company just installed unreleased Go 1.17, build on his notebook and pushed to production)?- That VM with systemd died at 1am. No customers for you until 7am (when you wake up)BTW. I am not saying that you should do Docker or CICD. The thing which I am saying that when you cut out from your process too much, you are increasing risks. (As an example, you didn&#39;t remove unit tests part. Based on &#34;Anything that doesn’t directly serve that goal is a complication&#34; you probably should have. However, you decided that it would be way too much risk)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I can&#39;t speak to the 4700u or the pangolin specifically, but I can offer this perspective on PopOS/AMD:I&#39;ve been using System76&#39;s PopOS with my Asus Zephyrus G14 (4800hs) as a daily driver and I really like it. (freelance/web)The battery life is comparable to Windows (on integrated graphics mode, it has graphics switching available)at 7-10 hours with 70% brightness and balanced power settings using VScode and firefox.The g14 has a 75wh battery vs the pangolin&#39;s 49wh, so I would expect less battery life from the pangolin despite the 4700u having a lower default tdp, since the 4800hs likes to sit at around 6-10 watts when doing non-intensive tasks anyway.In 2021 I&#39;m not missing any major programs. It&#39;s pretty incredible how much is cross-platform now."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Technically, what&#39;s going on here?&#34;CAID&#34; isn&#39;t a public iOS technology, and the article doesn&#39;t say what it means.Some googling returns: https://mmachina.cn/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MMA%E4%B8%AD%...Apparently it means &#34;CAA Advertising Id&#34;, where &#34;CAA&#34; appears to be the &#34;Creative Artists Agency&#34;, some sort of Chinese advertising group. (edit: wrong organization, it&#39;s actually &#34;Chinese Anonymization ID&#34;, not a group.  the group behind it is https://trackingio.com/)Searching &#34;CAA Advertising Id&#34; yields more Chinese PDFs.From what I can tell here, &#34;CAID&#34; is a partnership between Chinese industry and Chinese government to track users across apps for better tracking.The issue here does not seem to be that they&#39;ve bypassed a technical restriction, but that the developers of major apps are using a shared identifier that Apple doesn&#39;t like.In the US, the analogy would be if apps had tracking SDKs in them, that fingerprinted users across apps, in order to better target them for advertisements, and then the US government can pick up that data and do whatever they&#39;d like with it.The strange part to me, is that this actually is the situation today in the US.I don&#39;t want to shill for China, but why is this a story?  This has been a US industry since at least Doubleclick was invented.edit:It&#39;s a story because they&#39;re using the iOS keychain API to persist and share the tracking identifier.  As far as I know, this is a new technique in the wild, but has been theoretically possible since iOS launched.  It&#39;s only now being seen as necessary because of the iOS14 privacy changes.It&#39;s curious that American ad companies seem to understand Apple&#39;s intent and are opting not to risk their business by expanding their SDKs to use keychain sharing techniques, even though they&#39;re surely aware you can do this.  Chinese ad companies seem ok with risking their clients apps being banned on the app store.Apple can mitigate this by giving users control of the data and sharing related to keychain services."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s additionally concerning that the US has little exposure to China-sourced data. This imbalance where the CCP knows far more about the average American than the US knows about the average Chinese person is deeply concerning.

This was a quantum leap beyond Mapquest&#39;s page reload and reset with cumbersome arrow buttons.  This was a paradigm shift that let me explore a geography better than any book atlas.  I gave away all my atlases+ MS Window Media Player&#39;s ability to cleanly accelerate playback to 2x,3x,4x of audiobooks and tutorial videos for slow speakers.  MS Windows 7 had this long before Youtube&#39;s player had a 2x playback option.+ SQLite library : more than 10x improvement since I came from old school of writing custom formats for persisting data.  No more dumping memory structs to disk or writing b-trees in C Language from scratch.+ C++ STL in late 1990s.  Instantly reduced need to write custom data structures like linked-lists or in-house string libraries for common tasks+ VMware in 2000s : more than 10x productivity enhancement because I can play with malware in a virtual software sandbox instead of tediously re-imaging harddrives of air-gapped real physical machines+ Google Chrome in 2008 : 10x quality-of-life since misbehaving websites crashing don&#39;t bring down all the other tabs in my browsing session like Firefox/Opera.I probably have more than a hundred examples.  Some software tech 10x improvements are more diffused.  Reddit+HN websites are a much better use of my time than USENET newsgroups.  Youtube with recordings of tech conference presentations I can watch at 2x+ is a better used of my time than physically traveling to the site."</p>

Debugging JS in IE6 was like trying to build a house blindfolded with both arms tied behind your back.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here are a few that I did not see listed by others:1. Automatic device discovery and driver installation (e.g., with USB devices (also USB device categories, etc.)). Instead of trying to find a driver, things just worked.2. Automatic updates.  Keeping everything updated, largely, fell into the background.3. Graphical integrated development environments (IDEs) for software development.  I realize editors can be contentious, but tab completion of variable names, automatic identification of methods within scope, syntax highlighting, easily dropping breakpoints, etc. are, in my experience, wonderful improvements on productivity.4. What you see is what you get (WYSIWYG) text / image editors.  Thankfully, I did not spend much time in the prior era, but it was, at times, maddening to get something to format correctly.5. Ad blockers / reader modes. Again, I know these can be contentious, but, for me, these reformatting services are sometimes the only way to make some websites practically readable.I strongly second:-The rise of memory-managed languages (e.g., JAVA, C#, etc) with pretty robust default library sets, especially for string manipulation, graphics, and network operations.-Moving map software, especially for mobile GPS mapping.-Spreadsheet software.-Being able to easily search for answers to fairly technical programming problems, compiler errors, etc. along with better access to online documentation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A company that purchases data from another search engine (that most likely also uses aggregated personal data to deliver results) with just two products (search + browser) compares its app data usage to a behemoth that strives for the most personalized experience possible in exchange for personal data in order to display personalized ads.Google&#39;s apps offer opt-in voice search (solving Audio), optional end to end encryption for bookmarks &amp; search history (solving Browsing History), while location and diagnostics are opt in as well and it&#39;s also up to you if you want to store your address book of store you credit card with Google (solving Contacts &amp; Financial Info).Yes, most people will probably use Google Contacts, Maps, unencrypted bookmarks &amp; browsing history and and store their credit card data in the browser, but you&#39;re not forced to do that.I really wish DDG would innovate on search, improve their own crawlers &amp; indexing and then attack Google head on by comparing better results with the ad-ridden, SEO-flooded shit show that Google results have become. Instead, their marketing keeps on comparing apples to oranges and just keeps on playing the privacy angle, which is intellectually dishonest because DDG and Google have completely different goals.Boy do I hope for some real competition in the search engine market. Brave and Neeva can&#39;t launch soon enough. I&#39;m so sick and tired of giving DDG changes upon changes only to switch back to Google because the results haven&#39;t improved much."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I guess the majority of people on HN already know this more or less. The problem is still this: We still don&#39;t have good alternatives to Google&#39;s products and services.1) Android: Google still owns all our phones. Even on rooted phones it hard to remove google services that god know send so many requests containing whatnot to the eeee addresses. Just install no-root firewall and you will be amazed the amount of pending requests that accumulate in 1 hour.2) Google search: I guess I can manage with DDG but when it&#39;s not that straight forward search, subconciosuly I&#39;m still thinking that let&#39;s just do a quick google search to see if i&#39;m not missing anything. And often I find better results. While adblocks makes sure I filter most of the crap.3) Gmail: Yes there are alternatives but switching emails is hard. It&#39;s a big commitment for most people to switch a 10 year old gmail address. And it still works great at filtering spam and whatnot.And same for maps, youtube and all their services.They really have a big leverage on everyone.Quiting facebook and instagram was child&#39;s play in comparison. I haven&#39;t logged in for almost an year now. Quitting google is really hard otoh."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Controversial opinion:Half the data Chrome collects is harmless, and the other half is up to the user to give up:- Location data: you are asked and must approve for Chrome to use (at least on macOS)
- Financial data: you must enter it manually and click &#34;save for future use&#34;.Could it be better? Sure! But I think DDG is exaggerating here. We&#39;re not _that_ bad."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think this is great news, and I hope other states will follow. But it&#39;s a bit troublesome that it took a wealthy executive to get this anywhere politically, even after years of safe-use research and its prevalence as medical treatments:&gt; David Bronner, the top executive at Dr. Bronner’s soap company, helped bankroll the campaign, which had to overcome pandemic restrictions to gather signatures and get on the ballot last fall."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I support the move but the headline is kind of misleading. The ballot initiative was limited to directing the police chief to make these crimes the &#34;lowest priority&#34; but they are still just as illegal as before and carry the same penalties. I&#39;m not even sure this directive is binding. As the mayor (who did not particularly support the measure) pointed out, it&#39;s not like this was a high priority to begin with.A proper decriminalization or perhaps even legalization would have passed, but DC citizens lack the same rights over their own local laws that any other American living in a state would enjoy. DC deserves statehood."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We do forget that medicine is a 20th century science. Even for most of the 1900s, doctors were performing wholly unscientific and unethical things.They still barely know anything. Medical science with proper epistemology is young, perhaps younger than the advent of modern computer science.So there&#39;s lots of stuff that&#39;s just grandfathered. And because very little modern medicine has the ambition to try real novelty, we never retest the grandfathered taboos."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One thing that always seems to be missing from these videos (in general, because there are many of them) is step 0: how do you go about acquiring the land and the permission to build a log cabin on this land? I can&#39;t imagine that there&#39;s many countries in the world where there is no build code or other legislation regarding how or where buildings can be built. The last thing I&#39;d want to do is spend an entire year building something that I would then be legally obliged to tear down.If you&#39;re felling a large amount of trees in a forest, at the bare minimum you need the blessing of the land owner (if that isn&#39;t you). Most likely, you&#39;ll also need in addition to this a permit to fell trees to begin with, because land owners in most countries aren&#39;t free to simply fell any amount of trees they wish just because they own the land.It&#39;s obviously an impressive feat to build a log cabin from scratch, but since this step is so often completely omitted, I have to ask myself whether this is because it&#39;s considered too boring, or because there are people out there who think that as long as you go far enough into the woods, you can do whatever you want because no one will notice."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A great excuse to drop a link to this legend:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_ProennekeRichard Louis Proenneke (/ˈprɛnəkiː/; May 4, 1916 – April 20, 2003) was an American self-educated naturalist, conservationist, writer, and wildlife photographer who, from the age of about 53, lived alone for nearly thirty years (1969–1999) in the mountains of Alaska in a log cabin that he constructed by hand near the shore of Twin Lakes. Proenneke hunted, fished, raised and gathered his own food, and also had supplies flown in occasionally. He documented his activities in journals and on film, and also recorded valuable meteorological and natural data.[1][2] The journals and film were later used by others to write books and produce documentaries about his time in the wilderness."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Another argument against the &#34;going dark&#34; claim is that before smartphones and the internet, the only conversations the FBI could monitor was through phonelines and mail. These were known to be easily monitored and I doubt there was much more criminal activity happening through those then than now.I would argue that the conversations that have gone online are the interactions that were previously happening in-person (at least in term of criminal activity), to which the FBI didn&#39;t have access before.There is something Orwellian with the idea that there shouldn&#39;t be a word that can be pronounced in the country that the government cannot record and listen to after the fact. The limits of what is legal or not have always moved (see homosexuality, drug and alcohol consumption, etc). So a 100% enforcement of the law is counter-intuitively undesirable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I dont understand why the US people still trust these agencies. FBI, CIA, NSA have all shown to act against the democracy in many cases. If they could be trusted, they could be trusted with a backdoor. Since they cannot be trusted, the backdoor only makes them a more dangerous enemy of the people."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article&#39;s title is a little misleading, but I agree with their overarching message.Law enforcement should never be given the easy way out in terms of breaking encryption. Asking for backdoors to be installed in every device is extremely lazy police work. I&#39;m sure there are other ways of breaking encryption like the rubber-hose technique (of course with valid arrest warrant).Arguing that law enforcement should stop attacking encryption because it jeopardises privacy seems a little naive to me. What about criminals that profit from creating spyware? In fact, allowing law enforcement to actively research new ways to break encryption can be productive for improving security in the long run. Stop using weak passwords people."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very interesting, these kinds of articles are (to me) some of the best content we get on here.I&#39;m no expert in any of the languages used except maybe C, at least I&#39;m quick to form opinions about C code. In C, I&#39;m not so sure that there is a well-established &#34;idiomatic&#34; concept, since C is not so tightly bound to a community as more modern languages. At least that&#39;s my feeling.That said, I was shocked to see that the example code did heap-allocations to store integers. Single integers, one per allocation, per &#34;counting bucket&#34;. I would store the count in the data pointer without a second thought, I just &#34;can&#39;t&#34; make 4/8-byte heap allocations and still sleep at night. Especially after all the concern about processing the input in large blocks for performance! Casting an integer to/from a void pointer should be pretty safe according to my gut feel. If that turns out to be false, I would dump the libc&#39;s hash API altogether, since it makes me do heap allocations to store single integers.I tried making the change locally, and the time taken (as measured with the OP&#39;s benchmarking program) dropped from 0.11 to 0.10 on my system (a Dell laptop running an Intel i5-7300). That&#39;s at least something."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is definitely the most interesting part of the article for me:Incidentally, this problem set the scene for a wizard duel between two computer scientists several decades ago. In 1986, Jon Bentley asked Donald Knuth to show off “literate programming” with a solution to this problem, and he came up with an exquisite, ten-page Knuthian masterpiece. Then Doug McIlroy (the inventor of Unix pipelines) replied with a one-liner Unix shell version using tr, sort, and uniq.http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2011/12/more-shell-less-egg..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Knuth-McIlroy comes up a lot.  Previous discussion [1].  For this example I can make a very similar Nim program [2] run almost exactly the same speed as `wc -w`, yet the optimized C program runs 1.2x faster not 1.15x slower than `wc -w` - a 1.4x discrepancy - bigger than many ratios in the table.  So, people should be very cautious about conclusions from any of this.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24817594[2] https://github.com/c-blake/adix/blob/master/tests/wf.nim"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"All of the people on this list are &#34;software engineers&#34; in the sense that they have some rudimentary education in the field. Almost none of them could get a job as a software engineer at their own company, if they had to, because they would be completely unqualified. And I&#39;m not looking down my nose at anyone: I have an undergraduate degree in CS, but I got it 16 years ago and then went to law school, and there is not a serious place on earth that would let me touch their codebase. But if I started a really valuable company tomorrow (maybe I should), I would code as a software engineer on this list.I mean, come at it from the other direction: Why are there so many software engineers who are not successful CEOs? My God, they have the secrets of for loops, S-expressions, they know about vim---and yet they aren&#39;t running Pfizer? Why not?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, talk about assuming correlation implies causation.I think the obvious lesson here is when society becomes reoriented around a new field (in this case software), people with experience in that field are going to do well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What this seems to show is that CEOs in a particular sector often have expertise in that sector. And that Tech is currently the most highly valued sector as measured by market capitalisation. To find evidence of Software Engineers being the best CEOs overall you&#39;d really need to find examples of them running non-tech firms successfully or examples of non-Software Engineers running tech firms poorly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I use this feature. On a large monitor, Firefox wastes quite a lot of space with the default layout. To be honest, I wish there was an option to make it more compact than the &#34;compact&#34; layout. There used to be an XUL extension to do this, before XUL was killed off.Seems like every time I see coverage about Firefox, it&#39;s Mozilla removing or crippling some feature I care about.Why bother using FF at this point? Most sites don&#39;t work as well, and Mozilla seems actively hostile to my use case. If I&#39;m going to use a browser that is hostile to me, I may as well get better website compatibility out of the bargain.Not surprised their market share keeps shrinking. At this point, what&#39;s the sell?Edit 1: worth noting, there is a lower-down comment thread[0] with relevant links - Mozilla does not care if you like this feature.0 - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26464973"</p>

The wording of the bugzilla specifically says&gt;  The &#34;Compact&#34; density is a feature of the &#34;Customize toolbar&#34; view which is currently fairly hard to discover, and we assume gets low engagement.So not only do they not have telemetry for that, they aren&#39;t even attempting to make it more discoverable to test if there&#39;s a correlation between &#34;hard to discover&#34; and &#34;low engagement&#34;?I would use this but never knew this could be changed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t think Mozilla has a clear vision of what they want to achieve. They&#39;ve been randomly removing features, or even plain butchering their  products (eg the recent Firefox mobile update) for several years, and all they probably achieved is to lose more and more users.Yet with their tiny market share they aren&#39;t exactly in a position to lose users."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For those not from South Africa, this app is primarily for people to be able to get notifications or look up when their area will be affected by a &#34;planned power outage&#34;, or as Eskom (our state owned power utility) refers to it, &#34;load shedding&#34;. &#34;Load shedding&#34; is enacted whenever they have a power production capacity issue where different areas take turns without power so as to not let the power grid collapse.This app aggregates information from various data sources and provides push notifications too. It is without a doubt the best source of this information and the app being unavailable significantly affects the day to day lives of a significant portion of the South African population who use it to plan around these power outages.While the app also has a &#34;chat&#34; feature, it&#39;s really tangental to the primary purpose of the app and I expect that most users of the app, like myself, don&#39;t use that feature at all and only care about knowing when they will be without electricity.In case you&#39;re wondering why they hell we have load shedding, it&#39;s because Eskom is grossly incompetent. Their incompetence is hugely exacerbated by nepitism and corruption where government has historically appointed people to Eskom management positions solely as &#34;favours&#34;, rather than on qualification for the job."</p>

We do not want the same to occur to our servers or if there is an overflow from Play Store ban to GCP etc. The business risk is too high when you rely on Google&#39;s services.Some examples:Terraria banned - https://twitter.com/Demilogic/status/1358661840402845696New project banned - https://medium.com/@amton15127/why-you-should-not-use-fireba...Google bans company - https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/8kvias/tifu_by_gettin...Google bans mail - https://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/a-serf-on-googles-farmBan app for communicating changes during covid - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23221447Adwords ban - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23224791Serverpunch bad support - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17431609Delete app - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20826618Google bans game with pandemic - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23229073Google bans dev with no recourse - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15197357"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"An interesting side point is that the graph optimization approach used here is somewhat similar to modern graph-based visual SLAMThe graph in the article can be seen as a factor graph. VSLAM systems usually have a (kind of bipartite) factor graph with vertices/variables that are either keyframes or ‘good’ features, with edges/factors between features and the frames that see them and between adjacent frames; each of these edges are the factors in the graph. This structure results in very large but sparse graphs, and there are factor graph optimization libraries that take advantage of this sparsity (e.g. g2o or GTSAM.) These libraries also use specialized optimization techniques for some of the nonlinear manifolds (e.g. SO(3)) that arise in SLAM problems."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a hopeful but possible take. But the 501Y.V2 (B.1.351) and 501Y.V3 (P1) lineages have the mutation within the conserved region for coronaviruses near the spike protein cleavage site. These show massively (1000x) decreased monoclonal antibody binding for original genetic sequence designs. It&#39;s better for the mRNA vaccine produced human-body-made antibodies which show only 5-10x reduction in binding.But antibody binding isn&#39;t the full story and there may be T-cell stuff helping too. The data seems to indicate updated spike protein designs will be needed but if there&#39;s other stuff going on we don&#39;t know about old spike vaccines could still work. I can&#39;t say it will definitely help because the vaccine rollout is so slow and air travel is so fast that this negative pressure will probably provoke more variants as long as host numbers remain high.ref: &#34;Antibody Resistance of SARS-CoV-2 Variants B.1.351 and B.1.1.7&#34; [pdf] https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03398-2_reference... https://i.imgur.com/8co1IoL.jpg &#34;SARS-CoV-2 VoC B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 neutralization evasion&#34; table.https://covariants.org/variants/S.501Y.V2 https://covariants.org/variants/S.501Y.V3"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Perhaps unpopular opinion, but the US vaccination system is about the worst when it comes to preventing spread.  Instead, it seems to be attempting to prevent death.I&#39;ve always argued that preventing spread would as a byproduct prevent death, but I&#39;m obviously not studied in the field.Put shortly, I would have vaccinated college kids and working age folks first.  They are not likely to die from it, but are far more likely to spread it than elderly and severely diseased folks."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I started free diving for abalone along the Sonoma coast in 2008. The first few years of diving were plentiful and majestic. But my friends and I noticed the changes around 2015. Less sunflower stars and star fish. After some red tide events, the abalone die offs were crazy. Coves that used to have abs stacked on top of each other were almost empty. Finding a 9” abalone became a chore. The thinner kelp forests meant less fish, less life. It’s been difficult to watch first hand. I get sad thinking about the reality that my children will most likely never see the underwater forests that filled my soul and gave me a deep love of the ocean. I hope we can help the system get back in balance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have been diving in the Monterey, CA region since 1999 and have seen the change first hand. Sunflower sea stars are now extinct in the area; I haven&#39;t seen one in years. Some of the smaller sea star species have started to gradually recover but they aren&#39;t effective at preying on purple urchins. There is a local group culling urchins but they&#39;ll only be able to cover a small area.https://g2kr.com/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One reason we don&#39;t have kelp forests in Oregon is due to sea otters having been wiped out, which kept the urchins at bay.[0]Unfortunately, according to OPs article:Others have suggested bringing in another kelp forest predator, the sea otter, to help fight back the urchins. The problem with this appears to be that sea otters aren’t so interested in the skinny, starved urchins occupying the most barren areas, reports Anuradha Varanasi for Inverse. A separate study published this week in the journal the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggests the otters do eat urchins but that they prefer the more well-fed residents of the coast’s remaining kelp forests to the so-called “zombie urchins” clinging to life in the denuded barrens.[0] - https://oregonwild.org/about/blog/lost-sea-otters-oregon-par..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This emulator currently has the most complete guest audio renderer implementations, as they just finished a project of doing an in depth reversing of that portion of the firmware. [0]Getting it to work with the host os(windows usually) can have minor issues with output in rare circumstances, or when a game is still not running the proper speed, but they&#39;ve ironed out the major ones.-----------------------    This is my requiem, I present to you Amadeus, a complete reimplementation of the Audio Renderer!
    This reimplementation is based on my reversing of every version of the audio system module that I carried for the past 10 months.
    This supports every revision (at the time of writing REV1 to REV8 included) and all features proposed by the Audio Renderer on real hardware.

Doesn&#39;t a bunch of hardware faking have to be rebuilt in C# that QEMU already does (well¿)?  Or is it too hard to introduce custom hardware/firmware (like this audio stuff) into QEMU?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In terms of single-player games, the figure is more like 85%. You can probably get an additional 5% to work with various levels of tweaking, but compatibility is remarkably good these days. Many games perform better on Linux than they do on Windows (Borderlands, Overwatch), while others give you a chance to have a flawless experience with games that are pretty busted on modern Windows (Diablo 2, Fallout: New Vegas). As another commenter mentioned, the big issue is with anti-cheat: any game implementing EAC will outright not work, full stop. That makes it about a 50/50 chance that multiplayer titles will work on Linux, with some unfortunate casualties like Rainbow Six Siege and Halo MCC&#39;s online multiplayer.With that being said, I truly and honestly believe Linux is the way to go if you&#39;re not into multiplayer. Valve&#39;s commitment to Linux is nothing short of herculean, and it&#39;s heartwarming to see them give back to the open source community in such a remarkable way. If it weren&#39;t for Proton (and DXVK), I&#39;d still be using Windows on my main computer, which made development hell. Now, I feel comfortable moving to a system where I can enjoy Overwatch, Titanfall and Team Fortress on a regular basis without dual-booting."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know it&#39;s not the topic here so apologies for the digression, but the Mac compatibility on this list is somewhat misleading. Games like TF2 don&#39;t actually work on the Mac any longer unless you stay on or downgrade to Mojave. And even then, the performance and bugginess leaves much to be desired.If you&#39;re using this article at all to make decisions around a Mac for gaming, dive a little deeper to make sure the game you want to play works on Catalina+ (generally requires a full 64 bit port).Back to the actual topic: I had no idea Proton got this good. That&#39;s quite an achievement for Linux gaming. What&#39;s the state of modern GPU support?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was really annoyed when Rocket League dropped native support for Linux, but it turned out it runs much better on my potato under Proton. My only concern now is that they&#39;ll add anti-cheat to it (even though there&#39;s there no real need for it) and Linux will become flagged. The fact that they moved the game to only be available to new players via the Epic client has me worried they&#39;re moving in that direction."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A big :+1: for running Docker containers with `--read-only`, forcing you to use explicit writeable volume/bind mounts for all writable data... it&#39;s not just the security benefits, you can also avoid entire classes of problems like:* minimizing the difference between `docker restart` (preserves overlayfs changes) and container re-creates (resets overlayfs back to the image state)* surprise data loss on container redeployments because data was unexpectedly being written to the overlayfs instead of a volume* unexpectedly running out of disk space in `/var/lib/docker` because data was being written outside of a volume* performance issues caused by excessive overlayfs writes (storage drivers and /var/lib/docker not necessarily designed for IO performance)"</p>

It prints out a long list of hardening flags that can be applied inside of your service, like so:    NAME                                                        DESCRIPTION                                                             EXPOSURE

ReadWritePaths should be replaced with a combination of DynamicUser + writing local persistent data to $STATE_DIRECTORY, but I&#39;m too lazy to do that yet.See systemd.exec(5) for more."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I use Hadolint[1] as a CI job to check if my Dockerfiles follow the good &#34;rules&#34;. But there is one rule that annoys me the most and which is also present in this article, is the pinned OS package version rule[2]. While I understand its interest, I struggle to handle this problem.When I build new images and it fails because the pinned version is not available anymore, I have to dig into Debian or Ubuntu packages websites to find the new ones as they don&#39;t keep the old packages online.I know I could ask Hadolint to ignore this rule but I don&#39;t like this and I think it&#39;s important to stick to a certain version of a package to avoid problems. I&#39;m just trying to find any tip that could make me use pinned version and avoid this manual search every time I have to. Does apt-get install allows wildcard for example?1: https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint2: https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint/wiki/DL3008"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;But the biggest potential is in ability to fearlessly parallelize majority of Rust code, even when the equivalent C code would be too risky to parallelize. In this aspect Rust is a much more mature language than C.&#34;Yes. Today, I integrated two parts of a 3D graphics program. One refreshes the screen and lets you move the viewpoint around. The other loads new objects into the scene. Until today, all the objects were loaded, then the graphics window went live. Today, I made those operations run in parallel, so the window comes up with just the sky and ground, and over the next few seconds, the scene loads, visibly, without reducing the frame rate.This took about 10 lines of code changes in Rust. It worked the first time it compiled."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; C libraries typically return opaque pointers to their data structures, to hide implementation details and ensure there&#39;s only one copy of each instance of the struct. This costs heap allocations and pointer indirections. Rust&#39;s built-in privacy, unique ownership rules, and coding conventions let libraries expose their objects by valueThe primary reason c libraries do this is not for safety, but to maintain ABI compatibility.  Rust eschews dynamic linking, which is why it doesn&#39;t bother.  Common lisp, for instance, does the same thing as c, for similar reasons: the layout of structures may change, and existing code in the image has to be able to deal with it.&gt; Rust by default can inline functions from the standard library, dependencies, and other compilation units. In C I&#39;m sometimes reluctant to split files or use libraries, because it affects inliningThis is again because c is conventionally dynamically linked, and rust statically linked.  If you use LTO, cross-module inlining will happen."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; &#34;Clever&#34; memory use is frowned upon in Rust. In C, anything goes. For example, in C I&#39;d be tempted to reuse a buffer allocated for one purpose for another purpose later (a technique known as HEARTBLEED).This made me laugh"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am so excited for this software. I have used Airtable extensively, and it&#39;s a pile of garbage. Here are just a FEW of the &#34;features&#34; Airtable charges $24/user/mo for:- Reliable 1-5 hours a month of downtime. There are months where it&#39;s literally 1 nine of uptime. Their status page was actually down for a while (I think they forgot to renew it?)- Simple and obvious bugs in the official API clients have not been fixed for years (for example, Promises in the official JS library throw the string `[object Object]` for all exceptions.)- The API has no way to query the structure of a table, you have to infer it from the first few records. (The auto-generated API documentation is actually wrong if you don&#39;t have a fully-filled-in row somewhere in the first few rows.)- You can&#39;t modify a table configuration by API... except you can _sometimes_ by adding a parameter which is documented to try to convert dates, but actually modifies field definitions for a number of fields. Documentation for which fields is entirely in scattered forum posts from users.- Booleans in the API are `true` or `undefined`. Seriously.This is all /barely/ worth it because Google Docs doesn&#39;t work when you need a large structured database with many collaborators. But man is it bad software."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I will be using this, and dropping a lot of my paid AirTable bases...and let me please explain why.Airtable makes it VERY hard to collaborate with people outside my organization. We are a team of 7 people. No longer a scrappy 1-person startup, but not an enterprise client by any-means.If I want to add a single person to an Airtable base, that&#39;s $24 a month please. I have one client with 12 people that want to collaborate on the base by posting comments. I can&#39;t justify $288 a month just to keep the comments for all time.I contacted Airtable about this and was told the &#34;Enterprise Plan&#34; would be a perfect fit. Minimum $15k a year commitment.Why is this happening in the SasS world??? Everyone seems to be either single Pro user, or Enterprise.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m one of the maintainers of one of the implementations of eth2 live today (https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm) and can help offer more context on this. Ethereum proof of stake has been live since December 1st and it currently secures over 6 billion USD worth of value https://beaconcha.in/. Currently, this is a chain that lives in parallel to the proof of work chain we know as Ethereum today. The idea is that over this coming year, the entire state of Ethereum will be &#34;merged&#34; into this new chain that uses proof of stake consensus via a docking process. &#34;Escalating the eth2 merge&#34; means there is more expedited work from researchers and developers when it comes to performing this critical decision. Since eth2 consensus is already live and running correctly with a large set of validators, miners cannot censor this new chain and therefore cannot really stop the merge."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Regardless of the current issues with the updates, gas prices, different opinions on the community, devs vs miners vs users...Am I the only one who thinks people underestimate Ethereum and its EVM invention? In 2013 this guy (who I think is a visionary) wrote a document with a proposal that led to the creation of a world-wide turing-complete distributed computer. And still, people are just starting to realize its potential. This month a layer-2 solution called optimism will launch a virtual machine called OVM (optimism vm) on top of ethereum smart contracts that can solve most of the current scalability issues (and there are other solutions being tested in parallel: zkrollups...). We are also starting to realize the potential of Dex and Defi (distributed exchanges and finance), DAOs (distributed organizations), NFT (non-fungible tokens) and a bunch of things more that 7 years after are appearing out of thin air. So even if Ethereum wasn&#39;t updated at all (although, we probably all agree that PoW is not environmental friendly and should be replaced with a better alternative: PoS) it could still thrive in the long term thanks to its most fundamental design choices (turing-complete...). I am truly amazed by this technology and Vitalik. I wish I knew a little bit more of the underlying fundamentals. What do you think?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not an expert, but if 51% of the existing hashpower doesn&#39;t want a change, it sounds less a 51% attack and more like miners voting against something that isn&#39;t in their interest. The whole point of blockchains is that the incentives are supposed to be aligned between miners and users. If that isn&#39;t the case here, it sounds like a problem."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So many of these start or end with an `x*`, `(x|y)`, `[xy]` or `[^xy]` that I only see two characters I can fill in before I need to start looking at multiple constraints for the same cell and either doing combinatorics or guess-and-check.This might be fine for hard mode, but as someone who considers themselves a regexpert it&#39;s not very approachable as a first puzzle IMO.A more gradual introduction to the format would be to give a few clues that give you confidence on specific characters, that then let you lock in some other characters in other hints, and so on.For instance, replacing `.*H.*V.*G.*` with `.{3}H.*V.*G.*` would go a long way because you could confidently place an `H`.  And say that intersected with `(DI|NS|TH|OM)*` on the `H`, you could then place a `T` from the second clue because of what you learned from the first clue.It could just be that I&#39;m missing something or not as good at regex as I thought, and please let me know if that&#39;s the case.   Either way though, when I&#39;m trying a new kind of puzzle I&#39;d like to feel like I made some sort of progress after trying for 5-10 minutes, and here 2 chars does not feel like progress."</p>

Life goal is to do the entire thing.Trip only took a few hours and there are plentiful bike lanes to reach that far. Along the way, or on the way back, check out the Hagaparken, Natural History Museum, and campus of Stockholm University."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Database startups suffer from an extreme case of an important truism in startups generally: the product you think you are selling is not the product the customer thinks they are buying. No one buys a database per se, they are just a means to some other end.People that love database technology — that would be me — tend to start database companies. It is very difficult to sell a database. It is much, much easier to sell a compelling solution to a somewhat boring but very valuable business problem that just happens to require an amazing database capability behind it. That’s your moat, the customer doesn’t actually care that there is an amazing database engine behind it but it makes it difficult for competitors to replicate.Filed under “lessons I learned the hard way”."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is akin to everyone’s dream to start a cozy, atmospheric coffee shop. These types of coffee bars fold very quickly or at best give founders years of servitude below minimum wage. The reason is that the type of behaviour this kind of establishment encourages - lounging, book reading, laptop work is exactly the opposite of the quick serve model that is  conducive to high revenue. The customer loves this model, the owner hates it.Analogous to it, the nosql DB market is the exact wrong market to enter. Large companies willing to pay big bucks for enterprise features will pay established vendors for the stodgy but battle tested stuff like Oracle or DB2. The hipster startup market pays nobody for anything as there is a myriad of free choices in every common flavour and the few that will pay will mostly do so to purchase managed hosting. And that’s only if their PoC built on your new and untrusted database ever makes it to production. And then it’s probably your cheapest tier. Don’t be selling to paupers!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Developers love building developer tools, often for free. So while there is massive demand, the supply vastly outstrips it.This is key, and plays out over and over again in different forms. There are no points for difficulty, only supply and demand. PG puts this well [1]:&gt; That&#39;s the essence of a startup: having brilliant people do work that&#39;s beneath them. Big companies try to hire the right person for the job. Startups win because they don&#39;t—because they take people so smart that they would in a big company be doing &#34;research,&#34; and set them to work instead on problems of the most immediate and mundane sort. Think Einstein designing refrigerators.[1] http://www.paulgraham.com/bronze.html"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you&#39;ll be using B2 for live production data, a couple points:First, B2&#39;s pricing is pretty amazing, especially compared to S3 and similar competitors: https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage-pricing.htmlSecond, be aware those savings come with some downsides. The major one for us has been their maintenance window every Thursday from 2:00-3:00pm Pacific Time. Usually there&#39;s no outage, but sometimes there is. There&#39;s no warning - it&#39;s just down sometimes during that window. So, if uptime is important for your data, consider the cost of also implementing a fallback solution to cover your production use during those maintenance windows. https://www.backblaze.com/scheduled-maintenance.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love B2&#39;s free ingress and egress when you use CloudFlare, they utterly destroy the competition on price.But my true dream would be for backblaze to someday offer ZFS as a service.I want to `zfs send -i my_pool@2020-03-11 | b2zfs recv some_bucket_id`, then be able to view my snapshots and files within in the backblaze web UI, and restore with `b2zfs send -i some_bucket_id/my_pool@2020-03-11 | zfs recv my_pool`.You can already mount B2 as a FUSE filesystem with something like ExpanDrive, then write ZFS raw file vdevs to the B2 FUSE mount, but it&#39;s horrifically slow and probably too janky for any real use."</p>

I&#39;ve got a laptop that has awful thermals but decent hardware. One of the fans is dead, and I&#39;ve attempted to replace it but I guess the header itself is busted.* The processor and GPU are just wasted in there as they throttle hard on basic workloads. So, I&#39;ve been meaning to rip the board out and make an HTPC out of it. I&#39;m not too experienced with electronics to know if there&#39;s any issues I could run into, so I&#39;ve been holding off on it. I would love to see if anyone else has done something like that.* Unfortunately, it possible that my attempt to fix a dead fan is what busted the header. I&#39;m not sure because the previous fan was dead and the new fan I put in didn&#39;t spin, but that&#39;s part of why I don&#39;t feel comfortable just winging it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I started using Wayland about a month ago on both my work computer and my laptop (On Pop_OS! 20.10). After seeing too much graphical glitches and weird behavior, specially because Alacritty (my favorite terminal) did not have any window decoration (I read through the whole issue on Gnome&#39;s issue tracker for server side decoration and got a little disappointed), I stopped using it on my work PC. But still I&#39;m using it on my laptop. I haven&#39;t had any issues there, but I just use my laptop for some web surfing and zoom. 
Screen capture is a hassle too. I was trying to capture only a part of my screen and had to do an hour worth of research to finally decide to just switch to X.org and get the job done. 
It&#39;s great that Flameshot is now supporting Wayland, and it&#39;s great that it is trying to support all the common protocols."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Two feedback points:* Password field for creating new sends should be named differently, as by default Firefox autocompletion puts there my account&#39;s password there. Potentially should be exposed from OPTIONS panel. Alternatively it can be generated by default, and then once the message is created, will be shared to the creator - or stored in options menu of my sends* Missing an option to expire message after first opening. It&#39;s like a self destroyable notification that can be read only once. Why? For the instance if I share some confident information with someone that I know is going to open very soon, then once he/she opens the message it will be destroyed, so that if somebody accesses either my or my friend&#39;s machine, it will be impossible to read the secret message. Another aspect is that if my friend will try open the secret message, and it will show that message doesn&#39;t exist / was destoryed - then we know that message was compromised."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Perfect timing. Just used this to send personal information across email. I still included the password in the email, but the expiry date means my personal data won&#39;t be collected through passive email logging. Also added max 2 read attempts: one for me test it, and another for the accountant.And of course, the accountant at my company still insists on passing personal information through email. Another example, Monese bank asking me to submit all sorts of pdf scans of personal documents to close an account with them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A very interesting addition indeed to Bitwarden. I still personally prefer my own setup as I&#39;m guaranteed not to run any risks of being siloed but I&#39;ve started pointing others towards Bitwarden because of this and their strong commitment so far towards Open Source [0][0] https://github.com/bitwarden"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this is the biggest takeaway for me:&gt; We saw this dynamic metastasize in the wake of George Floyd’s murder, when well-intentioned claims of “silence is violence” (recalling the powerful 1987 ACT-UP “Silence = Death” campaign) spiraled into calling out individuals with even a small following who hadn’t come forward with a timely public statement of solidarity or remorse. Yet public posts were subject to popular scrutiny and judged based on sincerity, originality, and tone. Not surprisingly, many people defaulted to posting a somber plain black square. But this generated criticism of its own by clogging the feed with an informational blackout during a moment when community resource sharing was critically important. Amid a chaotic time, the platform functioned exactly as designed: amplification of emotions, uptick in user interaction, growth in platform engagement and data cultivation. Cha-ching, the platform cashes in.In other words, any large movement or discussion on &#34;clearnet&#34; spaces gets subverted by the algorithms and profit motive of the platform they live on.However, where I disagree with the author is considering mainstream &#34;dark forest&#34; platforms like reddit or 4chan to be countercultural. In fact, I&#39;d argue that mainstream social media can never be countercultural. While there may be no &#34;algorithm&#34; controlling the narrative you see on 4chan (or a straightforward and ostensibly fair one on a site like reddit), the content you see (and by extension, the narrative) is shaped by profit motive: From well-compensated marketing teams, to hordes of self-interested proselytizers (see: bitcoin), to propaganda teams looking to influence public opinion, mainstream dark forest sites simply shift the balance of power from the platform itself to the most motivated and well-funded members of the platform"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Still reading the article, but this is an interesting blurb if nothing else:&#34;To be truly countercultural today, in a time of tech hegemony, one has to, above all, betray the platform, which may come in the form of betraying or divesting from your public online self.&#34;I hadn&#39;t thought of boycotting much of popular online space as being counter-cultural. It&#39;s an interesting thought."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"You can&#39;t censor it away completely, but you can help the redeemable extremists __know__ they&#39;re indulging in extremism by forcing them to go to fringe websites rather than allow them to stay on Twitter and Facebook as if nothing is wrong. As for the &#34;deplorables&#34; who know what they&#39;re doing and will never question it or feel any remorse, we should not be giving them a megaphone.sources[0]: I was susceptible to extremist thought (not actions, fortunately) when I was younger. The sense that I might get into trouble if I participated in fringe websites kept me from going further down the rabbit hole. I kept reading mainstream news and sites, and while I would give a lot of things an extremist spin in my mind, eventually the narrative stopped making sense.sources[1]: https://twitter.com/iyad_elbaghdadi (can&#39;t find the specific Tweet, but he went through a similar experience, and almost became a full-blown extremist Muslim, before the sites he used to frequent were taken offline)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My reading from the outside is, the left needs to realize (I&#39;m sure it applies to the right equally as well) that scolding people into guilt is not a viable approach to affect action or to change perceptions when you&#39;re dealing with adults.Neither does boxing people into this, that and that category do any good. Like if all you want to do is dehumanize those guys so you can happily insult / hurt them without hurting your conscience, go ahead, that&#39;s choice.. you have different goals.. but remember that instinct that wants you to scream at this-this-this type of person is a confrontational approach that deep down falls in the pattern of, eliminating the other tribe.. if you choose to do something about it and what you do is your responsibility and problem.I just think the solution should lie in :
1) dialog 2) lawsI think beyond those 2 lie some really wrong answers.."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you cannot censor away opinions, if suppression of ideas doesn&#39;t work then why in exactly these kinds of articles do people bemoan it as dangerous?I may agree that most censorship is wrong but it does work. It worked for centuries to help maintain systems of inequality.It worked for centuries to maintain familial control and enforce sexual monoculture in many countries. Information control works so well, it prevents people from even understanding themselves or what they really want in the face of ideologically imposed values.We are steeped in a culture of Hollywood telling us what the lessons of history are about. One of the off repeated &#34;hopeful&#34; messages we are fed is that you can&#39;t kill an idea but my reading of history has led me to the other conclusion entirely. That controlling the conversation, its constraints and determining the status quo are profoundly powerful tools."</p>

Every few years we get a tourist that confuses that with Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.They generally realize something is wrong when they switch planes in Halifax from a Jet (Boeing 737, Airbus 320, etc) to a 19 person turboprop for the last few hundred kilometers to Sydney.News Articles:http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2172858.stmhttps://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/italian-tourists-...https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/31/teen-accidenta...Wikipedia Link:Sydney, Nova Scotia, Canada https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney,_Nova_ScotiaSydney, New South Wales, Australia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney"</p>

1. a main or important element of something, especially of a diet. &#34;bread, milk, and other staples&#34;Considering that the Office Supply store was called Staples, and the local grocery stores were Alpha Beta, Vons, and Ralphs, one could understand their confusion!"</p>

SQLite already ships with a fairly large suite of JSON tools, which are optional to compile into the library, so there&#39;s precedent.Datetimes are of those things which is incredibly annoying to get right, and really belongs inside the database. RFC3339 timestamps are already well designed, since if you stick to UTC (and if you don&#39;t store timezone data separately you deserve those problems), lexical order is temporal order, but queries which would be rendered in English as &#34;return all accounts where last payment is ninety days prior to `now`&#34; isn&#39;t really possible with string comparisons.Also, with the JSON library, you can use a check constraint to fail if a string isn&#39;t valid JSON, another affordance I would love to have for datetimes.Grateful for what we just got, though!

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Literally every time you see a startup release a product that seems trivial it&#39;s because that&#39;s not the full story. You&#39;re judging without complete information. For example, the public face might be a simple Mac calendar widget, but that could be the gateway to calendar sharing, native office apps, meeting booking, event management, ticket sales, corporate flight sales etc.Building an audience with a cheap tool that solves a tiny pain point for a lot of people is a great way to build a direct relationship with a market that you can then sell other services to.I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s the case here. Maybe their business is actually a widget. I&#39;m saying that most businesses do far more than you can see from the outside."</p>

Apple themselves started with a niche computer back then that sold to less 500 hobbyists at a hobbyist computer shop. The next Apple would also have to build something extremely niche that no one is paying attention to. Something like this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"2 observations:- I happily paid for a very similar product about 10 years ago (it was full screen width and  had a brilliant timeline feature but otherwise very similar. It was broken when Snow Lion or something was released. I still look for an equivalent.)- Monthly payments forever for standalone apps is a big no no in my book. I get annoyed even just writing about it. Monthly payments for feature upgrades, perpetual license for last pud release (and some discount to encourage people to not jump on and off) is however totally OK with me. In this case however I think the price is generally too high anyway - for now."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting read, especially as someone poking w/ writing a parser in zig for fun :)One area of improvement worth mentioning in this area is that currently zig errors cannot be tagged with extra information, which tends to be important for surfacing things like line numbers in parsing errors. There was a proposal[0] to improve this and it&#39;s not the end of the world for me anyways (as a workaround, I&#39;m toying with returning error tokens similar to what treesitter does)On a different note, there&#39;s another cool zig thing I found recently that is mildly related to parsing: a common thing in parsers is mapping a parsed string to some pre-specified token type (e.g. the string `&#34;if&#34;` maps to an enum value `.if` or some such so you can later pattern match tokens efficiently). The normal way to avoid O(n) linear search over the keyword space is to use a hashmap (naively, one would use a runtime std.StringHashMap in zig). But I found an article from Andrew[0] about a comptime hashmap where a perfect hashing strategy is computed at comptime since we already know the search space ahead of time! Really neat stuff.[0] https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/2647[1] https://andrewkelley.me/post/string-matching-comptime-perfec..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I absolutely love parser combinators, and years ago I did a huge rewrite of my compiler compiler so that it&#39;d have the easiest possible parser combinators: simple string concatenation. grammarA + grammarB = grammarC. You can play with that here (https://jtree.treenotation.org/designer/). You still need to make a line change or two (good design after all, requires some integration), but it just works. Haven&#39;t seen anything beat it and not sure if that&#39;s possible.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A modern circuit simulator, that has a fully featured programable API, that can be run from a real modern programming language, would be a dream.
Every simulator i have used has been pretty limited in that way, or at least those features were not well advertized.
Even the insanely expensive ones.
I mean the most expensive ones (like $100K liscense type deals, like Cadence) are if anything even less modern from a user interaction perspective.My first academic paper 
(https://www.oxinabox.net/publications/White2015PsoTransistor...) was based on doing a search over parameters for the transistors being used in a circuit.
The way that whole thing work was by string mangling the netlist file to update the parameters.
Triggering the simulator on the commandline.
Getting it to output a CSV of the signals.
Parsing that CSV, and detecting edges and then measuring timing that way.
Then throwing it at a particle swarm optimizer to fine a new one.
That sucks from a user experience.
It&#39;s a super cool way to  solve problems though.
that would be so easy with a real API.Further, with julia being a differnetiable programming language, rather than having to use a particular swarm optimizer to search, I could have been differentiating it, and using some sophisticated gradient descent like LBGFS etc.I hope that some of the general tools like this will be an outcome of this project."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Huh, did not expect our press release to end up on HN, but I&#39;m the PI on this project, so AMA, I guess. Will jump into the questions already asked here and provide some context."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This seems very promising to me
One big part of circuit simulation is solving differential equations.
That&#39;s the whole inducer, resistor, capacitor thing.
Julia has hands down the best toolkit for differential equation solving.
Most circuit simulators today are going to be using old methods invented in the 60&#39;s-80&#39;s.
Neglecting the state of the art developments.Someone made a blog post recently comparing the time to simulate with LTSpice vs writng and solving the system in Julia
https://klaff.github.io/LTSvDEQ_1.jl.html
this is a very simple circuit, and they still got a 100x speed up.
Sure that is neglecting the time it takes to actually extract the differnetial equetion from the circuit.
But from what i hear that kind of thing is something this DARPA project will be working on.
And sure LTSpice isn&#39;t state of the art.
But still I find this indicative and promising."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have opinions about writing. So does Mr. Graham.What our opinions have in common is that they are not falsifiable. Unless we validate our conjectures with empirical evidence, we&#39;re really just sharing our taste.&#34;Oh no,&#34; you may say, &#34;I have tested it, and when I write a longer essay, my retweets and upvotes decline.&#34; Very well, but the plural of anecdote is not &#39;data.&#39;Somewhere else on the Internet, there is someone with poetic, dense writing. When they simplify it, their audience dries up.Writers and audiences find each other. If you try to measure the effect of your writing using only an audience that has selected your writing voluntarily, you are not measuring your effectiveness, you are measuring the degree to which your writing pleases people who already like your writing.Absent a properly constructed empirical approach, we might as well be discussing hemlines and necktie widths."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For grins I pasted PG&#39;s text into the demo readability tool at &lt;https://app.readable.com/text/?demo&gt;.&#39;Write Simply&#39; received an overall grade of &#39;A&#39;, and a very-approachable Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of 5.9. It&#39;s said to be readable by 100% of the literate general public, which is only 85% of the full general public.But, out of the 507 words and 38 sentences, 4 sentences were flagged as &#34;very long&#34; (over 30 syllables) and 15 as &#34;long&#34; (over 20 syllables).Two &#39;hard words&#39; – over 12 letters or over 4 syllables – were flagged, somewhat ironically: &#34;unnecessarily intellectual&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When something feels easy to read, it&#39;s not just a matter of using simple words. To maximize scanability, you need to use a mix of long and short words, and also mix long and short sentences, until you achieve a kind of &#34;flow&#34;. Famously, Dovlatov&#39;s prose (in Russian) avoids having words that start with the same letter in the same sentence, which is unnoticeable to the reader but makes the words just fly off the page.Another trick I&#39;ve found is making sure each word has unambiguous function. Here&#39;s some examples from other comments:I had this impression recently while reading the Akbarnama, which is a sort of court-approved biography of the Mughal Emperor Akbar, written by his Grand Vizier -- Was the Emperor written, or was it the biography?There are some cases in which your work demands a certain level of precision -- It could&#39;ve continued like &#34;in which your work demands are excessive&#34;, so you don&#39;t know if &#34;demands&#34; is a noun or a verb until you read on.That &#34;simple&#34; writing lasts longer is disproved by many works of literature that have made their way to us through history -- It could&#39;ve continued like &#34;that simple writing is not so simple&#34;, so you don&#39;t know if &#34;that&#34; is a conjunction or determiner until you read on.These are small things, but somehow the more I notice them, the clearer my writing becomes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some of these recipes seem decent if you&#39;re already somewhat experienced and have developed cook&#39;s intuition. Otherwise they&#39;re way too vague. For instance, the chicken parm recipe:- There should be a photo of how to slice the chicken breast. Saying &#34;through their width&#34; isn&#39;t good enough. I had to explain what &#34;lengthwise&#34; was once because my friend cut all the vegetables the exact opposite of it.- Pound with what? A lot of people will come up with very bad answers to this question.- How much flour? How much egg? I&#39;ll bet that plenty of beginners will use a tablespoon of flour or a singular egg- Ditto with oil. Beginners do not know how much oil is necessary to fry stuff- How high heat? You probably want to turn down the heat after the oil starts smoking.- Is there a single mention of adding salt? Sounds like a pretty bland recipeI don&#39;t mean to be too harsh but recipes are hard. There&#39;s a reason why professional recipe developers have developed certain standards like measurements, terms (folding batter, shimmering oil, etc.), and development procedures (cross testing)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Am I the only one who thinks that this concept is perfectly good, and all the things the site doesn&#39;t have are just great further development of the idea?What&#39;s wrong with a &#34;wikipedia for recipes&#34;? I would LOVE that.All the complaints about the quality of the recipes or the lack of more in-depth explaination of each one, some kind of  voting/reputation system for the recipes and for the submitters and the voters, Yes those are all good ideas to make the db more useful than just a db.But you have to start somewhere. How is the core idea here of a public cookbook not fundamentally awesome? I mean hello... GIT. Recipes that are living documents that can be honed over time, complete with viewable history of what changes have been made so you can decide if you agree with them. Branches and forks for all the hundred variations on any given thing. Revisions by better experts than the original submitter of some recipe.So, today on day one it doesn&#39;t already have the benefit of years of contributions and incremental improvements and revisions, Quelle Suprise!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The info about salt is plain wrong. Kosher salt is used for curing meat and as a mainly decorative addition to baking, you don&#39;t need to use it for cooking, it doesn&#39;t dissolve noticably slower in liquids. In fact when most recipes specify a volumetric measurement of salt they mean table salt and if you were to use kosher or sea salt you would be under seasoning due the reduced volume, nothing to do with how quickly it dissolves.You should definitely not be using large grain salt in baking for this reason, unless it is to decorate a finished product.Iodine deficiencies were and are very, very real. They&#39;re also on the rise due to food deserts and rising poverty. Iodised salt largely eliminated iodine deficiencies so people with poor knowledge of the history think they just went away. Most processed food does not contained iodised salt, so table salt is an essential source or iodine for a great many people around the world.Idosing salt was and is one of the greatest public health success stories of the 20th century, do not talk about it like some conspiracy by government."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Brings back some memories because this was the first &#34;large&#34; program available to me for study when I was first learning to program, around 1978.Having talked my way into using the local university EE dept&#39;s 11/45, I found the source tree was mounted (they had a 90MB CDC &#34;washing machine&#34; drive) and decided to print it out on the 132-col Tally dot-matrix printer.Some minutes into this, the sysadmin bursts into the terminal room, angrily asking &#34;who&#39;s running this big print job&#34;.I timidly raise my hand. He asks what I&#39;m printing. I tell him the C compiler source code because I want to figure out how it works.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Plastic card distribution can be extremely frustrating, because the only time you need it to happen is when you don&#39;t actually want it to be needed (fruad, loss, damage, new account, whatever). You just want to fucking buy things, not deal with shipping incompetence, you know?This reminds me of a time I was traveling and had to cancel a lost credit card. I told the card company that I was not at home,was definitely outside of the country, not going to be home, definitely staying at an address that was not the home address listed on the account, wanted the card to be sent to _me_ and not my _home_, gave them my foreign delivery address 5 times over as many weeks, got 5 separate promises that the card was definitely going to reach me at my outside-of-the-country-and-not-at-home location in just a few business days, and the card never showed up. So I just gave up. And then, when I finally went home there were 5 goddamn cards in my mail slot.Honestly this reason alone makes Apple&#39;s purely digital credit card my favorite. Need a new card number? Just push a button. No incompetent shipping divisions with 5 hops and as many business days between you and your ability to buy things when your card number is breached."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I live in the Netherlands, a country that primarily uses debit cards. I do have a credit card that I rarely use. Only when I buy something in the USA for example.Some years back I moved to a different city. About a year later I wanted to make a purchase with my credit card. I found out it had expired. I rang the bank and asked for a new one. They promised to send it to me. It never arrived. Rang again, got the same promise, and still no card. When I called them the third time, the employee found out my old address was still in their database. Turns out the credit card department had a different client database then the debit card department (who had my new address).To change my address, I had to log in to their site. They weren&#39;t allowed to change it on the phone. As soon I tried to log in, I noticed I forgot my password. When I clicked &#39;reset password&#39;, there was a new surprise: they send the new password by snail mail.... to the old address of course!So I had to go in person to the house I used to live in and explain the situation. I asked them to ring me when the letter with my name on it arrived on their doorstep. Luckily the people who now live in my old house were very nice and gave me the letter!"</p>

        z    string
    }

with sentinel strings like &#34;\04&#34; and &#34;\0\06&#34; for IPv4 and IPv6-no-zone was rejected.  Sure, this 8 bytes larger for the implicit string length, but its still not terribly large, and the string comparisons in the normal IPv4 / IPv6 case are very cheap (just length and pointer equality checks).  And it doesn&#39;t require opening the unsafe jar.  Was the extra 8 bytes enough to disqualify it?  Or are the authors worried about the fact that this may allocate on each parse of an IPv6-with-zone?"</p>

I&#39;ve had success using camelot-py (https://camelot-py.readthedocs.io) to extract tabular data from PDFs (for images, I use imagemagick to convert those to PDF).

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s been said many times here over the past few years, and it&#39;ll get said a lot right here today, but rule of thumb: never  enable WiFi on a TV except maybe temporarily to do an update or something. And even then only if it&#39;s absolutely necessary. Get a Roku or an Apple TV or a game console or whatever you want for watching streaming services. Never use what&#39;s built in to the TV, not just for privacy reasons but because it always seems to be a terrible experience compared to running Hulu, Netflix, etc. on anything else. But for privacy too- the TV companies were incredibly egregious about privacy years ago and AFAICT it&#39;s only gotten worse since then."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At this stage, these threads are getting kind of boring, it&#39;s clear that almost all manufacturers are in a race to the bottom in terms of cost - and now the only way that they can compete on price is by bundling adverts into your internet connected set.All talk of &#34;voting with your wallet&#34; doesn&#39;t work when there are literally no &#34;smart&#34; consumer sets that can compete on features and are without adverts.If you really wish to have your smart TV connected to the internet - I&#39;ve listed some of the adservers that you can block at : https://factory-reset.com/wiki/Smart_TV_Adverts - however this is also going to be a tiresome game, as manufacturers will just seek to find more creative ways to serve adverts.The reality is though, if you want to avoid this behaviour - buy the set that has the screen that you want and only connect it to the internet if you wish to do a software update. Only software update if your set has a bug that the advertised firmware actually fixes, as newer updates tend to add more &#34;features&#34; - adverts, slower apps etc etc. Use something like and AppleTV or a Roku device connected via HDMI if you really need smart features - but be aware even the likes of Roku / Nvidia Shield / FireTV will at some point in the future also be serving you adverts.I&#39;ve also heard that some sets are trying to find open wifi networks - if you are really that worried, cut the traces on the wifi card inside the set and hope that manufacturers don&#39;t start to use ethernet over HDMI."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Back in the late 90s, I implemented the first systematic monitoring of WalMart Store&#39;s global network, including all of the store routers, hubs (not switches yet!) and 900mhz access points.
Did you know that WalMart had some stores in Indonesia? They did until 1998.So when https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_1998_riots_of_Indonesia started happening, we heard some harrowing stories of US employees being abducted, among other things.Around that same time, the equipment in the Jakarta store started sending high temperature alerts prior to going offline. Our NOC wasn&#39;t able to reach anyone in the store.The alerts were quite accurate: that was one of the many buildings that had been burned down in the riots. I guess it&#39;s slightly surprising that electrical power to the equipment in question lasted long enough to allow temperature alerting. Most of our stores back then used satellite for their permanent network connection, so it&#39;s possible telcom died prior to the fire reaching the UPC office.In a couple of prominent places in the home office, there were large cutouts of all of the countries WalMart was in at the time up on the walls. A couple of weeks after this event, the Indonesia one was taken down over the weekend and the others re-arranged."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A bigger problem in my opinion is that Rust has chosen to follow the poll-based model (you can say that it was effectively designed around epoll), while the completion-based one (e.g. io-uring and IOCP) with high probability will be the way of doing async in future (especially in the light of Spectre and Meltdown).Instead of carefully weighing advantages and disadvantages of both models, the decision was effectively made on the ground of &#34;we want to ship async support as soon as possible&#34; [1]. Unfortunately, because of this rush, Rust got stuck with a poll-based model with a whole bunch of problems without a clear solution in sight (async drop anyone?). And instead of a proper solution for self-referencing structs (yes, a really hard problem), we did end up with the hack-ish Pin solution, which has already caused a number of problems since stabilization and now may block enabling of noalias by default [2].Many believe that Rust async story was unnecessarily rushed. While it may have helped to increase Rust adoption in the mid term, I believe it will cause serious issues in the longer term.[1]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/62149#issuecomment-...

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not totally sure what the author is asking for, apart from refcounting and heap allocations that happen behind your back. In my experience async Rust is heavily characterised by tasks (Futures) which own their data. They have to - when you spawn it, you&#39;re offloading ownership of its state to an executor that will keep it alive for some period of time that is out of the spawning code&#39;s control. That means all data/state brought in at spawn time must be enclosed by move closures and/or shared references backed by an owned type (Arc) rather than &amp; or &amp;mut.If you want to, nothing is stopping you emulating a higher-level language - wrap all your data in Arc&lt;_&gt; or Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;_&gt;&gt; and store all your functions as trait objects like Box&lt;dyn Fn(...)&gt;. You pay for extra heap allocations and indirection, but avoid specifying generics that spread up your type hierarchy, and no longer need to play by the borrow checker&#39;s rules.What Rust gives us is the option to _not_ pay all the costs I mentioned in the last paragraph, which is pretty cool if you&#39;re prepared to code for it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like to joke that the best way to encounter the ugliest parts of Rust is to implement an HTTP router. Hours and days of boxing and pinning, Futures transformations, no async fn in traits, closures not being real first class citizens, T: Send + Sync + &#39;static, etc.I call this The Dispatch Tax. Because any time you want more flexibility than the preferred static dispatch via generics can give you - oh, so you just want to store all these async fn(HttpRequest) -&gt; Result&lt;HttpResponse&gt;, right? - you immediately start feeling the inconvenience and bulkiness of dynamic dispatch. It&#39;s like Rust is punishing you for using it. And with async/await taking this to a new level altogether, because you are immediately forced to understand how async funcs are transformed into ones that return Futures, how Futures are transformed into anon state machine structs; how closures are also transformed to anon structs. It&#39;s like there&#39;s no type system anymore, only structs.That&#39;s one of the reasons, I think, why Go has won the Control Plane. Sure, projects like K8s, Docker, the whole HashiCorp suite are old news. But it&#39;s interesting and telling that even solid Rust shops like PingCAP are using Go for their control plane. It seems to me that there&#39;s some fundamental connection between flexibility of convenient dynamic dispatch and control plane tasks. And of course having the default runtime and building blocks like net and http in the standard library is a huge win.That said, after almost three months of daily Rust it does get better. To the point when you can actually feel that some intuition and genuine understanding is there, and you can finally work on your problems instead of fighting with the language. I just wish that the initial learning curve wasn&#39;t so high."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really think that Windows 2000-era Windows Forms had the user experience nailed perfectly.  It wasn&#39;t the prettiest UI paradigm ever, but it was the most functional and easiest to teach.  Nothing was omitted, and the user was shown everything they needed to see in order to get a complete idea of the state of the application.I don&#39;t think that efforts to hide UI elements that aren&#39;t in use is going to prove to be a good idea when we look back at today from the future.Here&#39;s a good rule, in my mind: Don&#39;t hide UI elements from the user.  End of rule.  I do not care if it looks better without whatever UI element.  The toolbox in my garage would look better if I could only see the tools I needed at the time I need them, and I would return that toolbox (or never buy it in the first place) because it is constantly lying to me about the state of the toolbox, which is absolutely insulting position for a toolbox designer to adopt."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I have a really hard time believing anyone would chose this as opposed to some design lead at Apple pushing a weird personal preference for tidyness on their entire user baseMaybe I don&#39;t understand completely what he is referring to, but on mobile I certainly prefer having a bit more space than a always visible scrollbar. It is usually clear enough that there is more to see below the fold.Scrollbars used to be sometimes useful to get a sense of how much content there is. But everyone using infinite scroll broke that, not apple."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"An interesting output of this is, if you keep scrollbars visible, you&#39;ll find that a lot of websites end up with weird extra scrollbars on random elements.What often causes this is some HTML element overflowing by one pixel, but no one saw it during the QA process because all the webdevs were using Macs, which have invisible scrollbars by default. I always enable visible scrollbars on my dev computers specifically so I can catch problems like this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;  That way, when candidates were pitched to us with &#34;X years of MOVA experience&#34;, we knew that somebody was full of it.I&#39;d put my money on the recruiter. I once had an excruciatingly awkward interview at a company on an industrial estate in the middle of nowhereland with no train station nearby that took me bloody ages to get to… which was actually going well until they asked me about my long experience with Exchange 2000. I had no experience with Exchange 2000, so I told them, and watched their faces drop.That was specifically why they wanted to speak to me. The recruiter had inserted it onto the copy of the CV he sent to them. I&#39;m surprised I&#39;m not still doing time for murder.What I&#39;m not surprised about though is why they do it. I&#39;ve been to plenty of interviews where my CV hasn&#39;t been given more than a glance. At moments like those I feel a deep sense of pessimism. The whole recruitment process seems broken from end to end and has been for a while."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of an anecdote I read once, maybe in Liars Poker, about how lots of people applying to this hedge fund put &#34;Chess&#34; on their resume somewhere thinking it made them seem like a deep or strategic thinker. As it happened, at this hedge fund there worked a former Soviet master or grandmaster ranked player. And so, whenever interviewing any candidate who claimed great proficiency with chess on their resume, at the end of the interview they&#39;d take the candidate to go play the master."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So, let me get this straight - you lie about your job requirements, but get all bent out of shape when the candidates lie right back at you?Brilliant.I can’t think of a better example of why hiring is broken; of how unequal the power dynamic is between employers and employees."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This would benefit the Northeast quite a lot.Assume that your average adult works 9-5, and your average school child is in school 8-3. Broad strokes, these are the two groups to focus on. I know most adults commute earlier than 9, and most students are up earlier than 8, but it&#39;s safe to say that most Americans are up-and-at-&#39;em from 8-5.On the shortest day of the year in Boston, sunrise is at 7:10am and sunset is at 4:14PM. Including civil twilight (&#34;it&#39;s still kind of daytime&#34;) extends it to 6:38am to 4:46PM.Even on the shortest day of the year, if you wake up even before 7 you&#39;re waking up in daylight. But, sunset is super early. Every working adult is commuting home in actual nighttime.Shift that forward 1 hour, and it gets light at 7:30AM and gets dark at 5:45PM. While slightly darker for students in the morning, it&#39;s immensely better for working adults, who at least get some daylight in the evenings, and not actual nighttime before 5PM."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The first few articles I could find on this topic neglected to identify the senators co-sponsoring the bill.  Here&#39;s a list from boston.cbslocal.com:* Roy Blunt (R-MO)* Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS)* James Lankford (R-OK)* Ed Markey (D-MA)* Marco Rubio (R-FL)* Rick Scott (R-FL)* Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI)* Ron Wyden (D-OR)Wikipedia has some history on similar, short-lived efforts in the past:&gt; Seasonal observation of DST was first enacted in the US during World Wars I and II, as an attempt conserve fuel. The practice was unpopular and promptly repealed after each war; however, lobbyists from the petroleum industry lobbied to restore DST, as they had noticed it actually increased fuel consumption.&gt; Permanent DST in the US was briefly enacted by President Nixon in 1974, in response to the 1973 oil crisis. The proposal was initially supported by an estimated 79% of the public; that support dropped to 42% after its first winter, owing to the harshness of dark winter mornings that permanent DST creates. An estimated six school children were also killed by motorists due to the new law.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_time_observation_in_...On the eastern edge of the enormous Eastern time zone, I&#39;m sympathetic to permanent DST, but I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s a good idea nationwide.  I would probably be in favor of the proposed Atlantic time zone, though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"DST has become my favorite &#34;holiday&#34; as an adult. Seasonal depression evaporates when I can see the sun after I finish working for the day. I can go work in my yard, or wash my car after work instead of having to cram it in the middle of the day. I feel more motivated to go do other things in the evening instead of feeling like its time for bed at 5pm."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Fun stuff I read since his passing yesterday in the Dutch newspapers.Although he had indeed humility about his contribution to the cassette tape and the CD, he also was frustrated what Sony did in this department. He wanted the CD to be 11,5 cm instead of 12 cm and was disappointed Sony sold the first CD and invented the concept of a walkman instead of Philips.His opinion about cassette tapes and vinyl having a revival because of the analog experience?&#34;I am not a psychologist, but that music experience is of course all nonsense. Nothing can match the sound of the CD. It is absolutely noise and rumble free. That never worked with tape. But who am I to say what&#39;s better, I&#39;m over ninety and have old ears. I have made a lot of record players and I know that the distortion with vinyl is much higher. But some people call it &#34;warm audio.&#34; I think people mostly hear what they want to hear. But there are always madmen who want to look back to the past. There is always a market for that.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s fascinating that someone, within their lifetime, can invent something, watch it become a household item in the entire world and then fade so far into obscurity that new generations only find out about it from encyclopedias."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The cassette tape really is an astounding invention, or I guess a great packaging and convenience improvement, compared to existing tape formats.A revolution in music portability, distribution (both licensed and DIY), home recording, you name it. All kicked off by &#34;little boys who had fun playing&#34;.Tape trading is still big in certain circles, especially within the punk and black metal milieus. Some albums, EPs and demos get their only physical releases ever on limited edition cassette tapes, both because it is inexpensive, easy to DIY and fits the lo-fi aesthetics.Where vinyl has a strong presence among audiophiles (for various mostly imagined reasons) and was always a format for those with money to spend, the humble cassette tape was the format of choice for the youth, the working class and people on the go, and it still carries that down-to-earth appeal today.I know at least for me growing up in the 80s and 90s in a family with just enough money to get by, hand-me-down cassette tapes were how I experienced music, not to mention how we experimented with recording our voices and playing them back at different speeds, and learned what happened when you play the same bit of tape over and over again because it had a really funny bit on it. Getting my first CD and CD player was exotic and felt like science fiction in comparison to the trusty old cassette tape.I keep a drawer of a few old and obsolete physical formats that meant something special to me. My cassette tapes of Deep Purple In Rock, Machine Head, Sgt. Pepper&#39;s, and The Triumph of Death are there, next to the 3.5&#34; floppy disks and Minidiscs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Absolutely worth it, however I&#39;d offer a few short tips:1. Try to stay in one place for a few months, minimum. If you can stay a year or two, do that. Jumping from city to city every week seems exciting at first, but it quickly makes everywhere feel the same.2. To quote Lao Tzu, when your work is done, forget it. If you work remotely, actively disconnect at the end of the day. It&#39;s too easy to be constantly plugged into the English-speaking media world and ignore what&#39;s right in front of you.3. Try to blend in and adopt local clothing, culture, foods, etc. Read books by local authors, watch local films. A bit obvious, maybe, but I&#39;ve met many people who insisted on only eating Western food, reading Harry Potter, and watching Netflix while abroad. At that point, why even bother traveling?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I quit my job and went travelling I used this framework:1. Go via land. You see everything in between all the places you should see as a tourist. You immerse yourself in how a place actually feels. You meet people who aren’t just trying to extract money from you. I cycled, because I like cycling, but any form of transport works.2. My algorithm was something like “Go east. Stay somewhere if it’s interesting, until you get bored. Continue going east.” I didn’t have a fixed itinerary, but I did have some framework.That was the basis of it, I think. I cycled from London to Italy, stopped for a while in Italy, cycled on to Greece, then fell in love (with the place and somebody in particular). I met some of my best friends, worked on side projects, volunteered for charities, and ended up staying there for several months. I skipped forward to India on a plane, cycled across India, then returned back to Greece.My partner in Greece wanted to visit the Middle East and Central Asia, but she wasn’t quite as excited about cycling through the desert as I was, so we bought a van and drove — to Central Asia, and everything in between.My framework worked extraordinarily well. If I have one regret, I think it was not making an effort to interact with more people. You do that a lot more naturally when travelling by land, but you still need to put in effort to make it happen.For example, I was up late in a bar in an Italian village, and met one of the locals. It was a long cycle ride back to the place I was staying so he offered me his spare room. Turns out he lived with his parents and the next day his elderly Italian mother cooked us pasta for lunch. Possibly one of the best meals of my life.I wish I had done more of that. Just hanging out in bars and making friends. And not tourist bars — real bars. Knowing the local language better would probably help."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Did not quit my job, but instead went full remote in 2018 (age 55 at the time).Still doing it, but the pandemic forced me to stay in one country for just about a year now.In that year I put down roots, got long term visas and maybe will spend another few years there while we see how things shape out this and next year.But ya, 2-3 months minimum in a place is what you need, with just a small backpack.Make local friends.Don&#39;t hang around or go out with other tourists or expats. This is the kiss of death.Make it a rule to eat only the food of the city or the country that you find yourself in.Learn a few words of the language &#34;hello&#34;, &#34;thank you&#34;, &#34;bathroom&#34;, &#34;stop&#34;, etc.Don&#39;t think people are less than you. They&#39;re not. They want the same things as you.As an introvert, being forced to make friends with people who speak another language and look the opposite of me (black guy in Asia), was exactly the ticket.Well recommended to do it.The main thing I would say - is have a mission when you travel. Seeing the sights and drinking the bars and mingling with other tourists and shtupping the local girls is fun, but not a mission.You will get bored after some time of doing that.Have some particular work or meaning to each day to keep you grounded, and you can do the moving around for a super-long time.You will find that you&#39;ll set some schedules for work, play and discoveries - regardless of where you are.Just don&#39;t quit your job. Instead go remote (even if you have savings). Ok?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I once wrote a negative review of a business on Google, and it went up, but when I went to look at the business&#39;s reviews under my wife&#39;s Google account, it was not there. I waited an hour and checked. Then a couple hours and checked. Then a day. It never showed up.I posted the review under her account and did the same checks for my account. It never showed up.I do not know why it didn&#39;t show up, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the business had been able to pay money to Google to be able to check reviews before they went live and mark them as spam.Edit: Because some commenters did not seem to get the implied message, what I am actually implying is that in this context, or any context, I don&#39;t trust Google. I have no evidence of what commenters said I have claimed. (I have not claimed anything; I just said I wouldn&#39;t be surprised.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My personal experience as a business owner. We do not care about reviews since we are a B2B software house. Our customers are mid- to large-size companies so they do not play reviews but lawyers if our service wasn&#39;t of highest quality :) My personal preference would be to prevent 3rd party companies like google from publishing reviews if the business owner doesn&#39;t want them.Anyway - no customer gave us any review on google and our website is full of recommendation letters. But at some point google started nagging our employees to put reviews since they visited our office.Guess what happened. We got our first review from an employee we were not happy with and planned to gracefully close our cooperation with.This is against Google policy. So we complained. We had to spend significant time to get to a real person at Google and get this removed.After a year similar situation happened. I thought ok - this should be easy the second time. No way - this time all the emails we knew did not respond, we could not reach anybody. We flagged the review several times. We could not do anything about that.It is like a person can just put a shit on your office wall and you could not clean it. And shit owner - Google doesn&#39;t care.We were forced to play by the rules and we bought 50 reviews to paint our wall. The company that provided this service was a Google partner. They explained that 80-90% of reviews of everything is written for money.And the best thing - once we started getting our reviews, the flagged reviews were finally removed. Seems like AI decided the we are a good company.Do you think we did something wrong? Immoral? Or just played business on a not leveled field?And to summarize. I do not care about reviews. And we have money to fight back with lawyers or PR. But it is sad that some businesses don&#39;t have this option and somebody (Google) can harm them through reviews they did not ask for."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"An interesting thing about paid reviews - you can prove that the reviews are fake, but you usually can&#39;t prove that the business itself actually paid for those reviews. In a hypothetical world where companies with fake reviews are regularly discovered and lambasted in public, it&#39;s easy to imagine a sinister metagame where unscrupulous small businesses can buy bad good reviews (i.e. 5-star reviews that are obviously fake) for their competitors to make them seem sketchy. The folks selling the fake reviews certainly don&#39;t care who&#39;s paying. There&#39;s no obvious solution to me for that potential problem aside from stopping fake reviews before they&#39;re posted (which feels like the kind of thing that&#39;s much harder than it sounds); thankfully it doesn&#39;t appear to be a very common thing yet."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What really frustrates me is I had already turned off all of the &#34;personalized advertising&#34; toggles I could find prior to this.  But I log in to turn these off and the ones I&#39;d touched before were back on.Increasingly, the &#34;if you&#39;re not paying then you&#39;re the product&#34; saying is bunk.  I am paying, almost $400 per month, for quite a few SIMs to be active on T-Mobile&#39;s network yet that&#39;s not enough.  They have to harvest data about me for even more.(Don&#39;t come at me with the &#34;a company is legally required to take in all of the money it possibly can for its shareholders&#34; bit.  Nothing says a company can&#39;t make a reasonable business decision to leave money on the table.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From Mac Rumors:T-Mobile customers can opt out of the advertising program through the T-Mobile app or the T-Mobile website. In the app, access the &#34;MORE&#34; tab, select Advertising &amp; Analytics, and toggle off &#34;Use my data to make ads more relevant to me.&#34;On the website(https://www.t-mobile.com/signin), choose &#34;My Account,&#34; select &#34;Profile, Privacy, and Notifications, then choose Advertising &#34;&amp; Analytics. From there, turn the opt-in toggle off. Sprint users can change the setting through the Sprint website. Select &#34;Visit My Account,&#34; choose &#34;Preferences&#34; and then scroll down to &#34;Manage advertising and analytics preferences.&#34; From here, turn off &#34;Use my data to make ads more relevant to me.&#34;Took me a few reloads throughout this process"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"John Legere, who was responsible for T-Mobile&#39;s norm-shattering &#34;uncarrier&#34; direction, resigned last year after the Sprint merger went through.Now that T-Mobile isn&#39;t a scrappy underdog anymore, I think we can expect more American business-as-usual customer exploitation from them."</p>
