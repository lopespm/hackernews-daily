								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The Uber propaganda here in this thread is insane. Taxi’s maybe have been shit but that does not in anyway justify Uber breaking the law to conquer the market (btw, now that they’ve done that, they’ve also turned to shit because it was unsustainable).Perfect may be the enemy of good but we shouldn’t excuse companies using endless VC money and law breaking to achieve something that’s marginally better for consumers.Obviously there are some exceptions to this in the comments but generally, in modern countries where the taxi firms aren’t run by literal mafias and killing people, we should condemn Uber’s behaviour."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Still a million times better than what it replaced. About 20 years ago I was working with the Australian taxi cab industry. The hq of the regulatory authority shared the address of the main payment system. The regulatory authority was made up of representatives of each taxi cab company that each had one vote. There was one taxi company (the one that controlled the payment system allowed) with 200+ subsidiaries that made up that organization. If anyone tried to get into the taxi industry they&#39;d use their 200 votes to say they are not allowed by regulations. This was a company making 2billion a year in one state of Australia alone (NSW). It was so incredibly fucking corrupt and i am thankful to Uber Lyft and all the other incumbents for managing to get their foot in. It required dirty dealing to get past this corruption."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Uber isn&#39;t the most ethical company for sure but here in Brussels the taxi industry is pretty shady as well.Getting a taxi license costs an exorbitant amount of money and it&#39;s done through all kinds of dodgy deals.There&#39;s 1-2 companies that have a monopoly on the whole industry.There&#39;s weird rules about which types of taxis can &#34;serve&#34; the airport, akin to what mobsters are responsible for collecting trash in what areas.You&#39;ll often get &#34;sorry the payment terminal is out of order, cash only&#34; BS.A study a few years ago showed the main taxi company, according to their tax documents, earned a ridiculously low amount of money per day (= obvious dodging of taxes).They clearly refused to innovate for years. When you called their number you&#39;d get some unintelligible voice on the other end that would give you about 10 sec to state your details before they&#39;d clearly run out of patience.You could only request pickups at specific addresses that would then be connected to your phone number / profile. So &#34;pick me up on this street corner&#34; was impossible.The last time we called one for a ride to the airport they didn&#39;t show up at the agreed time so we got an Uber. Taxi company called us many times screaming insults down the phone, followed by an offensive email with an invitation to pay and threats of small claims courts.In light of all that, I have zero problems with someone else moving in fast to break things."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;Google makes $40bn...If I can create something that just a tiny fraction of people find useful, then I can create a huge amount of value.You conflate two meanings of value: monetary value, and intrinsic value. Search engines are intrinsically but not monetarily valuable to users. Search engines are monetarily, but not intrinsically, valuable to advertisers. You can get into trouble when you conflate these two meaning of &#34;value&#34;.In fact, right here is the pivot on which the internet goes from an idealistic shang-ri-la for geeks, to a commercial hellscape for the unwashed masses. It is surprisingly easy to create intrinsic value with computers! You see it all day every day on HN: some geek had a thought, spends a weekend making it, and then deploys a solution.It is surprisingly hard to extract monetary value from an intrinsically valuable solution. In fact, I believe that creating artificial scarcity is the hardest part of building an internet business, requiring invention on par with the intrinsically valuable part - and yet its the very thing that idealists rail against.(And making something artificially scarce does seem morally repugnant. And yet I don&#39;t see any other way to pay developers. Full stop. Open source software + consulting fees is a good way to go, but that can&#39;t apply to hosted search for the public. Well I guess it could, you could teach businesses how to game your own engine!)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Perhaps a better approach would be building an open source www index or even a full current cache - as an enabler for people to build their own search engines?Right now it is extremely difficult to build your own web crawler that would compete with Google. And that is not because of the technology, but because multiple sites will prevent your bot from accessing them if you&#39;re not Google or Bing - either through robots.txt, or through directly banning your IP if it&#39;s trying to crawl and it&#39;s not a confirmed google-bot.Having a non-profit, open source, crawler that keeps an up to date index (or web cache) of the web would help competition spring up."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Disclaimer: I work for Google, though far away from Search.Regardless of search engine design, there&#39;s HUGE money in SEO. Any successful search engine will be gamed. Do you have the developer power to go red-queen against all the large companies in the world?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"(disclaimer: lead brand manager, been at the table of a lot of the meetings where these logo changes happen.)There&#39;s a few different reasons (especially depending on the company) why that these happen, but I personally think it boils down to two unintuitive quasi-psychological reasons.- When suits are fumbling around looking for a new shiny project that&#39;ll give them a sense of &#34;legacy&#34; and their fingerpints all over (that won&#39;t affect immediate profits), somewhere in marketing and brand is usually the first place they&#39;ll grab.  If wins, fantastic, they&#39;ve secured their legacy both in a career-spanning sense and at the company itself with a bonus. If it fails disastrously, easy enough to quietly switch back to the old and to save face by tackling a different project.- Sort of relatedly, a lot of marketing suits hate feeling &#34;left out&#34; of trends; it&#39;s something I loathe about the industry, the hyper-focus and optimization of being at the crest of new trends (when arguably they&#39;re usually shittier than the previous ones). Oftentimes their entire salary / sense of purpose of being at the job is tied into with presenting the latest and greatest, and insecure designers will be too happy to be enablers.(My opinion may be a minority of the industry itself as if it were me, we&#39;d be back to 90&#39;s era logos for the sheer zany quality.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article is confused about the difference between a logo and a word mark, which is what they are showing. Big brands are super pedantic about how and where logo marks and word marks are used. You shouldn&#39;t be seeing these word marks in contexts that are not already dripping in branding for the company.Look at the Pinterest Brand guidelines (https://business.pinterest.com/en-au/brand-guidelines/) and you well find them saying: &#34;Only use the Pinterest badge (please don’t use our word mark)&#34;. The Pinterest badge is the exact same stylised letter P from the old wordmark. So, almost everywhere you encounter a Pinterest logo it will be the stylised graphic. They can do that because enough people recognise the brand that they can drop the &#34;interest&#34;.The Facebook logo is an even weirder example because they are comparing the old Facebook app word mark with the newer Facebook-the-company word mark. That logo was specifically designed to look different from the app. Now that Facebook is now Meta, that uppercase logo has been retired.Microsoft, Facebook, Pinterest, Spotify and Airbnb all have stylised logo marks. eBay and Google use word marks, but are brightly coloured and immediately recognisable 99% of the time they are seen."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These are just the word marks, not the full logos.I mocked up a comparison of the logos (Microsoft/Airbnb/Spotify/Pinterest rarely use their word marks without the accompanying icon) and they start to retain a _little_ more personality, at least for the tech comparison.https://imgur.com/a/v5yKD3oIt still seems fair to say they&#39;re more bland than past iterations, though. The theme is ”[optional icon] + sans serif word mark”, and it&#39;s a good example of “small m minimalism” — a kind of unthinking collective march toward an absence of detail — touched on by The Cultural Tutor in this thread:https://twitter.com/culturaltutor/status/1538211892707086338&gt; Perhaps minimalist design is so prevalent because we no longer have anything to say.&gt; You don&#39;t need me to explain what the Gothic cathedral says, for example.&gt; But the skyscraper? It doesn&#39;t say anything, really. It&#39;s just... there.&gt; And suddenly everything, everywhere starts to look the same.&gt; Absolute neutrality. No detail. No identity.&gt; What does that say about us?"</p>

It’s all over Twitter etc., too.[1] https://web.archive.org/web/20220710064519/https://www.daily...[2] https://web.archive.org/web/20220710061754/https://gendai.is...[3] https://web.archive.org/web/20220710062542/https://news.yaho..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a lot of words for the basic conjecture that he was killed by/for being a moonie.The problem with this reporting is that it takes the killer&#39;s supposed words at face value.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Lichess is amazing given how little they receive in funding. The interface is miles ahead of commercial competitors.They also handle guest plays much better. I&#39;ve faced less cheating bots and no annoying pop ups on lichess when playing as a guest compared to chess.comCan anyone point me to how they handle cheating detection? I would love a high level overview of how it works especially when you have no data on the player.fun nugget: HN users hosted tournaments on lichess at the start of the pandemic [0]0] https://lichess.org/team/hacker-news"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Always excited when chess pops up on HN once a month or so. As someone who picked it up as a hobby in December, I can attest that lichess is a great app and site for folks looking to get back into the game or get started (I’m also a premium chess.com member as I use both products).For those of you thinking about picking up chess, I’d highly recommend watching the Chess Brah “Building Habits” series on YouTube. Watch the first five or so videos, and just start practicing those habits in rapid games (recommend 15 minute with 10 second increment on lichess, which shows up as 15+10). Embrace the losses, and just keep working on not hanging your pieces for free.If you’re intimidated by playing other humans, you can try the “Maia 1” bot on Lichess. It’ll likely beat you up for a while if you’re a beginner, but it’s a bot designed to play more like a human, and it’ll help you get the reps to feel more comfortable playing other humans.From there, just enjoy yourself. Chess can be frustrating because by design you always lose about 50% or your takes, but once you learn to accept the losses, it can be a great mental exercise to keep your brain sharp."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yes! The front-end code for Lichess is what got me to learn Mithril years ago. Really clean code for such a complex application. Here’s a great example:https://github.com/lichess-org/lichobile/blob/master/src/ui/..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For the past few weeks, I&#39;ve been collecting and refining prompting tricks for getting GPT-3 to emit and understand various types of non-prose output. Many of these are discussed in the Twitter thread the OP links to, but I&#39;d like to highlight a few of my favorites here too.- GPT-3 can produce simple SVG diagrams (https://twitter.com/goodside/status/1545883023719239689) from an English description, or incrementally modify a given SVG diagram (https://twitter.com/goodside/status/1545888869207400454).- GPT-3 can produce diagrams using Graphviz dot notation (https://twitter.com/goodside/status/1545109709035900928), including diagrams that incorporate real-world context (https://twitter.com/goodside/status/1545112039147847682) not given in the prompt.- It can emit and understand HTML and Markdown, including table markup — e.g., &#34;Produce an HTML table giving the members of the Beatles and their instruments&#34;- It can accept/emit multiple named files, with arbitrary content, simply by embedding those files as values in a larger JSON/YAML document. Here, (https://twitter.com/goodside/status/1545848754883919872) I demonstrate completing the file tree of a trivial Python package given a README.md.- It can understand the raw JSON file contents of .ipynb files, successfully following directions given to it in markdown cells, emitting multiple code cells, etc.While all this is fun, as many people have pointed out the model has a bad habit of &#34;hallucinating&#34; — producing highly specific, wrong output. Avoiding this (https://twitter.com/goodside/status/1545793388871651330) is more of an art than a science. Be highly skeptical of any output you get from GPT-3, and search for verification methods where you can."</p>

 input a,c;
 output y;
 assign y= c ? a : 1&#39;bz; 
endmodule*This code is a Verilog module that defines three inputs (a, c, y) and one output (y). The output y is assigned to the value of a if c is true, otherwise it is assigned to 1&#39;bz.*What is 1&#39;bz ?*1&#39;bz is a Verilog constant that represents a bit value of &#39;z&#39;, which is used to indicate a high impedance state.*Why is high impedance used ?*High impedance is used in digital circuits to allow multiple drivers to share a single bus without contention. When two or more drivers attempt to drive the same bus at the same time, a contention can occur and the bus voltage can become undefined. By using high impedance, drivers can avoid contention and allow the bus to remain stable.*Give me a testbench for this module*module testbench;

What you are doing is copying the html/css of a website and then exporting it to an autogenerated react component(s).2) It would be great if the demo video showed the React component generated.  Is all of the html thrown into 1 component?  Is the resulting html clean?  Or is it cluttered with html attributes that aren&#39;t actually needed?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s not just biology. It&#39;s basically every subject in high school. The amount of knowledge in the world has exploded in the last 100 - 150 years, yet our school system refuses to adapt and pretends we&#39;re still in the early 1900s. Back then you actually could get a good and reasonably in-depth overview of what makes the world work before going to college or work.But those kinds of aspirations are completely futile these days. People in the ministries of education and other responsible bodies will argue that high school&#39;s purpose is not to educate on a subject in depth but to give a broad overview of many subjects but that&#39;s completely besides the point. Because the point is that the only way that they are able to &#34;give you a broad overview&#34; these days is by force-feeding you ever more facts and knowledge in sliced up classes, compressed into ever more shallow and boring text books and then letting you puke it all out in brain dead exams, many times a year for many different subjects, in parallel. Bulimia learning.Which is beyond sad, because basically every subject can be the source of wonder and amazement if taught the right way and with enough time to explain and explore. Which is why we need to let our kids choose the subjects they are interested early in school and get comfortable with the fact that they won&#39;t have any knowledge about other subjects when they leave high school. There simply isn&#39;t any other way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had been putting off quantum physics and time was running out. I was worried forth semester physics at MIT was going to be tough, but then through some miracle of providence the EE department decided that a solid state chemistry chemistry class plus Into to Biology could be substituted for quantum physics.Because I had already taken a solid state chemistry class, all I had to do was take a basic introductory biology class; how difficult could that be? It turns out that biology is hard, very hard.The other students that filled the large lecture hall weren’t ordinary first year students; they were pre-med students. Instead of relaxing by the swimming pool reading a colorful text with pictures of jelly fish and beetles, it felt more like I was taking swim lessons with a few hundred sharks.The lectures by Professor Luria were great (he had won the Nobel prize four years before) but the number of facts seemed impossible to remember. My fellow students were writing down literally every word written or uttered during each lecture. There wasn’t any mention of jelly fish or bugs or pea plants, but there were complex diagrams depicting even more complex biochemical pathways. I was accustomed to math classes and engineering classes and computer science classes. Biology was very different, more facts and less study of how to apply fundamental principles to prove some theorem or solve some engineering problem.I survived the Biology class, but it would have been a lot easier for me to take the physics class."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"During the first part of the pandemic I watched the lectures for the Introductory Biology course [1] from MIT OpenCourseWare. I cannot recommend those highly enough!Almost every lecture brought up and highlighted something really cool and fascinating. Like how RNA sequencing over the last couple of years has gone from expensive to almost free, and what its uses are. Or time-lapse of bacteria adapting to antibiotics. Or just the first lecture showing a video of someone sticking a syringe into a cell. There were even some labs that could be done via a normal web browser.For me this was so much more engaging than the biology I was thought in high school, where we mostly learned things from outdated books.[1]: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/7-016-introductory-biology-fall-..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This exact thing happened to us. We have a store located in Puerto Rico and Shopify would randomly stop payouts every 3-4 months or so because they needed to re-verify our owner address information. Apparently, most of Puerto Rico is not verifiable by their shitty address verification API, so it triggers the freeze every time it retries the verification. It was one of the most frustrating experiences I&#39;ve ever had and cost us thousands of dollars.Stripe also did the same exact thing for very similar reasons and at one point we had over $300,000 USD frozen with them, which was basically our entire monthly payroll expense. We had to explain to our bank why our accounts were suddenly drained. This one was worse than Shopify&#39;s since we actually never received any communications notifying that this was going to happen. At least we got an email from Shopify that we just hadn&#39;t noticed.They&#39;re all broken. And Know Your Customer needs to eat shit and die."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This problem seems endemic to big tech platforms, particularly when money is involved. I remember hearing similar stories about PayPal a decade ago (still do for what it’s worth).While I can understand the desire to not interact with a user of the platform (shopify, google, PayPal, etc), because of the cost, and because many are likely to be bots or actually fraudulent. It’s precisely at these edge cases when computers and automated performs the worst.These are the situations where the scenario is imperfectly modelled in the system. Maybe the engineers didn’t think of the edge case, or an ML model never had training data to cover it.Point is, it doesn’t matter. People problems need people solutions. Remediating edge cases involving people’s livelihoods strikes me as most likely a people problem.When you’re asking a person or company to trust them in a business relationship into the future, such as by being their shopfront, there’s only so many you can destroy before word gets around. I haven’t used or recommended businesses to use PayPal for a decade, because I saw them time and again inflict pain and financial stress with no recourse.As another example, look at the general sentiment around Google Cloud. Would you build a business on top of it? Does that include an exit strategy to multi-cloud, because you’re unsure if they’ll support the service you use?If you can’t scale to provide a human to help other humans caught in the edge cases of your own system, then you need to acknowledge you’re causing harm.A dog food company that kills a puppy every week, is really a puppy killing company that sells dog food.It’s a matter of perspective yes, but if you got into it to help feed dogs, surely the last thing you would want to do is harm them?And if you became aware your killing puppies, would it not be the top priority to ensure it never happens again?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Shopify should be scrambling to do a public post-mortem right now. They &#34;Fixed&#34; the situation within a few hours of the tweetstorm, showing that they know they f&#39;d up. Shit happens - but how does shopify assuage small businesses that this won&#39;t happen to them next? A public apology, post-mortem and steps to make sure this never happens again."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article says Musk agreed to buy Twitter mostly as a joke. I think there&#39;s a far better explanation. This wasn&#39;t a joke for Musk because after agreeing to buy Twitter he proceeded to sell billions of dollars&#39; worth of TSLA stock, supposedly to finance the purchase. Even for the richest man in the world that&#39;s not a joke.I think a better explanation is that Musk offered to buy Twitter as a cover for selling billions of dollars&#39; worth of TSLA.Look at this story: https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-sells-billions-of-dol...
The headline is: &#34;Elon Musk Sells $8.5 Billion of Tesla Shares After Deal to Buy Twitter&#34;Why does he need a cover? Because TSLA is way too overvalued. He has to know that it is overvalued. Tesla&#39;s market cap is double of Toyota, VW, Mercedes, BMW, GM, Honda, Ferrari and Volvo all combined! [1]. If you sell stock while knowing your company&#39;s stock is way too overvalued, you&#39;re fleecing unsophisticated investors. Pretending to buy Twitter provides a convenient cover.Musk pretended that TSLA valuation is reasonable. Musk even called out Gates for shorting TSLA stock [2]. If he didn&#39;t have a cover then Musk would look like a hypocrite for selling TSLA.In reality, both Musk and Gates sold TSLA, the only difference is that Musk sold stocks he owned, but Gates sold borrowed stocks. But Musk used buying Twitter as a cover, so he gets to pretend to be morally superior. Even though both men sold TSLA, according to Musk, Gates&#39; sales means that he isn&#39;t serious about climate change [3].[1] https://companiesmarketcap.com/automakers/largest-automakers...[2] https://nypost.com/2022/05/31/elon-musk-calls-out-bill-gates...[3] https://www.businessinsider.com/bill-gates-shorting-tesla-wo..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So much noise here and ill-informed comments fail to give a broader understanding of  what&#39;s going on. Elon bought up Twitter shares early in the year for a reason, because he wanted more control over Twitter. He bought up so much Twitter shares that when it was announced via the SEC, Twitter offered a board seat under the clause that he wouldn&#39;t acquire too much % control over the company. He obliged, but then left when he realized he couldn&#39;t make the changes he desired at the company. Plus, people on the board at the time, specifically Dorsey, was nudging him to buy out the company as a whole. So he did, hastingly. That was an ill-informed decision and obviously a mistake made with respect to doing due-diligence. In hindsight, before the market crash that price may have made sense. But fast forward today with looming recession talk, it&#39;s pretty clear he realized it&#39;s overvalued (we know this from tweets about twitter deal being repriced). And so he needed an escape hatch, hence the issue with bots and the unverifiable mDAU was a great talking point. In fact, he may as well be right on the issue as Twitter doesn&#39;t want to reveal how they calculate it. What he&#39;s trying to do right now is pretty clearly force the board to give a better deal. He&#39;s not sold any stock and likely won&#39;t unless he&#39;s actually out for good. But given the amount of effort and thought he&#39;s put into it and making it clear that he should pay a lower price depending on the bot issue, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s much doubt he&#39;s not actually leaving Twitter. Whether the courts will force an acquisition at the current price however, is a looming question. My bet is they settle at a lower price."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not knowing anything about glyphosate, I went to the article before reading the comments. I’ll just put this here because it was clear the researchers wanted to be sure people see it. From the first paragraph of the article—&gt;&gt; In 2015, the International Agency for Research on Cancer determined that glyphosate is a “probable human carcinogen” (IARC, 2015). However, the European Food Safety Authority and the Joint Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)/World Health Organization (WHO) Meeting on Pesticide Residues (EFSA 2015, FAO/WHO 2015) determined that glyphosate is unlikely to be a carcinogen. The US EPA concluded that “available data and weight-of-evidence clearly do not support the descriptors “carcinogenic to humans,” “likely to be carcinogenic to humans,” or “inadequate information to assess carcinogenic potential” (US EPA 2017a). Controversy and concern that the rising use of glyphosate may have adverse human-health effects exist (Myers et. al., 2016)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been in the field for many years and I see the EU on the forefront of public chemical safety, both in terms of legislation and enforcement.
ECHA is transparent about glyphosate [1]. It is not even labelled as CMR on REACH Annex III [2], and that&#39;s saying a lot.
If you follow the developments, you will find that there is no way to prove a chemical as &#34;safe&#34;. All it takes is one bloke on record to develop any health condition which can be linked to a chemical, and it will be scrutinized six ways to Sundays. Often leading to the introduction or decrease of an OEL, or a classification of this substance. As new humans are born all of the time, and diagnostics and analysis methods are still being improved, the likelihood of any given chemical to be &#34;harmless&#34; asymptotically approaches zero.
1 in 2 people develop cancer during their lives [3]. There are currently &gt; 23000 chemicals on the EEA market at &gt;= 1 t/a [4].1 https://echa.europa.eu/hot-topics/glyphosate

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Most insane part of this article was the below quote from the bill sponsor:&#34;Kavanagh said it is important to leave this buffer for police to protect law enforcement from being assaulted by unruly bystanders. He said “there’s no reason” to come closer and predicted tragic outcomes for those who do, saying, “Such an approach is unreasonable, unnecessary, and unsafe, and should be made illegal.&#34;He is just happily excusing cops visiting &#34;tragic outcomes&#34; on people who get closer than 8 feet to cops. The lengths that people will go to too justify police just killing people is insane. How about we don&#39;t allow police to just wantonly murder or beat whoever they want?This same guy is an ex cop and &#34;sponsored legislation that would prohibit oversight boards of police departments unless those boards were two-thirds sworn police officers&#34; After the 2020 election he also said: &#34;&#34;Everybody shouldn’t be voting...Quantity is important, but we have to look at the quality of votes, as well.&#34;Seems like a really great guy that very much deserves to be in power /shttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kavanagh_(Arizona_politic..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Seems like a great way to prevent recordings by having one officer move towards onlookers and force them an arbitrary distance away"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If I was cop, I would certainly want to know that there is a physical boundary in law that bystanders cannot cross. For my own safety, and for theirs. I see nothing unreasonable about not allowing people to cross this boundary. The law does not prevent recording. It says you cannot record closer than 8ft. Why would somebody need to get closer than 8ft to an officer doing their job, when you have no involvement in the situation at hand? Adding more people to the situation simply increases the stress of all involved."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In the early 2000s someone (drunkmenworkhere is what I remember) made a blog post generator that you could sign up for, add some names, some interests, and it would generate blog posts with Markov chains and some other magic. I signed up, not fully understanding how it worked, added some friends and family as names, played around with it, it wasn&#39;t what I thought it was and moved on. Meanwhile it kept generating entries about me and my family doing fantastic things.At some point my then ex-wife (we&#39;ve since reconciled) was google-stalking me and came across these entries. At some point they became outlandish enough that she contacted me to ask what was going on in my life. There was a very confused conversation where I had no idea what she was talking about and she was somewhat concerned about my health and safety. It wasn&#39;t until I talked to a relative and started googling myself with some specific terms that I came across the entries and was able to figure out what was happening. I emailed the individual running the project and asked to end the entries and if possible remove them from the internet to avoid further confusion."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I first learned about Markov chains in the early &#39;00s, I found and hacked at a simple IRC bot, and deployed it to a number of rooms found in the mIRC defaults.  It would sit in each channel and learn, only replying when DM&#39;d.I did give the bot a few hard-coded replies, namely to &#34;ASL?&#34; with &#34;[random integer 20-30]/f/cali&#34; and &#34;pic?&#34; with a random link to images from Google Image search. Otherwise it would happily barf up random Markov walks from all of the other conversations without any consideration of context.In the span of one weekend at least five hundred unique users attempted to chat with it, some for hours on end. I only have a few logs left, but the conversations generally progressed from horny to irate or bizarre."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It is a nice article. Summary is they wanted lighter cars so accel/decel would require less power and the gas/brake system would be lighter/smaller. So then the wider gauge is helpful to increase lateral stability (to prevent tipping over) since the cars are so light.In my opinion these kinds of historical mechanical/civil engineering stories are quite interesting. Would love to see more."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good to know it was for steadiness against the wind given its light construction and the original intent to have if go on (under?) the GGB deck.I’d like to know why the tracks are flat and not angled  and require regular grinding down to even out the washboard effect this causes… which results in that high pitched sound whenever it enters a curve due to slippage."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Despite the District’s claim, I still wonder if the Southern Pacific had a hand in the choice of a non-standard gauge, to help make sure they’d never be ordered to take over BART and bear its operating losses. That risk might seem slight today, but it would have been more of a concern in that era, years before Amtrak, when railroads were being required by their regulators (ICC and CPUC) to operate other unprofitable passenger services.As the posting concedes, “The pamphlet does not specify why only the wide gauge of five-feet-six inches was tested and not others.”"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; she used the Yamaha CS-80 as her main composition instrument. She seemed to favour it particularly for its touch-sensitivity, and it was one of the few synths that offered the feature at the time.This undersells the CS-80. It had polyphonic aftertouch, which most synths don&#39;t have today.Most have velocity sensitivity, meaning each note transmits how much initial force you applied. And most have aftertouch, meaning they transmit how much force you continue to apply after hitting bottom. But for most it&#39;s just channel aftertouch, meaning it transmits the aftertouch of the key you&#39;re pressing the hardest.The CS-80 transmitted aftertouch of each individual key, and had nice controls to to adjust how it used that information. A lot of synths can use polyphonic aftertouch but only a few new ones actually have poly-AT keyboards. The ones I know of are the Hydrasynth (out for a couple years now), the Behringer UB-Xa, and the Iridium keyboard (both introduced this year).Vangelis was also a huge CS-80 fan and used it on the Blade Runner soundtrack. Incidentally, a boutique synth that replicates the CS-80 pretty well (without keyboard) is the Deckard&#39;s Dream. It&#39;s $4000 but that&#39;s way less than a vintage CS-80."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Everyone already probably knows this, but if you search &lt;Song Name&gt; acapella or &lt;song name&gt; isolated vocals on youtube you can get the vocals to songs you want to cover. Sometimes its the original isolated, but sometimes its just someone singing it. I&#39;ve been having a lot of fun with Reverbmachine&#39;s Legends bank and vocals from youtube. Eurythmics Sweet Dreams for example.On a tangent, when I was in prison my mom died, and Kate Bush was her favorite music. Also in prison as a coping mechanism I created my own superstition that music on the radio was a message for me (I know it isn&#39;t but I needed a way to just get a little space to breath). Like Tom Petty meant the the day was going to turn out ok. So I programmed myself to be super receptive to Kate Bush being popular again and it&#39;s been amazing for my mood and productivity. Programming little positive things into my makeup has been really important in getting through stuff, be it addiction or just day to day difficulties."</p>

The formatting structs (and most cell related ones) are so tightly packed and the byte code VM for the formulas is pretty neat.I wish I could have met duanec, that guy wrote probably 10% of the code for Excel. Sadly he had retired 2 years before I started working on Excel.Fun fact: when they were about to ship Excel 1.0, they didn’t know what to name it then so they had an internal poll. The name that garnered the most votes was “Mr Spreadsheet”. Needless to say, marketing vetoed it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The filed letter (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000110465922...) isn&#39;t the knockdown argument I would be expecting.Musk is saying, you haven&#39;t demonstrated your numbers are accurate.  But having signed the merger agreement and waived due diligence, I think he needs to demonstrate that they are _not_ accurate.  Complaining Twitter rate-limited his API access (which would be very foolish on their part) or that their bot measurement standards are &#34;arbitrary&#34; doesn&#39;t seem to get there.The letter complains that Musk asked for data allowing him to &#34;independently verify Twitter&#39;s representations regarding the number of mDAU&#34; -- but where does the agreement provide for that verification as a condition of the deal?  Maybe Twitter didn&#39;t provide sufficient information for Musk to &#34;independently verify&#34; that number -- that means nothing without showing Twitter had a duty to provide that information, or that Musk had a right to his own verification.  (Any lawyer agreeing to the other side&#39;s verification of such a thing probably isn&#39;t a very good lawyer.)The last paragraph, complaining about firings and hiring freezes and departures, seems positively desperate.  Who seriously cares about this stuff?&#34;I relied on your numbers but now they seem soft&#34; is different than &#34;I relied on your numbers but now they are clearly wrong&#34;.I have enormous respect for his engineering and business skills, he&#39;s accomplished some remarkable things.  But he doesn&#39;t seem so great as a dealmaker.  Perhaps he&#39;s badly advised, but hey, he chose his advisors.I would think Twitter will sue for specific performance, and they probably have a case.  And Musk is liable for their full market cap, and any trial would depend on a legal team that has a hard time writing a clear letter.  I think Musk is in trouble here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Chancery courts will compel performance of this transaction absent a showing of an material adverse advent.  Very, very high bar.  The buyer is a highly sophisticated investor and the grounds that he is alleging form the basis of the breach of contract were and are public information that has not materially changed nor been alleged to have materially changed since the signing of the merger agreement.  Moreover, and most critically, it is not being alleged that spam accounts have any substantial impact on the earnings of Twitter.  Thus, the courts will obligate Musk to buy the business as he agreed to in April."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For anyone thinking he can pay the 1B$ termination fee and walk away, it&#39;s not that simple.The 1B$ is a &#34;reverse breakup&#34; fee, and applies when an outside force (like SEC or financing) prevents the deal.  That 1B$ has nothing to do with any choices on either side, and is unlikely to factor into this process.At this point they&#39;re clearly going to trial, and it&#39;s not unlikely that the cost to Elon will be somewhere in the neighborhood of the difference between the fair current market value (~20B$?) and the purchase price (~44B$).My guess is it&#39;ll end up being ~10-15B$."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The utterly inefficient and overpriced Canadian telecoms exist only because we allow one specific behavior:1. A new local player comes to town, builds their own infrastructure (e.g. connects one building to fiber) and starts offering competitive service.2. Rogers/Shaw/Bell/Telus immediately offer better terms for the residents of that building.3. The competitor runs out of money and leaves.4. The telecoms revert to their usual pricing.This hurts competition, this hurts customers, this hurts long-term infrastructure resilience, but not a single politician ever comes close to even admitting the problem. I understand you cannot do it on the federal level where both major parties are on the telecoms&#39; payroll, but it could be a very low-hanging fruit for someone running for a municipal position to address. But nope, identity politics, words, feelings and fighting climate change with paper straws seem to be what the electorate wants instead. Sad."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"People in other countries probably don&#39;t understand just how powerful - and depended upon - the big telecoms are here in Canada.They have no presence outside the country - they are so bloated and inefficient they couldn&#39;t compete - but they are omnipresent here.There are lots of people who depend on Rogers for home Internet, home phone, mobile phone, TV, and home security, not to mention business services that consumers also depend on, like the payment networks that are down.Plus their media properties, which probably come in useful when the government starts to think about allowing more competition or decreasing the taxpayer money being funneled to them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I see a lot of people noting the lack of communication and updates from Rogers.To me it would be shocking if they were providing updates. Canada’s telecommunication monopolies are not known for their customer service and, even worse, they seem to have internal corporate cultures of entitlement and arrogance that drive an “F U” attitude in general when it comes to external communications and accountability. So you won’t see a post mortem. You won’t see timely updates. You certainly will never see some kind of status page!I’m sure Rogers will be forced to do a post-mortem for large commercial clients where contractually required, but I highly doubt we will hear a word from them about the cause of this or what was/is being done to rectify it. They probably have an ETA but feel no obligation to share it.Rogers isn’t alone. I would expect the same behaviour from Bell or Telus. Canada has serious issues when it comes to its big telco carriers and it represents major risk to the Canadian economy."</p>

This fall is the worst since the devastating earthquake and tsunami disaster[59][60] hit Japan in the first quarter of 2011 when the GDP shrank by an annualised 6.9 percent.So, his economic policy might have been as bad as an earthquake + tsunami.That said, he was not the only one supporting this policy, and nobody deserves to die for a mistake."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"By this point in humanity&#39;s development, their brains had developed the ability to automatically block the parts of reality screaming for their attention, results of an economic system based on coercive consumption. Attention grabbers bifurcated into subtle, nefarious actors intent on slipping past in-brain ad-blocking and the shouters, turning up the volume and animations to make ads impossible to not see. People were subtly crippled, partially blind, now. Yet it was, after all, the mind&#39;s defense mechanism against an increasingly hostile environment trying to rob it of its most precise resource: attention.That was, of course, until they banned psychic violence in the &#34;Goddamn, get out of my brain&#34; amendment in the late 21st century."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The explanations like banner blindness, etc. make sense to me, but I think there&#39;s still a problem in our society or species in general that people simply do not read things thoroughly. And when confronted with a problem, instead of going back and reading things thoroughly, they blame someone else.How many of us software engineers have had this exact experience: Someone runs into an issue with your software that can&#39;t be papered over because of inherent complexity, and they report the problem to you. You tell them the solution, and they tell you it should be documented. You tell them it is documented, and you even tell them where. They tell you it should be more prominent.I&#39;ve had this happen where the warning was in bright red, bold letters at top in a separate box that said &#34;WARNING!&#34; but even after I sent them the link telling them it was documented, they still didn&#39;t see it.I&#39;m sure this banner could improved.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"“‘There is a game of puzzles,’ he resumed, ‘which is played upon a map. One party playing requires another to find a given word — the name of town, river, state or empire — any word, in short, upon the motley and perplexed surface of the chart. A novice in the game generally seeks to embarrass his opponents by giving them the most minutely lettered names; but the adept selects such words as stretch, in large characters, from one end of the chart to the other. These, like the over-largely lettered signs and placards of the street, escape observation by dint of being excessively obvious; and here the physical oversight is precisely analogous with the moral inapprehension by which the intellect suffers to pass unnoticed those considerations which are too obtrusively and too palpably self-evident.’”—From “The Purloined Letter” (1845) by Edgar Allen Poe"</p>

Hopes and prayers. Elections are ongoing. Unforgivable act. Doctors are working hard to save Abe. Not appropriate to address the political situation at this moment and I am not comfortable to do so.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wrote Hacking Healthcare for O&#39;Reilly, created ClearHealth/HealthCloud open source EMR, managed health systems for 15+ years, blah, blah, blah.It is very good there is are the transparency regulations. It is worth briefly explaining some of the reasons why many facitilities are having a hard time complying. There are some bad actors, absolutely true. However &#34;Hanlons Razor&#34; -- never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity -- definitely applies.Many health systems are a lot more like &#34;medical malls&#34; than they are single monolithic enterprises. Lots of health systems use really, really old technology and also a lot of it from a company called &#34;Epic&#34;. Epic does what it wants, when it wants and there is basically nothing anyone can do about it. There is rarely one central consistent mechanism and source of truth for pricing data because it gets generated from a complex web of different entities, systems, and processes. Herding all those cats is why it can take a health system a long time to comply. And also why a fine of even a million dollars can be small potatos vs the cost of actually complying in a timely manner.Just one facet, MUMPS is a widely used technology which you probably haven&#39;t heard of and which very few technologists understand. Lots of people are struggling to create new code to meet the new regulations using 1970s era technology including MUMPS.Another, a lot of health systems have been around a really long time. The insurers they work with also, (since the 1960s at least). They have Electronic Data Interchange EDI relationships built on the standard called 837. Business logic that surrounds pricing and billing is often buried in 50 years of tech debt. Everyone is deathly afraid of making too many changes too fast because when those systems break the money stops flowing and a health system will literally go insolvent. People still have hard physical lines connected to Medicare mainframes.This is a similar situation to other regulated industries like banking, airlines, etc. Modernization is hard, time consuming and very expensive. These regulations are a good driver for all that, but it takes time. Having been in some of these boardrooms there is not typically a cartel of evil executives figuring out how to screw patients. A lot of the time it is a group of relatively normal people trying to hold up a technological and business process house of cards with chewing gum, paper clips and hope.Disclaimer: I have been involved with the development of some of the fee schedules and health systems mentioned/criticized."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When High Deductible Insurance was introduced the supposed concept was to &#34;give employees a stake in their costs, and therefore lower them for both employer and employee.&#34;However, even today doing so is very challenging, and before laws like this it was essentially impossible. There&#39;s no way to shop around American healthcare, with the system itself working against you at every turn (e.g. doctors prescribing named brand, and you not be allowed to switch back to generic without another $100+ appointment).You can try calling and getting quotes, but they&#39;ll just waste a bunch of time and then give you a RANGE with no assurances. Even getting the quote requires your doctor to write up the entire work-order, which itself can get pushback, and or cost money.Then you have random things like for-profit life flights, which are automatic bankruptcy machines. Imagine one minute driving down the road, then suddenly waking up in a hospital, and then getting billed $80K for just the trip to get there let alone your hospital treatment or recovery. And insurance doesn&#39;t cover it.Aside but all ambulances around me are &#34;out of network&#34; and don&#39;t work with insurance at all. So I guess I should shop around by moving cities..?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting to read that only 33%-50% of hospitals comply with the law and post their prices.  If there&#39;s one thing this country needs to do it&#39;s demand transparency everywhere.Especially our government.  Spending.  Salaries.  It all needs to be public."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A better formulation of DRY is SPOT (Single Point Of Truth). Definitions (code, data) that represent the same “truth”, i.e. when one changes all have to change to represent a consistent truth, should be reduced to a single definition.  For example, if there is a rule that pizzas need at least one topping, there should only be a single place where that condition is expressed, so that when the rule changes, it isn’t just changed in one place but not the others. Another example is when fixing a bug, you don’t want to have to fix it in multiple places (or, more likely, neglect to fix it in the other places)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Every time I read an article like this, &#34;why &lt;often cited best practice&gt; is overrated&#34;, I think, yeah you are right in theory. But most places I have worked, these best practices were not overused, but underused. If you have the problem that your coworkers create unneccessary abstractions, I envy you, because I have so often had the opposite problem. Maybe this is not the case if you work in a great software development team. But if you work somewhere where they do software development on the side (science, hardware, etc..) it is the main issue.People not able to factor out functions or structure their code in a readable way. Variables are called v1, v2, v3. Unit testing seen as a waste of time. CI seen as a fun toy. They lack the experience to even notice the difference.Maybe I&#39;m becoming a curmudgeon, but I think many people would be well served by just googling &#34;&lt;my programming language&gt; best practices&#34;, learning the acronyms like DRY, and just following them. And when you have gained some experience, sure, then you should question the wisdom and not follow it blindly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;  Instead of our code being architected around the concept of how pizzas are made in the abstract, its architecture is tightly coupled to the specific needs of these two pizzas that we happened to be dealing with. The chance that we will be putting this code back the way it was is extremely high.Mistake 1: Switch from DRY to premature optimization.&gt; You might think that legit reasonable developers but would not actually do something like this and would instead go back to the existing invocations and modify them to get a nice solution, but I&#39;ve seen this happen all over the place.Mistake 2: Assumption of incompetence to support your argument.&gt; . As soon as we start the thought process of thinking how to avoid a copy paste and refactor instead, we are losing the complexity battle.Mistake 3: Strawman argument. DRY does NOT lead to over-complicating things.
Overcomplicating things leads to overcomplicating things.Now, i wasted 5 minutes, so you can waste some more to reply to this comment, instead of completely ignoring this dumb random blog post."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The maritime coverage map shows coastal coverage around countries with inland coverage right now, i.e. they are bouncing the connection via one of their satellites to a nearby groundstation.Starting in Q4/2022 they want to cover mid-latitudes around the globe. That might mean that they plan to enable inter-satellite links then? (This is a bit surprising - on one hand, this step extends coverage towards higher and lower latitudes but on the other hand not as much as they already have inland-coverage (cf. Brazil). It also extends longitudinally around all of the globe?).Coverage above mid-latitudes requires satellites in polar orbits to join the network. (Their non-polar orbits have an inclination of 53° which means that satellites go no further north or south than that (plus a bit whatever their range is)).https://api.starlink.com/public-files/maritime-coverage-map...."</p>

Every time I cook, my wife about has a panic attack watching me fumble around, forgetting things, looking for things, oh god that&#39;s burning, etc.Back on topic, I absolutely cannot listen to music with words when I code.  I&#39;ll intermittently type lyrics instead of what I was intending to do.  Anyone else cursed with such a thing?If anyone cares, I actually like a lot of the vaporwave/outrun/whatever it&#39;s called now stuff when coding.  Techno is a bit too jarring, and while I love classical, it either puts me to sleep or carries me away in thought."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A couple of my go-tos are Solar Fields and Infected Mushroom. Both are electronic; former is calm/ambient focus, latter is energetic/driving focus. Both have huuuge discographies that you can just put on shufflehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ldYxgJQG_Ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQmvPQ0MmiYSolar Fields actually did the Mirror&#39;s Edge game soundtracks too, if you&#39;ve played those. Really nice mix of ambient, almost meditative sounds. Often there&#39;s a super long, repetitive, pulsing buildup to a brief higher-energy section at the end of a trackInfected Mushroom is a wild mix of heavy Israeli dance-electronica, trance, and even rock, with a dash of metal here and there"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just quickly scrolled through my collection and here are some random, but fantastic instrumental albums I&#39;ve used while &#34;in the zone&#34;:  - Miles Davis: In a Silent Way
  - Brian Eno: Ambient 4: On Land
  - Godspeed You! Black Emperor: F♯ A♯ ∞ (one of my favourite albums. listen with your best headphones. HD650s are good)
  - Aphex Twin: Selected Ambient Works Volume II
  - Mozart: Requiem (my first proper introduction to classical. I was absolutely blown away)
  - Boards of Canada - Music Has the Right to Children
  - Sun O))): Black One (extremely experimental doom metal. the musicality of it is questionable at times but it&#39;s fantastic to study to)
  - Sleep: Jerusalem (occasional vocals but trust me they&#39;re not distracting)
  - Tim Hecker: Harmony in Ultraviolet
  - Bill Evans: Sunday at the Village Vanguard

The worst part about these sorts of things is that 30 seconds after posting I&#39;ll remember all the awesome albums I forgot and kick myself for it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very nice, I thought it was a basic wrapper around SQLite but then realized it actually had more features then that, such as it&#39;s own admin dashboard. Then I realized you built multiple auth designs into the system, then I realized there was a javascript SDK to interact with it, then I found your beautiful documentation site, then I realized there is an actual product inspiring it&#39;s development (https://presentator.io/)Each of these is another encouragement to use pocketbase. I went from &#34;eh, I&#39;ll just keep my own wrapper&#34; to &#34;pocketbase has a lot of promise, I should try it&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"PocketBase is a small open source project that I&#39;ve been working for the last couple of months.You could think of PocketBase as a lightweight Firebase/Supabase alternative.In short, it is an open source Go backend (framework and app) consisting of:- embedded database (SQLite) with realtime subscriptions\- backed-in files and users management- convenient Admin dashboard UI- simple REST-ish APIAnd all of this compiles to a single portable binary.It&#39;s still a little rough around the edges, but you could give it a try and share your feedback."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Looks very nice.One thing I noticed is you are using server sent events for subscriptions.  SSE have a lot of nice properties but do have one nasty limitation (from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent...):&#34;Warning: When not used over HTTP/2, SSE suffers from a limitation to the maximum number of open connections, which can be especially painful when opening multiple tabs, as the limit is per browser and is set to a very low number (6). The issue has been marked as &#34;Won&#39;t fix&#34; in Chrome and Firefox. This limit is per browser + domain, which means that you can open 6 SSE connections across all of the tabs to www.example1.com and another 6 SSE connections to www.example2.com (per Stackoverflow). When using HTTP/2, the maximum number of simultaneous HTTP streams is negotiated between the server and the client (defaults to 100).&#34;This can lead to some weird bug reports from users."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Roblox is horrendous. It is as dangerous as any dark corner of the Internet, except that it appears child-friendly to parents. It _seems_ to have controls, and _seems_ to restrict bad behaviour, but it does not, and cannot. My daughter was roped into an online paedophile ring when she was 12. The initial contacts and grooming were made through Roblox... almost right under our noses. Every time we, as parents, looked at what she was doing, it seemed okay. We could have dug deeper, but did not. Luckily we caught it before it progressed too far, but some damage was done.Wherever you can, tell parents to flat-out block Roblox.Edit: Because people are asking how it works.Roblox is a lot about bragging rights for individuals. You gain skins, trade for rare items, buy Robux for real money that can be used to buy items. Players flock around those that that have rare or expensive items. My daughter had a &#34;super super happy face&#34;. I just googled, and it is current selling for $350. It makes them feel wanted and important. So just like fornite and skins in other games.The groomers feed the celebrity, sense of community and so on to engage in chat. It starts as in-game chat, which you can never see the history of, before moving to DMs. The chat has tricks to get around removed words, so they all communicate in some sort of code that they all pick up along the way. Then they are able to divert them to other platforms where there are fewer controls. My daughter was made to create instagram account and an a porn one. Then they follow up on other platform calls (or phone calls) and follow the usual grooming techniques.The trick is to identify the marks by how they behave in the game, and in the more popular, and social ones, I think that it is quite easy (in retrospect)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like Hearthstone is a good example of the maximum amount of communication two strangers can have on the Internet.  You can choose 6 pre-made things to say to your opponent; Thanks, Well Played, Greeting, Wow, Oops, Threaten.  This might be too much; I have definitely seen people get mad from their opponent using the voice lines too much.My thought is that this significantly reduces the richness of the in-game interactions (implies less engagement, implies less revenue), but doesn&#39;t need moderators to keep the game from being used for illegal sexual encounters, which is nice if your game targets kids."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the challenges here is that the incentives are misaligned.  It&#39;s well-understood in the cash-shop games industry that most of the revenue comes from &#34;whales&#34;, users that buy large quantities.  In a game targeted at children, who themselves don&#39;t have income/credit cards, it&#39;s unlikely that the &#34;whales&#34; are in the target demographic.  Rather, it is likely most of the &#34;whales&#34; are adults who are spending large in order to use the in-game currency to exploit interactions with others.Not only was this predictable, it seems nearly by design.  I don&#39;t see how Roblox can ever fix this without fundamentally changing their business model.  Their business model is essentially structured to enable commercial sexual exploitation of children over mobile platforms.On my own network I used various means to make it impossible for anyone to use Roblox, music.ly, TikTok, et al.  Services that are targeted specifically at children but provide a pathway for semi-anonymous communication are already ripe for exploitation by bad actors, the microtransactions aspect of Roblox just makes it even worse.It&#39;s ironic, but platforms intended for adults tend to be safer for children, because they don&#39;t concentrate bad actors in the same way."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Part of taking on SOC 2 is also choosing whether you want your attitude to be &#34;Let&#39;s do the minimum to get past the audit&#34; and &#34;Let&#39;s take this framework, and figure out where we can learn from it.&#34;The post mentions background checks. On the one hand, I understand there&#39;s a real issue with these. On the other, if my PAAS isn&#39;t ensuring repeat offender fraudsters don&#39;t have access to sensitive data, that&#39;s possibly an area of concern. Hopefully the things they took from the other mentioned company do increase due diligence in vetting employees who have access to sensitive/regulated information.Use it as a framework to actually think about BCP, DRP, etc, etc, and it won&#39;t be a total waste of time.Edit:
Also adding I bring up background checks as an example of learning from vetted practices, rather than trying to attack the decisions of fly. I respect this article, especially where it&#39;s easy for people on the internet to criticize decisions, when the reality is security is a series of tradeoffs, and to function as a business means having imperfect processes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Careful, now. “Getting SOC2-certified” isn&#39;t the same as “doing the engineering work to get SOC2-certified”. *Do the engineering now. As early as you can. The work, and particularly its up-front costs, scale with the size of your team.*Emphasis mine.I&#39;ve uttered this phrase or something like it so many times that I want to get this line fire etched onto a large, thick and sturdy block of wood and go back in time to several jobs where I and my cohorts got stuck with shoring up SOC2 tasks and smack my former execs with it.Half joking but the pain and trauma from past SOC2 audits due to exactly this is real."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"De-nuclearization of other European countries is a long-held goal of the German environmentalist movement and the Green party. It&#39;s understandable that France doesn&#39;t want to go with that, as they don&#39;t want to be forced down the same ruinous path we&#39;re currently on here in Germany. And honestly, good for them.It&#39;s just sad to see how little actual science is respected in Germany. I did my PhD at the French nuclear energy agency and my French colleagues would always be puzzled when I talked about German energy policies and our anti-nuclear sentiment. But here in Germany the Green party will probably never reverse it&#39;s stance on nuclear energy, as their rise to popularity was strongly fueled by the anti-nuclear movement from the 80s and it&#39;s the one thing they can&#39;t abandon without losing a large number of followers.I partially blame the highly ideological stance on the way people rise to power in politics and administration in Germany. In France, top positions in the administration are usually filled by people that are technically excellent and have gone through the system of grandes écoles (ENS, ENA, X, ...), whereas in Germany most people rise through social engineering and party politics and most top positions in the administration are filled by people with law degrees that don&#39;t have a clue about technology. In my opinion that&#39;s also a reason why we completely fail in everything regarding digitalization, lawyers are simply not good technical problem solvers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You know how I know environmentalists are just dragging their feet on nuclear for ideological reasons?When we talk about a storage facility for nuclear waste, a scenario they insist you prepare for: if human civilization completely collapses to the point that any of the currently spoken languages on earth are no longer able to be read how to we keep the, whatever comes after us, from busting up the concrete and digging down deep into the earth and playing with it. That&#39;s the last gasp of someone out of obstructionist ideas. I&#39;ve had these people tell me that launching the waste into the sun would be dangerous for the sun, they aren&#39;t serious and need to be ignored.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_nuclear_waste_warn..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"About time. Nuclear is hardly an environmental risk even compared to the &#34;cleaner&#34; fossil fuels like gas.Hopefully this will allow the EU to return to competitive reactors designs instead of leaving China to pull humanities weight on that front.Though tbh I wouldn&#39;t be sad if we bought Chinese reactors until we are back up to speed, having Chinese nuclear &gt; no nuclear. Everyone bitching about China stealing IP finally have something to steal back."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This kind of highlights a subtle interactive design or user experience component of the Trolley problem.Part of the Trolley Problem is that the choice is between an action or inaction.  But these problems, or the first one at least, have two buttons.So you&#39;re making a choice.  Yeah, some might argue it&#39;s a technicality.  But what if you put the Do Nothing choice on a timer?What if you made it an asynchronous &#34;Problem of the Day&#34;.  No action by the end of the day triggers Do Nothing, etc.Lots of cool, interesting design choices.  There&#39;s an unstated subtle ultimatum hidde. in these problems, but still cool.Sorry, geeking out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Level 20 was weird. It was a choice between letting a trolley run as normal (&#34;emits CO2, kills 3 people in accidents over 30 years&#34;) or running it into a brick wall and decommissioning it. For some reason more people picked the latter. So, they just dislike public transit? What about the emissions and death rate when everyone switches to cars instead?Goes to show how easily the context and exact wording of a question can sway people&#39;s opinions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Let&#39;s not let the perfect be the enemy of the good.This is a huge step forward for iPhone users. Look, I get it. From the typical HN perspective, this potentially looks like a lot of hype. But many of you aren&#39;t looking at from a high level.In the world we are now living in; even what&#39;s happening in the United States right now, being able to protect yourself from well-funded, determined attackers for the average person couldn&#39;t come at a better time.There&#39;s a huge gap between Fortune 500 executives, government officials, etc. and regular people in terms of the resources available to them to prevent state-sponsored attackers. It doesn&#39;t take much these days to go from a nobody to being on somebody&#39;s radar.If you&#39;re a woman seeking an abortion in a state where it&#39;s illegal or severely restricted, you could be the target of malware from your local or state government or law enforcement. In Texas, you can sue anyone who aids and abets a woman who attempts to get an abortion for $10,000, which is enough to get someone to trick someone into installing malware on a phone.No, it&#39;s not China or Russia coming for you but it doesn&#39;t take much to ruin someone&#39;s life.I don&#39;t think this is virtue signaling or marketing hype by Apple; if anything, this is right in alignment with the stance they&#39;ve had on privacy for years. Even for a company the size of Apple, putting up $10 million to fund organizations that investigate, expose, and prevent highly targeted cyberattacks isn&#39;t pocket change.At the end of the day, this is all good news for user privacy and security going forward. I also suspect if I lockdown my iPhone, my other compatible devices using the same Apple ID will also lockdown. No IT department required."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am so excited about this news. I understand that some people are pessimistic, and view it as a &#34;giving up&#34; on complete security against nation-states. I think that&#39;s the wrong way to analyze the situation.The dream I have is someone making a phone that is purpose-built to be secure against state actors. Unfortunately, this makes very little economic sense, and probably won&#39;t happen (maybe if some rich person started a foundation or something?). The phone would need to have pretty restricted functionality and would not be generally appealing to mass market consumers.As it stands, securing a mass market modern smartphone, even from just remote attacks, is just intractable. We should not bury our heads in the sand and wishfully think that if they just spend a little more money, close a few more bugs, and make the sandboxing a little better, somehow iOS 16 or Android 13 will finally be completely secure against state actors. The set of features being shipped will grow fast enough that security mitigations will not someday &#39;catch up&#39;.This is the next best thing! The more we can give users the freedom to lock down their devices, the more the vision of an actual solution comes into view. This is the first step towards perhaps our only hope of solving this someday - applying formal methods and lots of public scrutiny to a small &#39;trusted code base&#39;, and finally telling NSO group to fuck off.Even this dream may not pan out, but at least we can have hope."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"With this announcement, Apple are saying &#34;we will protect you from state actors&#34;, which is a role usually performed by states. Apple is saying &#34;we operate at the same level as nation states; we are a nation-state level entity operating in the &#34;digital world&#34;: It&#39;s a flag-raise.It&#39;s the first such flag-raise I&#39;ve seen. Security researchers talk about protections from state actors all the time, and there are tools which support that... but this is the first public announcement, and tool, from a corporation with more spare, unrestricted capital than many countries. It comes at a time when multiple nation states are competing for energy and food security; and Apple are throwing up a flag for a security-security fight (or maybe data-security). This is not just handy tech, it&#39;s full-on cultural zeitgeist stuff. Amazing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Two points to highlight from this article:1. LinkedIn is an absolute godsend for bad guys, allowing easy targeting of everyone in the company with spear phishing emails and texts. I know many security professionals no longer use their real name, and don&#39;t list the real name of their company, because they know it&#39;s such a great hacking vector. Not sure what/whether LinkedIn can do anything about this.2. I wish there were more information about what the vulnerability was in the PDF in the first place. I think a lot of people would be wary of downloading a PDF from a stranger, but not from someone who you had multiple interview rounds with and who offered you a job."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve got to say, this is an incredibly cyberpunk article.&gt; Ronin, the Ethereum-linked sidechain that underpins play-to-earn game Axie Infinity, lost $540 million in crypto to an exploit in March. While the US government later tied the incident to North Korean hacking group Lazarus, full details of how the exploit was carried out have not been disclosed.It&#39;s not in William Gibson&#39;s style, sounds more like Bruce Sterling&#39;s.&gt; Axie Infinity was huge. At its peak, workers in Southeast Asia were even able to earn a living through the play-to-earn game. It boasted 2.7 million daily active users and $214 million in weekly trading volume for its in-game NFTs in November last year — although both numbers have since plummeted.&gt; Earlier this year, staff at Axie Infinity developer Sky Mavis were approached by people purporting to represent the fake company and encouraged to apply for jobs, according to the people familiar with the matter. One source added that the approaches were made through the professional networking site LinkedIn.Also gives me Charles Stross vibes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those that don&#39;t want to read the whole thing, (supposedly) the attackers reached out on linkedin to a bunch of employees asking them to apply to a fake company. One of them did it, went through a bunch of fake interviews, and then got a fake offer, in the form of a PDF.They opened the PDF and that installed a keylogger on their system (it doesn&#39;t explain how).The attackers then used that engineer&#39;s credentials to take over 4 of the 9 validators on the blockchain which they then used for their heist."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is the unfortunate reality of India; the government/police don&#39;t need to actually go to court. It can harass companies and executives by simply threatening to / actually carrying out unnecessary &#39;raids&#39; through the tax department.The usual process is for the a bunch of policemen and beareaucrats to just show up unannounced; seal the office so that no one can enter or leave, and seize computers / phones, files and demand random stuff like invoices for $10 purchases from three years ago and so on. This can happen regularly until all business basically comes to a halt (unless the company complies with whatever the government wants). [1]The next step is to threaten arrests and actually carry out some arrests on trumped up charge, and you can wait forever until trial (unless you comply with what the government wants). The trials usually result in acquittal after several years but the process is the punishment. The media in the meanwhile is happy to go along with the official version (that the company is question is allegedly employing shady accounting practices).The next stage is painting the company as &#39;anti national&#39;, arrange for a few mobs to harrass folks / attempt lynchings and finally actually &#39;dissappear&#39;/kill people (this last step is usually reserved for judges/writers etc since others usually comply before this step)[1]: https://www.economist.com/asia/2021/10/02/indias-government-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Rule of law is a joke in India.Center has central agencies and each states has their own police department. 
So whenever there is a noticeable criticism from someone centre or state govt will send their police/agency your way. You will be detained, put through the worst conditions and false charges will be filed. Most of these charges don&#39;t hold in higher courts but the damage is done. You will suffer, a lot. 
You will not dare to speak up again.This is even so comical, sometimes centre will send agencies against another party politicians in power in a state they are not in power, and state will send police for local politicians from centre party.
(https://scroll.in/article/1027571/how-the-modi-government-ha...)Sometimes diff state police with diff party governments fight with each other.
(https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/toi-editorials/sto...)And sometimes police will just plant evidence in your email with their work email address as backup email address. They literally jailed bunch of very old left activists with fake charges by hacking their email accounts.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"More big companies that use open source should do this or something similar. The dividends to security, developer productivity, etc are probably extremely high, particularly for a company with hundreds or thousands of engineers already. It&#39;s such an efficient use of money to give it to the people who already have the expertise to do the work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is such great news for ruby. Here’s hoping with these resources rubygems and bundler can add improved support for signature verification. Rubygems supports gem signing but without a good scheme for trust, key rotation, etc it is not particularly usable.  Sprucing this aspect of the ecosystem up would go a long way towards allowing ruby to maintain its historical role at the vanguard of language specific package management.Another thing I would love to see is the ability to incorporate a signed attestation that a gem was built from a given signed commit. A common dirty trick by supply-chain blackhats is to publish a gem which contains code other than that of the corresponding tag in source control.  Given that rubygems has no means to browse package contents other than downloading and extracting the tarballs for manual inspection this means that people typically reference changelog or diff links on source control hosts, despite the fact that those diffs will only be accurate for gems published by good-faith actors following platform norms.There are a number of ways to fix this and I sure hope one of them gets implemented."</p>

I tend to find the big view and small view videos with the same level ease.*Also a premium subscriber.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I had a great conversation this evening with a marine biologist studying the recent collapse of a 100,000 sq km California kelp forest. The grants for the science of ecosystem stewardship are in the 10k-50k$ range.Over the past few years, something killed over 5 billion giant starfish and “science” has no idea what did it. Without the starfish, the sea urchin population exploded, turning kelp forest into desert.I love the LHC. But we need to seriously grow the science pie and prioritize the science of ecosystem collapse and management. There simply aren’t enough trained scientists."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Things I didn&#39;t get from article:What changed to make a slew of new discoveries possible? Is it pure
chance like Bitcoin mining? If so, what&#39;s the chance of discovering
nothing for years and then, like London buses, three all come along at
once?What are the implications of a new &#34;particle zoo&#34;? Can I do anything
with these, like build new atoms, or use them to detect something?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is it possible, even it principle, that some of these exotic hadrons could be long-lived (let alone stable)?They&#39;re probably interesting to study on their own, but the engineering instinct is to want to build something out of them, or use them as tools, which seems pretty hard if they disintegrate in a quintillionth of a second!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s several very good provisions in this legislation (3rd party payment processors, non-preferential treatment for 1st party apps), there are several that have a mix of upsides and downsides (sideloading is one--I personally like knowing that Facebook can&#39;t ask people to sideload some privacy destroying crap on iOS).Then there&#39;s:- Allow developers to integrate their apps and digital services directly with those belonging to a gatekeeper. This includes making messaging, voice-calling, and video-calling services interoperable with third-party services upon request.- Give developers access to any hardware feature, such as &#34;near-field communication technology, secure elements and processors, authentication mechanisms, and the software used to control those technologies.&#34;Apps will use near-field communication technology and other mechanisms to track us (consider how many device related APIs have restrictions in web browsers for just this reason), and I think it&#39;s credible that the interoperability requirements are going to be used to smash end-to-end encrypted messaging. You can have a decentralized end to end encrypted protocol. Can you retrofit every existing messaging service to use it in the short-term? Probably not.As an end user, the things that give developers maximum freedom are not necessarily the things that let me use my device with maximum freedom. I support people who want a FOSS device that is in no way locked down. I just don&#39;t want that, because I don&#39;t want to play systems administrator for an always on tracker in my pocket."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is huge. Forcing Apple to allow app side-loading, third-party payments, etc is going to wrest away control of the iOS ecosystem (and eat pretty heavily into their revenues [1][1] https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/10/apple-implies-it-generated-r...I hope some of these regulations spill over into the U.S. and the rest of the world."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Happy that I might be able to install something else than Safari. I want the Gecko engine on iOS. Sad that being in UK probably means we&#39;ll ignore it because &#34;Brexit.&#34; I got a text the other day telling me that, since we&#39;ve left the EU, roaming charges are back. Hurray!Without making this about politics, this is a great step forward. Still unsure how Apple &amp; co. will make their proprietary video and messaging platforms &#34;interoperable&#34;. I doubt they&#39;ll be writing an RFC any time soon."</p>

I&#39;m not naive enough to believe I wasn&#39;t being recorded previously, but I can&#39;t help but find this trend of sticking a camera directly in my face whenever I&#39;m trying to make a purchase extremely insulting and violating to my sense of privacy. Now after watching this I have almost no doubt that facial recognition software is installed on these systems.I&#39;ve spoken to other people about the rudeness of this but most people seem to think it&#39;s fine. Perhaps I&#39;m just weird and more bothered about this stuff than most people. If sticking a camera in someone&#39;s face when they&#39;re trying to purchase something in a pharmacy isn&#39;t going too far though I do wonder if the average person would really care about anything presented here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was initially put off by the webcam permission requirement, but the terms and conditions page says it&#39;s basically an art project and they don&#39;t send any data off (unless you explicitly accept it at the end) so I gave it a chance.I&#39;m glad I allowed webcam permission because it was an interesting, informative, and fun look at biometric tracking.Apparently I&#39;m &#34;violently average&#34; which is not a way I would previously have described myself. According to this site the most unusual thing about me is that I read the terms and conditions before ticking the &#34;accept&#34; box."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think many people commenting on the model making bad predictions are missing the point.
The speaker argues that even though models are known to be inaccurate, companies like tinder or insurance companies might still use the model outputs since they have nothing better. 
Therefore, in some future (or already today?) you can suffer from bad model predictions because you are &#34;not normal enough&#34; for the model to make good predictions, and might therefore receive a wrong predicted life expectancy and higher insurance bills."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Ultimately companies that abdicate their informatics operations like this will give their profits to their data-center operators, who will be empowered to charge them whatever price they want.  Because what&#39;s their BATNA?  Migrating from Azure to AWS when Microsoft doesn&#39;t want to let them?Renting your information infrastructure is a great way to reduce startup costs, but down the road, that information infrastructure runs your company.  Trying to outsource it is like trying to outsource upper management.To be clear, I&#39;m not saying that the optimal amount of cloud services for an established company like FedEx to buy is 0.  They bring in management consultants, too.  But it sure isn&#39;t 100%."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Making accurate calculations of data center cost is of course complicated and rarely manages to take everything into account, but the common knowledge I’ve heard is that there comes a point when a company is so large that going on-prem is what actually saves them a lot of money.If FedEx is not large enough to be one of those companies, how large do you actually have to be? Or has cloud pricing changed to the point where this is no longer true, and even huge corporations can save money in moving away from their own premises?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Its weird to have companies say they&#39;re moving from Mainframes to the Cloud.The Mainframe is a sort of cloud, each one has usually double the spare capacity and you call IBM to unlock it.The cost of running a Mainframe is measured in terms of MIPS based on amount of compute used and there&#39;s compute reserved for offloading things like JITs (zAAPS). Essentially a version of cloud compute costs.I can understand if you&#39;re locked into COBOL with EBCDIC and can&#39;t find talent, but Z runs freaking Ubuntu now! I know IBM works furiously on modern ecosystem support.Not shill for IBM, but what exactly is it that they&#39;re expecting to be so different from their cloud migrations? Or is everyone here caught up in the &#34;Mainframe old&#34; falsehood."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Academics are not the place to go to make useful novel contributions, there are too many confounding factors.  First, the university owns whatever IP you come up with, and will happily exclusively license that IP to entities with no interest in developing it.  Monopolistic corporate power centers aren&#39;t known for fostering novel competition to their established businesses.  This is why it took so long - and serious capital - to get something like Tesla going, as the likes of Toyota, Ford, GM etc. were closely tied to Exxon, Chevron etc. via their investors, and had no interest in developing electric cars.Any kind of applied research in the US academic sector these days is best understood as corporate R &amp; D for established interests in pharmaceuticals, technology, industrial chemistry, etc.  You&#39;re certainly not free to do blue-skies renewable energy research (budgets for that are still miniscule at best, and have been since the 1980s), for example.  The job description has become indistinguishable from that of in-house corporate researcher - narrowly defined assigned problems are what you get to work on, and &#39;academic freedom to pursue the research wherever it leads&#39; is a quaint myth.The obvious fix is to eliminate exclusive licensing of academic IP (i.e. repeal the 1980s Bayh-Dole Act), which would force corporations to spend capital on their own private R &amp; D divisions if the wanted exclusivity, and simply make any university-held patented discovery available to any entrepreneur who wanted to develop it for a small flat fee.Until then the author is 100% correct about entrepreneurship being the only way out of the trap."</p>

Furthermore, the article says that &#34;he dropped out of high school to become a poet,&#34; but please note that, a number of students drop out of high school in South Korea to fully focus on the college entrance exam, in hopes of getting into better universities. This is not uncommon at all. And sure enough, he got accepted into the best university in South Korea, majoring in astronomy and physics. One of his classes was even taught by a Fields Medalist. If this is his definition of &#34;being lost,&#34; I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ll ever be found."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This passage caught my attention:He proceeds just as deliberately when doing mathematics. Wang was shocked when he first witnessed it. “I have this math competition experience, that as a mathematician you have to be clever, you have to be fast,” he said. “But June is the opposite. … If you talk to him for five minutes about some calculus problem, you’d think this guy wouldn’t pass a qualifying exam. He’s very slow.” So slow, in fact, that at first Wang thought they were wasting a lot of time on easy problems they already understood. But then he realized that Huh was learning even seemingly simple concepts in a much deeper way — and in precisely the way that would later prove useful.Having gone through the American education system, I felt like I was in a factory being evaluated as a potential end product. Steamroll through as much material as quickly as possible. Optimize behavioral patterns for the next performance metric. Rinse and repeat. Is this really the best system we can come up with? Can the pace of mathematical and scientific advancement be optimized by steamrollers? I wonder how much potential we&#39;ve missed as a society because the education system has been trying to force everyone through the same hole, and destroying intellectual curiosity in the process.Personally, my experience with this educational system turned me off from &#34;math.&#34; It was only much later in life when I learnt that the mindless algorithms that I had to personally execute for years on end to get into university could barely be considered math at all. Only then could I begin to appreciate how elegant real math could be. And I doubt I&#39;m alone in my experience."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The nationalization of news and politics in a country of 330 million people is toxic. We’re one country but we don’t share a single set of values. Even the notion of “blue America” and “red America” is misleading. What would be unremarkable in San Francisco would raise eyebrows in Baltimore.I noticed this acutely living in Atlanta for the better part of a decade. Politics was not a big deal when I lived there. Atlanta was “blue” and the rest of the state was “red” but politics was forward looking and productive. The mayor when I was there, Shirley Franklin, was truly put the city above partisanship. A Democrat, she endorsed Mary Norwood, an independent, in 2017, because the Democratic candidate was a protege of a mayor she believed to have been corrupt: https://www.wabe.org/former-atlanta-mayor-shirley-franklin-e.... She waved aside criticism suggesting that she (a Black woman) should have endorsed the Black Democratic candidate instead of Norwood, a white woman.Then in 2018 all hell broke loose when Georgia’s governor’s race became the subject of national attention. The state became a battleground in a proxy war between New York and Mississippi. Racialist rhetoric reached a fever pitch in the New York Times and Washington Post (but notably, the Atlanta Journal Constitution was far more prudent). They made Georgia out to be an unreformed Confederate backwater, instead of a state that’s the destination for huge numbers of Black residents leaving California, Illinois, and New York, attracted by plentiful jobs, low taxes, and an excellent public university system. The national media completely misrepresented Georgia and the people in it to the rest of the country."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Axios is expanding into local news coverage.  This is their PR and wow the bullet point approach sometimes really just doesn&#39;t do it for me.For a more involved take of the underlying topic, consider _News for the Rich, White, and Blue_ by Nikki Usher.
http://cup.columbia.edu/book/news-for-the-rich-white-and-blu...I don&#39;t agree with all of Usher&#39;s takeaways but there&#39;s a lot of good stuff in there. And as to the headline – yeah, sure, the &#34;local news crisis&#34; is partly causative in the polarization sure but lazy and biased coverage can compound all sorts of nasty dynamics.While I&#39;m here, Mark Lamont-Hill and Todd Brewster&#39;s _Seen and Unseen_ would be my pick for a recent media read. Lots of great history, recent and less so, as well as analysis:

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not a word about why media antitrust is important... even though the article casually mentions that &#34;Newspapers continue to be consolidated by hedge funds and private investment firms that believe they can wring more profits from the papers through synergies as the industry declines.&#34;&gt; &#34;Axios is owned by Axios Media, whose investors include Glade Brook Capital Partners, Lerer Hippeau Ventures, Greycroft, and NBC News. NBC doubles up as Axios’ media partner.&#34;https://marketrealist.com/p/who-owns-axios/Not only that, people employed by today&#39;s media conglomerates are increasingly drawn from the &#39;wealthy liberal coastal elite&#39; sector and are typically filtered through an unpaid internship process before getting hired, leading to non-representative &#39;journalists&#39;, which is probably doing as much damage (i.e pushing the populist perception of news media as a symbol of out-of-touch elitism) as the corporate consolidation is.Another side effect of this trend is the death of investigative journalism, which generally upsets the state and corporate power centers who are increasingly joined  at the hip.  For example, the last Washington Post investigative series of note was &#34;Top Secret America&#34; from about a decade ago, and now that Jeff Bezos owns the paper and AWS is actively seeking CIA and NSA contracts, forget about anything else like that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am excited about Felt. (And whoever comes around to compete.)That&#39;s mostly because I think (as they also must) that &#34;making maps&#34; is something that everyone does (in our heads; verbally; on the back of scrap paper; on random car-floor cardboard tacked to trailhead signs) but that few easily-accessible software tools have ever tried to facilitate digitally.I&#39;m interested mostly in the user-experience they&#39;ve created to add our &#34;human effects&#34; to an &#34;existing&#34; map (like notes, relevant points, lines, directions). I really am drawn to it.They&#39;re putting a lot of energy into the data-layer side of things, which I think is admirable considering the complexity, and seem to be nailing it. I&#39;m not sure how folks will use those things, since I don&#39;t think our mental maps often require additional data.I&#39;ll also add that their curated set of example uses is an excellent model for how to show people how to use a product that they might otherwise have no idea what to do with."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Doesn&#39;t look like the author knows what he is talking about. His point about early stage startup should not use K8S is fine. But the next advice about not using a different language for frontend and backend is wrong. I think the most appropriate advice is to choose a stack which the founding team is most familiar with. If that means RoR then RoR is fine. If it means PHP then PHP is fine too. Another option is to use a technology which is best suited for the product your are trying to build. For example, if you are building a managed cloud service, then building on top of K8S, or FireCracker or Nomad can be a good choice. But then it means you need to learn the tech being used inside out.Also he talks about all of this and then gives example of WhatsApp at the end. WhatsApp chose Erlang for the backend and their front end was written in Java and Objective-C. They could have chosen Java for backend to keep frontend language same but they didn&#39;t. They used Erlang because they based their architecture on Ejabberd which was open source and was built with Erlang. Also WhatsApp managed all their servers by themselves and didn&#39;t even move to managed cloud services when they became available. They were self hosting till FB acquired them and moved them to FB data centres later on (Source: http://highscalability.com/blog/2014/2/26/the-whatsapp-archi...)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I agree entirely.I like to call what the author is referring to as, &#34;What-If Engineering&#34;. It&#39;s the science of thinking you&#39;ll be Google next week, so you build for that level of scale today. It involves picking extremely complicated, expensive (both in compute and skilled labour) technologies to deploy a Rails app that has two features. And it all boils down to, &#34;But what if...&#34; pre-optimising.It happens at all levels.At the individual unit level: &#34;I&#39;ll make these four lines of code a function in case I need to call it more than once later on - you know, what if that&#39;s needed?&#34;It also happens at the database level: &#34;What if we need to change the schema later on? Do we really want to be restricted to a hard schema in MySQL? Let&#39;s use MongoDB&#34;.What&#39;s even worse, is Helm and the likes make it possible to spin up these kinds of solutions in a heart beat. And, as witnessed and evidenced by several comments below, developers think that&#39;s that... all done. It&#39;s a perfect solution. It won&#39;t fail because K8s will manage it. Oh boy.Start with a monolith on two VMs and a load balancer. Chips and networks are cheaper than labour, and right now, anyone with K8s experience is demanding $150k + 10% Superannuation here in Australia... minimum!https://martinfowler.com/bliki/MonolithFirst.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I lean conservative in my tech choices but I just don&#39;t see the big issue with Kubernetes. If you use a managed service like GKE it is really a breeze. I have seen teams with no prior experience set up simple deployments in a day or two and operate them without issues. Sure, it is often better to avoid the &#34;inner platform&#34; of K8s and run your application using a container service + managed SQL offering. But the difference isn&#39;t huge and the IaC ends up being about as complex as the K8s YAML. For setting up things like background jobs, cron jobs, managed certificates and so on I haven&#39;t found K8s less convenient than using whatever infrastructure alternatives are provided by cloud vendors.The main issue I have seen in startups is premature architecture complexity. Lambda soup, multiple databases, self-managed message brokers, unnecessary caching, microservices etc. Whether you use K8s or not, architectural complexity will bite your head off at small scales. K8s is an enabler for overly complicated architectures but it is not problematic with simple ones.&gt;Did users ask for this?Not an argument. Users don&#39;t ask for implementation details. They don&#39;t ask us to use Git or build automation or React. But if you always opt for less sophisticated workflows and technologies in the name of &#34;just getting stuff done right now&#34; you will end up bogged down really quickly. As in, weeks or months. I&#39;ve worked with teams who wanted to email source archives around because Git was &#34;too complicated.&#34; At some point you have to make the call of what is and isn&#39;t worth it. And that depends on the product, the team, projected future decisions and so on."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have witnessed something quite similar. During the flash-floods in 2021 in Germany, locals in the Ahr region absolutely rose to the occasion. Farmers were evacuating people in head-high water with their tractors during the night, local restaurants were already providing hot food and water the next morning wherever they could reach, pharmacies were loading whatever they had available on ATVs to somehow get much-needed medicine down precarious mudpaths. Local construction companies were already clearing rubble and building emergency bridges out of it. One Excavator was just basically standing in the middle of the river and ferrying people and rescue partys across. The local racetrack basically just organized everything while politicians were still playing the blame game. When our local firebrigade was officially pulled back from active duty because we lost one of ours during rescue operations in the first day, basically everyone just went down again and just tried to do whatever was possible. Absolutely stunning what people will do when they are face to face with disaster. I freely admit that I was crying like a little girl when I first saw the endless columns of Bundeswehr, THW, Fire Brigades, Farmers, basically everyone who could just streaming to help people they never met but were neighbors and friends for me.Sorry for the rambling, but I am still not emotionally disconnected enough from it to concisely talk about it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; And the most unusual thing about all this is: None of this is unusual. At least not within the national tapestry that is The Great American Small Town.It also isn&#39;t unusual in the cities. Humans are wonderful and terrible everywhere. It reminds me of the 30 Rock episode where Jack and Liz go to Georgia to find a new comedian in touch with the &#34;real America&#34; and Liz keeps insisting that all Americans are real Americans and there is no &#34;real America.&#34;The acts of people after 9/11 in NYC remind us of the good in humans just as this small town inspires us.As Mr Rogers said, &#34;When I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me, &#34;Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For some reason this reminded me of the Ray Bradbury story, &#34;The Town Where Noone Got Off&#34; which is a dark little story indeed about two men and a small town on a railroad line.  This one is a bit more positive.However, it turns out this whole incident was apparently due to the lack of a railroad crossing guard system of any kind at the intersection.  The most basic system has flashing lights warning of oncoming trains, and even that wasn&#39;t present.https://www.kwch.com/2022/06/30/amtrak-derailment-places-spo...In that respect it&#39;s also a story about the poor state of American infrastructure."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Given some of the people here might run their own servers, the self-hosted alternative is to have something like Sonarr PVR for newsgroups and torrents, alongside a tracker indexer like Jackett, and then Plex for the frontend. In this combination, you &#34;subscribe&#34; to TV shows and select movies on the Sonarr system, and then the downloading is taken care for you even when new episodes arrive. These will then appear on Plex which is refreshed by the pipeline automatically. The system integrates with private trackers and is capable of maintaining your seed-ratio if that&#39;s important.I recently fell into this rabbit-hole while trying to organise my music. For music there is Lidarr, which also ID3 tags your music and reorganizes it into folder structures. This is convenient since organizing anything using Plex is a nightmare."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I became a single parent when my daughter turned 1 year old. When she got old enough we&#39;d go fishing, bicycling, swimming, and hiking a lot. We&#39;d also go to a used book store twice a month (on pay day) so she could pick out a few books to read. She loved doing that.She had no interest at all in learning how to code or gaming but she loved helping in the garden and in the kitchen prepping and cooking meals.When she got to Jr. High she wanted to join the &#34;Cheerleader&#34; squad so there were a lot early morning rides to school I had to make, and lot&#39;s of Basketball games I attended until she graduated, but I had a lot fun cheering along with them.During those years I setup a campsite on our property so her and her friends could go hang out there. I&#39;m sure they had more fun than most parents would approve of but they never got into any real trouble, the police were never called, and no one got hurt bad enough for the parents to call me. For the most part all those parents knew exactly where their kids were and what they were doing. And that I was close enough to deal with anything that came up. But there were never any serious issues.She&#39;s 37 years old now, still loves to hike, backpack, swim, fish, garden, and cook, and most important, she still likes to hang out with me!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My son is 12 y/o, and he&#39;s into Minecraft.Yesterday he discovered the server mc.openredstone.org. He spent all day yesterday and about one hour today, and he ended up building a 4-bit adder.On this server players learn how to build logic gates, and mix them so they eventually build CPUs. It&#39;s fully gamified, so beginners are called &#34;students&#34; and more advanced players are called &#34;builders&#34;. To become a &#34;builder&#34; you need to pass some trials. The &#34;builders&#34; probably have their own challenges (not sure, my son is still a student), in any case, they behave like teachers. So a student will find a builder who will give them instructions, and guide them through more and more complex designs.So, yesterday my son had no idea what XOR or NAND is, and today he already built a 4-bit adder, and has dreams of building an ALU.I&#39;m quite excited to be honest. By the way, I&#39;m not in any way connected with whomever put together this Minecraft server. I don&#39;t even think it&#39;s a for-profit thing, as far as I can tell, it&#39;s fully non-profit."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Might be off topic but a nugget from having two girls (5 and 11). Kids don’t care about budget or how much things cost. We have toys we’ve spent hundreds of dollars on only to have the near free to free one be a hit. I say this to make sure you know your employment status likely only effects your kids if it effects you. Or said differently, to the extent it effects you it will effect them.Kids will generally have fun with anything you show a degree of interest in. The copper pipe plumbing example in this thread is a perfect example. A simple Task became a life long activity for the kid. They will remember it forever and tell someone in the future “this time I welded with my dad”… they won’t remember that time my dad didn’t hire a plumber.Things off the top of my head that have been a hit - 
Planting plants 
Fashion design 
Basic coding activities or contests 
Shooting
Anything that requires safety procedures 
Lawn work (but make it fun or set a timer)
Writing a story where they write some of it, you add in silly bits, they write more , repeat till laughing out loud. 
Both my girls super in to etiquetteBest of luck buddy and squeeze these years for as much as you can."</p>

Please, please, don&#39;t write it off until you&#39;ve read the book. Note that Sarno&#39;s work focuses on back pain, but it applies to all types of chronic pain (including migraines, which he discusses in the book).- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jQtmSZetJM- https://aaroniba.net/how-i-cured-my-rsi-pain- https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/09/well/mind/john-sarno-chro...- https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/well/chronic-pain.h..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Do 1 task a day, no matter how small it is, do it consistently for a week or two. Then every other day you do 2 tasks for a month, and you start working up to a point where you feel you do what you can within your limits and get joy from that 1 (or 2) items you can scrap off.If you live with family focus your tasks maybe on easing their life, pull out 10  weeds out of the garden, take out the trash, fix a squeaking door. Small but attainable things.Chronical pain is a mess, it&#39;s relentless and it&#39;s always there, it doesn&#39;t go away, but you learn to deal with it. Focus on the pain initially, learn what pain you have and focus on it. I learned to focus on it and make a mental note (do not know how else to say) that it&#39;s not worth paying attention to, and I get by without medication. It&#39;s not always easy and there are days where you want to cry and cry and just fall asleep so you do not have to feel it.
It&#39;s normal and accept that not all days will be the same and successful.It&#39;s a tough hill you are up against, but all shall pass and all will be well in the end. It&#39;s unbelievable sometimes, but all shall pass. Remember that.Good luck, don&#39;t falter, reaching out is the first step!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was in a similar situation, minus the physical disability (I was mentally in a really bad place though). The only advise I have is to not think of any job as below you. I don&#39;t know your exact situation or your disabilities, but if you can deliver pizzas to at least keep your head above the water, do that. Having gone through YC you&#39;re obviously also a bright and intelligent person, how many different companies have you tried consulting for? Some companies could be more understanding than others of your situation, in which cases making 1500 a month shouldn&#39;t be a huge problem in this industry. Sorry you&#39;re going through this friend.."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; full Linux desktop&gt; The Core Project is a highly modular based system (...) It is not a complete desktop nor is all hardware completely supported. It represents only the core needed to boot into a very minimal X desktop typically with wired internet access.That is not a full desktop, and the [The Core] project doesn&#39;t say it is.That being said the concept of &#34;full desktop&#34; is somewhat loaded. Today we have a somewhat unreasonable expectation that at least one, but sometimes several browsers, office suites, multimedia viewers and editors to be a &#34;basic desktop&#34;.Back in the 90&#39;s people did not expect the computer to come with any such software applications built-in."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Direct link:http://tinycorelinux.net/I have wondered how such a tiny distribution is possible. I&#39;m thinking of the kernel, in particular--when I try to compile my own kernel with no module support and only the drivers I need built-in (&#34;make localyesconfig&#34; will do this), it comes out like 10MB compressed. And I am no kernel expert, so it&#39;s hard for me to tell which settings I can change and what will happen if I do.Then when I boot the most bare-bones system with /bin/sh as init, it is using like 70mb of RAM doing nothing.So anyway, I found that you can just grab their kernel config, I&#39;ll be curious to see how it differs from more typical configs: http://tinycorelinux.net/13.x/x86/release/src/kernel/config-...Windows 95 ran in 8 MB of RAM.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I sure wish Starlink supported IPv6. They&#39;re a brand new ISP planning for millions of customers and decided from the start they couldn&#39;t get enough IPv4 addresses for everyone. Fair enough! But we&#39;re stuck with Carrier Grade NAT and it is a drag.On Starlink it&#39;s impossible to host a server socket directly, which makes any peer to peer networking a PITA. Geocoding IP addresses doesn&#39;t work so I have to bend over backwards to convince, say, Youtube TV that I&#39;m in the Sacramento metro and not LA where the POP is. Also the shared IP addresses seem to trip a lot of DDOS protection; I fill out 10x as many CAPTCHAs on Starlink as I do on my other ISP. And I sometimes get random network stability problems; a few weeks ago Starlink screwed something up so no one could keep a persistent connection up more than a few minutes. Seems to be fixed now, but I bet it was their CGNAT system.I realize half the world lives with CGNAT. It&#39;s not unusable, at least web browsing works more or less. But IPv6 would solve all these problems. A little surprised that a new ISP created in 2021 wouldn&#39;t have IPv6 support as one of their launch features. There&#39;s hints they are trying to get it working but it&#39;s not an official thing now.

If 20% of users want to be able to do something in TypeScript that the language doesn&#39;t support, they either can try to get the change into the core language, or live without it (or fork it). If it changes, it&#39;ll change for everyone using TypeScriptBut in Clojure (lisps in general), you don&#39;t have this restriction, so modifying the language for your own need, becomes a lot easier. Lots of work on Clojure is simply done in libraries, as it&#39;s possible and doesn&#39;t impact the core of the language, which everyone shares."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As much as I respect Rich Hickey, it&#39;s hard to say anything positive about this. It has basically nothing to do with open source. It&#39;s entirely specific to how he chooses to run his own projects.Open source is not a gift in the sense that you &#34;get what they give you&#34;. You are entitled to the source code. You are entitled to modify the code. You are entitled to distribute your modifications.Are you entitled to be part of the development process and to state your opinions about how things are going? Yes...if those are the rules of the project. The thing is, that has nothing to do with open source, it&#39;s always project-specific, so the full post largely doesn&#39;t make any sense as a comment on open source."</p>

Like, all the knowledge ever. Maybe that should be considered the good default of things.At least one in every town that everyone could use, for free, forever, without restriction to ANY of the knowledge anyone desires.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So, if I get it right. First there was Libgen, which is mirrorable. Then, some Z-Library copied Libgen and added some more books, without making it mirrorable. The goal is to make these new books, which are not mirrorable — mirrorable (i.e. to &#34;preserve&#34; them).So, why not just re-upload them to Libgen, then? I guess somebody will do that now anyway, but you could easily done it in the first place, without making your own mirror, which is not a mirror of Libgen. Just upload them to Libgen and make a mirror of Libgen."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It gave me a pause to think about how it came that I can never really tell what am I looking at anymore. Forget the HN title, which is stupid — what does this landing page tell me? Well, that it&#39;s… next gen, and it apparently can catch up with me, which is not much, since I&#39;m not really catching up with what&#39;s going on anyway. Also, that it&#39;s &#34;tooling&#34;. Like IDE, or framework, or maybe a chainsaw. Can&#39;t tell.&#34;Getting started&#34; page tells me that &#34;Vite&#34; (pronounced as &#34;veet&#34;) is &#34;quick&#34; in French, then it proceeds with quite wordy installation guide. It also quickly mentions that it&#39;s a &#34;build tool&#34;. Finally. So, like gulp or grunt, I guess? But it doesn&#39;t even mention those, or any other build tools it supposedly replaces. And it seems unlikely, since everybody uses some script that comes with angular or vue or any other framework of your choice nowadays…"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Working with front end for 5+ years have nearly made me switch careers. 
There&#39;s an absolute onslaught of languages, frameworks, patterns and now also &#34;tools&#34; that never really work in you editor, and you never really grasp before moving on to the next thing.I think me and my team have spent 90% of our time working with tooling, and all creativity and joy has gone out the window - because you never become a master, an expert og know your way around the codebase before you&#39;re suddenly 2 years behind.It&#39;s a shitshow and no one really seems to know what the hell they are doing - even the teachers of this stuff - they just know &#34;how&#34; rarely why.Way, way too much complexity and abstraction for simple tasks. Some things &#34;should have&#34; become easier with quick scaffolding, auth templates or whatever, but they always only work 95% and you use an endless amount of time fixing the last 5% instead of building creatively.Vite was the same thing, faster yes, but my VSCODE broke because of the myriad of build tools and plugins on top of each other from older projects."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Incredible amount of negative comments. It takes more time to type all that negativity out than it takes to read about what Vite is and what it does.Frontend dev here. Vite is amazing. It doesn&#39;t take long to get what it does if you try it out (you can avoid reading about it that way).I won&#39;t bother summarizing what it does, the website literally covers it. Reading really became superpower in this day and age."</p>

Sure it is, which is easily proven by physics. But the physics we know of applies to what we know. There might be something completely different to what we&#39;re seeing/observing/theoritising with our smartest people and best equipment.I&#39;m not saying we can just go faster than C by advancing technology: I know it&#39;s limited by relativity and is not a matter of advancing tech.What I&#39;m saying is that there will probably be advancements in physics and technology so that C limit will of course stay the same, but it will be the physics inside the box whereas a complete new understanding of reality outside the box would be discovered, where things can travel &#34;faster&#34; than C using other dimensions or something that we even haven&#39;t thought of yet &#34;outside the box&#34;, while still being perfectly compatible with the &#34;regular&#34; &#34;inside the box&#34; physics we love and use today, without violating and relativity rules of our classical physics.Then they&#39;ll probably look back and just laugh at the people who thought C was the absolute limit to everything."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; As soon as Sphero completed the acquisition, bringing Kelsus in as an app developer, two things happened: 1) Sphero told us they needed fully revamped iOS and Android apps six months later with no schedule wiggle room. 2) Sphero spent the first two of those six months organizing a team on their side and hashing out requirements for the new apps.This exact pattern has preceded every mismanagement disaster I&#39;ve ever seen:1) Management gives an unreasonable deadline to developers before defining the deliverables. Clock starts ticking.2) Management then fails to settle on the requirements for months and/or continuously moves the goalposts while people are trying to work, turning an unreasonable deadline into an impossible deadline3) Developers start realizing that they&#39;re going to receive the blame when impossible deadline isn&#39;t achieved, despite not having any control in the matter. They start leaving for new jobs, and the death spiral begins.It&#39;s the universal pattern of a management team that doesn&#39;t know how to do anything other than make demands and then apply pressure. Unless you can get someone in charge who has real leadership and planning skills, it&#39;s not recoverable."</p>

If you ever use it you could face legal consequences. And there&#39;s no code I&#39;ve ever written that I wasn&#39;t convinced I could write better from scratch the next time if it ever came up.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve seen this twice. First time the PE firm installed their CEO who came in and immediately started talking about cleaning house. A bunch of developers left fearing a layoff. That was bad enough, but what he really meant was sales. He gutted the sales team and brought in his guys. Sales tanked, company growth stopped, hard. Features dwindled and bugs grew. This clown and his cronies were gone after two years and the company still struggles today.Second time. A $10B company acquired a $4B company. The parent demanded high margins from the company that had been running on low margins and legacy, near end of life applications. Layoffs ensued and the parent was choking on the acquisition. They’d been sold on a bogus modernization effort that ended as soon as the acquisition closed. That acquisition is a drag on their earnings today, six years later.Getting to see these type of disasters first hand is pretty cool imo."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I actually gave away a Porsche 911. This was not a mall giveaway but a marketing experiment for my new startup: Flat 6 Club.Yes, we wanted something in return, in this case, we wanted you to buy a t-shirt or start a subscription (merch+content+events), which gives us essentially all the same info, which would enter you in a sweepstakes to win the car. We also wanted to promote the club, which we did.We researched it and contracted a sweepstakes company who helped us run the sweepstakes legally.In the end, we gave away the car to a very nice man and his wife, who we flew in from Minnesota to San Diego for the giveaway event.Some people did think it was a scam.But there are several operations that actually do give cars away such a Omaze, Diesel Brothers and many more.There’s a model there based on the new post-search world we live in that has to do with high engagement increasing Return On Ad Spend and other AdTech voodoo.No doubt there are lots of scams but there are also real winners out there.We’ve only given away 1 car. We learned a ton.I decided to kill the monthly subscription after we gave away the car because we grossly underestimated the amount of up-front ad spend required to achieve a good ROAS and I knew we wouldn’t be giving away another car for a long time.The biggest surprise to me was hearing from people that were sad that we killed the paid membership/giveaway program.This was $9.11/mo for membership and occasional swag drops and automatic entry into our next giveaway —whenever that might be. I communicated personally with some of these folks.The gist of what I learned was that for $9.11/mo, people enjoyed the hope that they may one day win a 911. We literally had people beg us to bring it back. This is probably the same happiness that a lottery ticket brings to many people. It’s not really that they expect to win. As long as someone wins, they’re buying some hope, some excitement… a dream."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m wondering if the last sentence from the abstract is more of a holy grail than the conversion of methane to methanol:&gt; ... The confinement of mono-iron hydroxyl sites in a porous matrix demonstrates a strategy for C–H bond activation in CH4 to drive the direct photosynthesis of CH3OH.https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-022-01279-1Selective C-H bond activation (of which this paper is an example) is extremely difficult. It has been the focus of intense research for decades. Having a tunable catalysts system that performed this transformation would be a game-changer for the production of just of about every organic molecule. The authors just focused on methane as the hydrocarbon feedstock, so it&#39;s hard to know how general the process might be."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Paper: Direct photo-oxidation of methane to methanol over a mono-iron hydroxyl site by An, B., Li, Z., Wang, Z. et al. Published in Nature Materials in June 2022.Publication page: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-022-01279-1Digital Object Identifier: https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41563-022-01279-1"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Apparently the technique works at close to standard temperature and pressure. Considering that the Sabatier process can be run off water and electricity, and desalination can be done with sunlight, we have all the puzzle pieces for converting seawater to methanol via solar power. The chemical byproduct is oxygen, itself very a very useful element though difficult to compress and store. Even if the byproduct O2 is released to the atmosphere this looks very promising."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is also available as a video, &#34;Why I wrote my own rsync&#34;:* https://media.ccc.de/v/gpn20-41-why-i-wrote-my-own-rsync* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpwObdgemoE"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This was a great write up. I&#39;ve already sent it to a few people.On the question of what happens if a file&#39;s contents change after the initial checksum, the man page for rsync[0] has an interesting explanation of the *--checksum* option:&gt; This changes the way rsync checks if the files have been changed and are in need of a transfer. Without this option, rsync uses a &#34;quick check&#34; that (by default) checks if each file&#39;s size and time of last modification match between the sender and receiver. This option changes this to compare a 128-bit checksum for each file that has a matching size. Generating the checksums means that both sides will expend a lot of disk I/O reading all the data in the files in the transfer (and this is prior to any reading that will be done to transfer changed files), so this can slow things down significantly.&gt; The sending side generates its checksums while it is doing the file-system scan that builds the list of the available files. The receiver generates its checksums when it is scanning for changed files, and will checksum any file that has the same size as the corresponding sender&#39;s file: files with either a changed size or a changed checksum are selected for transfer.&gt; Note that rsync always verifies that each transferred file was correctly reconstructed on the receiving side by checking a whole-file checksum that is generated as the file is transferred, but that automatic after-the-transfer verification has nothing to do with this option&#39;s before-the-transfer &#34;Does this file need to be updated?&#34; check.
For protocol 30 and beyond (first supported in 3.0.0), the checksum used is MD5. For older protocols, the checksum used is MD4.[0]: https://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice write up. rsync is great as an application but I found it more cumbersome to use when wanting to integrate it into my own application. There&#39;s librsync but the documentation is threadbare and it requires an rsync server to run. I found bita/bitar (https://github.com/oll3/bita) which is inspired by rsync &amp; family. It works more like zsync which leverages HTTP Range requests so it doesn&#39;t require anything running on the server to get chunks. Works like a treat using s3/b2 storage to serve files and get incremental differential updates on the client side!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Really glad there&#39;s advanced open-source tools like darktable and RawTherapee.I&#39;ve switched back and forth between RawTherapee and darktable for a few years now.I prefer the UI and workflow or RT, but dt has better performance on my machine.  And RT has this strange longstanding bug where the image is extremely blurry during editing, and only becomes clear after exporting.  According to a github issue, a workaround is to disable lens correction (and anything else in the &#34;transform&#34; tab) but this didn&#39;t work for me, prompting my most recent switch to dt.current biggest grip with dt... why are those damn arrows at the edges of the screen so tiny???  Expanding and retracting the side panels requires pixel-perfect accuracy on a ~20px target.  I know I could use keyboard shortcuts, but my brain isn&#39;t wired for them yet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Let&#39;s see if this changed anything.But my previous experience with editing Sony RAWs on Rawtherappe and Darktable wasn&#39;t good.The color science is missed up in Darktable and in Raw therappe, I just couldn&#39;t get something decent out.I would be editing for an hour and end up with a weird looking image, while in lightroom I would be done in 10 minutes.People might say that I&#39;m just used to lightroom but I&#39;m not, I was using Capture one, then didn&#39;t shoot anything for multiple years, then just went pack to Lightroom and could edit photos without major frustrations and get decent results quickly.Creative apps in general are a very weak point of the Linux desktop, and when they exist, that have many weird requests and problems that just using them on windows is easier(Davinci resolve requiring the crappy closed source AMD drivers)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"darktable has a pretty steep learning curve and it introduces concepts from cinema (the scene referred workflow) that may be known to video editors and colorists, but that are surely alien even to seasoned still image editors and retouchers.For anyone that wants to learn darktable I wholeheartedly recommended the forum at https://discuss.pixls.us/c/software/darktable/19The darktable developers frequent this forum and it&#39;s an indispensable resource."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My mind works best with examples, I was about to ask here when I stumbled upon it on the TLA site [0].The example starts out with a simple piece of code that exposes a bug, then the bug gets fixed and the following question is asked:&gt; Does the issue go away because we’ve solved it, or because we’ve made it rarer? Without being able to explore the actual consequences of the designs, we can’t guarantee we’ve solved anything&gt; The purpose of TLA+, then, is to programmatically explore these design issues. We want to give the tooling a system and a requirements and it can tell us whether or not we can break the requirement. If it can, then we know to change our design. If it can’t, we can be more confident that we’re correct.[0]: https://www.learntla.com/intro/conceptual-overview.html"</p>

Maybe Brad Fitzpatrick could team up with Aphyr and use it to make golang v2 a bit less crap.Note: I write this with love, as someone who&#39;s written hundreds of thousands of lines of Go, and am now turned off and afraid of the behavior at the sketchy edge boundaries. I&#39;ve now shifted to learning Rust, albeit slowly and finding it saddeningly challenging compared to what I can pump out with the Go.For reference, see &#34;Data Race Patterns in Go&#34;, posted 21 days ago: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31698503"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just started reading the book a couple of days ago.

For example, on https://www.learntla.com/intro/faq.html &#34;losting&#34; should be &#34;losing&#34;.  It would be great to simply and quickly report them without having to context switch and go through the overhead of opening an issue or creating a PR.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The Netherlands will be especially impacted by this. We refused actual legalization for many reasons, many of which will be invalidated by Germany decriminalizing. Our current stance on weed is so confusing that it&#39;s hard to explain to any foreigner, but strictly speaking weed isn&#39;t legal and not even decriminalized... But yes, Amsterdam is in The Netherlands."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the legalization of cannabis in Europe has a lot of potential. I just wish that we would take measures to avoid the ever increasing levels of THC dosage in weed to insane levels, like you see in the US or California specifically. I firmly believe that cannabis can do a lot of good, but the poison is in the dosage. It has been shown in the past that increasing THC while decreasing CBD leads to an increase in negative side effects, some being permanent [1].Let&#39;s see how it&#39;ll work out. I also think it&#39;s quite funny that the German meme &#34;Bubatz&#34; has made it into the highest levels of our government.[1]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6312155/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In South Africa Cannabis has been legal for personal use in &#34;places where you have an expectation of privacy&#34; (but selling is still illegal) for several years now. So far the world has not ended, the country doesn&#39;t sit around stoned all day and we&#39;re not all hooked on Heroin.There&#39;s talk of introducing legislation to restrict quantities (government has plenty of securicrat control freaks), but since that violates the very principles which underpinned the Constitutional Court&#39;s overturning the legislation that made weed illegal in the first place, I can&#39;t see it going very far."</p>

You&#39;ll discover dozens of ambiguities, &#39;gotchas&#39;, and shortcomings!It&#39;s important to use a new junior each time (i.e. if they&#39;ve used your docs before, don&#39;t use that person again). They should also try to accomplish a real task (not just proofreading the docs, but actually using the docs for their intended purpose).I&#39;ve used docs from Salesforce and Google and can tell they haven&#39;t been tested in this way since they contain (glaring) problems that would easily be found and addressed in a few minutes.I use this approach often, and gain enormously from it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The Python logging module is one of the worst modules in the stdlib. You can see it’s Java inspiration all over it, as being one of the oldest modules it was created before anyone really knew what “pythonic” code was.Things I really dislike about it is the lack of “context”. Usually log messages are about something - often a request. You can’t attach a request ID or something else a nested set of function calls that log.The whole library is just really rubbish and has not aged well. There’s no standard way of outputting JSON logs, but there’s a built in way to spawn a socket server that allows the logging configuration to be updated remotely via a bespoke protocol? And everything is built mostly around logging to files.It also hits that perfect sweet spot of being both overly engineered and totally inflexible. I wanted to funnel our log messages to s3 via the “s3fs” module, which supports a “file like” object that gets written to s3. I had to hack around the various handlers to support this because it assumes it’s a “real” file.Hate it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another great project for Python logging is loguru:
https://loguru.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.htmlOne of my favorite features of loguru is the ability to contextualize logging messages using a context manager.  with logger.contextualize(user_name=user_name):
    handle_request(...)

Within the context manager, all loguru logging messages include the contextual information. This is especially nice when used in combination with loguru&#39;s native JSON formatting support and a JSON-compatible log archiving system.One downside of loguru is that it doesn&#39;t include messages from Python&#39;s standard logging system, but it can be integrated as a logging handler for the standard logging system. At the company where I work we&#39;ve created a helper similar to Datadog&#39;s ddtrace-run executable to automatically set up these integrations and log message formatting with loguru"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I mentioned this almost every time logging and python come up but one of my favorite feature is logging.exception: https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.Logge.... It allows you to attach the whole exception with stack trace without having to explicitly used “as e” and then use traceback or embed the error in the message. Something like logger.exception(“Failed to connect.”) will print the message and the exception in one go."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Much of this is due to the reversal of the tight hiring market.For the past several years tech companies were desperate to hire because everyone was growing and the hiring market was tight. This inevitably results in companies loosening their hiring standards and retaining underperforming employees because they can&#39;t afford to reduce team sizes.Layoffs combined with hiring freezes (or slowdowns) signal real stress within a company. However, many of these layoffs are single-digit percentage layoffs from companies that are still hiring across the board. That&#39;s not so much a traditional layoff as a pruning of the workforce. That pruning wasn&#39;t happening as much when hiring was tight, but now that hiring is easier and real, actual layoffs have put more good candidates back onto the market, the companies who simply collected too many underperforming employees can afford to churn some of them back out of the company. Doing it as a &#34;layoff&#34; makes it more palatable than going on a firing spree.That said, when it comes to interviewing you shouldn&#39;t assume that a laid off employee was necessarily underperforming. A lot of companies don&#39;t really perform layoffs with surgical precision and will instead drop entire teams at once. I&#39;ve watched great engineers get swept up in minor staff reductions simply because they were assigned to bad managers or doomed teams that they couldn&#39;t save by themselves. I&#39;ve also hired great people who came right out of layoffs at other companies and I would have missed those resumes if I had been using dumb filtering rules like ignoring anyone who had been laid off."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"All this panic about tech layoffs seems a little premature given we haven’t even begun to see the impact of rates hikes on quarterly earnings yet. Many companies still have open recs and budgets to keep hiring.I work at a company that just laid off 18% of the workforce (Coinbase) including many people in engineering. The day this happened my email, LinkedIn, Twitter inboxes exploded with companies asking me if I knew of anyone looking for a job or if I myself had been impacted.I reached out to many of my former colleagues who had been impacted to see if they needed help. All had multiple interviews in flight and were not having trouble finding jobs.Aside from many crypto companies the inbound jobs were from many public and private companies and spanned many industries.I expect tech layoffs to get worse and the white collar job market to tighten towards the end of this year and 2023.I expect the main driver for this will be cost reduction at public and private companies in the lead up to earnings or quarterly reports. Main cost for a tech company obviously being labor."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While there is still a open question about how much the sudden reversal of monetary policy from the last 15 years of &#34;hey! all the money can print&#34; that led to companies going into debt to purchase their own stock to &#34;oh crap, inflation, let&#39;s tighten the money supply&#34; affects the durability of companies...that said...There are some very hyperbolic people comparing this to the .COM crash and also to 2008/2009.In 2001, there was literally a site doing nothing but reporting in flamboyant terms all of the &#34;fucked companies&#34; going under. IIRC, it was dozens a day, at one point, with people stating that the Internet had failed, and it was all going down the drain.In 2008, absolutely no one had any clue what was going on but everyone knew it was catastrophically bad. People were trying to guess if it would be merely the worst recession ever or the second great depression.This so far seems like a fairly normal correction. We will see if Debt blows up and changes that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There is a massive YouTube and Instagram industry of outright faking craft and cooking tips. They&#39;re not just bad or a stretch, they&#39;re intentionally fabricated, made at scale by TheSoul Publishing with 550 employees. That&#39;s because making cool things looking surprisingly easy goes viral way better than actual reality-grounded instructions, and for the adtech giants nothing matters except the number of clicks.Before people realize that they can&#39;t really make a 3-layer cake in a toaster, the fakers already cash in on the views. Usually the risk of these faked craft hacks is just cut fingers and kitchen fires, but the &#34;just grab 2000V, it&#39;s so easy!&#34; videos take it to another level of lethality."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"YouTube&#39;s moderation is ridiculous, and it demonstrates the problem Google has in general. They don&#39;t like paying actual people to moderate their sites, and rely on automated systems and bots to do everything for them. So, if there&#39;s ever an issue (or you have a bunch of scammers mass reporting you because you debunk their &#39;work&#39;), then YouTube/Google seems to think you&#39;re the problem instead of the scumbags.We need things to change here. We need Google to moderate their services properly, and we need these scammers to get arrested/sued/whatever for misleading info, and putting people&#39;s lives at risk."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m one of the co-founders of Turquoise Health, mentioned in the article here. We&#39;ve been downloading and parsing this data all day. It&#39;s a really big deal in the industry that the prices that insurance companies pay doctors are now being shared publicly. It will have all sorts of positive impacts over time, hopefully making rate negotiations more consistent and fair between different insurance plans. Right now, 10x differences in prices paid for the same healthcare service from the same doctor between insurance plans is not uncommon."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; “What we’re learning from the hospital data is that insurers are really bad at negotiating”Do the insurers have any incentive to negotiate well? Since their customers are not very price-sensitive (since they aren&#39;t marketing directly to patients or doctors), I would imagine they don&#39;t have a huge incentive to do anything but apply a markup to whatever prices the hospital tells them it costs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My teenage son knocked on our bedroom door last night after we&#39;d all gone to bed. He was crying and told us his cousin had just texted him the news, and then he watched the video. We watched it again together. I cried and hugged him and we talked about it a little bit.My kids were so isolated during covid lockdown, we were getting really worried for their mental state. They weren&#39;t seeing other kids their age, they felt like they had no friends, and there was one point when it seemed like they even stopped missing other people altogether.But my son, especially, was deep into Minecraft Youtube at the time, and I could tell that this cast of creators was really important to him. It often felt like he was on a call with his fun and hilarious buddies, just on mute.I think Technoblade, and other creators like him, helped get my son through the past couple years. I&#39;m so grateful to him for that."</p>

I&#39;ve been watching his videos since 2017- the picture in today&#39;s video of him in a hospital bed with his 10 million subscriber play button absolutely destroyed me. He used to joke all the time about hitting 10 million subscribers as if it could never happen, and the fact that it did is a monument to all the time and effort he put in- should&#39;ve lived to 100 million. A reminder to us all- life is precious, live it to the fullest while you still can.They&#39;re all good, but if you want a video to watch, I&#39;d recommend his 1 million subscriber special: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3rnhyu000w"</p>

They can&#39;t report to city traffic control about their condition.We should be innovating in infrastructure instead - create standardised computer readable infrared road markings, equip each traffic light and each lamp post with a radio beacon, each crash barrier could have a radio marker, create PUBLIC maps of each city, have a central traffic control sypercomputer in each city provide directions to cars. Have each car painted with infrared markers so they recognise each-other. Provide cyclists with something these cars can recognise.We could even make radar-reflective pants so that autonomous cars see them better.the whoe traffic system needs to be looked at and brought to a new set of standards, whatever they may be. I am not sure what they are, but it should be clear to anyome with half a brain thay having a car use a camera to tell if the traffic light is red or green is idiotic.untill a new system is ready, no car without AGI level ai will ever be safeThe only problem is that such collective approach conflicts with the way VCs work."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Related. I listed something for sale on Craigslist recently and got a bunch of messages right away that asked obvious questions that were in the listing. One suggested that his wife pick it up, and can I take Zelle? Went silent when I said cash only.But the most interesting scammer said: &#34;for my safety, can I send you a 6-digit number, and you confirm it, so I know the listing is not fake?&#34; I say yes, unsure what the scam was going to be, but sure it was a scam. Moments later I got an SMS from Google Voice asking me to verify my phone number. Mofo tried to steal my number, presumably to use it to scam other people. I was pissed and impressed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For a while I grew quite fond of wasting phone scammers time. I’d pick up, talk suuuuuuper slowly— like Emo Phillips speed at one syllable every one or two seconds— interrupt with irrelevant questions or anecdotes, and overall just see how long I could keep them on the phone without giving them any information. The best strategy I found was telling them that, yes indeed I did remember owing the IRS or whoever money and I could pay them however and insisting that first they needed to take down my new email address… I’d just start spelling random words incredibly slowly, say I messed up and start over, ask if they needed my checking account number to keep them engaged and then start spelling my email address again. They prey on intellectually disabled folks so pantomiming a stereotypical version of that wastes a ton of time while keeping their interest. Got boring after a while but I got pretty good at it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, how interesting. I started getting these a few months ago, right after starting a new job in a somewhat high-profile area. I have been getting 1-2 per month but found them quite unusual because none of them ever progressed to an actual scam - just a few messages back and forth about the fabricated &#34;wrong number&#34; situation and then each thread would stop, seemingly earnestly.Since there was no obvious scam, I&#39;ve been wondering what the motivation for these was, and actually started worrying about whether someone might be trying to compromise my phone via some yet-undisclosed SMS exploit - why else would there be a systematic effort to get me to spend time exchanging a few pointless messages around the &#34;wrong number&#34; pretext that otherwise went nowhere?I tried calling the senders by phone and found they were all Google Voice numbers, which eliminated the possibility that some actual rich guy had innocuously ended up with a number similar to mine.I asked a few friends and no one else was experiencing the same thing. Glad to hear it&#39;s not just me."</p>

Up until now, most plugins (except Lua-only ones of course) have worked in both editors, but it doesn&#39;t seem like Vim9 will be supported in Neovim, so I guess what people go with now, will decide what you might stick with in the future (unless you&#39;re eager to switch development environments)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Shame that Bram is doubling down with vim9script. This will give vimscript a Python 3 moment, splitting an already small community into even smaller pieces.I wish he’d have embraced Lua like Neovim. It has already been proven to work great (half my plugins are Lua these days, and it performs great), but alas, it was not to be."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article is mostly cliche popsci trash that isn’t worth reading.  Good for a game of logical fallacy bingo.The only interesting development seems to be the methodology but that only gets a passing mention.The rest is basically fearmongering.&gt; In humans, for example, gut bacteria influence how the immune system responds to pathogens and allergens, or interact with the brain, affecting mood.Ok.  But what does that have to do with diversity?  Humans have not been an emotionally rational species at any point in the past.  Arguably the relationship between gut biome diversity and civilization is inverse.  Maybe we want fewer microbes.Lifespan has also increased with decreased gut biome diversity.This is why correlation alone is uninteresting.  You can find it anywhere.&gt; Splitting the difference, people in less developed parts of the world have between 60 and 65 of those bacterial groups, an observation that ties the decrease in microbial diversity to urbanization.Oh come on.  How does a line like this get published?  This is fine if you define “ties” as “moves with” but not “is connected to”.  IOW correlation doesn’t imply causation.&gt; Kyle Meyer, a microbiologist at UC Berkeley, argues such losses are not necessarily a problem. “Maybe we don’t need them,” he points out. But Moeller is worried. “We are really doing some scary stuff to our microbiomes,” he warns.Why is it “scary”?  Nothing in this article established any cause for concern.The guy that developed the methodology is now in search of a problem his solution fits."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"About ten years ago my former PI (second author in the below paper) did quite a job on this in Burkina Faso, analyzing the composition of the gut in children living outside cities, in cities, and a comparison with European children.Obligatory disclaimer: I was working in his laboratory at the time, but I wasn&#39;t involved in that research.https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1005963107"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Pretty much every culture around the world 100 years ago had some staple fermented food. Nowadays, a lot of people in western culture at least outright refuse yogurt or other fermented foods like saurkraut or pickled cabbage that used to be staples in these people&#39;s ancestor&#39;s diets a few generations ago. People are becoming even lactose intolerant. You have to fertilize your microbes so to speak and eat these sorts of foods. Plus once you are doing stuff like making your own yogurt, a jug of whole milk works out a lot cheaper than the chobani stuff."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The sad thing about news like this is that most people only pay attention at all because they&#39;ve been bombarded with anti-Russian propaganda, not because this showcases Google&#39;s awful anti-privacy practices. Despite years of warnings, examples and analysis of where this can lead, the only thing that matters in the end is some emotional trigger word that makes the public think they are dealing with an &#34;outgroup&#34;.The cherry on top of it all is that ProPublica uses Google Search for their website. I am moderately sure that after I post this someone will jump in to comment and defend this practice, showing nothing has been learned.Privacy is important precisely because after your data has been collected and stored, there is no telling where it will end up and what it will be used for."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; This means Google may have turned over such critical information as unique mobile phone IDs, IP addresses, location information and details about users’ interests and online activityCan someone help me to understand this?I thought Google kept this kind of user-preference (interests/activity) data to itself, and used that as the sauce powering its ad auctions. If you run a site, GA will give you IP, location, etc. for inbound traffic, but I didn&#39;t think they would give you data on other users.Does Google actually sell user preference data and IPs in bulk? What product are they referring to here?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is this really a complaint that a single, well-established Russian ad company got the same information from Google that they would give to any US company with an email address?This is part of the cognitive dissonance that insists that Russia has the most effective intelligence services in the world, that can manipulate elections at will and subsume every US social movement to spread its propaganda, but is too stupid and helpless to create a US front company."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In the US at least, any refrigeration technician should already have passed his EPA 608 or 609 and be fully aware that venting a unit can cost him his card rendering him unable to buy refrigerants. Before working on all but small self contained units he must have access to a refrigerant recovery unit. This a compressor sort of thing that can move the gas from the installed unit into a tank for either reuse on site or taking to a reclamation center, where allegedly they can be paid for it.(Yes, my AC units broke and the time to even get a technician to look at them, was so long I researched how to diagnose them and do the easy fixes, ran into the EPA requirement, studied the material and got my EPA certification, bought a bunch of gear off Amazon and refrigerant from a “good old boy” at an exorbitant price (global shortage, plus most is sold in palette quantities), and fixed my own unit in half the time it would have taken to get an appointment with a professional company. The first unit is working. If I succeed at the second unit I’ll even be money ahead. Of course if my yak had already been shaved maybe it could have tolerated the heat.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problematic refrigerants are pretty diverse, being made up of short carbon chains (1-4 atoms typically) decorated mainly with chlorine or flourine atoms. For example:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2,3,3,3-TetrafluoropropeneInterestingly the best option for a refrigerant may be CO2 itself, which if collected from the atmosphere has no global warming or ozone depletion issues.  The only drawback is CO2 refrigeration equipment has to operate at relatively high pressure, but this isn&#39;t a major problem:https://www.rsi.edu/blog/hvacr/carbon-dioxide-refrigerant/Getting rid of the chloro-flouro stuff makes lots of sense, but not producing any of it in the first place would be even better."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Planet Money did a story [1] in 2020 about a US team running a very similar scheme with the same business model to get rid of R12 refrigerant in the Midwest.It turns out running a business where you give people money in exchange for their junk is suprisingly harder than you would think.[1] https://www.npr.org/transcripts/917060248"</p>
