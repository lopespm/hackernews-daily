								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I do not get why people are coming down on AWS here. Elastic made the software available under the Apache License. That gives AWS the right to offer this service. Maybe they did not have right to trademarks, there are courts to settle that.AWS contributes improvements to the project. This is just about Elastic and their business model. They could have not made it open source and it probably just would not have been widely used and successful. It is up to Elastic to come up with a business model that works, not blame others if it is not."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"AWS are the good guys here. Elastic built a popular product off the work of countless open source contributors. That&#39;s how they became a market leader in this product space. It&#39;s how open source works. The people who contributed to the product did so with no expectation of reward except that their efforts would remain open source.Elasticsearch got popular, and now Elastic wants to reap all the rewards and make money off the product. They&#39;re free to do that, and create restricted-license or closed-source versions for future enhancements. But the community doesn&#39;t have to buy into that and continue to contribute to what is no longer truly an open source product. AWS is forking it and continuing with the original, truly open source license.This is pretty much exactly what happened to MySQL, and now we have MariaDB, which is a better and truly open source product.AWS does plenty of things worth criticizing, and one can even criticize them in this particular instance for not working with Elastic to provide more support to whatever it was they were asking for. And Elastic may very well have a legitimate gripe about trademarks. But yanking the Apache license out and moving to a more-restrictive license is not the right solution, and is not what everyone who contributed to building the product signed up for.You can&#39;t create an open source project, wait for it to gain market dominance, decide to be less open source, and expect the community to continue contributing.Elastic shot themselves in the foot and now they can either revert their decision or get left behind as the community moves on to what will ultimately end up being the better product."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While it&#39;s great that AWS has indeed contributed fixes to upstream Elasticsearch, they link to 9 PRs that are generally on the trivial end of the scale. (Though I don&#39;t doubt the PR that adds a missing synchronized keyword might have been gnarly and time consuming to debug, and that diff size does not necessarily correlate to importance)For a project AWS was making hundreds of millions in revenue on four years ago (as per an ex AWS employee), patting your own shoulder for such a trivial amount of contributions is a bit disingenuous. They might have contributed more, but if there was something significant, they probably would have mentioned.Notable new features like &#34;ultrawarm&#34; they did not attempt to contribute upstream, nor open source at all: https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/05/aws-annou..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is really cool. Kudos to Microsoft for really getting open source lately. I wrote an app (which failed miserably) called zenaud.io . When I started writing the app, Apple was hands-down a better developer experience. Now, it&#39;s the exact opposite -- MacOS is increasingly painful, throwing up more and more roadblocks and constricting their platform ever more. And Visual Studio is better than Xcode IMO.Also, as a C++/Python dev - it&#39;s increasingly hard not to notice the awesome momentum Rust has garnered."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Rust needed a GUI and Microsoft provided one. They seem to be very focused on giving developers what they need, but only to a point. I&#39;ve been doing some system glue stuff and while it&#39;s nice that powershell has ssh an scp they are missing some options I want. I was going to use curses with python (batteries included!), only to find out it&#39;s not supported on windows.It almost feels like a strategy - be standard enough to bring people in, but idiosyncratic enough to lock them in.I&#39;ll be using gtk-rs thank you very much."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was curious how this worked: The previous iteration of this only worked for WinRT API, and this new crate seemed to also work by generating code from WinMD files. But WinMD files only contained definitions for WinRT/COM APIs, so how could this possibly work?Well turns out, microsoft started a project to also generate Win32 API information in WinMD file, to generate APIs from them automatically for all native languages! See win32metadata[0]. This could make interfacing with win32 APIs a lot more convenient!https://github.com/microsoft/win32metadata"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of my all time favorites. Can’t remember where I first read it (Quora?), but it’s currently my top Google hit for “balloon programmer project manager joke”. [0]============A man is flying in a hot air balloon and realizes he is lost. He reduces height and spots a man down below. He lowers the balloon further and shouts:&#34;Excuse me, can you help me? I promised my friend. I would meet him half an hour ago, but I don&#39;t know where I am.&#34;The man below says, &#34;Yes, you are in a hot air balloon, hovering approximately 30 feet above this field. You are between 40 and 42 degrees North latitude, and between 58 and 60 degrees West longitude.&#34;&#34;You must be a programmer,&#34; says the balloonist.&#34;I am,&#34; replies the man. &#34;How did you know?&#34;&#34;Well,&#34; says the balloonist, &#34;everything you have told me is technically correct, but I have no idea what to make of your information, and the fact is I am still lost.&#34;The man below says, &#34;You must be a project manager&#34;&#34;I am,&#34; replies the balloonist, &#34;but how did you know?&#34;&#34;Well,&#34; says the man, &#34;you don&#39;t know where you are or where you are going. You have made a promise which you have no idea how to keep, and you expect me to solve your problem. The fact is you are in the exact same position you were in before we met, but now it is somehow my fault.&#34;[0] https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/2rn8qx/i_h..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"(Not my joke)At a recent real-time Java conference, the participants were given an awkward question to answer:
&#34;If you had just boarded an airliner and discovered that your team of programmers had been responsible for the flight control software, how many of you would disembark immediately?&#34;
Among the forest of raised hands only one man sat motionless. When asked what he would do, he replied that he would be quite content to stay aboard. With his team&#39;s software, he said, the plane was unlikely to even taxi as far as the runway, let alone take off."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is an oldie (I first heard it in the 80s) but is one of my all time favorites.  While it can be told about any two classes of people it really applies to a lot of code I encounter:  A physicist is showing a thermos to her friend, a programmer.

  &#34;It&#39;s amazing&#34;, she said.  &#34;You put a cold drink inside and regardless of how hot it is outside the drink stays cold&#34;.

  The programmer is suitably impressed.

  &#34;But that&#39;s not all&#34;, she continued.  &#34;You can put a *hot* drink inside and no matter how cold it is outside the drink stays hot&#34;.

  Now the programmer is perplexed.

  Plaintively he asks, &#34;But how does it know?&#34;


I think of this whenever I read code that contains a gratuitous state variable that explains the type or content of some data structure rather than make the data structure self-explaining.  Even more annoying when it&#39;s a class.Having to coordinate two variables is a recipe for bugs down the road.  Seems like it should be a beginner&#39;s mistake but I see it all the time in &#34;non beginner&#34; code."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is an encouraging move.My secondhand understanding was that Intel was losing top talent due to pressure to pay closer to median industry compensation. Top engineers recognized they were underpaid and left the company.I&#39;ve been part of a similar downhill slide at a smaller company in the billion dollar revenue range. To be blunt, once the [mediocre] MBAs start realizing that the engineers are getting paid more than they are, the pressure to reduce engineering compensation is strong. Frankly, there are plenty of engineering candidates on the market who are happy with median compensation. Many of them are even great engineers and great employees.However, being a top company in a winner-take-all market requires the top engineers. The only way to attract and retain them at scale is to offer high compensation. I&#39;m hoping that&#39;s part of what&#39;s happening here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A bit off topic but I remember when Intel set up a special career fair presentation for my major.I forget the specific role the manager was hiring for, but it sounded like a quality/reliability engineer. Basically run a bunch of tests, identify and analyze errors on newly manufactured equipment.I immediately lost interest when the manager said the role would either work until 9 PM or start the next day at 4 AM due to an important (daily?) 7 AM meeting where the results would be presented. Ontop of that, it was required that you be on call during every weekend and most holidays. You would be required to do this for your first two years as an entry bachelor degree worker. Entering masters level students wouldn&#39;t need to be on call.After that, he mentioned this role would pay ~$65,000 USD. Bonus &lt; $5000. To live in the bay area. Then he bragged to us about the ability to buy intel stock at a 15% discount or something like that.The manager presented in a room with fully qualified people to work at any FANG/Graphics/Aerospace company.I sold all my intel stock the next day [late 2019], it made up most of my portfolio at the time. I just did not see how intel would attract talent if it over-worked and under-compensated entry level employees like that. Compared to the FANG employee getting free meals, game rooms, huge salary, etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In my estimation, Intel has four categories in which it is being outperformed by key competitors:1. TSMC/Samsung - fabrication2. AMD/Amazon-Graviton - Cloud Server3. Apple-M1/AMD - Laptop4. Nvidia/Amazon - Cloud ML/DL AcceleratorIntel has made giant blunders in the past (e.g. Itanium [1], Atom [2], WiMAX [3]) but I&#39;m not sure that any of these past challenges were equivalent to the current four-front war. I would not count Intel out at this point but it will be several years before we know if they were able to right the ship.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itanium[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(system_on_a_chip)[3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WiMAX"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For anyone who hasn&#39;t yet had the pleasure, Scott&#39;s (fiction) book Unsong is magnificent.  It&#39;s one of the best books I read last year, and I read constantly.http://unsongbook.com/Ebookhttps://github.com/JasonGross/unsong_scraperSample:“I AM BUSY. I AM TRYING TO FIX CONTINENTAL DRIFT.”“I…didn’t know it was broken.”Uriel’s face became more animated, his speech faster.“IT HAS BEEN BROKEN FOR FIVE WEEKS AND FIVE DAYS. I THINK IT BROKE WHEN I RELOADED NEW ZEALAND FROM A BACKUP COPY, BUT I DO NOT KNOW WHY. MY SYNCHRONIZATION WAS IMPECCABLE AND THE CHANGE PROPAGATED SIMULTANEOUSLY ACROSS ALL SEPHIROT. I THINK SOMEBODY BOILED A GOAT IN ITS MOTHER’S MILK. IT IS ALWAYS THAT. I KEEP TELLING PEOPLE NOT TO DO IT, BUT NOBODY LISTENS.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m glad that Scott is back (and that Substack will make it easy for him to get paid for his work).That said, some of the best things about Slate Star Codex were stumbling on the archives, going down a rabbit hole of old LessWrong posts, the links in the blogroll. Substack is much worse than a standard WordPress blog when it comes to that sort of casual reading and creating a permanent home for posts that are timeless. [1]I&#39;m all for creators being paid for their work, I just hope that SSC doesn&#39;t lose anything that made it special with the new platform.[1] Applied Divinity Studies / Nintil on Substack: https://nintil.com/substack-milquetoast"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I particularly liked the emotional end to this post, and I&#39;m very glad he ended it with such a strong and positive tone.Online communities are able to connect people that, before the Internet, would have had a very difficult time finding the right peers for them. Some communities adjacent to SSC (and some near HN) have helped me find some amazingly smart and cool people, and I&#39;m very thankful that they exist (and that Scott can continue blogging as well), and if anything I hope we can encourage significantly more niche community building on the Internet, and with many more modalities than blogs, forums, and comments (which SSC indeed has).His notes about people being afraid to express themselves, have open discussions, be honest, and share with one another are pretty saddening however, and I hope that we can progress towards a better area here, even if progress sometimes seems slow or impossible."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I got some hands-on time with the Pico and made a video for it [1], with a tiny project I decided to try out with MicroPython.It was the first time I&#39;d ever tried MicroPython, and I have to say I&#39;m a huge fan. As a dev who came from PHP/Javascript into Java and Python (heh, not quite the same thing but that&#39;s how life was), I find MicroPython a lot more intuitive than the Arduino language or raw C.I also learned that Adafruit maintains their own flavor, CircuitPython [2].Definitely worth trying out if you haven&#39;t, and know any Python![1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUCgYXF01Do[2] https://circuitpython.org"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some high level info on the Pico [1]:  - New RP2040 microcontroller with 2M Flash
  - Micro-USB B port for power and data (and for reprogramming the Flash)
  - 40 pin 21x51 &#39;DIP&#39; style 1mm thick PCB with 0.1&#34; through-hole pins also with edge castellations
   - Exposes 26 multi-function 3.3V General Purpose I/O (GPIO) 
   - 23 GPIO are digital-only and 3 are ADC capable
   - Can be surface mounted as a module
  - 3-pin ARM Serial Wire Debug (SWD) port
  - The power supply achitecture is pretty simple (you can power the unit from micro-USB, external supplies or batteries)
  - Buy price is $USD 4.00
  - MicroPython &amp; C++ SDK
  - Pinout Diagram: https://files.littlebird.com.au/Shared-Image-2021-01-21-17-39-47-GVzHd.png
  - When using MicroPython, the programming model is similar to other boards where you have to unplug and plug back in the board. I hope this is ok on the Micro-USB port.
  - The isn&#39;t currently a version with header pins, so you&#39;ll have to add your own, or get one from a Reseller who will mode them for you (like this one [2]).

The burried the lede is that Raspberry Pi have created their own silicon (just like that other fruit company).
They call their Microcontroller the &#34;RP2040&#34;:It boasts some impressive specs:  - Dual-core cortex M0+ at up to 133MHz
  - On-chip PLL allows variable core frequency
  - 264K multi-bank high performance SRAM
  - External Quad-SPI Flash with eXecute In Place (XIP)

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I bet that future Raspberry Pi boards will have a RP2040 or successor chip onboard, to do the bit banging/realtime jobs on the I/O port.Or they will even integrate it into their SOC.Shame though, that they didn&#39;t make the IO ports 5V capable. It&#39;s nowadays pretty common for microcontrollers that are meant for industrial and automotive use to have a separate supply for the I/O ports, that can go up to 5V, independent from the core/peripheral voltage.The main use is to drive (logic-level) MOSFETs directly, interface to 5V buses like SENT, CAN, etc. without having to use level shifters."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; There is one thing that has been and is always going to be counterproductive, especially in such situations: blind actionism. Many people flooded the Internet (read: forums, Reddit, bug trackers of projects), inciting panic and suggesting to move to some other “free” hosted platform. This is clearly not a solution. Any hosting platform will sooner or later have to comply with such a request. It can become very expensive if you end up in court."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Regarding GitHub, it is sad that they took down the repository at all. It’s a well-known pattern: platforms rather comply with such requests than risking litigation, requiring projects to invest time and money to fund lawyers themselves (or hope for an association such as the EFF to pick up their case). The moment they published the request and took down the repositories, many experts immediately raised concerns that the request itself is illegal. It remains questionable why GitHub’s legal team didn’t recognize this.ok... am I crazy? I thought when someone sends a DMCA request to you, the platform, that you are required to take the content down and wait for a counter notice from that contents author. The legality of the message is not your problem. You receive the DMCA, you take the content down, if you get a counter claim, you put it back up, the two parties go to court.If that&#39;s correct, then can you really criticize github for following an odious law? Whether we like it or not, they are bound by these requirements."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is really clever. I&#39;ve been wanting to try the WASM version of SQLite for something - this is a really smart usage of it.My https://datasette.io/ project is built around a similar idea to this: the original inspiration for it was Zeit Now (now Vercel) and my realization that SQLite read-only workloads are an amazing fit for serverless providers, since you don&#39;t need to pay for an additional database server - you can literally bundle your data with the rest of your application code (the SQLite database is just a binary file).If you want to serve a SQLite API in an edge-closest-to-the-user manner for much larger database files (100MB+) I&#39;ve had some success running Datasette on https://fly.io/ - which runs Docker containers in a geo-load-balanced manner. I have a plugin for Datasette that can publish database files directly to Fly: https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/publish.html#publishing-..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve also experimented with this, unfortunately the 50ms CPU time isn&#39;t enough for datasets larger than 1.5MB. And the wasm init add at least 100ms to each request even when &#34;hot&#34; in cache.Also, out of a cost perspective, running a VM with SSD for cheap with SQlite will give much more requests than a CF worker for much less.Adding writes to this is also very limited due to the max 1sec write per KV key limit."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As the developer of a pretty popular &#34;utility&#34; browser extension, I&#39;ve been shocked by the volume of email I get every week about it.On a daily basis, I will get requests to sell the extension. Once or twice a week, I will receive an offer to add &#34;a couple lines of code&#34; to my extension which are always generously described as &#34;allowed in the Chrome Web Store&#34; by little fly-by-night organizations that only even have a landing page half the time and usually have throwaway-looking gmail accounts. Out of curiosity, I&#39;ve asked a few what their code does and they never fully describe it, but it either collects analytics to ship home (my extension runs on all sites, so it&#39;s appetizing to them!) or places paid results at the top of any search results, for which I can make &#34;thousands of dollars a month based on the number of North American users I have&#34;.Here is an example email I received yesterday. It&#39;s a good example of how they call it &#34;an SDK&#34; and looks like one of the more legit ones (they registered a domain to send email from, at least).  We at [redacted] are considering purchasing the complete license and ownership of the extensions which have 50K+ active users, may I know if you would be interested in selling? If so, - what is your estimated price?

  Regarding the SDK monetization which we discussed earlier, as it is not distractive and is compatible with any other monetization. We have straightforward terms and provide support for your users agreement. Our partners generate 3-20 K USD monthly with our solution for the browser extensions.

  As a kind reminder, we are [redacted] — a reputable global peer-to-peer ethical proxy network. All our clients are big reputable companies, we authorize their business before providing any proxy plans. 

  Look forward to your further feedback and discussing further details of our financial proposal for your Software in a short Zoom call or here by emails.

Finally, I am also hounded by teams at Microsoft and Apple, who want me to port the extension to their new plugin ecosystems so it can be featured/showcased. I worked with Apple on one similar thing for an extension and it caused such a huge jump in support and feature requests from users that I was overwhelmed, so I am not keen to do it again until I have more free time. They can&#39;t understand why I don&#39;t want to grow by tens of thousands of users a week, but I&#39;m just one person and don&#39;t make money from it whatsoever."</p>

The only way to be safe is to exclusively download releases from the extensions github repo and to manually install them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I find interesting that GNOME Screensaver&#39;s security depends on it to not crash.Meanwhile, in KDE the lock screen is managed by KDE Session Management Server which ensures that lock screen cannot be bypassed by simply crashing its process.The way it works is follows: ksmserver draws a black rectangle over everything and spawns kscreenlocker. If kscreenlocker crashes, the black rectangle is still here, and ksmserver will spawn kscreenlocker again but this time with software rendering (just in case it crashed due to graphics driver issue). If kscreenlocker crashes four times then KDE Session Management Server gives up, stops respawning kscreenlocker and simply draws the following text on the screen.  The screen locker is broken and unlocking is not possible anymore.
  In order to unlock switch to a virtual terminal (e.g. Ctrl+Alt+F2),
  log in and execute the command:
  
  loginctl unlock-session %1
  
  Afterwards switch back to the running session (Ctrl+Alt+F%2).

If ksmserver itself crashes then the entire session closes.I&#39;m not sure why GNOME screensaver cannot do something like this. Lock screen crashing seems like something inevitable (especially considering buggy graphic card drivers and so on), and it makes sense to prepare for it so that crashes won&#39;t bypass the screen locker."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Does anyone know why lockscreens in Linux have been such a joke? I remember trying Ubuntu couple years ago and when waking up my laptop it would show me my entire desktop with all the information displayed right there in the open for about 10-20 seconds before suddenly engaging the lockscreen. All you had to do was close the lid and open it again and you could just copy whatever was on the screen before the lock screen appeared. I guess it&#39;s because the lockscreen was a separate process that had to start up? Still, what an awful awful design."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Years ago I taught a high school typing class in a K-12 school.  The school didn&#39;t have the funds to get a commercial typing program so I wrote my own typing program.  It evolved over time with features to help me track the students&#39; progress etc.  One day we had a school open house where all the parents could come to school.  We had a bunch of different activities set up in different classrooms and I ended up getting assigned to the 3rd grade classroom to set up my typing program so anyone coming through could test their typing speed.  It was a DOS program and I didn&#39;t want people using anything other than my typing program, so I modified it so you couldn&#39;t quit the typing program.  Over the course of the day the 3rd graders were hanging out in their homeroom not really doing anything productive.  Of course the computer was a novel attraction and they were just smashing keys and exploring my program&#39;s UI.  Eventually at one point I noticed that they had somehow crashed my program with a segfault in what had otherwise become a pretty stable piece of software.  To this day I have absolutely no idea what the bug was."</p>

It&#39;s meant as a check to blunt overzealous prosecutions.Note that the President does not have the corresponding power to convict anyone.An interesting set of pardons was when Andrew Johnson pardoned all the rebels in the Confederacy, including Jefferson Davis.As far as I know, the only Confederate officers convicted and hanged were the ones running the POW camps.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think some (maybe vim experts) jumped a bit too quickly to vimtutor.  In some regard, I agree.  But I tried the initial exercise on my 8 year old and was impressed, so I purchased to have access to the rest.  I&#39;d say I&#39;m a sub-par intermediate vim user - knowing enough to know that I don&#39;t know or use the true power of vim day to day, but have memorized a few &#34;tricks&#34; that seem to impress basic vim users.  Hoping I can leverage this to break a few bad habits I&#39;ve gotten into.  Nice UI and I think the pricing is fair.  Hopefully the content expands, but even if the service isn&#39;t around more than a few years I feel like the $15 will have been worth it.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"While working on Pebble, we ran into a lot of issues as we tried to enable messaging from the watch. For example, we never figured out how to send an iMessage or WhatsApp reply. While digging around for a solution to that problem, I thought it was odd that no one had built a Adrium/Trillian/Meebo chat app for modern chat networks. I buried that thought for a while, until I learned about Matrix two years ago.Matrix is the holy grail of chat. It&#39;s end-to-end encrypted by default, federated and open source. The only problem is that not a single one of my friends or family was on it! Luckily the Matrix folks had already envisioned a solution to this problem - they built an API enabling &#39;bridges&#39; between Matrix and other chat networks. This struck a chord with me, maybe we could finally build a single app that I could use to chat with all my friends, regardless of which chat app they used. Through the Matrix community I met Tulir, the most prolific bridge developer and we started working together on what would become Beeper. I&#39;ve been using it as my primary chat client for almost 2 years now. I could not imagine going back to the hot mess of 12 different chat apps I had before!Beeper is a paid service because I think it aligns interests between us and our users. We make a featureful and secure app, in exchange you pay us money. For those who prefer to self-host, you can run the entire Beeper backend stack on your own server. The vast majority of the code we&#39;ve written for Beeper is open source on gitlab.com/nova. Our desktop client is closed source, but you can use Element (or any open source Matrix client) if you prefer. See our FAQ for more info or I&#39;d be happy to explain more."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just installed matrix and bridges for telegram, slack and whatsapp using the linked ansible playbook. I used my own domain and a new cheap vps.
this took me about an hour.
I connected Element on my android phone to my new matrix server and now I have all chats in one app and on desktop. That is totally great and worked far better and easier than I imagined. Well done."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"First of all, I&#39;ve never heard of PING.Second:&gt; Concerned that web privacy issues were being routinely ignored by many working groups of the W3C, the Privacy Interest Group sought to expand its charter, such that it would have the ability to block any new technical specification that it felt would have negative implications for web privacy.This wasn&#39;t just that Google &#34;vetoed&#34; a new privacy standard, they actually just vetoed the group&#39;s ability to &#34;veto&#34; future standards.Everyone voted for it, except Google.  And that was enough to block it.To Google engineers: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VImnpErdDzA"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The title seems a bit misleading.  If I read this right, Google didn&#39;t veto a privacy proposal- it veto&#39;d giving an interest group within the WC3 &#34;the ability to block any new technical specification that it felt would have negative implications for web privacy.&#34;It&#39;s still probably bad, I&#39;m quite prepared to believe the spirit of the headline (that google is anti-privacy), but it doesn&#39;t seem like this is a case of google directly hurting privacy in web standards."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is precisely why I&#39;m so disappointed in Microsoft for choosing Chromium for Edge. This only gives Google more power to run roughshod over user privacy. I would&#39;ve much rather seen them adapt WebKit or Gecko for Edge. Chromium doesn&#39;t need to be any more powerful.At least will still have Firefox and WebKit to prevent Google from having total reign over user piracy on the web."</p>

We’re revising much of our core threading and thread pooling architecture to handle the distinction better, improve efficiency, and eventually be able to schedule less performance-critical tasks on the efficiency cores.I found this bit interesting.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Thanks OP for sharing my website!Please be gentle with me. This is a project website that I built out of frustration a few years ago. I know there are things that need improving and a lot of things that could be adjusted. I work full time at Brave Software (brave.com) and simply don&#39;t have time to put a ton of effort into MuslceWiki.I do however have a big backlog of videos to add and I&#39;ve slowly been working on an app. We have also re-drawn the homepage images and my long term plan is to move away from gifs to webm or MP4.FWIW, for some reason I was unable to log into my HN account. I made a new one, but the posts seem to be limited. So looks like I&#39;ll be replying in the morning."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well done site.
I have a little mixed feelings about the target audience.
Working out for many years (gym and calisthenics) I know a lot of exercises. Beginners might be tempted to approach their fitness by asking that question:what muscle I want to grow today?That is not the way to go.
If you start out or especially during a pandemic where you need to work with everything you can get go for composite exercises that hit more muscles and are the opposite of isolation exercises you might be tempted to choose from a page like this.
Beginners: full body workouts.
Advanced: 2 to 3 day split.
Expert: you know your drill. and will do whatever works for you.So who should be using this site?
Beginners and advanced should use a plan that is preconfigured. Pros know what exercises they want to configure into their routines.Don’t get me wrong: It’s nice to have for reference but do yourself a favor and use some preconfigured workouts if  you’re starting out.You won’t get a sixpack by only working out abs. Train your whole body and reduce body fat. That’s the way to go."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Couple quotes for those that don&#39;t enjoy spending hours in the gym:&gt; “You do not need to do many different exercises to get strong - you need to get strong on a very few important exercises, movements that train the whole body as a system, not as a collection of separate body parts. The problem with the programs advocated by all the national exercise organizations is that they fail to recognize this basic principle: the body best adapts as a whole organism to stress applied to the whole organism. The more stress that can be applied to as much of the body at one time as possible, the more effective and productive the adaptation will be.”&gt; “There is simply no other exercise, and certainly no machine, that produces the level of central nervous system activity, improved balance and coordination, skeletal loading and bone density enhancement, muscular stimulation and growth, connective tissue stress and strength, psychological demand and toughness, and overall systemic conditioning than the correctly performed full squat.”― Mark Rippetoe, Starting Strength: Basic Barbell Training"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Blog post author here. Since this post, there&#39;s now an option available for DRM-enabled Electron. However, it&#39;s only available through a single vendor, castLabs [0].This is a closed source, downstream effort which means no modifications can be made to Electron itself. All changes must make it upstream to show up in this fork. When asked whether they would eventually merge it upstream, they didn&#39;t provide a clear answer [1].I also wrote a followup blog post with more detail on the current state of DRM options on the web [2]. Spoilers: it&#39;s not great.Regardless of all of these problems, I still hold an interest in browser development and have been working towards making Electron a viable option for building a browser [3].[0] https://github.com/castlabs/electron-releases[1] https://github.com/castlabs/electron-releases/discussions/24[2] https://blog.samuelmaddock.com/posts/the-end-of-indie-web-br...[3] https://github.com/samuelmaddock/electron-browser-shell"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Isn&#39;t this just how DRM works? It&#39;s precisely why so many were concerned about EME being adopted into web standards, and why so many are passionate about DRM-Free media. DRM is designed to put restrictions on where, when, and how media is played, including what software it&#39;s used with.This doesn&#39;t invalidate any of the author&#39;s points, and they&#39;re right to be upset. But the problem isn&#39;t Chrome per se, it&#39;s DRM-encumbered media.And that&#39;s why I buy audiobooks from Libro.fm†, games from GOG†, and (out of necessity) movies and TV shows from iTunes—which are still DRM&#39;d by default but are at least relatively easy to decrypt.----------† Among others, I don&#39;t use any one source."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Apart from the general consternation about an OSS license becoming non-OSS, can we also talk about the problem that companies are formed, invest a whole lot of resources into creating a product, open-source it, and then have Amazon eat into their profits by just installing and maintaining that product as a service?No matter how you slice it, I think Amazon is bad for us end-users, and Elastic is good. Elastic could have released ES as closed source, but they didn&#39;t, and the OSS ecosystem is better for it. They were hoping to make money off their product, which I don&#39;t think anyone can fault them for, but instead Amazon came in and took a bunch of that money while not giving anything back.Now Elastic is not happy, and I wouldn&#39;t be either. As an end user, I&#39;m grateful the circumstances exist that allow companies to make a living from OSS, and I want to encourage that. AWS is the fly in the ointment there, and I don&#39;t see how blaming Elastic for not giving us stuff for free any more is anything other than entitled. We should be grateful that ES is OSS at all, and we should want an environment where companies that produce OSS can thrive, instead of blaming them for wanting to get paid for the work that they release freely into the world.Amazon hinders that, period. I don&#39;t think Elastic is in the wrong here, I think Amazon is."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think I have grown a rather hard stance on this over the years: putting an open source license on a product isn&#39;t a business model. It&#39;s, by and large, a part of a larger business model.A license is a choice. It means you choose to not gain revenue by directly licensing the IP. Instead, you choose to put the code out there without any further legal obligations on your part as well as those who use that code.It also means that you have to find alternate ways of making revenue e.g. by providing consultancy, building services or licensing the trademark (which is an entirely different ball game from open sourcing the code!).The trouble isn&#39;t that Amazon decided to use ElasticSearch in their own offering. The trouble is that Amazon simply out-competes ElasticSearch with their own product when it comes to consultancy, services, etc.To add insult to injury, Amazon made the mistake of leveraging the ElasticSearch brand a few times too many in ways that just rub the ElasticSearch people the wrong way.Of course, the founders of ES could never predict how successful their product would become after a decade. There are plenty of open source products engineered by commercial companies  that never catch the eye of behemoths like Amazon."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My wild guess is that watermarking is done on the client. Doing it at the server stage requires running an encoder for each user connected to the meeting, which increases broadcast costs imensily for Zoom. It would make sense for security reasons, but the trend with them seems to be profit instead.If watermarking is therefore done at the client stage just before being heard/seen at each endpoint, then there is a good chance that it is hackable and watermarking code could be patched or audio/video extracted before watermarking occurs.It would still require whistle-blowers to take this more envolved step before leaking a meeting though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some articles found by googling [1] [2] from two years ago describe this capability as &#34;ultrasonic watermark&#34; so it is not new. I think this is coming to light as Zoom has become popular with the pandemic. For a journalist wanting to sanitize audio I would think they need to remove anything higher than 15kHz.[1] https://www.nojitter.com/video-collaboration-av/zoom-takes-v...[2] https://venturebeat.com/2019/01/22/zoom-is-bringing-ultrason..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is fascinating and really made me think.  The article is pitched at leakers but it could just as likely be pitched at journalists.  If you consume news from an outlet that doesn’t follow The Intercept’s advice then complain immediately to the editor.When you leak something it needs to be credible.  Removing watermarks also reduces the fidelity and therefore the credibility.  If 99% of the screen is blurred and the audio has been transcribed then how does the receiver know this is a real leak at all?The answer lies in reputation.  Leak high fidelity material to a trusted third party, usually a journalist.  This can include just showing them the material though that involves meeting in person.  They will verify the source material, summarise and down sample it to conceal the source actor, and maybe even destroy the source material itself.The economics are simple: if you get a reputation for revealing sources then people will stop leaking secrets to you.  Newsrooms that rebroadcast Zoom caps verbatim are revealing sources and need to clean up their act if we are to continue to rely on what’s left of The Fourth Estate."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I spent 6 months in lock down in a 1 bedroom apartment in Australia. Working from home. 1hr outdoor/exercise a day. No more than 5km from home. We had pretty strict rules. I went for a walk around the block with my mate once a week and spoke to my family on zoom once a fortnight and that was about the extent of my social contact for a large part of 2020.I managed pretty well. I&#39;m a naturally introverted person, which is perhaps a good trait to have in this situation. I&#39;m already used to spending a lot of time by myself and I have things I like to do. This is key, I think. I spent long hours making DJ mixes in Ableton and playing records on my hi-fi. That&#39;s a creative place for me and it was very satisfying to have the time to bury myself in it.I wrote code, not heaps, but I played around with a few things.I dug up some old/remake computer games (Half Life Black Mesa was by far the best)! I watched a bunch of old films I haven&#39;t seen in years, and a few bits and pieces on Netflix. I read books. I went for a 1hr walk every day and enjoyed the sight of trees and the sound of birds. I said a sincere thanks and smiled with my eyes at the people who staff the stores I shopped at once/twice a week. They have a hard job and I think it&#39;s important to convey gratitude to them.I&#39;d be lying if I said it was all fine, there were definitely days when I was bored stiff, depressed or otherwise not in a great place, but it was helpful to remember that everyone was in the same boat, and my sacrifice, along with everyone else&#39;s, are what is going to pull us through.Keep your chins up. Especially you guys in the USA. What a mess you have to fix over there. I hope this year is productive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Personally, I&#39;m not burnt out.To void burn out, I did a few things which I feel are extremely helpful.1. Have a room that is a dedicated office. When I leave this room, I leave the &#34;office&#34;.2. Establish communication throughout the day. This means having slack conversations (typed and video) that are casual. It&#39;s okay to vent on these calls.3. Have a defined schedule - Awake at 6am, washed/dressed by 6:30am, Red Bull (or if you like food) and at my desk by 7am. I do work long hours, but I enjoy it because I&#39;m accomplishing something.4. Work on something that excites you or find joy in your work somehow.5. Lastly, realize most of the mental stress can be managed with a little mindfulness, learning to accept that you still can grow and find joy even when at home and cut back on social media; or if you&#39;re like me, I cut out 99% of social media.I hope everyone remains positive. Do something today, that makes you better tomorrow."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had to leave California (been there 6 years). I was lucky because I had four other room mates to keep me company but even with that it was tough. I also wasn&#39;t really enjoying what I was working on at my previous company (adtech) and needed a change.I ended up moving to Taiwan a few weeks ago. Zero COVID here, and was surprisingly easy to immigrate (coming from someone who was dealing with the US immigration system as a Canadian). Working at a fun startup back on the consumer product side instead. Went to a bar for the first time in a year last week and was able to just sit in a coffee shop with 10 other people this morning. I&#39;m still teaching myself to read/speak Chinese but it&#39;s totally worth it.Anyone with experience with TypeScript/React interested in tagging along to Taiwan, send me an email (my email is in my hacker news profile). I&#39;m actively hiring engineers now. We&#39;re a distributed team across many different countries but a few of us hang out in Taipei together at a coworking space. It&#39;s the best of both worlds, I&#39;m able to WFH when I feel like it but still go to a public space to be around people"</p>

It&#39;s embarrassing.I&#39;m so tired of the rent seeking in the entertainment industry. I want to pay artists and content creators, not an ever growing pile of mediocre middlemen and their lawyers.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think one day we’re going to wake up and discover that AWS mostly runs on Graviton (ARM) and not x86. And on that day intel’s troubles will go from future to present.My standing theory is that the m1 will accelerate it. Obviously all the wholly managed AWS services (Dynamo, Kinesis, S3, etc.) can change over silently, but the issue is EC2. I have a MBP, as do all of my engineers. Within a few years all of these machines will age out and be replaced with m1 powered machines. At that point the idea of developing on ARM and deploying on x86 will be unpleasant, especially since Graviton 2 is already cheaper per compute unit than x86 is for some work loads; imagine what Graviton 3 &amp; 4 will offer."</p>

What failures happened in Intel&#39;s engineering/engineering management of its fabs that led to it getting stuck at 14 nm? Only the people in charge of Intel&#39;s fabs know exactly what went wrong, and to my knowledge they&#39;re not talking. If Intel had kept chugging along and got down to 10 nm years ago when they first said they would, and then 7 nm by now, it wouldn&#39;t have any of these other problems. And we don&#39;t know exactly why that didn&#39;t happen."</p>

China has shown a willingness to flex its muscles on enforcing its values beyond their borders. China is smart, and plays a long game.

And maybe every 10 years thereafter.Google&#39;s Eric Schmidt suggests that young people should change their name upon reaching adulthood:

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Death is no escape either - my grandfather died almost thirty years ago but you can still find his name and last address on all of the people search sites. My grandmother was still getting marketing materials addressed to him when she died about five years ago. I had an uncle who died in the early 80s and there is no trace of him, so 90s seems to be the point at which the data brokers decided that nobody ever dies. Online advertising is already a sham (no really, I am never ever going to download Homescapes but I see ads for it thirty times a day), add on top of that all the dead people’s data being passed around. There really needs to be some regulation and oversight."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the article they mention a user being angry that they lost their kick data. It felt like they were highlighting this scenario like it was somehow weird or unusual that a pregnant mother was upset that she lost this data.This &#34;fascination&#34; from the author is unhelpful IMHO.I am not surprised that the pregnant mother was upset - in the UK it is now drilled into you that you need to keep track of kick data for your child and that you must - must - call the hospital as soon as you notice any change at all in kicking from your unborn child (1).They are deliberately very vague and unclear about what a &#34;change&#34; constitutes - just that if you feel something has changed at all or in any way then you need to call. From experience, these calls always end with a request that you go into hospital for a check from a midwife. So 55 kicks today, but 60 yesterday?  Come in and a midwife will hook you up to keep track of your baby&#39;s vitals for an hour just to be sure with lots of reassurance that you did the right thing by coming in and getting it checked.So no shit if you&#39;ve entrusted this data to an app and they&#39;ve dropped the ball, no wonder you are angry: this is not just data for data&#39;s sake - not having it potentially endangers the life of your unborn child because you don&#39;t have your historical data to compare against any more, so you can&#39;t know anymore if today&#39;s kicks are changed from yesterday&#39;s or the day before etc.I am sure many people will scoff and call this an overreaction (including apparently the author of the article) but this is the current recommendation from the NHS here, and not everyone has a totally normal medical history or otherwise-textbook pregnancy where it is all skipping through meadows of wild daisys and baby ducklings quietly nuzzling at your feet followed by the perfect stress and pain free delivery. People can and do have medical circumstances that influence pregnancy. It ain&#39;t all plain sailing.People have reason to need to trust that their medical data is stored safely and reliably. To insinuate that is is odd is deeply unhelpful.1 - https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/your-babys-movemen..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The way Thai&#39;s feel about honor and defamation is a lot more complex and causes friction when the (existing Western) system tries to apply legal rules of how conflict is resolved (and punishment is applied) in an environment where the old values of honor are still valid.when I still lived in the South of Thailand early 90ies we took people diving from Koh Samui, Koh Phan-gan, Koh Tao. The relationship between Thai&#39;s and the law is a strange one. It&#39;s almost like there are 2 systems. One for Thais one for &#34;Farang&#34;.A Thai would not dare to speak ill of the monarchs. They leave the room if a &#34;farang&#34; has had one too many and says something critical (they&#39;re peace loving but their love of peace might end there). This applies to both the very rich and the very poor.We hired the captain from another region of the South to transport our divers. He was with the company since the day these islands were still 100% jungle and the place belonged to local fishermen. The reason why he left the region was because he had an argument and killed his neighbor. The deal was that he would not get killed only if he left the region and settled without ever returning to his family - this is considered not just shameful but seen as a huge disadvantage to make a living. They settled it without police, lawyer, bailiff, or judge, all among themselves.Our other captain (in charge of the boat that left Koh Phangan) was also the right hand man of the most powerful person on the island. That guy was like a major, or village elder because he owned what was then the only &#34;super market&#34; on the island, and lot of the land. Our captain and &#34;right hand man&#34; to this guy was a devout monk (every year for several months left his wife to sweep the floor in silence in the monastery). He was a family man, highly respected within the community, and it was no secret among Thais that he was also heavily armed and had a body count of 12 people in his short life (late 20ies).While murder is obviously illegal by law in Thailand, it is still used as a way by locals to settle disputes within rural areas of the South. The illegality isn&#39;t even considered here since in this case they see it as their moral duty which still trumps whatever some judge/lawyer&#39;s definition of justice is who has never before left Krung Thep.Long story short it&#39;s quite complex to transform what is still in ways a tribal society into what we call &#34;law-abiding&#34; citizen. Especially when the law contradicts the values of society. And even more so when the existing police force is just a show for the tourists and to the urban population."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In Poland, we still have a blasphemy law. A newspaper along the lines of Charlie Hebdo had its owner dragged over courts for over 8 YEARS. The offense was illustrating an article about emptying churches with a surprised Jesus in a road sign. The newspaper routinely posts much more offensive content: cartoon dicks, cartoon sex, caricatures of pope, Jews, politicians (some dick-headed or engaged in homosexual sex), national flags in dog shit... But it was ostensibly a surprised Jesus that crossed the line.Since the current government entrenched itself, police is investigating things like suspicious duck-shaped snowmen next to statues (related to last name Kaczyński). The party leader that had 80 police squad cars guarding his villa.One of worst parts of thin skinned politicians is fabricating excuses to harass people they don&#39;t like."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I know this is probably what most users want but I hate the why Chrome&#39;s camera/mic permissions work. Your options are(1) block a domain from camera/mic access(2) give a domain camera/mic access forever2 is what people pick. From that point on, that domain, in an iframe, can turn on your camera/mic. That means if messanger.com or meet.google.com or zoom.com wanted to make zoom.com/embed/this/url/as/iframe/to/spy/on/people.html they could, and then sell that service for ads to embed in their ads. They have the permissions needed to turn on the mic/camera whenever they want at that point, no more questions asked.That bugs me.Firefox at least has &#34;allow camera access once&#34;.I don&#39;t know what a better solution is. One might be mic/camera permission per URL instead of domain. I supposed that&#39;s not really any different if you can just append ?dothespything=trueAnother might just be that it always asks. It&#39;s not like the phone feature of a smartphone has the option to just always answer immediately. Instead you choose whether or not the take the call. Does it need to be any different on a webpage?PS: I like that webpages have this feature. I like that I can video chat/conference in a sandboxed environment instead of having to install a native app that can spy on me in other ways too. I just wish this permission issue worked differently."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good analyses, but I was expecting more discussion of how best to work with (conceptual) state machines when writing code.I&#39;m no expert on the matter, but there are code-generative tools out there that help make state machines very explicit: you describe the state machine, and the system generates the code. This should help to avoid issues with transitions that you failed to consider, which may be of real value as such unexpected transitions may pose a serious security issue when implementing the state machine &#39;by hand&#39; in code. More so than many design patterns, it seems to make good sense to use a code-generative approach for state-machines.This is of course related to how regex works, as regex is implemented with state machines, but state-machine code-generator systems might not make use of the usual regex syntax.Related reading: Turning vaguely reassuring finite-state machines into regular expressions, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25496045"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Every time a vulnerability like this comes out, especially if it&#39;s a company that has some people with a chip against them (and most companies do), people say &#34;See, that&#39;s why you can&#39;t trust Company With Vulnerabilty, I never use their software.&#34;But if you actually pay attention you&#39;ll realize that vulnerabilities happen everywhere. Not all software is created equal, some might be more secure and have fewer vulnerabilities than others. But a single exposed vuln, no matter how severe, is pretty much never enough to judge which software is which.I remember hearing about this exact bug in Facetime, but I had no idea that, as OP demonstrated, an analagous bug effected pretty much every popular similar A/V group chat software. Including the vaunted Signal.Did this one OP find and reveal it in all of them? wow.Also, I really wonder how many of these the NSA knew about before we did, but who can say (except the NSA)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In my experience, the output from GPT-3, DALL-E, et al is similar to what you get from googling the prompt and stitching together snippets from the top results. These transformers are trained on &#34;what was visible to google&#34;, which provides the limitation on their utility.I think of the value proposition of GPT-X as &#34;what would you do with a team of hundreds of people who can solve arbitrary problems only by googling them?&#34;. And honestly, not a lot of productive applications come to mind.This is basically the description of a modern content farm. You give N people a topic, ie &#34;dating advice&#34;, and they&#39;ll use google to put together different ideas, sentences and paragraphs to produce dozens of articles per day. You could also write very basic code with this, similar to googling a code snippet and combining the results from the first several stackoverflow pages that come up (which, incidentally, is how I program now). After a few more versions, you could probably use GPT to produce fiction that matches the quality of the average self published ebook. And DALL-E can come up with novel images in the same way that a graphic designer can visually merge the google image results for a given query.One limitation of this theoretical &#34;team of automated googlers&#34; is that what they search for content is cached on the date of the last GPT model update. Right now the big news story is the Jan 6th, 20201 insurrection at the US Capitol. GPT-3 can produce infinite bad articles about politics, but won&#39;t be able to say anything about current events in real time.I generally think that GPT-3 is awesome, and it&#39;s a damn shame that &#34;Open&#34;AI couldn&#39;t find a way to actually be open. At this point, it seems like a very interesting technology that is still in desperate need of a Killer App"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The intention behind it is pretty good. Best of luck to them.I wonder if I can donate computing power to this remotely. Like the old SETI or protein folding things. Use idle CPU to calculate for the network. Otherwise the estimates I have seen on how much it would take to train these models are enormous."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Serious question: is there a warez scene for trained models yet?(I don&#39;t know how the model is accessed - are users of mainline GPT-3 given a .pb and a stack of NDAs, or do they have to access it through access-controlled API?)Wherever data is desired by many but held by a few, a pirate crew inevitably emerges."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"HR is not your friend and your company is not your family.Regardless of intent there are commercial realities that exist within the context of a company that may never be present in a non-work relationship. This has varying degrees of impact on the nature of the relationship itself and may not present itself until you are at your most vulnerable.I find that a collegial environment with shared goals and responsibilities can be equally rewarding as non-work relationships even if we all have some level of underlying self-interest at heart. Our day-to-day interactions can also be made more pleasant if we are not constantly reminded of the at times competitive, zero-sum, structure of professional engagements.At a team level your colleagues may be your friends but one shouldn&#39;t conflate professional relationships with personal ones."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really don&#39;t enjoy the tone here. The derision with which it speaks about managers, like they are either evil or incompetent, is unfair in my experience.(my) Managers are just people. They have a task, they do their best to get that task done. Sometimes they decisions that seem bad to me. Often that is because I misunderstand their goals. Sometimes, it is because I know something they don&#39;t, and something they couldn&#39;t verify if I told them. And other times, they just made a mistake, or weren&#39;t told the relevant information by me or others.Indeed, sometimes their goals are somewhat self serving. But often it just has to do with wider business goals than what I am working at. I am grateful for them keeping an eye on those. Leaving me to worry less about the biggest of pictures. That however, doesn&#39;t mean I should just bog down on the small picture of my work, and deem everything that seems bad in that context as stupid."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Performance reviews are a joke because almost nobody knows how to measure anyone else&#39;s effectiveness. They are just a continuation of the same popularity contests you thought you left behind from middle school, high school, and maybe even your college/university days.This has a bit of truth. In my experience climbing up the ladder is so disconnected from actual reality. There’s quite a bit of a buddy buddy / quid pro quo system that goes on when it comes to promos.There are people who do the actual work and take it 99%, and others who stitch the last 1% and take credit for all of it. Our Industry loves rewarding for features over things that customers actually care about. I’ve seen many feature promos in my life. One year later we’d have to kill the whole feature because it’s not worth the maintenance cost.One of my managers believed folks who write python and JS are not real programmers, C and go programmers faced hard problems therefore they are more real. There was also the unconscious bias that women can’t lead projects so opportunities weren’t given to them. Over time women kept leaving. Over time really stellar frontend engineers kept on leaving.It also baffles me how much energy is spent on hiring people, vs mentoring and fostering them so they grow and are promoted."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The issue with estimates are expectations. While nobody acknowledges it, you&#39;re not actually asked for an estimate, you&#39;re being asked for a quote.The difference is when you&#39;re asked for a quote, you&#39;re asked how much you will be charging, with the expectations that you&#39;ll be willing to eat into your own margins to give a lower quote. That&#39;s why it&#39;s a negotiation, where you negotiate how much extra effort, time and headcount you&#39;re willing to give, how much tech dept you&#39;re willing to take, etc., for the privilege of getting their business.If you see it for what it really is, you&#39;ll see that it works pretty well actually. The business gets more out of you for less to them. It was never about having an accurate timeline or helping with planning or prioritizing, and always about negotiating a better contract with the dev team.Now keep in mind that the &#34;business&#34; in this case is a person who need to report that through their amazing prowess of administration and management, they personally managed to get X feature out during their last review cycle at Y cost with impact Z. This person will not need to deal with developer satisfaction, retention and performance. They will not need to deal with the impact the lower margins they pushed for had on the next feature delivery, or the continued maintainance of the systems. And if the dev team had to lower the quality too much in order to meet the quote they put out, that will be 100% their fault, the &#34;business&#34; will know not to use them for their next contract, or they&#39;ll expect the dev team to take on fixing all the issues at their own expense once more."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s unfortunate that this HN thread has been reduced to the generic discussion about software estimates when the article is specifically talking about research done on the topic of software estimates.According to the article, proper research remains a struggle due to outdated datasets from before modern agile methodologies, and that the modern datasets from industry are hard if not impossible to gather.If industry is truly interested in improving software development and estimation, their data should be anonymized and made available to researchers for analysis."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If someone can conclusively teach inexperienced programmers good approach to estimates (methodology) + help embed this into sales process of a software house-type company, I know some folks who&#39;d love to have this :)My own experience has been this: people make estimates, client has expectations based on some variant of those, and something later happens but so much change is introduced during the actual software development, that there seems to be no sane way to compare what happened with original estimates. (new features, changed features, lots of new information, market shifts/product vision shifts, quality assumptions change, etc. etc.)But at that point nobody cares! People go on with further projects, and no data is ever collected.Nobody learns.When f*ckups happen, i.e. a gross over- or under-estimate, this is often not shared with the broader organization (ashamed/afraid sales people/PMs/devs say nothing/hide it/sugarcoat it). Client walks away.Sometimes project is severly underestimated but usually not just because of the software part. Again, no decoupling and estimation of contributing factors is done.It&#39;s insane."</p>

But I think this illustrates something important: what constitutes a context switch is not universal. It depends on what parts of a task you need to think about.In the kitchen, from long practice, I do not have to think about prep, technique, or washing up. There are no decisions I need to make for those tasks. They take very little attention. This frees me to spend my focus on the more abstract goals of what I want to cook, and for me it is not a context switch to wash a bowl while an onion is sauteeing. I can certainly cook while keeping the kitchen clean more efficiently than I could cook and then clean it. But when I was first cooking, it was a context switch to go from chopping an onion to chopping a carrot. Both tasks required my attention and focus."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve recently been assigned a course to teach where I need to mark lots of assignments. These assignments have 12 short answer questions and each student must do them.Slowest part about marking these is having to context switch for each question. So I&#39;d mark Q1 , then Q2 etc for one assignment, then go over to the next one and start back at Q1.I figured this was super inefficient since I needed to have the answer and context of the question in my mind and keep switching.So I wrote a program to parse all of the questions from all of the reports and present them to me in question batches. So now I see all of Q1 one after the other for each student&#39;s and mark those. Then once all of the Q1&#39;s are done, I mark all the Q2&#39;s. After all the marking is done, I run that through another program that then formats that data to each student so it&#39;s back onto their individual report plus any comments or deductions.I find that apart from saving the time to have to open tonnes of docx files, now it takes maybe 5 mins to mark everything."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"That was a fun read. I wish the author mentioned how much he was trying to sell the service for. It could have been $59 a month or $599 a month and with doctors you could potentially expect the same answer.I&#39;m not a psychologist but some of the author&#39;s quoted text came off extremely demeaning in written form. If the author happens to read this, did you really say those things directly to them?For example, Susan (psychologist) was quoted as saying:&gt; &#34;Oh sure! I mean, I think in many cases I&#39;ll just prescribe what I normally do, since I&#39;m comfortable with it. But you know it&#39;s possible that sometimes I&#39;ll prescribe something different, based on your metastudies.&#34;To which you replied:&gt; &#34;And that isn&#39;t worth something? Prescribing better treatments?&#34;Imagine walking into the office of someone who spent the last ~10 years at school and then potentially 20 years practicing their craft as a successful psychologist and then you waltz in and tell them what they prescribe is wrong and your automated treatment plan is better."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m kind of concerned that people read this as satire but miss the most important part, namely the absence of concern about the safety and validity of the results.  You know, the part where he stuck some statistical software in front of a database populated by a &#34;motley crew&#34; of contractors and wanted doctors to use it as a shortcut for making patient care decisions.  The part where he implicitly compares the HTML spit out by his system to peer-reviewed work by professional researchers.  The part where he is proud of &#34;beating&#34; a &#34;record&#34; for least discriminating meta-analysis.Reading this story and talking about his marketing and product development process feels like watching Lovecraft Country and then then only talking about the time travel physics of it.  There&#39;s something real and awful here, hopefully presented in a fictionalized or highly exaggerated form.  The people in my social circles who mistrust tech and despise startup culture -- this is exactly how they see us."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article&#39;s thesis seems to be that medical professionals are not incentized to provide the best interventions, and as a result, wouldn&#39;t pay for this service. However, what the author fails to mention is the competitors in this space that are successful, such as Up To Date, which provides really high-quality research trial data: https://www.uptodate.com/homeRather than building a product that informs medical professionals about effective interventions, I wonder if the creator would have had more success if he deeply explored what sources of information these medical professionals pay for now - do they pay for anything at all, such as UpToDate, and don&#39;t want to pay this because it&#39;s an additional expense? If the creator found which sources people are using, the creator could sell this database as a feature for these partners and widely disseminate this data through partner channels rather than creating a competing source of information. It seems to be a case of this being a good instance of a B2B2C model, where selling this service to other businesses that sell directly to medical professionals could be more viable than trying to sell directly to them.Alternatively, if the creator wanted to sell to patients, rather than medical professionals, the blueprint here is all of the consumer reports companies, such as Wirecutter, which is one of the New York Times&#39;s most popular services. Here, again, a &#34;Wirecutter for medical interventions&#34; could be quite successful, and you could sell this service to media companies that provide consumer reports as a service that would bolster these companies.It&#39;s bad the creator wasn&#39;t able to find traction, as getting more medical data into the hands of consumers could have a huge postive impact over time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was a foster kid for 11 years. My social worker and foster parents were likely the only reason I am still here. My social worker would visit his children weekly-- even on weekends and did whatever it took for us. Still, he was just one man. I still talk to him regularly. During one discussion, I asked him about the other kids that I remembered. There were only two of us left.
I think people forget about the trauma foster kids deal with. First, the reason kids went into care. Second, the separation of the kid from their families. My experiences showed me that this trauma, combined with an institutional care system does not equip most kids to function in society."</p>

All on drugs, homeless, many in prison, spent time there. Many are having kids that will soon be take away by the state, for good reasons.Our own has done better, but was years of insane drama.Knowing that bio family was out there hurt her immensely.She finally had to spend time with them.   Literally Pulling her drunk biological dad out of a ditch, to realize that they were dragging her down.She does aight these days.Foster kids can be helped, but  you really need multiple strong families or support groups dedicated to the task. For a couple of decades, at least."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"More generally, prisons all over the world serve much more often as a place to put people that society has failed than vice versa. It’s a sad truth that gets very little recognition since these people have no lobby. The American prison situation is certainly particularly awful due to privatization. But it doesn’t stop there. We’re doing terrible things in Europe as well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think something else that would be of interest would be doing this for drug prescriptions: compare the cost that my employer, the NHS, pay for a compound and those that Americans pay for the exact same compound. This is easy on my end at least -- prices and prescription guidance are released in the BNF / British National Formulary annually and are all made available in public. I have never understood the US system of &#34;co-pays&#34; and found the whole thing very confusing.For a few &#34;popular&#34; random examples that I think HN might have heard of: one branded Epi-Pen is £26.45; Naproxen (the NSAID painkiller) is £4.29 / 56 pack; and omeprazole (PPI used to treat gastric reflux) is £0.84 / 28 pack.A more expensive example might be the cystic fibrosis &#34;designer drugs&#34; lumacaftor with ivacaftor -- 112 tablets are £8000 (to be prescribed by a specialist, if the patient has the genotype to respond to it -- a total annual cost of about £26k). The US equivalent is $379,780 [1].(NB: The price you pay as a British patient is usually £0, unless you are a working-aged and working English person -- at which point it is £9.15 per item [independent of its cost] or a fixed &#34;all you can eat&#34; prepayment certificate that works out at about £8.83/month -- which is what I have.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Careful abusing these tricks. Over 10 years ago I decided to implement an RC4 (arcfour) cypher to generate pseudorandom noise for a test program.The algorithm looks like (from wikipedia):  i := 0
  j := 0
  while GeneratingOutput:
    i := (i + 1) mod 256
    j := (j + S[i]) mod 256
    swap values of S[i] and S[j]
    K := S[(S[i] + S[j]) mod 256]
    output K
  endwhile

Being a smartass 1337 coder (and declaring intermediate variables always being a bit of a bother in C89) in my implementation I decided to implement the swap using the xor trick:   s[i] ^= s[j];
   s[j] ^= s[i];
   s[i] ^= s[j];

I then ran a few basic test vectors, everything seems to work fine.A little while later I noticed that the output of the cypher was weird, the longer it ran the more zeroes I would get, eventually getting only zeroes.The keen reader will already have spotted the problem: whenever i and j happen to be equal instead of doing nothing the code sets the entry to 0 (since x ^ x == 0 for any x).And that&#39;s the story of how I never used this trick ever again.In general it&#39;s always better to write clear, concise code and let the compiler optimize it. If it turns that the code is performance critical and the compiler doesn&#39;t do a good enough job then you can see if the smart solution is worth it.And if you fail an interview because the interviewer expected you to know how to find a duplicate in an integer list by using xor then you probably dodged a bullet anyway. What a silly trivia question."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A fun party trick not mentioned here is reducing storage in a doubly linked-ish list:  Normally each node stores 2 pointers:  struct Node {void * prev;void * next}The trick is to use only 1 &#39;pointer&#39;, storing prev XOR next:  struct Node {void* xored;}While traversing, you remember not only the current position, but also where you came from.  So forward traversal goes: next= current.xored XOR previous.  Backwards also works: Node 
 * previous=(Node * )current.xored XOR (Node * ) next.The first and last node can use 0 as previous or next node, or you make a circular list.  You do have to store a pointer to the first and last node, as usual.I&#39;ve never seen this used in the real world, which is probably a good thing.  It also plays hell with garbage collectors like Boehm, as they can&#39;t derive the 2 used adresses.UPDATE: And of course wikipedia knows everything: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_linked_list"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As mentioned in this article, x ^ x == 0. Fun fact, this is frequently used by compilers as a &#34;cheap&#34; way to zero out a register.In addition, there are comparatively few cases in programming where we XOR. Sure, it happens in things like games quite a lot, but the main use is actually _cryptography_.Between these two facts (more like hints really), I managed to reverse engineer the bulk of a piece of malware I was given to analyse in a an internship. I was handed the malware, a copy of IDA Pro, and given a few days to see what I could find. All I could remember when presented with a wall of hex encoded machine code were the hints above. I looked for XORs of different values, assumed it was crypto, and extrapolated from there. Found a routine happening three times in quick succession and guessed it was triple-DES. Then I guessed that writing your own 3DES from scratch was unlikely, so googled for crypto libraries and happened to find one that nearly matched (I think an earlier/unmodified version), and worked my way up tagging the operations until I got to the purpose, exfiltrating various registry keys and browser history to [somewhere].It was a fun exercise, and therefore these facts will stay with me for far longer than they are accurate I&#39;m sure!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Corneal surgeon here ! (Note : I never implanted a keratoprosthesis. This is an extremely unfrequent procedure, usually performed by a handful of surgeons in a given country). 
Some insights about this topic.
This looks like a great device (never heard before !).
This is a keratoprosthesis, meaning this is a last recourse, &#34;no-hope-except-maybe-that&#34;, procedure.
However it looks infinitely more simple and respectful of the eye integrity than current keratoprosthesis, and, if it really acts like a scaffold for native corneal cells and allows a colonization and the obtention of a satisfying corneal surface, it could be a game changer. It is way too soon to know.A significant percentage (I would say around 40-70%, depending on the 
country) of corneal graft indications originates from pathologies coming from the inner layer of the cornea (corneal endothelium). Posterior lamellar graft (DMEK) allows today to change only the thin cellular layer which is pathological, with an usually quick recovery. Even the best performing keratoprosthesis won&#39;t replace this procedure, because we care to preserve the eye&#39;s integrity as much as we can.It is interesting to remember that corneal transplantation is a very special topic because the cornea is not vascularized, meaning less rejection. There still is, of course, but the outcomes as usually good. Keratoprosthesis are today indicated when previous grafts where rejected, when the other structures of the eye are healthy, and when the vision is extremely low. This allows to gain a few years of very low vision before, usually, losing the eye due to infection or high ocular pressure.The technology presented has the potential:
- to replace current keratoprosthesis and lower the threshold to decide to perform the procedure : yes, almost sure if the device is well-tolerated
- to replace perforating keratoplasty (full corneal replacement, unfrequent today) where the cornea is damaged in its entirety: maybe, highly uncertain for the moment. That would be an incredible step forward, a revolution in our practice.
- to replace anterior lamellar keratoplasty, where the anterior wall of the cornea is replaced : highly unlikely
- to replace posterior lamellar keratoplasty, where the cornea lacks transparency because of inner layer cellular dysfunction: almost impossible.I would also like to raise awareness on the topic of eye rubbing. The eye surgeon community progressively discovers the highly harmful consequences of vigorous and daily eye rubbing. A few teams (mine, notably) even think that it is the single trigger for keratoconus. You will find a nice illustrations of what a rubbed eye looks like in MRI I by googling &#34;don&#39;t rub your eye&#34; (this is me in the MRI ;-) and more explanations here : https://defeatkeratoconus.com/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am a recipient of a dual cornea transplant because of a condition called:   Fuch&#39;s Cornea Dystrophy.In 5-20 years I&#39;ll need it again.I&#39;m not in as bad of shape as the person in TFA.  I&#39;m damn lucky, but to be honest, I&#39;m miserable.  I remember what it was like to have lazer-sharp vision.  Now I can&#39;t work with electronics anymore.  My soldering iron is gathering dust.  I can&#39;t do 30% of my job.  Hell I have to assemble PC&#39;s by feel.  I can&#39;t see the writing on jumper connections, and spend a lot of time taking a picture of a thing and then magnifying the image just trying to figure out what goes where.It&#39;s a shame I am not a mechanic, bolts are much bigger then jumpers.  Working by feel is a fucking bitch."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Keratoconus sufferer here. This looks really cool. I&#39;m probably not going to need a corneal transplant at this point (since my condition appears to have stabilized with age) but I&#39;m definitely going to follow this. Even with correction the acuity in one of my eyes is very bad (like, can&#39;t read 16 point font at arm&#39;s length bad). Since this method takes the tissue rejection concern out of the equation I wonder if an &#34;elective&#34; corneal transplant might be an option down the road."</p>

But we&#39;ve now done the experiment in a big way and the results seem overwhelmingly negative to me, to the point where they present a credible existential threat to civilization, on a par with climate change.Maybe someone here can talk me down from this new position.

Even if you run your own servers, you&#39;re at the mercy of your hosting provider, your ISP, your DNS registrar, and even browser level things like Google Safe Browsing. Any of these can be major points of failure.So yeah, not using AWS would avoid being dependent on AWS, but you&#39;re going to depend on someone. In this sense, inclusion on the internet ultimately has a political dimension. I think that&#39;s just how it is — we live in a society with politics.(I&#39;m omitting commentary on Parler in particular because I have no sympathy for them in this or any other case.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A lot has already been said about them copying or borrowing or just getting their inspiration from Apple, so I&#39;ll skip that.
Unless they fully opensource the code it is unlikely to get any traction. And if it is really based on Linux we&#39;re likely going to see UI and UX issues, An OS is more than just a some fancy icons and modded apps. The transitions that they show in the demo are not easy to achieve as in stability of the software. 
It looks very clean but unlike elementary OS, it doesn&#39;t feel authentic. I don&#39;t know what obsession people have with Apple but they aren&#39;t the only company getting designs and UX right. These avenues are unfortunately killing independent and new design ideas."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wonder if this is going to be the OS of choice for flea-market iPad counterfeits/knockoffs... the Files screen even says &#34;On my Pad&#34; in the shown screenshot.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The Pleiades[1], also known as the Seven Sisters:&gt; It is among the star clusters nearest to Earth... and is the cluster most obvious to the naked eye in the night sky.Only six stars in the cluster are visible to the naked eye yet mythology from several ancient cultures share the idea that one of the seven “sisters&#34; is hidden. The article The world’s oldest story?, originally published in TheConversation [2], states:&gt; The star Pleione... was a bit further away from Atlas in 100,000 BC, making it much easier to see.These two stars now appear as one to the naked eye which the author proposes is the source of the hidden sister. This dates the story to 100 kya.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiades[2] https://theconversation.com/the-worlds-oldest-story-astronom..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminded me of a theory came up with as a teenager, that the Vaanaraas of Ramayana (a group to which the famous &#34;monkey god&#34; Hanuman belongs) may actually be an early hominid that had ape-like features, that lived in parallel with humans in different territory. They were intelligent enough to help the human princes in their quest, which got them a place in their story - a story which went on to become an oral tradition, and got embellished with time to become the Ramayana. If, as proposed here, stories can be orally passed down for tens of thousands of years, that makes it slightly more likely that this outlandish theory actually has some merit to it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a nice theory but sometimes simpler, less glamorous solutions might hold the truth.There are more than 6 &#34;sisters&#34; visible with the naked eye, but most people normally can&#39;t see them.It&#39;s more believable to me that the &#34;missing&#34; 7th sister is just the brightest of the less visible ones.Those less visible would certainly have been used as a test of prowess for determining the keenest-eyed, especially among early societies where such skills were important.&#34;Ah, but can you find the hiding sister?&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When you finally learn to master and config Emacs, you run circles around all other editors. Emacs is so much more than just an editor. But even if you only use it for coding: Magit is the best git client I have used in years (coming from PyCharm + Git Tower App, which is nice), then there‘s Ztree-Diff (excellent folder diff tool; previously using Kaleidoscope app), then Eshell for interacting with the server from within Emacs (programmatically if you like), Tramp for remote editing, excellent integration of ripgrep and silversearcher (ag) into Emacs for code navigation, yasnippet as an excellent templates/snippet manager, and many more packages.What makes Emacs exceptional is you can link all these packages together, create your own workflows by scripting Emacs in Lisp. And I write the docu in Emacs in org-mode, with org-babel I can run shell-scripts / python-scripts and other code in my org-file and see the output underneath it (like Jupyter notebooks), link to code fragments in my org files etcI manage several projects with it and switch contexts with one key-combination: Vagrant box is started, project folder is changed, necessary files opened, ready to hack, build, deploy, do server restarts with a single key stroke.I think VS Code is a nice coding environment with good defaults and many things done right (compare installing packages in VS Code to Sublime! What an improvement) but nowhere near the capabilities and the productivity of Emacs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; It also shines in areas where Emacs doesn’t: if you’re a programmer working on typical contemporary projects, mostly just wanting to get stuff done, things usually… just work. You install VSCode, open a source code file, get asked to install the extension for that particular language, and that’s it. You get smart completion, static analysis, linting, advanced debugging, refactoring tools, deep integration with git, and on top of that, great performance and a cohesive user experience.These days I mostly use VSCode due to great language server integration (Pylance, gopls, rust-analyzer, etc.), but I still rely on Emacs with Magit for almost all my git interactions. This is not helped by VSCode&#39;s shitty commit message box, which after five years is still this ~250x20px by default input field with some after-the-fact validation tossed in. The great thing about Emacs is that everything is a buffer, you get the full editing power afforded by a buffer, not some second-class input field, especially for something as important as commit messages."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On the discussion of values, I&#39;d also like to submit &#34;(expected) longevity&#34; for consideration, which I think is distinct from &#34;stability&#34;.I made the switch from Vim to Neovim as soon as I felt confident that (1) the project was going to be around for a while, and (2) it was on track to &#34;overtake&#34; Vim (you may choose to disagree with me on this, I found built-in LSP to be a compelling selling point, but the specifics aren&#39;t really related to the point I&#39;m trying to make). That it was almost completely a drop-in replacement, down to the init file, certainly didn&#39;t hurt.Under the author&#39;s framework, Neovim apparently prefers &#34;progressiveness&#34; while Vim prefers &#34;stability&#34;, and those two sound dimetrically at odds based on their descriptions; but both have large, active communities that aren&#39;t going anywhere. I&#39;m not sure I can say the same about Kakoune, for example, which is a certainly a promising project but hasn&#39;t yet convinced me to jump the fence.[edit for Emacs thoughts]: Now that I think about it, &#34;text centrism&#34; in my mind is also closely related to longevity. I don&#39;t care as much about the properties of plain text as I do about the fact that I&#39;ll be able to open/view/edit them _even if the application ecosystem dies_. I find Emacs attractive here with org-mode and, to a lesser extent, org-roam (the comparison here would be between e.g. SaaS productivity offerings like Notion)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The nice thing about my 2015 Macbook Pro is that it&#39;s useful without any accessories. I can just throw it in a bag and walk out the door.It&#39;s got enough battery life that I usually don&#39;t need to bring a charger. It has all the ports that I ever need. I can hook it up to a projector with the built in HDMI port, I can put in the SD card from my camera, or I can quickly copy files from someones thumb drive. I don&#39;t need to think about bringing the right kind of cables for what I&#39;m planning to do.Sure, the new Macs are a lot faster, but every Mac released after 2015 would be a downgrade for me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I use two MacBooks for programming for several hours each every single day, my personal machine has a touchbar, my work machine does not. I realize this is blasphemous to say and I did think I would hate the touchbar for all the reasons, but I actually ended up liking it.I had imagined myself tapping virtual function buttons and the whole thing seemed silly and useless and worse than having physical keys, but VS Code and other dev tools actually have good integration, and when I open an app like Adobe Illustrator which I don&#39;t use frequently enough to memorize all the hotkeys it&#39;s quite handy to have the commands listed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article&#39;s criticism of the 12-inch MacBook are preposterous. The 2 lb Macbook is the best laptop I&#39;ve ever owned, by far. Maybe I&#39;m too sensitive about weight, but I feel an incredible difference between 3 lb and 2 lb laptops, especially if its sitting on your lap for extended periods of time. The keyboard and charger have never once been a hindrance to my workflow, as the article makes it out be. I really wish Apple would come out with 2 lb laptops again. Latest line of Macbooks (the &#34;Air&#34;) weigh in at 2.8 lb minimum."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So the cancer cells went with the non-blocking, albeit slower algorithm. With aerobic, pipelines could get filled with ATP and end up blocking the essential NAD+. So the optimization was a loosely decoupled slower fermentation process over the faster aerobic process. Back pressure avoided and all that.So tempting to go with analogies we are familiar with."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"These groups are awesome, but they&#39;re also fragile.Our little English town had an amazing Freecycle group running for a while that got us through the &#34;baby clothes&#34; issues that people are discussing here.  But the next town over had a &#34;Sell &amp; Seek&#34; group that was essentially the same, but for small cash payments instead of goodwill.One woman saw the arbitrage opportunity and started accepting pretty much everything that came up on the Freecycle, only to re-list it on the Sell &amp; Seek.  My wife gave away a big basket of washable diaper stuff and watched as it all popped back up, one item at a time, for $5-$10 each on that Sell &amp; Seek.  Think about the emotional ride that puts you on, from thinking you&#39;d single handedly sorted some new young mom, to realizing you&#39;d been suckered by this... well, not nice person.  Then multiply it by every member of that group that gave anything away in good faith.The Freecycle just sort of went away inside of a month, and now all that&#39;s left is that paid version from the next town over.All it takes for one person to do this and your community dies.  Notice that she didn&#39;t ever do anything illegal or even &#34;wrong&#34; from her viewpoint.  Just the same sort of &#34;disrupting&#34; and arbitrage that we see praised here all the time.But it completely ruined a nice thing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You know what rules about Buy Nothing?Kid stuff.My partner and I have young kids, so it is a revolving door of stuff in our house.Buy Nothing solves a major problem in that if we need to get rid of something, someone wants it. And on the other side of that coin, if we need something, someone probably has it and is looking to part with it.As an added bonus, we have built a much stronger connection with many of those who live in our neighborhood, people we might not otherwise have crossed paths with.In the words of your average Ebay review, *A++++ Would Buy Nothing again*"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My wife participates in our local Buy Nothing group and it’s fantastic. They have a couple of rules that seem to help make it work:1. Hyperlocal: your local group will he made up people near your house. You’ll get to know them. When the group gets too large, it’s split into two smaller groups.2. Not bartering, not first-come-first-serve.  When something is posted, the person offering is supposed to wait a while, then decide who to give it to. I don’t participate in the group, so I don’t know why this makes a difference, but my wife says it does."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The unintuitive thing here (for the general population at least, possibly not the HN crowd) is that almost certainly nobody at Facebook saw, and approved (much less designed) this marketing strategy. It naturally emerged from the goals the system has been given. That doesn&#39;t excuse it: in fact, it indicts automated targeted-advertisement as a category.This software is working exactly as it was designed to. I&#39;m sure somebody could (and probably will, now that it&#39;s made the news) add a rule that makes an exception in this case. But this is going to keep happening, and keep happening, and keep happening, as long as we continue allowing systems to automate our content-feeds, optimized for getting us to spend money."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ll pile on an anecdote. I still have a facebook account but its not something I use very often except the past week given the situation in the USA.My facebook account is very old, when i was more of an active user I did all the usual posts/photos that a lot of liberal urban types contribute.Anyway, after posting some anti-insurrection posts I start noticing all sort of &#34;tacti-cool&#34; gear ads or targeted T-shirt s with some very macho-man hyper masculinity phrases on them.This is very much _not_ me. Now I keep facebook on a tight leash (FB container, privacy settings turned to max) so my guess is that someone out there is spending a lot of money on a huge ad target or somehow facebook thinks anyone who is posting about a US insurrection would like to participate with some neat military cosplay kit."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Yes. That&#39;s what Go is for. Go is for doing the things that Google does on servers, which mostly means web apps of one kind of another. It has all the parts for that, and they&#39;re well-exercised because they&#39;re doing billions of operations per second on Google&#39;s own work. It&#39;s hard-compiled, so you don&#39;t have all the extra overhead of the interpreted languages. Also, Go has a better async story than most web-oriented systems. Goroutines, or &#34;green threads&#34;, do both the job
of threads and &#34;async&#34;. In async land, if anything blocks or uses much CPU time, you&#39;re stalled. Not so in Go. A goroutine can block without stalling other goroutines.Right now, I&#39;m writing a client for a virtual world in Rust. There&#39;s a big need for concurrency, but, unlike web stuff, it&#39;s all tightly interrelated. There&#39;s a GPU to keep busy. There&#39;s network traffic of several different kinds. There are compute-bound tasks which need to be kept out of the frame refresh loop.Rust is good for this. The existing C++ client is too much of a mess to make concurrent; people looked at it and gave up. In Rust, it&#39;s coming along nicely.Use the right tool for the job."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m the maintainer of Juniper. Juniper is a library, not a framework. As such it is agnostic to how you want to solve N+1. You get a lookahead and can do what you want...dataloader (like Facebook), eager loading all data up front (like Rails), generating efficient SQL on the fly (like prisma).There are projects and examples to do all three but we don&#39;t want to assume one solution is right for all domains.We take this to the extreme...Juniper doesn&#39;t even require a web server and isn&#39;t tied to a particular serialization format! Of course, we provide optional integrations with popular web frameworks using json but the key is they are optional."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; But Rust’s memory rules aren’t more secure than Node.js’s or Python’s. Your web application written in Rust isn’t going to be systematically more or less secure than an application in Python or Ruby.Just want to call out that I&#39;ve heard a horror story of a very bad security bug due to implicit shared mutability in Python.(vague to protect the innocent)&gt; Heck, if you ask some people, Rust is less secure than a GC’ed language for web apps if you use any crates that have unsafe code - which includes Actix, the most popular web framework, because unsafe code allows things like deferencing raw pointers.You can write unsafe code in Python (and some of the web frameworks use this) and nothing helps you with auditing it, unlike unsafe blocks in Rust."</p>

Especially in a world of hosted email providers where everyone is using Exchange, Google Email, and even cPanel to host email for organizations, and none of them have a big incentive to support this.EDIT: On thinking about it, I&#39;d think this would have more chances if they phrased it as an augmentation of email&#39;s capabilities rather than an email killer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is actually funny, because I was involved with the creation of this list, way back in 2004.  The whole thing started as a way to stop phishing.I was working at eBay/PayPal at the time, and we were finding a bunch of new phishing sites every day.  We would keep a list and try to track down the owners of the (almost always hacked) sites and ask them to take it down.  But sometimes it would take weeks or months for the site to get removed, so we looked for a better solution.  We got together with the other big companies that were being phished (mostly banks) and formed a working group.One of the things we did was approach the browser vendors and ask them if we could provide them a blacklist of phishing sites, which we already had, would they block those sites at the browser level.For years, they said no, because they were worried about the liability of accidentally blocking something that wasn&#39;t a phishing site.  So we all agreed to promise that no site would ever be put on the list without human verification and the lawyers did some lawyer magic to shift liability to the company that put a site on the list.And thus, the built in blacklist was born.  And it worked well for a while.  We would find a site, put it on the list, and then all the browsers would block it.But since then it seems that they have forgotten their fear of liability, as well as their promise that all sites on the list will be reviewed by a human.  Now that the feature exists, they have found other uses for it.And that is your slippery slope lesson for today! :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"After years of seeing developments like this, getting worse and worse, it fills me with rage to think about how clearly nobody in power at Google cares.I naively used to think, &#34;they probably don&#39;t realize what&#39;s happening and will fix it.&#34;  I always try to give benefit of the doubt, especially having been on the other side so many times and seeing how 9 times out of 10 it&#39;s not malice, just incompetence, apathy, or hard priority choices based on economic constraints (the latter not likely a problem Google has though).At this point however, I still don&#39;t think it&#39;s outright malice, but the doubling down on these horrific practices (algorithmically and opaquely destroying people) is so egregious that it doesn&#39;t really matter.  As far as I&#39;m concerned, Google is to be considered a hostile actor.  It&#39;s not possible to do business on the internet in any way without running into them, so &#34;de-Googling&#34; isn&#39;t an option.  Instead, I am going to personally (and advise my clients as well) to:Consider Google as a malicious actor/threat in the InfoSec threat modeling that you do.  Actively have a mitigation strategy in place to minimize damage to your company should you become the target of their attack.As with most security planning/analyzing/mitigation, you have to balance the concerns of the CIA Triad.  You can&#39;t just refuse Google altogether these days, but do NOT treat them as a friend or ally of your business, because they are most assuredly NOT.I&#39;m also considering AWS and Digital Ocean more in the same vein, although that&#39;s off topic on this thread.  (I use Linode now as their support is great and they don&#39;t just drop ban hammers and leave you scrambling to figure out what happened).Edit:  Just to clarify (based on confusion in comments below), I am not saying Google is acting with malice (I don&#39;t believe they are personally).  I am just suggesting you treat it as such for purposes of threat modeling your business/application."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a relatively long article - but it does not answer one simple question, which is quite important when discussing this: were there any malicious files hosted on that semi-random Cloudfront URL? I realise that Google did not provide help identifying it - but that does not mean one should simply recomission the server under a new domain and continue as if nothing has happened!From TFA:&gt; We quickly realized an Amazon Cloudfront CDN URL that we used to serve static assets (CSS, Javascript and other media) had been flagged and this was causing our entire application to fail for the customer instances that were using that particular CDN&gt; Around an hour later, and before we had finished moving customers out of that CDN, our site was cleared from the GSB database. I received an automated email confirming that the review had been successful around 2 hours after that fact. No clarification was given about what caused the problem in the first place.Yes, yes, Google Safe Browsing can use its power to wipe you off the internet, and when it encounters a positive hit (false or true!) it does so quite broadly, but that is also exactly what is expected for a solution like that to work - and it will do it again if the same files are hosted under a new URL as soon as detects the problem again."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Another similar service is Aira[1].The main difference is that Aira is not free, but you&#39;re helped by professional agents, who had to undergo various background checks and sign airtight NDAs. They have a 5-minutes-per day free plan, and businesses can also offer free service if you&#39;re using Aira with one of their products.My biggest frustration with Aira is that you need to own a phone number in one of the supported countries, which is a pain to set up and maintain.All agents also have TeamViewer installed, so they can quickly and efficiently help with computer issues.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Here I am, a productive developer eager to deliver maximum value to my customers and apply my innovation to company goals.Open up JIRA and pick up a unit of work to produce today -- gotta stay faithful to those story points!Somehow, a magic team of spherical devops in a vacuum created an environment where things are just green, predictable, and are never broken.Another theoretical team of angels from a parallel universe has materialized into this one, updated all the docs, and beamed back into their universe of productivity and effectiveness.Unit of work defined, I then proceed to produce it for a few hours completely uninterrupted, since if another human being were to make contact, I&#39;d simply explode and format my hard drive, losing all my productivity.It&#39;s break time -- I ingest 2 story points of coffee and join a game of table tennis. The ball bounces back and forth without ever touching the ground. My movements are productive, and value-adding, just like my partner&#39;s.Back to producing units of work, only half a story point left (sike! no such thing as half a story point, and no such thing as &#34;left&#34;, as it&#39;s a measure of effort, not time. Almost got you there!).Git push! Automatic CI gains consciousness and validates that my work unit has no chance of causing a user to break our software. It gives me a thumbs up and discards its human shell to fade back into the ones and zeros. A QA engineer cries out in the distance.A metric of my productivity is logged to the OKR database.Nothing breaks, and nothing unexpected happens, as the universe is completely predictable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Patterns on the most effective teams I’ve worked on:- high degree of trust and emotional safety between team members. The team can safely share feedback and risk sharing our crazy ideas- high degree of care for the craft. We hold each other accountable to quality- ships, regularly, to real customers- little status seeking - goes with emotional safety - few individuals on the team need to be “in charge” or hold arbitrary titles.- the individuals are more than fairly compensated and the company shows their love for the team in big and small ways- the team talks to their customer and has a lot of empathy for their problems. They want to be accountable to them- the team has a lot of empathy for new team members and works hard to make on boarding easier- some willingness to “get in trouble” with the broader org because you know what you’re doing is right ultimately for the customer- high self starters: instead of complaining, people feel empowered to solve problems or prototype ideas without a permission structure- not too much catering to “super stars”. 1-2 heros does not a team make, the senior people make it their job to lift everyone up. The team doesn’t obsess over their high performers.There’s a lot more emphasis on emotional intelligence and  empathy in an effective team than on any specific process."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; There is an overwhelming amount of good advice, practices, tools, and processes that you should use to improve.I disagree. Advice is contradictory, practices and processes are often orthogonal, and tools quite literally don&#39;t exist. I say this as someone that&#39;s worked in large companies and saw how lengthy not only process feedback loops were (especially developer ↔ product team), but also engineering feedback loops (testing, deployment, dev environment setup, etc.)And I also say this as someone that works on side-projects by myself. The tooling simply isn&#39;t there. Setting up fast engineering feedback loops (multi-tiered deployment, test, dev, local, prod, etc. environments, heck even hot reloading or debugging) is needlessly difficult, or janky, or simply impossible. This goes for just about any language/framework out there: from Java, to Javascript, to Go.It&#39;s not surprising that FAANG often designs their own internal systems that handle this sort of thing (from DevOps, to automated testing, to A/B testing, to deployment). I&#39;m a believer that this is also a space that&#39;s ripe for disruption. I want environments to just work. I want code to just compile. I want containers to just run. Without me having to start digging through documentation, looking at thirteen Stack Overflow threads, and cobbling a solution that will inevitably break 3 months from now."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I run a honeypot software company, with our customers being mid-large enterprises. While the case presented here is certainly interesting, it&#39;s actually fairly uncommon for companies to run internet-facing honeypots, mostly due to it being a huge resource sink, and it&#39;s fairly difficult to learn anything truely useful from observing attacks coming from (mostly) bots.The more interesting use case for most is planting these in your network internals, which gives an added benefit of early, high-fidelity threat detection in addition to the &#34;threat intelligence&#34; bonuses. It&#39;s not completely trivial to set up, but can be a reasonably quick way to build good detection capability into even very disparate environments.A vast majority of organizations still lack good situational awareness of their infrastructures and this is one way of improving on that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is interesting, but like most honeypot discussion kinda melodramatic.  They got scanned by a bunch of known internet scanners, and a few mysteries including a &#34;store that sells weaponry&#34; (which turns out to just be scopes and red dots -_-).  It&#39;s always good to people reporting that they discovered nothing, but it is a bit boring."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I believe the first attempts at doing something like this were back in July of 2020. https://github.com/below/HelloSilicon : Someone with an early Developer Transition Kit (pre-M1 release) worked to convert the code from &#34;Programming with 64-Bit ARM Assembly Language&#34; to the M1&#39;s syntax.Porting additional  textbooks to M1&#39;s (ARMv8) syntax could help a lot in terms of making assembly accessible to more people. I believe there&#39;s a lot of value in learning it on a particularly popular real-world platform like x86 or M1 - where it may directly translate to reverse engineering userspace applications without having to then learn another assembler language as you might if you started with, say, RISC-V.Truthfully I think someone should really add the M1 syntax to the new version of VisUAL: https://github.com/scc416/Visual2 . I&#39;ve been intending to work on that to go along with porting Bob Plantz&#39; &#34;Introduction to Computer Organization: ARM Assembly Language Using the Raspberry Pi&#34; to ARMv8 for the same educational purpose but haven&#39;t quite found the time to really dive in. A tool like VisUAL2 could help a lot of people learn this even if they don&#39;t own an M1 themselves.Very tangentially to all of this, I&#39;d like to showcase https://github.com/cornell-brg/pydgin , which is a flexible toolkit for simulating ISA&#39;s in Python, and was used to help validate the first version of VisUAL during its own development."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting choice of technology, but you didn&#39;t completely convince me to why this is better than just using SQLite or PostgreSQL with a lagging replica. (You could probably start with either one and easily migrate to the other one if needed.)In particular you&#39;ve designed a very complicated system: Operationally you need an etcd cluster and a tailetc cluster. Code-wise you now have to maintain your own transaction-aware caching layer on top of etcd (https://github.com/tailscale/tailetc/blob/main/tailetc.go). That&#39;s quite a brave task considering how many databases fail at Jepsen. Have you tried running Jepsen tests on tailetc yourself? You also mentioned a secondary index system which I assume is built on top of tailetc again? How does that interact with tailetc?Considering that high-availability was not a requirement and that the main problem with the previous solution was performance (&#34;writes went from nearly a second (sometimes worse!) to milliseconds&#34;) it looks like a simple server with SQLite + some indexes could have gotten you quite far.We don&#39;t really get the full overview from a short blog post like this though so maybe it turns out to be a great solution for you. The code quality itself looks great and it seems that you have thought about all of the hard problems."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This post illustrates the difference between persistence and a database.If you are expecting to simply persist one instance of one application&#39;s state across different runs and failures, a database can be frustrating.But if you want to manage your data across different versions of an app, different apps accessing the same data, or concurrent access, then a database will save you a lot of headaches.The trick is knowing which one you want. Persistence is tempting, so a lot of people fool themselves into going that direction, and it can be pretty painful.I like to say that rollback is the killer feature of SQL. A single request fails (e.g. unique violation), and the overall app keeps going, handling other requests. You application code can be pretty bad, and you can still have a good service. That&#39;s why PHP was awesome despite being bad -- SQL made it good (except for all the security pitfalls of PHP, which the DB couldn&#39;t help with)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you are the kind of person that want to read an article titled &#34;explained as easily as possible&#34;, I think you should just avoid saying the phrase &#34;big oh&#34; but instead talk about algorithm runtime more informally, like &#34;quicksort has a worst case quadratic but average case n log n runtime&#34;.The risk is otherwise you will shoot yourself in the foot, maybe during an interview or other situation, as Big O is just one out of many members in a family of notations that has a very specific mathematical definition, other common ones being small-o and big-theta.Analysis of algorithms is more difficult than it appears. If you implement an algorithm in a high level language like Python you may get much worse runtime than you thought because some inner loop does arithmetic with bignum-style performance instead of hardware integer performance, for example. In such case you could talk of big-omega (your analysis is bounded-below instead of bounded-above, asymptotically)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A bad programmer solves their problems inefficiently and a really bad programmer doesn&#39;t even know why their solution is inefficientTo any beginners reading this: Solving problems inefficiently does not make you a bad programmer. Most of the time, an &#34;inefficient&#34; solution will be good enough, and optimising for performance comes at a cost.So sit back, relax, and enjoy the journey."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Every one of these &#34;Big-O explainers&#34; says pretty much the same thing: count (or bound) the number of steps, then take the most significant term, and drop the constant associated with it.  None of them explain why you take the most significant term or drop constant factors.I get why that is.  You need the mathematical definition to demonstrate why that is, and most &#34;Big-O explainers&#34; don&#39;t want to assume any significant amount of mathematical background.  But, that definition isn&#39;t that hard.  It&#39;s simply:f(x) is O(g(x)) iff there exists a positive number M and an x_0 such that for all x &gt; x_0, |f(x)| &lt;= Mg(x).And, if you&#39;re in an analysis of algorithms context, it&#39;s even easier, because you typically don&#39;t have to worry about this absolute value business.Well, that M is essentially the reason you get to drop constant multiples of f(x).  And, you drop the least significant terms of f(x) because g(x) dominates them, i.e. lim_{x -&gt; \infty} g(x)/f(x) = 0.  (No need to prove this, because this is what makes the &#34;less significant&#34; terms less significant.)I would also like to add that the equals sign in f(x) = O(g(x)) is one of the most useful abuses of notation that I know of, but it can be misleading.  It doesn&#39;t behave at all like a real equality because it&#39;s not symmetric, but it is transitive and reflexive.  It actually acts more like set membership than equality."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Along with the unionization at Google, I think it&#39;s a good trend to see them happening at big tech companies. As it says in the article: &#34;Unions are a prominent presence at Amazon in Europe, but the company for years successfully fought off labor organizing efforts in the U.S.&#34;It&#39;s sad that Amazon, along with FB and Google, etc. have managed to squash unions so completely here in the US. There&#39;s a lot of propaganda around unions that helps prevent them from every gaining much power. Obviously Amazon warehouse employees desperately need unionization much more than software devs, but I think both are needed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unions were proponents for worker safety, fair wages, anti-discrimination. They are the reason why such thing as OSHA exists today. They are the reason some laws were passed to protect workers in the US.But once these mandates became law, corporations used the arguments of &#34;why do we need unions if the law already protects workers?&#34; This and following Reagan&#39;s firing of the air traffic controllers changed the image of unions. They were now corrupt middlemen that charged you a fee to be part of the club.And it worked. Trying to form a union is now news instead of being the natural course of things. I wager that most people in the tech side of Amazon have a hard time grasping why their coworkers are trying to unionize. (we get paid well, what&#39;s the fuss all about?)I hope they vote in their interest, but I&#39;m doubtful it will pass (I hope I&#39;m wrong). These laws that are supposed to protect workers are enforced by the company&#39;s HR department[1]. The problem is that HR will side with the company before siding with any employee.I think we need to start looking into reforming HR and making it a public service.[1]: https://idiallo.com/blog/unions-are-not-coming-back"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wonder what percentage of otherwise very liberal Amazon devs read sentences like &#34;The company for years successfully fought off labor organizing efforts in the U.S.&#34; and come away thinking &#34;we&#39;re definitely the good guys.&#34;"</p>

The first time I ran into a technical issue I almost considered just cancelling my account and moving elsewhere because I couldn&#39;t figure out how to speak/chat with a human. There are many services I spend less money on monthly that have infinitely better customer service. Ultimately a friend provided me with your support email and I got a response there, but was shocked that wasn&#39;t listed anywhere on your website that I could easily find.."</p>

It seems you&#39;ve actually delivered on the vision that dreamweaver was originally trying to create all those years ago.I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if one day Webflow&#39;s market share on the Web gets to be Wordpress-sized.With the recent funding raised, I&#39;d love to hear what your vision is for the next 5 years of Webflow as a product?"</p>

They simply refused to admit that an upsell was a advertisement and that disrupting my workflow on my paid, professional account for an ad was wrong.The other interesting thing about that conversation, they could not understand how a sole proprietor would see no benefit from collaboration tools and kept making up bizarre scenarios where I could use them.I actually asked them if they were a product manager or a salesperson at one point.To Dropbox&#39;s credit,  that product manager didn&#39;t try to retain me,  they were genuinely trying to figure out why I had quit; they just couldn&#39;t grok the reason."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was told a story about the Dropbox sales team a while back that swore me off using them. They contacted the company I worked at, that didn&#39;t have a business contract with Dropbox, offering a great deal and a meeting was quickly arranged. The meeting (which I only heard about secondhand from a good friend) quickly turned into a strong-arm operation.Dropbox had &#39;detected&#39; that employees at our company were using Dropbox and it would be unfortunate if their stored files were no longer available and it would be in our best interest to sign up for a business account or we might legally be in breach of some terms of service. Some detective work later it was determined that people had been signed in to Dropbox from company machines, but there were no accounts opened with a company email and nothing business related was being synced. All Dropbox binaries and network connections have been blocked since."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really wish mobile OSes would allow you to grant apps permissions but serve fake data, (that&#39;s important!) without giving the app the ability to tell the difference. Just so it appears to the app that you&#39;ve given the permission, when you in fact have not. This would solve this entire class of problems and then some. So, for example:- App &#34;has&#34; access to contacts, but the system returns that you have none.- App &#34;has&#34; access to location, but the search for GPS satellites never completes.- App &#34;has&#34; access to storage, but it&#39;s actually /dev/null."</p>

I am 42. When I was younger, in the late 90s, getting into physical fight was much more common than today. These days even drunk young guys seem to be content with hurling a few insults. (For record, I am a peaceful person and the possibility of getting beaten up for no good reason was something I definitely did not look forward to during my old pub crawls.)I wonder if this is actually a manifestation of population-wide testosterone drop."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The study states the majority of the effect is for fairly predictable causes like age and obesity, but I found this interesting:&gt; After controlling for confounders—including year of study, age, race, BMI, comorbidity status, alcohol and smoking use, and level of physical activity—total testosterone was lower among men in the later (2011-2016) versus earlier (1999-2000) cycles (P &lt; 0.001)Excluding all those confounders, there&#39;s not much we&#39;re left with. Environmental toxins?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If due to environmental toxins (say, hormonally active “forever chemicals,” plastics, etc), my guess is you’d see the deleterious effects first in women. Women also make (and need) testosterone, just at much lower levels than men, so they have much less to lose. There’s research going back 30 years on the efficacy of low dose TRT in women to treat all kinds of things that tend to hit women in their late thirties on (when natural testosterone has been declining for 15-20 years); I’m on mobile now, but what I recall most from a review paper was the efficacy in treating fibromyalgia pain. The lack of continued research on this seems to be almost entirely due to social pressure. (People lose their minds when you talk about women and testosterone, or men and estrogen.)It’s hard not to wonder if environmental toxins affecting the testosterone levels of men are also contributing to the rise of health issues in women, especially autoimmune conditions, fibromyalgia/CFS, obesity, depression, etc.In other words, women might be the canaries in the coal mine for systemic problems arising from environmental endocrine disruptors."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"An aggregator ala reddit/hackernews/twitter that uses a market mechanism to better incentivise content discovery.One of the biggest issues with existing aggregators is that:- how well content performs is dependant on the attention it gets immediately after posting.- However, readers aren’t incentivised to sift carefully through new content, which is generally of lower quality than &#34;frontpage&#34; content- This means that how content performs is a lottery. Great content is often missed just by chance- This in turn means that there’s no platform that encourages unknown authors to create high-effort, thoughtful pieces. Instead it’s far more effective to blogspam.I&#39;m working on a platform that uses something similar to a prediction/stock market to incentivise people to search for high-quality content. Instead of upvoting, you effectively buy shares in new content, which you can then sell at a later point for a profit if the content proves popular. Equally you can buy &#34;downvote shares&#34;, which act like a short and help dampen rampant speculation.It’s early days still, but I’m hoping this could be a great way to encourage higher quality content creation.Draft paper here:

Essentially you&#39;re an AI who&#39;s mission is to mine every resource from a planet. To keep things efficient you start out small and have limited processing power. You&#39;re only able to run an assembly like language that we&#39;ve developed. As you get more resources you can research new things like functions, variables, type arguments, whatever. We plan for there to be a tech tree so you can choose to build out a language that&#39;s not strict similar to JS or you can go the try hard route and build something like Haskell. You build bots that mine, explore, hunt, etc and each bot is a computer running their own script. We plan on there being battles you have to script around and even things like setting up your own network so you can have robots call home when they&#39;re out in the field.I still need to think of a good name for it though."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ll believe it when I see it.  I could believe them getting rid of the touchbar, but bringing back magsafe?  I&#39;m sticking with my 2015 MacBook until it&#39;s irreparable, and I do like the magsafe port, but is there really any point in going back after moving to USB-C?  I think I just like magsafe because it&#39;s cool more than that it actually has some sort of superiority over USB-C.  I&#39;ve tripped over the USB-C cable to my work laptop(2018 model) a handful of times and somehow the cable always manages to unplug without flinging the laptop across the room or damaging the USB components themselves.  It doesn&#39;t seem like going back to magsafe would achieve anything."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know it&#39;s from Kuo, but these leaks don&#39;t pass the smell test for me. It makes no sense for them to add the touchbar to the base model 13&#34; MBPs only to remove them from the higher end versions. It makes even less sense to add more ports which aren&#39;t USB-C, as the bits about MagSafe and no dongles imply. Further, I don&#39;t understand what is meant by &#34;iPhone 12 like&#34; non-curvy design - I have a 2018 MBP 15&#34;, and the sides of this thing are pretty flat and not curved.I mean, these features sound like a dream come true, but I&#39;m having a hard time believing them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If anyone from Apple is reading, let me just say – this is exactly what I want. Magsafe charging. Function keys instead of the touchbar. 15-16&#34; screen. M1 CPU. 32GB Memory.I also prefer the 2015 keyboard, but it&#39;s not a dealbreaker.I&#39;ll pay for the kickstarter now if it means it&#39;ll come out in the next 18 months.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been switched to DDG for about 4 months now. I am loving the Ads I get in youtube now that google doesn&#39;t know what I am interested in they have noting to do with anything I care about. It&#39;s wonderful. DDG still has a way to go for really technical queries. I just can&#39;t get the same results about this error or that in Java. Until then I&#39;m 100% DDG for personal and 100% google for work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve used DDG full-time for over two years now. I honestly don&#39;t miss Google.Every time I use !g I&#39;m reminded just how bad it&#39;s gotten. Between the SEO spam and ads I find myself scrolling at least halfway down the page to find anything even remotely relevant. I can&#39;t say that DDG always has the &#39;best&#39; results, but at least they seem appropriate to what I&#39;m searching for.One thing I do wish DDG has is webmaster tools. I know they don&#39;t do their own indexing, but it would be nice to have a way to get performance &amp; keyword data the way Google/Bing/Yandex etc present it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"After a few failed attempts to migrate from Google as my default search engine due to poor results, a couple of months ago, I decided to give DDG another try. Been using daily since, I don&#39;t even remember what Google is. Not sure if the service did improve that much or what, but I&#39;m glad I could move on. Youtube, you are next."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Fantastic work by the Wine team! Congrats on the release.Still very disappointed that macOS has not been supported since Catalina (10.15) dropped 32-bit support - from my understanding, the 32-bit architecture is deeply integrated into Wine and removing it would be a significant effort. Understandably the focus has always been on Linux, but I would still appreciate at least an update from the team on potential macOS support in the future."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The otherday I was setting up Wine on Debian to play Diablo2, it was really painful to get all the 32bits i386 version for each wine dependencies ... Once Wine was installed it worked almost flawlessly, but those i386 libs ...Is there a way to get Wine as a single binary / docker or something that is easy to install?Edit: As for why it was really difficult is because of that: https://wiki.winehq.org/Debian ( The WineHQ packages for Debian 10 and later require libfaudio0 as a dependency. Since the distro does not provide it for Debian 10, users of that version can download libfaudio0 packages from the OBS. See https://forum.winehq.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=32192 for details. ) That bloody libfaudio0."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Besides the 3D graphics improvements, USB device support is a monumental change. I keep a Windows VM just to update the firmware on devices I own that will never be supported by fwupd. I suspect this is one of the many hidden requirements keeping businesses on old versions of Windows."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s also important to realize that the backup includes your encrypted iMessage messages, and the key required to decrypt them. Meaning that if you have backups enabled, all the &#34;end-to-end&#34; encryption in iMessage is defeated. Apple and by extension the FBI can read your messages. This is documented by Apple here: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202303Even if you disable backups, whenever you correspond with someone that has backups enabled those messages are still accessible to Apple."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Since user encrypted iCloud backups would prevent password recovery to access your data I&#39;m more inclined to believe the decision was made out of convenience for the end user.General public would hate it when the support won&#39;t help them recover family photos which are still stored in the cloud. Full encryption is nice to have, but overwhelming majority of users won&#39;t get any tangible benefits from that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It looks like the main &#34;about backups&#34; page [1] on Apple Support misleads about this issue:&gt; iCloud backups include nearly all data and settings stored on your device. iCloud backups don&#39;t include:&gt; Data that&#39;s already stored in iCloud... iMessages... Health dataOnly the more technical &#34;about encryption&#34; page [2] that most users wouldn&#39;t seek out contains the full story, providing a list of regular encryption vs. E2EE services and admitting the key issue:&gt; Messages in iCloud also uses end-to-end encryption. If you have iCloud Backup turned on, your backup includes a copy of the key protecting your Messages. This ensures you can recover your Messages if you lose access to iCloud Keychain and your trusted devices. When you turn off iCloud Backup, a new key is generated on your device to protect future messages and isn&#39;t stored by Apple.The problem is that the first page makes it sound like no iMessage related data is backed up, when the truth is that the messages themselves aren&#39;t but a backdoor copy of the encryption key is, and lists it along with other E2EE services like Health data that do not have a key backed up and remain E2EE protected with iCloud backup. A user would have no reason to even seek out the second article to learn that it&#39;s not the same.Concerningly, iCloud Photos are not E2EE at all. It&#39;s no more secure/private than Google Photos or any other app.[1] https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204136

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Author here!The article was published earlier this week and I have a quick addendum: regarding Erlang/Elixir, my goal has always been to bring new developers to the platform. After all, Erlang developers already have the most important part of Elixir, which is the Erlang runtime!There are also key people in both communities working hard to make sure the tooling is consistent across all languages. A lot of this effort happens under the Erlang Ecosystem Foundation (https://erlef.org/) too.All to say, regardless if you pick Erlang or Elixir (or Gleam, LFE, etc.), I hope you will fall in love with the platform as much as I did 10 years ago!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Happy Elixir user here. At work we have a use case that isn&#39;t covered by José&#39;s high-level overview of the domains Elixir&#39;s used in: we run a massive multiplayer game server on it.This is actually a really good fit. (It kind of rhymes with the original use of Erlang, being telecoms infrastructure.) We get outstanding concurrency support, high reliability, and really efficient development times. I can&#39;t imagine shipping this feature with a server written in C++ (the language I&#39;m most comfortable in), and I can&#39;t imagine scaling it the way we need to if we&#39;d gone for a traditional web language like Node, PHP, etc.If you&#39;re interested, you can see the RakNet (game networking protocol) implementation we use on the server here:https://github.com/X-Plane/elixir-raknetThe README gives a good overview of the full MMO server&#39;s architecture, too: each client connection is a stateful Elixir process (not to be confused with a heavy-weight OS process!), acting asynchronously on a client state struct; clients then asynchronously schedule themselves to send updates back to the user."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Meanwhile te company I work for is moving away from it. We cannot find enough people with enough knowledge to be already productive in it. Not many want to learn it because it is considered pretty niche, and the ones willing to learn will need many months or years to be productive and build with some level of quality, and once they learn they move away to bigger companies which pay more. We end up paying to people to learn to then &#34;graduate&#34; and we end up with a platform built by people that were learning.Some people here say the tooling is great. Compared to what? The editor plugins are terrible, slow, and blow away your CPU doing god knows what kind of indexing. Compilation is slow and takes a lot of time (in CI for example). Libraries for things you give for granted in other platforms (java, javascript, python, ruby) are non existent, implemented in erlang, unmantained, poorly documented, not popular enough, or a combination of these.People are using it for creating traditional CRUD apps, and it is totally overkill. Something you would do in a day with django or ruby on rails takes a lot of time. Ok, you have tons of concurrency and scaling and.....but... unless you are facebook or google or amazon you won&#39;t need this anyway.Probably all of these things will be solved in the future, but at this moment, using Elixir for real production code in product focused companies is just a terrible mistake in my opinion. Certainly the ideas, the technology, and the BEAM are awesome...and it is technically superior to everything I&#39;ve seen out there. But from a business perspective, it makes no sense to use it unless you&#39;re building the next whatsapp or similar."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In Case You Didn&#39;t Know:Big Sur on M1 (and possibly on Intel) maintains a persistent, hardware-serial-number linked TLS connection to Apple (for APNS, just like on iOS) at all times when you are logged in, even if you don&#39;t use iCloud, App Store, iMessage, or FaceTime, and have all analytics turned off.There&#39;s no UI to disable this.This means that Apple has the coarse location track log (due to GeoIP of the client IP) for every M1 serial number. When you open the App Store app, that serial number is also sent, and associated with your Apple ID (email/phone) if you log in.Apple knows when you leave home, or arrive at the office, or travel to a different city, all with no Apple ID, no iCloud, and no location services.This has always been the case on all devices using iOS, too.This change is essential for blocking such traffic, and I&#39;m glad for it, but there is a long way to go when it comes to pressuring the pro-privacy forces inside of Apple to do more."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While I&#39;m glad they fixed it (upgrading past Catalina was not going to happen), It&#39;s going to take me a LONG time to trust them again.The fact that they could rationalize their own thought process to think this was a good idea or even anywhere close to acceptable, at best leads me to doubt their judgement. At worst, well it&#39;s best to assume incompetence over malice but you can see what doors this would open in the future.
Now we know they CAN do this without it being obvious to most users, which is a new dimension of risk regardless of intent."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This firewall issue isn&#39;t the only privacy feature strip from Big Sur release. Unfortunately no big media care about other huge problem Apple introduced.My only hope they will also fix full disk encryption in this update. Since Big Sur broken installation of macOS on passphrase-encrypted disk partitions.I bought into M1 hype and now it&#39;s end up that you no longer able to have separate password for the disk encryption."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; I went through a phase a while back of holding down keys to see what they did.Back when I was a gamedev at EA, one of the things QA would do is button-mash test the games. Just smash as many buttons as they could at the same time at all sorts of random points in the game. This was a constant source of bugs. It was surprisingly easy to get the game into a state where it was totally hung because of this.One of the main culprits was transitions between screens in the UI. So much of the UI code assumed that the initial state of a screen is that no buttons are currently pressed. But if you mash a bunch down in the middle of a transition, the screen can end up receiving a button up event that did not precede any button down event. If the screen&#39;s code assumed every up has a preceding down, it could get into a broken state.I never did see any clean systematic solution to this problem. I still think about it a lot when I do UI programming. In the back of my head, I&#39;m always wondering, &#34;what will happen if the user presses X in the middle of this animation?&#34;Programmers are particularly prone to these bugs because we have unconsciously trained ourselves to baby our own software. We&#39;re careful to wait for transitions to complete and only send input when the app is in a known state."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;While I’m not a QA or security professional, I have developed a knack for doing “stupid” things with software which causes it to malfunction.A person after my own heart.I&#39;ve had many a dev go &#34;why would you do that&#34;In which I answer &#34;it doesn&#39;t matter, but if you accept my input it&#39;s your job to ensure the app doesn&#39;t crash&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There was and still is a website called The Daily WTF about discussing especially funny bugs and programmer&#39;s mistakes. In 2012 I registered on it as a user &#34;undefined&#34; to make a comment about JavaScript oddities under one of their articles and almost forgot about its existence, then they migrated their comments and forums to Discourse and in 2015 I got a bunch of email notifications about people mentioning me as suddenly all &#34;likes&#34; in the forum were linked to my profile:https://what.thedailywtf.com/topic/17637/undefined-liked-thi..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My experience is in quant hedge funds, where sometimes you get some guys who develop the strategy and some guys who put it into production.Yes, I do admit there can be some specialization in terms of time spent on science vs engineering.But you really need people who understand both. Particularly if you have a strategist who thinks his job is just to dream up profitable models, he ends up carving that role out in a way that&#39;s detrimental to the rest of the team. You get people who just don&#39;t appreciate that there&#39;s other work to do than finding models, and that models depend on that other work to function.You also get a huge prestige gap, because inevitably management will think that there&#39;s a magician and a blacksmith. One guy needs to be paid a lot, and the other guy needs to be paid enough.These effects feed each other. Magician will say &#34;where&#39;s my data&#34; and expect blacksmith to make it, promptly. He won&#39;t do it himself, because spending time on mundane stuff makes the magic disappear. And not doing it yourself, or taking the time to understand it, will eventually lead to problems with the magic."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Preach!The data lifecycle is waaay overpopulated with Data Scientists who are not empowered or knowledgeable enough to work with product designers and engineers to do everything that empowers Data Science and ML.We need more Data Engineers involved at time zero in projects to help:1. Plan out what data should be produced/captured by the product2. Instrument systems to actually generate data consistently and effectively3. Build ETL pipelines and data management systems4. Manage enterprise data sharing and resiliencyetc...What ends up happening is you have a bunch of Data Scientists just handed a pg_dump or flat file from some ops team. That is typically missing data or poorly formatted and they spend 90% of their time cleaning it up then running some basic regression with numpy or whatever.Need better understanding of the data lifecycle by organizations and investment in instrumentation and data management."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can&#39;t recommend the Data Engineer career enough for junior developers. It&#39;s how I started and what I pursued for 6 years (and I would love doing it again), and I feel like it gave me such an incredible foundation for future roles :- Actually big data (so, not something you could grep...) will trigger your code in every possible way. You quickly learn that with trillions of input, the probabily to reach a bug is either 0% or 100%. In turn, you quickly learn to write good tests.- You will learn distributed processing at a macro level, which in turn enlighten your thinking at a micro level. For example, even though the order of magnitudes are different, hitting data over network versus on disk is very much like hitting data on disk versus in cache. Except that when the difference ends up being in hours or days, you become much more sensible to that, so it&#39;s good training for your thoughts.- Data engineering is full of product decisions. What&#39;s often called data &#34;cleaning&#34; is in fact one of the import product decisions made in a company, and a data engineer will be consistently exposed to his company product, which I think makes for great personal development- Data engineering is fascinating. In adtech for example, logs of where ads are displayed are an unfiltered window on the rest of humanity, for the better or the worse. But it definitely expands your views on what the &#34;average&#34; person actually does on its computer (spoiler : it&#39;s mainly watching porn...), and challenges quite a bit what you might think is &#34;normal&#34;- You&#39;ll be plumbing technologies from all over the web, which might or might not be good news for you.So yeah, data engineering is great ! It&#39;s not harder than other specialties for developers, but imo, it&#39;s one of the fun ones !"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Also embarrassing:https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7vqew/the-hacker-who-archiv...&gt; donk_enby had originally intended to grab data only from the day of the Capitol takeover, but found that the poor construction and security of Parler allowed her to capture, essentially, the entire website. That ended up being 56.7 terabytes of data, which included every public post on Parler, 412 million files in all—including 150 million photos and more than 1 million videos. Each of these had embedded metadata like date, time and GPS coordinates—unlike most social media sites, Parler does not strip metadata from media its users upload, which, crucially, could be useful for law enforcement and open source investigators."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I personally don&#39;t find their ability to remain online that surprising.The Pirate Bay and other torrent networks were built by people with a passion for building, maintaining and hacking things. People who, even without a solid CS background, would spend hours a day learning new things, developing distributed protocols, evading DNS blocks and hosting their content wherever they could to make it accessible - included the small server in their own garage if needed. And they are used by people who don&#39;t mind learning a new protocol or how to use a new client to get the content they want.I don&#39;t see the same amount of passion for technology and hacking among the Parler users, nor its maintainers. Those who believe in conspiracy content are people characterized by a psychological tendency to take shortcuts whenever they can in order to minimize their efforts in learning and understanding new things. So when the first blocker hits they usually can&#39;t see alternative solutions, because it&#39;s not the way their brains are wired. They always expect somebody else to come up with solutions for them, and they always blame somebody else when the solution won&#39;t come. And even if they decided to migrate their content to the dark web or on a Tor network, not many people will follow them - both because they don&#39;t have the skills, and because they don&#39;t want to acquire those skills. Plus, they&#39;d lose the &#34;viral network effect&#34; that they get when posting click-bait content on public networks, the new censorship-proof network will only attract a small bunch of already radicalized people.And even if they wanted to hire some smart engineers to do the job for them, we all know that engineers tend to swing on the other opposite of the ideological spectrum. Those who have built systems for escaping REAL authoritarian censorship would rightfully feel disgusted if asked to apply their knowledge to provide a safe harbour for rednecks to vomit their conspiracy-theories-fueled hate."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I got the sense while crawling data from their API that the engineering quality is poor at Parler. Dates were represented as strings in &#34;YYYYMMDD&#34; format (so today would be &#34;20210113053923&#34;) instead of UNIX timestamps, certain fields were duplicated for no reason (e.g. every object would have an identical &#34;id&#34; and &#34;_id&#34; key), counts of impressions/comments/etc would be the display strings rather than raw numbers (so &#34;2k&#34; or &#34;5m&#34;), and various moderation flags were in place like a boolean &#34;sensitive&#34; which was always false, even for posts that had been downvoted significantly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I did some quick math, and the 240k acres it says they own comes out to about 378 square miles, which if condensed down to a square would be 20 miles by 20 miles.On the one hand, that&#39;s a lot of land. On the other, it&#39;s not really anything."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Bill Gates is the wealthiest person in the world (or arguably Arnault).You might say, no, Musk and Bezos are worth 50% (or ~60 billion) more. On paper yes, but that&#39;s not a great metric. When I think of wealth, I think of what you can reasonably acquire.If you multiply Musk&#39;s shares in Tesla times the current share price, sure you get 180 billion. But if he tried to sell a large number those shares, they&#39;d plummet in value as he was selling them. Without Musk, I&#39;d be surprised if Tesla is worth 20% of its current valuation. To a lesser extent, this is true of Bezos too, although Amazon without him is still a very valuable company.On the other hand, Bill Gates owns 1.6% of Microsoft, which I believe is his biggest holding, followed by Berkshire Hathaway stock. I&#39;d bet he can sell both of those holdings completely without a huge hit to either stock price (but definitely some hit). Same with his farmland and other alternative assets. On top of that, having already sold his Microsoft shares, he&#39;s not subject to as much capital gains tax as Bezos or Musk, each of whom pretty much owe 20% of their total net worth the second they want to sell.So on paper, Musk and Bezos are wealthier, but if all of them decided to Scrooge McDuck it and put all their money into a gold filled vault tomorrow, Bill Gates&#39; vault would be the fullest.EDIT: typo above... Originally said that Musk owns 180 bn in Amazon stock :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here is another article that isn&#39;t just about farmland, but about land ownership in general: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/11/25/these-people...Of note, the Gates don&#39;t even appear on this list. At first I thought it&#39;s because OP is only talking about farmland, but in the USA Today article the Simplot family apparently owns more than 400k acres for potato farming in Idaho, but doesn&#39;t even appear in the OP. I&#39;m not sure what to make of the discrepancy.Also for the sake of comparison, 240k acres is a good amount, but (as another commenter mentioned), it&#39;s also not. There are some cattle ranches larger than that. And for an example of non farm/ranch use, Bezos apparently owns over 400,000 acres in West Texas to be used for the Blue Origin launch facilities."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some good points in the article, but I disagree with the tone and the conclusion.&gt; we’ve rewarded and lauded incremental researchers as innovators, increased their budgets so they can do even more incremental researchThere isn&#39;t a scientific field where every single paper is groundbreaking. It&#39;s a Brownian motion of small incremental innovations, until eventually we stumble upon something big (like deep learning). In no way is machine learning unique in this. Sounds like the author is simply disappointed that, like in any other profession, day-to-day of a researcher is a slog and not a perennial intellectual festival. We&#39;ve been in an exciting deep learning craze for a while, but it&#39;s silly to expect it to last forever. Back to the grind now.&gt; Machine Learning Researchers can now engage in risk-free, high-income, high-prestige workNot sure what author means by &#34;risk-free&#34;. Yes, if you&#39;re not publishing enough you&#39;re most likely not going to starve. Is that a bad thing? Is the survival instinct the only good motivator for doing good research?I would argue that there&#39;s plenty of risk, in that people who don&#39;t publish good research don&#39;t get very far in their academic careers, which in my view is good enough motivation. &#34;They must do good research or starve&#34; is a rather cynical take, especially from someone who seems to not be doing too badly for themselves.I&#39;d rather more fields provided similar benefits. Maybe then going into science wouldn&#39;t be associated with so much sacrifice, so more smart people would choose science over investment banking or such, and we&#39;d make more scientific progress faster.&gt; CNNs use convolutions which are a generalization of matrix multiplication.A nitpick: CNNs are most definitely not a generalization of matrix multiplication. In fact, the opposite: you can view CNNs as a matrix multiplication with a particular matrix structure."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article is dead-on, but I think it is missing a fairly large segment of where ML is actually working well: anomaly detection and industrial defect detection.While I agree that everyone was shocked, myself included, when we saw how well SSD and YOLO worked, the last mile problem is stagnating. What I mean is: 7 years ago I wrote an image pipeline for a company using traditional AI methods. It was extremely challenging. When we saw SSDMobileNet do the same job 10x faster with a fraction of the code, our jaws dropped. Which is why the dev ship turned on a dime: there&#39;s something big in there.The industry is stagnated for exactly the reasons brought up: we don&#39;t know how to squeeze out the last mile problem because NNs are EFFING HARD and research is very math heavy: e.g., it cannot be hacked by a Zuck-type into a half-assed product overnight, it needs to be carefully researched for years. This makes programmers sad, because by nature we love to brute force trial-and error our code, and homey don&#39;t play that game with machine learning.However, places where it isn&#39;t stagnating are things like vibration and anomaly detection. This is a case where https://github.com/YumaKoizumi/ToyADMOS-dataset really shines because it adds something that didn&#39;t exist before, and it doesn&#39;t have to be 100% perfect: anything is better than nothing.At Embedded World last year I saw tons of FPGA solutions for rejecting parts on assembly lines. Since every object appears nearly in canonical form (good lighting, centered, homogeneous presentation), NN&#39;s are kicking ass bigtime in that space.It is important to remember Self-Driving Car Magic is just the consumer-facing hype machine. ML/NNs are working spectacularly well in some domains."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a nice talk by Yann LeCun where he goes on to explain really well why deep learning has such fast progress. [0]He goes on to explain how theory always comes later.I thought that information theory came before practice but turns out it also came after. (there was a bunch of heuristics for sending messages with teletypes)A nice example is Roman technological advances in architecture and materials that predate the use of geometry or mathematics completely. All advancements a result of tinkering and heuristics.[0]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG5NCkMerHU"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve used aquafaba in cooking a lot, mostly to avoid using so many eggs in baking. And while I&#39;ve had great results for a few specific recipes, I&#39;ve also found that it&#39;s not a universal egg replacement, and it&#39;s hard to tell which recipes it will and won&#39;t work in.I bake a lot of gluten-free and grain-free breads and biscuits, and aquafaba is a great egg replacement in these. Sometimes it even produces a better texture. But in other recipes, like cookies, it doesn&#39;t work at all; the dough loses its shape completely and deflates into a puddle.I&#39;ve also read about using aquafaba to make meringue or mousse, but I haven&#39;t had good luck with that so far. The chickpea taste is strong, and does not go with sugar at all.I haven&#39;t tried using any beans other than chickpeas. Maybe it would work better with different beans."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Aquafaba is amazing. But since we&#39;re talking about egg replacers, here&#39;s one even more remarkable:Carbonated water.No joke. Carbonated water can seamlessly replace egg in almost all things where the egg provides some rising / fluffy texture (not so much binding, like aquafaba does). It won&#39;t be stepping in your quiche any time soon, but cookies, brownies, cupcakes, anything with a fluffy inside.1/4 cup of water equals one egg. Try it, you&#39;ll be amazed.https://iambaker.net/egg-substitutes/"</p>

Where do you draw the line that manages to keep Facebooks app available, while still being able to defend the removal of Parler.I know many will think I&#39;m defending Parler, I&#39;m not. I just don&#39;t see why Facebook is continuously given a free pass for all the horrible stuff on their platform. Is it just because Facebook has other uses, because they&#39;re bigger or because an app store that doesn&#39;t have a Facebook app will experience a huge backlash from consumers?"</p>

We run a major media site and if AWS decides to capitulate to the pressure from essentially people on social media or the wrath of the US Govt, what&#39;s stopping them from doing the exact same from Govts of other countries?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; We faced rejections in submitting the app, because they decided to change their policy on the app having a link in the &#34;About WireGuard&#34; tool window to www.wireguard.com/donations/ (which they previously had allowed explicitly; now they want 30% or something)Last year Google started to ban donation links in FOSS apps, WireGuard was one of the first victims [0], completely removed from the store. I didn&#39;t know that Apple also started doing the same and hit WireGuard again. Extending the definition of an &#34;in-app payment&#34; to a link to the project homepage in the &#34;About&#34; window that doesn&#39;t buy any good or service related to the app is an overzealous restriction. Especially so when that button is clicked by, perhaps, only 10% of the users.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"FOSS developers should simply stop developing good software for Apple devices.The absolute opacity of Apple&#39;s technical policies and their arrogant i-dont-care/its-your-problem approach against developers are quite renewed in the community. This ends up costing a lot of development time to developers who mostly work for free, who struggle to reverse engineer or debug what happens on MacOS/iOS, and (like Wireguard&#39;s case shows) it harms the reputation of their software because people tend to blame the application rather than the OS when things don&#39;t work as intended.If people want to use FOSS software, then they should be able to do so on systems that support the FOSS ecosystem, that provide developers with appropriate tools to debug what&#39;s going on (ON ANY PLATFORM) and sufficient documentation for them to understand how a certain component of the OS is supposed to behave.I know that in the past 15 years lots of tech-savvy people have opted for Apple products because &#34;they&#39;re still UNIX under the hood, and unlike Linux they just work out of the box&#34;. But being Unix-like DOES NOT mean to be developer-friendly! Apple is still an opaque developer-unfriendly company even if it provides you with a native bash!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The iOS and macOS apps have been the biggest point of stress and frustration when building EteSync[1]. The API is buggy as hell and very limited (if at all available) and the review process is arbitrary and can cause updates to be rejected. You can never know if your workarounds will be accepted or rejected. Sometimes they can even get rejected in future app updates.The EteSync experience is subpar on Apple devices, and there&#39;s almost nothing we can do about it. We already spent countless of hours trying to fix things, but Apple just make it impossible. We have more ideas on how to fix things, and we will keep on trying, but it&#39;s beyond me why would anyone willingly use an Apple product.Edit (adding one more point): that&#39;s one of the more annoying parts about Apple being the gatekeeper to 40% of the US population and in effect, to 100% of businesses (because one bad Apple in the org is enough to spoil the whole bunch). As a developer, you are just stuck with no way out.[1] https://www.etesync.com"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s one of the most successful routers ever sold and yet network equipment manufacturers are still fighting tooth and nail to keep their devices closed source. It just doesn&#39;t make sense to me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So, I worked for Broadcom for some years after this went down. This post is purely descriptive to give people some insight into the history from inside the company; I&#39;m not commenting on who should have done what (although I was not directly involved, so if someone who was comments, take their word over mine).Broadcom made an error of judgement here, but this incident fostered a deep distrust of open source, at senior levels, that persisted for more than a decade after; perhaps to this day.Firstly at this point Cisco was, at the time,  Broadcom&#39;s largest customer by a large margin. This caused huge tension in that relationship that was totally unforseen, and was very painful for a while.Secondly, a at a certain point it dawned on Cisco and Broadcom that the GPL lawsuit was not like a normal business dispute , because businessmen after a certain point will settle for money even if they didn&#39;t get everything they want. Sure a few people will keep going to the detriment of their own business, but most aim to make profit, not expound a principle. Many companies in the position of the FSF would have settled for a cut of the revenue. But the FSF wanted the source code released, and they were prepared to kill the business to get it. So Cisco and Broadcom had to concede. The source code was released, and OpenWRT was born.The fallout, though was that subsequently Broadcom router ICs were designed with hardware accelerators which were separate from the main CPU. They were driven by separate CPUs on the same SoC that did not run linux and whose drivers could not be demanded under the GPL. none of the open source firmwares  can run these devices efficiently unless someone spends weeks reverse engineering them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don’t know why WiFi AP manufacturers don’t just give up and just use stock open source firmware on their devices. They are not even trying to get the sw right. The first thing I do when buying one anymore is ditch the built in tinker-toy firmware and install an open source one. Lots of companies that make hardware treat software as just another line item on the BOM like a bolt or a screw, and source the cheapest shit they can find, rather than treating the software as an integral part of the product that needs the same polish as the external box and marketing materials."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Is there something inherently complicated in adding a SATA/M.2 port to board like this?The RaspberryPi is also &#34;disk-less&#34;, which to me is one of the major limitations.It&#39;s a super interesting little board, and I love that it&#39;s a RISC-V, that could really help getting the CPU in the hands of people. I just don&#39;t know enough about these things to understand why there are no storage connectors (other than an SD card slot)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been unable to use Beagle boards in the past as they ship with an old kernel and uboot without the sources to update or config them (this was specifically with the black variant). It probably had something to do with vendor NDAs with chipsets or something but it made them entirely unusable to me and more expensive than competitors by almost 2x to boot.I would love a RISC-V board to play with that is a bit more stable and about the size of a Raspberry Pi within a reasonable price range. The SiFive development boards are pretty pricey, definitely showcase hardware (look at all these peripherals or this is basically a desktop computer!).I&#39;m hoping with the explicit call out of open hardware and open software that this board won&#39;t have the same issues as the Beaglebone Black..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Here&#39;s a fun fact (and I suspect shows what a loser I am :-)) Pat Gelsinger and I were colleagues at Intel in the early 80&#39;s. We both worked in what was called &#34;MIPO&#34; (Microprocessor Operation) but I was in Systems Validation and he was on the customer facing side with field engineering. My career went off through a variety of engineering roles, his went into management and up. When he joined EMC, I told him I had always thought he would have been Intel&#39;s CEO. He told me, &#34;Hey, maybe I still will be :-)&#34; That was like 10 years ago, and here he is.There are a lot of things you can say about Silicon Valley, but one of the more interesting aspects of it for me has been how &#34;small&#34; it is in terms of people have an oversized impact. I have never been one of those people of course, just a part of the entourage. But it has been interesting to watch and learn from folks who are good (and bad) role models."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Notable absent from that list is he fired Pat Gelsinger.
Please just bring him back as CEO.&#34;  - [1] 2012 on HN, when Paul Otellini Retired.&#34;The only one who may have a slim chance to completely transform Intel is Pat Gelsinger, if Andy Grove saved Intel last time, it will be his apprentice to save Intel again. Unfortunately given what Intel has done to Pat during his last tenure, I am not sure if he is willing to pick up the job, especially the board&#39;s Chairman is Bryant, not sure how well they go together. But we know Pat still loves Intel, and I know a lot of us miss Pat.&#34; [2] - June, 2018&#34;This is the same as Intel pushing out Pat Gelsinger. The product people get pushed out by sales and marketing. Which are increasingly running the show at Apple.&#34; [3] 30 Days ago.And numerous other reference since 2009. Many more around various other forums and twitter. I am getting quite emotional right now. I cant believe this is really happening. ( I am wiring this with tears in my eyes! ) I guess Andy Bryant retired makes the decision a little easier. And Pat has always loved Intel. I guess he is pissed those muppets drove it to the ground.This is 12 years! 12 years to prove a point! Consider 4 - 5 years of work in lead-time since he left in 2009. That is 2014. Guess what happen after 2014?May be it is too little too late? Or May be this will be another Andy Grove &#34;Only the paranoid survive&#34; moment?The King is Back at Intel, despite being a fan of Dr Lisa Su, I am little worry about AMD.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4804875[2] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17391707[3] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25435150"</p>

Intel had previously done a significant reduction way back in 2006 of about 10%&gt;In an industry that runs on “tribal knowledge” and “copy exact” and experience of how to run a very, very complex multi billion dollar fab, much of the most experienced, best talent walked out the doors at Intel’s behest, with years of knowledge in their collective headsbottom line: Intel created the hole by itself and jump into that deep end."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Dropbox and Evernote, for me are two very similar companies. Startups that innovated on a great user experience and had a flawless execution in the beginning.  I was an early adopter of both of them, and they worked well. Dropbox sync between different machines worked like magic. I still remember some of the nightmares my coworkers had with OneDrive in meetings when the files for the presentations were missing because of the poor sync capabilities of OneDrive. 
Dropbox is no failure. Their projected revenue for 2020 is $1.8B. This is 3x more than Slack, but their market cap is 3x smaller. 
Both Slack and Evernote are facing the most powerful companies in the world offering their products for free or at really discounted rates. What makes their situation even worse is that they don&#39;t own the content (documents, pdfs, spreadsheets). The documents will be edited somewhere else and then shared in dropbox.  On top of that many other applications like chat offer file transfer and sharing.Bottom line: I don&#39;t want them to fail ( I don&#39;t want Evernote to fail too), because it points to a world where only 5 to 10 big tech companies can survive. We need smaller innovative businesses to succeed too. It will be a sad day when a $2B business can&#39;t survive and is forced to sell."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Dropbox has been hammered by Wall Street ever since it went public. On the surface it should be trading well enough given it&#39;s revenue growth from when it went public to now, however, the narrative of competing with both Microsoft and Google was a tough one to play down.Revenue growth will slow down to below 20% in 2021 which basically starts to take DBX out of the high growth tech stock focus and it is trading at less than 5x 2021 revenue when the median is somewhere closer to the 12-14x range and that&#39;s for companies below 30% growth.The same was seen with Slack. Though they had great revenue growth, the narrative was that they couldn&#39;t compete with Microsoft and so their stock never really traded at a comparable revenue multiple compared to others.It could be said that they have a heavy spend on Sales and Marketing but the same could be said of plenty of other Enterprise tech focused companies like MongoDB that still commands a very high forward looking multiple.Unfortunately from the end-user side the experience has suffered somewhat and I&#39;ve personally switched away from Dropbox so I can&#39;t really say they are doing great on the product side and the amount of &#34;Growth Hacking for Revenue&#34; that is now part of the product experience is a bit off-putting.Also shows the potential for issues if you end up solely dependent on one product and don&#39;t diversity, especially if it&#39;s seen as a commodity.The work force reduction is purely to turn the company profitable on a net basis and the trailing twelve months they&#39;ve already gotten into the black. That&#39;s down from a $400MM loss just a couple of years ago.But the belief is that there isn&#39;t a tremendous amount of profitability internally, because the expenditures are just too high, and cutting further into that theoretically will reduce revenue growth further."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is interesting because having layoffs at a company that should be going off like a rocket during a pandemic is odd.  What is going on at Dropbox that prevented them from taking advantage of the huge shift to remote work?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"After our second daughter was born with a disability and we didn’t know if she’d make it to her first birthday I threw myself into my new job utterly. I was working 7-7 almost every day, took every opportunity to travel, and in general was absent from the situation as much as my “very important job” would allow.For me I felt completely powerless at the hospital. At work I got to solve “important” problems that were trivial in comparison to the things I had no control over, and was rewarded for doing so. It felt good to be useful when my life felt in complete chaos outside of work.At one point I stayed up all night to wrap up a project that wasn’t even that important. My boss, rather than being happy with me, sat me down and said I needed to make sure to sleep and take care of myself, that I was going to burn myself out. I really appreciate him saying that in retrospect, even though I felt a little offended at the time. I try to balance work and home life, and have developed a great relationship with my daughter, now two.In retrospect I wish I’d had the emotional stability to spend more time at the hospital, and to provide more emotional support for my wife who was saddled with going to the hospital almost every day.Things are better now, our daughter is doing very well, but the workaholism can be because of external factors, as overworking made me able to ignore the other, more depressing parts of my life where I lacked control."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Most of the time I&#39;ve seen it, it is avoidance of the rest of their life. &#34;Change diapers? Oh, sorry honey, I uhh... gotta do this thing at work. Darn it!&#34;One phenomenon I&#39;ve always noticed about workaholics is that they THINK they are being more productive, but often times they are just spending more time spinning their wheels. Also the effect it has on their mood/interpersonal skills, and the pressure it puts on the rest of the team cancels it out. Seriously, one rude comment in the morning can throw a developer off for the rest of the day, it&#39;s not worth it.&#34;Man what&#39;s up with frank today?&#34;&#34;Oh he was pulling an all-nighter doing a non-urgent task.&#34;&#34;Did anybody ask him to?&#34;&#34;No. In fact we asked him to stop.&#34;I consider independent study, side-projects, reading a good book, smoking some dope, cooking a good meal with my partner, getting enough sleep, relaxing, and exercising(!!!!) part of my job. I don&#39;t care what kind of mutant you THINK you are, you will perform better if you go to bed and get a full nights rest and clean your brain out. It is just science.Finally, while it is true that &#34;work more = better review at work&#34;, it&#39;s just... not worth it. If your job is your whole life and you are not making +200k: GET A LIFE. You have better things to do with your time than make some other man money. Work is a &#34;safe place.&#34; Time goes in, money comes out. But that doesn&#39;t mean it is a healthy way to spend all of your time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have been running an open source MathJax-based mathematics pastebin[1] since 2012 and I had received 2 donations for it until recently. Then a mathematician tweeted[2] about it convincing others to send some donations. After that kind gesture by him, I received 3 more donations. So pretty sure I can&#39;t make a living out of donations. :-) But I still appreciate them because they help in covering a portion of the hosting cost.Also, I never seriously expected donations for this project because I don&#39;t work much on it these days apart from cleaning up spam from time to time, complying with legal notices and occasional maintenance. I added a donation button only to see if someone would use it. Apart from covering hosting cost, I think an important side effect of the donations is that it provides some additional motivation to continue working on the project and develop it further which I indeed plan to do as soon as I can find the time for it.[1] http://mathb.in/[2] https://twitter.com/daveinstpaul/status/1345082256361193473"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The first donation to my open source project (1) came from someone who went through the trouble of emailing me to ask how they could donate.Since then, I&#39;ve embraced receiving donations and last year I ended up receiving more than 10.000 euro. (2)I (re)donate everything to charity, for reasons (3), but even then it&#39;s a great motivator. If it wasn&#39;t for the money I would have burned out long ago. It really means a lot when people show their support in such a tangible way.I recommend everyone to both accept donations, and donate to others.(1) https://freesewing.org/

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been trying to encourage more &#34;Charityware&#34; for software [0]. My software is free and open source (MIT license) [1] but I also sell it for $5 and donate $3.50 of every sale to a cost-effective charity. My goal is to increase donations to the charity, and asking people for donations wouldn&#39;t be as effective. My software now has generated almost over $9,000 in donations.Personally, every purchase of my software feels rewarding. It&#39;s probably not as great as a regular donation, but it&#39;s a close second. Furthermore, since my software is pay-what-you-want (with a minimum of $5) people have been often giving more than the minimum. That really feels like a donation.[0] https://medium.com/@whyboris/charityware-doing-good-with-pro...[1] https://github.com/whyboris/Video-Hub-App"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have an interesting anecdote related to this.As it happens, I currently have COVID. When I first noticed I was getting sick, I was scheduled to fly in the near future, so I got a rapid COVID test that delivers results in 15 minutes.It was negative. I got another one, and it was negative too. I had thus intended to go ahead with the trip under the assumption I had a minor cold.Later, a few days before I was to fly, I lost all smell and taste. Now I didn’t know what to think. I wasn’t particularly congested, and the loss of smell was total. I’d never experienced this before. Could both tests have been false negatives?I delayed the flight (free of charge luckily, so no big deal) and got a test that had to be sent to a lab for analysis. A week later, the positive test result came back.Take from this what you will. I&#39;m not a scientist or a doctor and frankly there&#39;s nothing remotely intelligent I can say about the various tests out there for COVID. But if the rapid tests are as unreliable in general as they were for me, it’s sort of no wonder COVID is spreading like wildfire. I was very, very close to boarding a plane with an active case of COVID, and I would have if I hadn’t acted out of an abundance of caution."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t understand why we don&#39;t implement the isolation procedures of countries that have gotten this under control, following these procedures for both foreign citizens AND US citizens:- When you arrive in the US, you either spend two weeks at a government approved hotel, at your expense, which is monitored by federal agents to make sure you don&#39;t leave your room.  You pay for room service for two weeks to get food.  This is what Singapore does.- If you don&#39;t want to stay at the government hotel, you agree to let the government track your cell phone for two weeks to make sure you stay in your home, and randomly call you twice a day to make sure you didn&#39;t ditch your phone.  This is what Taiwan does.As a plus, all the hotels near airports would be so thankful for all the forced business to make up for the loss of travel business.They should have been doing this for the last nine months.Edit: And obviously combine these rules with a relief bill that helps the industries that are hurt by these rules, or you know, everyone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A similar requirement has been enacted in Canada and what has happened is that Canadians with covid can&#39;t return home to Canada and are stuck abroad.
It really gives some teeth to the &#34;do not travel&#34; recommendation - if you get covid abroad you can&#39;t come home until you test negative. If you get covid at home and then go abroad you can&#39;t come home until you test negative.
I think people who previously would have travelled and just risked it will be a lot more careful now since they can&#39;t get home if they are sick with covid. Instead of dozens of flights per day entering canada with covid cases we now have zero [1].[1] http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m generally anti-regulation, but one potential consideration is to apply the same standards of eviction to cloud hosts as we do to landlords.I think we agree that no private platform should be forced to host a tenant that they object to. Yet a landlord isn&#39;t allowed to arbitrarily throw you out of your house on a moments notice. Even if your lease is on a month-to-month basis, the law requires giving the tenant a reasonable timeframe to let them find new accommodations.Even if the landlord insists on a contract abrogating this, it&#39;s unenforceable. Policy restricts this because 1) landlords generally have very high negotiation power, and 2) tenants rarely read the fine print. It seems to me that both conditions are approximately true for the major cloud providers.If you agree with tenant eviction protections, then you should probably support similar eviction protections for cloud computing. AWS/GCP/Gmail/iCloud could ban you as a customer, but only with 90 days notice. Otherwise, immediate eviction could only occur if it involved legally codified egregious behavior,  and would require a court judgement.I think this would eliminate nightmare scenarios where somebody suddenly finds themselves locked out of their Google Drive and Gmail for some algorithmic mishap. But it would put very little operating burden on the cloud providers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I... don&#39;t understand? You were an unpopular speech platform. I worked in porn for 20 years. I know what it&#39;s like to get kicked out of AWS, so does John Young. Why weren&#39;t they dockerized and prepared to move containers and backups at the drop of a hat? Why didn&#39;t they have hot spares elsewhere? There are literally thousands of hosting companies running the gamut from penny-ante to larger platforms like Rackspace, operating in a hundred countries, many of which don&#39;t know and don&#39;t wanna know what you&#39;re doing. The same is true to a lesser extent of registries. And Apple/Google kicking you out of their stores? You can still bookmark a mobile-friendly web app onto the home screen of an Apple device. You&#39;re not going to lose Qspiracy fans and nazis just because they have to do an extra step to get to your site.Nevermind that maybe, just maybe, if your platform users advocate for violent revolution, you&#39;re going to have a harder go of things. Prior to approximately October, 2001, there was a taleban.com too. I didn&#39;t read any hand-wringing when they got the axe. Newsflash: At least Tor can&#39;t remove you.The simplest explanation is that they saw this coming a mile away (who honestly didn&#39;t?) and this is engineered martyrdom."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article (really it&#39;s more of a press release from the interested parties) seems to confuse the role of DNS from the role of certificate authority, making it hard for me to understand what they&#39;re talking about.These days sometimes the same entities provide both SSL certificates and DNS, but they are different services.&gt; Handshake is “is effectively a decentralized domain name server,” Roquerre said. Instead of using the web-standard certificate authority to authenticate user connections to a server, Handshake stores references to the IP address of the websites registered in its system. Namebase is a platform that offers users access to the Handshake networkThat makes no sense at all. But it sounds like handshake is simply an alternate DNS protocol?  Or does it also serve as a certificate authority somehow?  Is it actually more decentralized than DNS (which is already of course decentralized in one axis, but not the relevant one for keeping a lookup available if the entity hosting DNS decides to remove it).Very confusing.It seems like tor .onion address would be an actually mature solution to this problem, instead of this thing that seems like press release babble?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The problem with &#34;trying it with my team for one sprint&#34; is that I now need to have a long conversation with legal. How will the service provider handle the content (discussions, screenshots, code snippets) that my team will upload? Do our current customer contracts contain any clauses that complicate the use of external discussion sites? In the unlikely event that the service offers the option to host it locally -- who is going to deploy it, configure it, set up security and authn/authz around it?The real answer is: just fucking use email. Why is email not  one of the options suggested in the TFA? It&#39;s universally available, durable, allows long-form conversation and thoughtful deliberation, doesn&#39;t tell you that &#34;someone is typing,&#34; and offers you the luxury of checking it at a set interval only a few times per day.The way many organizations have collectively abandoned email in favor of instant messaging is a travesty."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can&#39;t agree with this essay more.In the early days of the Ethereum community a lot of open coordination was done on reddit and a threaded forum hosted on Vanilla Forums. Initially for privacy and convenience, Skype, gitter, Discord, and Telegram began to take hold, and later became the primary place for open, public discussions and some decision-making as well.Threaded forums were still used but not central. It was a difficult era (but a lot of work still moved forward)! There emerged a kind of opacity due to ability to put attention on real-time threads, and IMO sometimes key voices were missing because they could not weigh in effectively.What changed the dynamic was the introduction of Discourse for the critical https://ethresear.ch discussions (set up by Virgil Griffith), and later https://ethereum-magicians.org (something I worked on). I was pushing for threaded at the time because of experiences I had here on Hacker News, reddit, and Slashdot. The person I collaborated with, Greg Colvin, wanted discussions like the threaded emails he was used to from the IETF and c++ communities.We each knew from long experiences dealing with coordinating on tech issue remotely that the quality of the message is the medium.From those successful experiments / re-introductions, many teams then began to adopt and host Discourse instances. Later, DeFi picked it up for their governance / coordination discussions. Of course, real-time never went away, with more gravitating toward Telegram and Discord. But tracing the emerging thinking, hashing out differences on what to do, and re-activating stale discussions improved a lot.Threaded discussions are a core part of the community and work again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find this somewhat incomprehensible. Why the bias for seeing and archiving everything? The implicit model, which is right there in his title, is &#34;talk&#34;, which is not naturally archived.I&#39;ve built products just fine using verbal communication nearly exclusively. [1] We don&#39;t need to create some sort of panoptic archive of every conversation ever had to get things done. If people miss things, they miss things. We can catch each other up on the parts that truly matter.Forgetting and repetition can be negative, but they can also be highly positive. We don&#39;t have to carry with us the weight of every word ever spoken about a project.[1] The main exception being index cards with a few words on each. https://williampietri.com/writing/2015/the-big-board/"</p>

A possible start: EFF have an excellent privacy hub https://www.eff.org/issues/privacyI have taken a case study with my teen about people loosing careers after facebook flame-wars; and being hauled in by police on face-recognition and geolocation data. We have a discussion at least once a month about the cyber-dystopia we find ourselves in.As I posted before, I&#39;ll just leave this here:1. &#34;It turns out that Facebook also buys data about your offline purchases.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not to be negative, but teamspeak and ventrilo represent some of the biggest failures of &#39;getting stuck in your lane&#39; ever. They got fat on hosted server revenue and never iterated. Both of them had years (decade?) on discord and never thought to make their product free, web based or have a better chat. Ventrilo still has no official ios/android app (lol). Both remind me of craigslist, actually- Except that craigslist is still going strong (for now).Both still exist, granted- And many still use them. Its just that discord really shouldnt exist, it should have been one of these players. The head start they had should have been insurmountable.Also, apologies for not really commenting on the subject at hand (TS supporting matrix) - Its just I so rarely hear about TS/Vent that I thought it worth me shouting into the ether my disappointment I am not talking to all my friends on vent/ts in 2021."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here is a more official-looking statement: https://community.teamspeak.com/t/beta-signup/13749/50&gt; We use the Matrix protocol only for the messenger part.
The rest does not require a different TeamSpeak server."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m glad to see TeamSpeak is still out there. I totally dropped it as soon as Discord became popular, not because I didn&#39;t like it - but literally everyone moved over, I didn&#39;t want to be left behind.Totally can see how some folks out here value their data a lot more and want to keep things private! That&#39;s where TeamSpeak will always thrive!Here&#39;s a little bit of a story-time anecdote: Back when I was in school, we used TeamSpeak to talk after hours, it was like the equivalent of people double (or 1.5x) my age spending hours and hours on the phone and their parents yelling &#34;GET OFF THE PHONE&#34;. 
It was a win win situation because with ADSL (3mbps lol) I could be connected all day and not hog the phone line, additionally the in-built chat to whisper things was good enough that we could exchange links for funny images/flash games etc.The voice quality was never bad, it took a little server configuration to get it just right, and the ability to record your voice and the conversation made for some hilarious clips compilation throughout the years, sometimes we still share some of those clips to remember what it was like to have a squeaky teenage voice.I spent thousands of hours on TeamSpeak and also tried Ventrilo/Mumble - but I was defo a team TeamSpeak kid...Also I really liked the fact that TeamSpeak had a public servers list that we could just join when someone forgot to pay the bill for our own server. Yep we rotated...so it wouldn&#39;t be the burden of 1 person paying for everyone!Speaking of paying the bill, it was always just a couple of dollars PayPal&#39;d over to someone who had a larger servers, basically sub-renting a whole room and subrooms...made us feel like adults paying our own bills :)Thanks for allowing me to drive down memory lane!"</p>

Biggest differences we&#39;re doing is to use Welford&#39;s algorithm[0] to calculate a running variance, so we can calculate anomalies in real time, without the need to store logs.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a nicely done article. One of the issues with using a z-score for count data is it assumes the data are normally distributed. This implies values &lt; 0 are possible. However, since counts are lower-bounded at zero, they’re asymmetric unlike the normal. This means that practically this method would produce too many false positives for most applications. Whatever threshold is chosen, is likely to have too narrow an envelope between false negative and false positive to be reliable for count data. However, for normally distributed data, this would work perfectly."</p>

When the button glows &#39;red&#39; the power is removed from the microphones."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yes that is the technical conclusion. But maybe the most important thing is that we have to do an actual teardown of the product in order to have some confidence that Amazon is not lying on it&#39;s Echo capabilities.To be clear, I am not saying we should trust Amazon &amp; Co, I&#39;m saying that if that&#39;s the level of trust we have with home assistance devices, why even bother with the stuff ?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Disclosure: I&#39;m an Amazon Devices PE, but not on Alexa devices.Jeff (and others) have spoken publicly about this in the past, and this teardown is correct.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I can really recommend doing this for your personal finances! Tools like ledger are really powerful, and properly accounting is a great way to save on money. I can very easily go into my personal ledger and (say) get a report on &#34;How much money did i spend daily on groceries last month&#34; or &#34;List all subscription services i pay for and how much they cost each month&#34; or whatever. It gives you a great view into where your money is going and helps you plan for the future. It&#39;s very satisfying to run the command &#34;ledger reg -Mn Assets Liabilities&#34;, which is &#34;show me my net wealth (i.e. the sum of Assets and Liabilities) for every month in the ledger&#34;, and see your personal wealth grow over time.But almost more importantly: if you&#39;re a programmer, it&#39;s really very fun! Like, i have my own system where I download my bank statement as a CSV and process it in AWK together with an org-mode table of payees that map each line on the bank statement to an account, which then generates a ledger file. Since it&#39;s just you using it, you can make it so it works however you like, and it quite satisfying to see it all come together.It&#39;s also a great way to learn about accounting. Turns out, I really kinda like accounting! It has many of the same pleasures of programming or math, and seeing everything balance is very satisfying. In short: if you&#39;re a programmer who feels like they haven&#39;t quite got a handle on their finances, I can&#39;t recommend plain text accounting highly enough."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I generally only care how much my net worth has increased.  I&#39;ve found that I taking the time to enter every single receipt and expense outside of my personal business accounting is largely a waste of time.For me, the most meaningful info is a markdown doc where I quarterly asses all of my investment accounts / assets and come to a &#34;current net worth total&#34;.I&#39;ve found a personal correlation between trying to minimize and track minuscule expenses and a decline in my mental health or happiness at work.  I&#39;m frugal by nature and trust myself enough to not worry too much about day to day spending."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t know, I&#39;ve been intrigued by plain text double-entry bookkeeping for a while, it looks like fun, but on the second thought I just don&#39;t see any real benefit for a regular person (probably, most IT specialists don&#39;t qualify). You get your salary, you set aside 20-75% to pay the bills, some amount you know from experience you need for groceries and other recurring expenses (like public transport and household goods) and if you happen to have anything left it goes to savings. If you&#39;re privileged, you&#39;ll also have some petty cash left for occasional lunch/night out. When you need to spend some significant unplanned sum you take it out of savings, if you have any. If not, you eat less or go into debt.What&#39;s there to track, how much you&#39;ve spent on potatoes and underwear this month versus the previous?That was the scenario for a disciplined citizen. Most just pay the bills (not necessary all of them) and then just spend what&#39;s left on their debit card until there&#39;s nothing left. It usually happens before the next salary, of course. No accounting software would help there.UPD: I&#39;m not sure it was the right place to spill my negativity, I fully understand the benefits of being organized with your finances."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I read things like this and it really makes me sad. I don’t agree with Steve Bannon or Rudy Giuliani on a lot of things. I also don’t agree with their equivalent person on the left. In fact I am skeptical of most “career politicians”. I really wish we could switch what politics is about. Currently we (meaning news channels and Twitter/internet folk) want to dunk on the other tribe and show them how wrong and stupid they are. Can’t we all try to find consensus and compromise? I know that I personally don’t have enough knowledge and experience to know what’s right for all people at all times. Life can be complicated. Let’s have some compassion folks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not even in the US, but all of this banning makes me really curious about what&#39;s being banned and why.Something that some of you may have missed: This banning thing already moved into the infrastructure/cloud services layer (AWS):https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25707959"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think we can&#39;t reasonably be doing front page stories every time one of these things gets reported. It&#39;s going to keep happening. Different people have different feelings about that, but we&#39;ve had thousands of front-page-thread comments on much more important stories than Bannon&#39;s dumb podcast channel. At some point we should just refer back to those threads. I don&#39;t need to see Bannon&#39;s culpability litigated on HN; we&#39;re getting to Politico levels of granularity here."</p>
