								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; But math never decreed that sine and cosine have to take radian arguments!That is not entirely true. It comes from the relationship between those functions and the complex numbers via the Euler formula.     ix
    e    = cos x   +   i sin x

There may be arithmetic/numerical inconveniences, but that&#39;s not all there is to &#34;math&#34;.Let&#39;s define ncos and nsin (&#34;nice cos, nice sin&#34;) as follows:   nsin x = sin 2πx
   ncos x = cos 2πx

So then what do we make of:   ncos x   +   i nsin x

This has to be   cos 2πx  +   i sin 2πx

which is then     2πix        (   2π) ix        ix 
   e           = ( e   )      =  f 

      
           2π
Where f = e    is a weird number like 535.4916. This f doesn&#39;t have nice properties. E.g.:      d     x           x
      -   f     /=    f 
      dx

Otherwise it works; for instance 90 degrees is 0.25 and surely enough     0.25i 
   f          = i

In situations not involving e in relation to angular representations via Euler, f cannot replace e.I&#39;m all for having parallel trig functions in libraries that work with turns, though.The annoying 2π factor shows up in lots of places though. Should way, say, in electronics, redefine a new version of capacitive reactance which doesn&#39;t have 2πf in the denominator, but only f?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author makes the point that turns allow for exact representation of many commonly used angles, but with binary floating point, many common angles (1/6 of a turn, for example) are inexact.This could be addressed by using a whole number other than 1 to represent a turn ... one that is a multiple of 3 (or 3x3) and 5, and while we&#39;re at it, 2 (or 2x2x2), so most commonly-used angles are whole numbers!  That gives us 360 as the value representing a whole turn."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My favourite way of handling angles was always with either unsigned char or 16bit unsigned int that was treated as 1/nth of turn. Usually in these cases cos/sin tables were pre-calculated for speed, although that need went away to an extent. As long as as the calculations wrap around on the underlying system, it makes angles much easier to manage, because angle1 + angle2 = angle3 is always within 0 to 255 or 0 to 65535. Unfortunately I mostly work with higher level languages now that have mostly dropped integer types.If anybody knows how similar calculations can be easily achieved in JS for example, I&#39;d love to hear about it. I&#39;m sure there must be a better way than boundary checks and manual wrap-around."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I can relate to the frustration of the author.
I wrote an open source library which gets downloaded 50K+ times per week.
At one point, I hadn&#39;t updated it in several months and people started asking if the project is dead...
In fact, it wasn&#39;t updated in a while because it had been working perfectly and was built in a forward-compatible way; that makes it more healthy and therefore more alive than probably 99% of libraries on the internet.The expectation that software libraries or frameworks should break every few months is disturbing. I think this may be due to the fact that many of the most popular frameworks do this.
I find that React-based apps tend to break every few months for a range of reasons; often because of reliance on obscure functionality or bundling of binaries which aren&#39;t forward-compatible with newer engine versions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; So I had to spend four hours on Saturday upgrading all my platform libraries simply so that I could compile the damn app.I sort of assume this is the actual point? Apple presumably wants to drop support for older versions of the SDKs, and that requires that app developers update to the newer versions. I think you can make a reasonable argument that dumping work on third-party developers to simplify things for themselves is bad, but the author&#39;s belief that it was simply pointless busywork is probably incorrect from Apple&#39;s perspective.I suspect the minimum download threshold to be exempt from this is _very_ high. Maintaining backwards compatibility for a small fixed set of apps doing things an old way is a categorically different problem from maintaining backwards compatibility for every app out there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t think culling games/apps based on age is the right approach to improving discoverability.I don&#39;t see Nintendo removing old Switch games from the eShop.I don&#39;t see Apple Music removing the Beatles because they haven&#39;t updated recently.My recommendation, which Apple&#39;s (obnoxious) ad business would never accept, would be to1. Remove the obnoxious and generally useless ads which eat up the top half of the first page of app search on the iPhone.2. Improve app search with more options and a fast, responsive UI. Also they might consider allowing you to consider ratings from other sources such as critical reviews vs. user reviews (a la metacritic.)3. Better human curation with more categories. This is the same approach that Apple Music takes and it seems to work well. Games should have Artist/Studio/Developer pages as well as Essentials lists to facilitate discovery. Same with genre/category essentials, which have a rotating list that can be saved/bookmarked."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A key fact to understand in thinking about cheating in over the board chess: a strong player can defeat a much stronger opponent with just 1-3 hints per game indicating the strongest move.  For example, most chess experts agree that a ~2600 rated player with 2-3 hints at key moments per game would be expected to beat a ~2800 rated player.  Many people might assume that a cheater needs guidance every move, thereby requiring a potentially more obvious cheating mechanism. That is not the case.Also, clever cheating devices have been found in over the board chess competitions.  So, this is possible.  Moreover, one needn&#39;t carry a device on themselves.  A cheater may have accomplices providing hints, if they carry a device.It will be interesting to see how chess tournaments, as well as FIDE, chess.com, and other major chess institutions react to this situation.  The potential for cheating has now been brought to the absolute forefront of chess discussion.  And Carlsen&#39;s actions have been questioned by FIDE in recent interviews, with FIDE staff condemning &#34;vigilantism&#34; of a kind.Some set of resolutions seems necessary--perhaps standards for security in major chess tournaments, perhaps an alliance to share cheating or reliability data amongst major chess operations, perhaps a standard term in major chess tournament agreements that no previously identified cheaters (online or otherwise) will be allowed to play, and perhaps sanctions in some form against Carlsen (or Niemann, if concrete evidence against him emerges)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Imagine you know someone with a history of stealing cars and other valuable objects. He has been caught multiple times. Now you see him with a shiny new car that you’re pretty sure he can’t afford.Did he steal it? Not necessarily — it’s entirely possible that he got a higher-paying legit job and saved up for it, or inherited money from a relative, or got it legally in some other way. He shouldn’t be convicted of a new crime with no other evidence just because he committed similar crimes in the past.However, it would be entirely natural for a reasonable person to assume that theft is the most likely explanation of the facts, and to avoid trusting that person.This is basically what happened with Hans. He has been caught cheating multiple times, and then had an unusually fast rise in rating. Is that rise impossible? No. But it’s consistent with cheating, and given his history, cheating is the simplest explanation.So it would be totally normal for Magnus to refuse to trust such a person even though it can’t be conclusively proven that he’s still dirty. But even then, Magnus agreed to play against him, until further circumstantial evidence came to light and it just got to be too much.So, is it possible that Hans is clean? Sure. If that’s indeed the case, do I feel sorry for him? No. He made the choice to destroy his own reputation when he cheated multiple times. If he doesn’t get the benefit of the doubt now, it’s on him."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I believe people might be seriously underestimating just how good Magnus may be at detecting cheating.Dude probably trains with computers regularly. He has a better memory than 10 average Joe&#39;s combined. He&#39;s been the absolute #1 of the world for what, 10 years now?He wouldn&#39;t risk his whole reputation for nothing.I personally take his suspicions very seriously, though I agree that evidence has to be presented sooner or later."</p>

So, let me bear my thoughts.Since July of this year I&#39;ve been CTO for a small games company, I&#39;ve worked in this industry before in a more specialised role but this is much broader scope.I&#39;ve gone from being responsible for 1 person to 10 which will likely become 50 by the end of next year.I&#39;m terrified.I&#39;m terrified because I feel like I will let my reports down.I&#39;m terrified because a lot of the work I&#39;m doing lacks transparency, how do I tell my compatriots about things that may not come to pass, especially deep political things -- and the amount of work necessary to onboard/offboard people, about &#34;strategic partnerships&#34; and why they&#39;re taken, or not taken or any of the hundreds of other things which are changing direction 3 times a day each.I am technical, deeply, passionately technical.I will not do service to people by being technical, my days are too fragmented, my worries too broad, it&#39;s impossible to dig into a small focused problem and give it the treatment it deserves - and even if I could then I&#39;d be dooming one of my colleagues to maintain it forever because I couldn&#39;t possibly..My being technical is good because I know the problems and I know what can make people feel valued; I can give people autonomy and direction and I can understand when help is needed and how to give it.However, almost nothing in my work is technical, it&#39;s all presentations, discussions, breakdowns, timelines, contracts and negotiation.The most code I write now is to do cost reporting.My most frequently accessed cloud console pages are the billing sections.This is not fun at all (and frankly, I didn&#39;t think it would be); but I fear what will replace me if I leave."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There is a difference between remembering something (like a fact) and a deep understanding of a concept.Let me give you an example in programming: I sometimes have to google for the names of functions I&#39;ve already used a hundred times. Sometimes extremely simple functions (just a while ago it was list.size() in Java), only because I can&#39;t remember the name of the function, but of course I understand the concept - the length of a list/array. I just can&#39;t remember if it&#39;s length(), or size() or count(), or whatever.This deep understanding feels quite different from simple memorization. It feels more like something in my body, similar to muscle memory or like playing a piano piece. It&#39;s something I feel I will never forget.I&#39;d love to learn more about this kind of understanding. For years I&#39;ve tried to find good reading about it, but much has been disappointing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who has been using Anki for the past 4 years to learn Japanese and now Chinese, I&#39;ve recently found that the initial &#34;learning&#34; step is not that hard. (i.e., given 辞書, I remember &#34;dictionary&#34;) What is hard is keeping the content I&#39;ve learned, _learned_, for more than a day.So now I&#39;m wondering, is my initial &#34;learning&#34; process wrong? Since definitions are fairly simple and I find them easy to remember at first but hard to hold onto. And my process in Anki for New cards is to rep them like reviewed cards until I pass the card; so really, I&#39;m just staring at the kanji + definition until I remember it.This brings me to my question: is there more Anki can do when it comes to learning new cards? Is there something we can do when learning new information that will help make it &#34;sticky&#34;? Especially in regards to &#34;simple&#34; facts, like basic kanji -&gt; definition mappings, where there are no mechanics to understand, just simple mappings.Edit (an addition):Also, I love SRS, but I don&#39;t understand how it can be advertised as completely different than rote memorization. When you learn a new physical flashcard, you&#39;re learning it the same way as you would be when learning a new Anki card. The only difference is that Anki will show it to you again at a more efficient time in the future, rather than at some regular interval."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Calling learning remembering, is like calling a computer a hard drive. Sorry, but, remembering is just one part, although important part of learning. There is loads of difference between remembering the words of a foreign language and fluently speaking it. The process of learning is complicated, eg. good teaching is not giving the final answers to learner, which should seem faster, but letting the learner arrive at their answers, even sometimes arriving at a wrong answer at first.
And the point about reducing forgetting, that&#39;s also a terrible way of learning. If you want to minimize forgetting, that means you have to learn in baby steps, repeat everything using some kind of spaced repetition algorithm, and endure the pain of doing all this for a considerate amount of time. Instead, learning the content rapidly (meanwhile forgetting a lot of the content), getting a whole picture, and gradually gain more understanding repeating the process using different textbooks/courses, is a much more faster way of learning. The brain is more used to BFS (breadth-first-search) than DFS (depth-first-search), and the whole process is much more stimulating. This is because new knowledge needs to be encoded with connections to pre-existing knowledge, and most knowledge is intertwined together, for example in calculus, limits, derivatives, integrals, infinite series, etc. Learning limits in isolation of the whole picture, optimizing for less percentage of forgetting, often leaves learners confused, why am I even learning this, and what use is this for. Even though the percentage of forgetting is much higher in the latter holistic BFS process, the overall content mastered in the same month or week duration is higher. So forgetting is actually normal and you shouldn&#39;t panic when you forget things- since you will gain more understanding each time you learn and re-learn the content.
For the last ten years, I&#39;ve been making products for learning, and every day now and then, I&#39;m still learning something new about learning."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find the vpmullq part the most stunning.This instruction is used in some bignum code, for example if you are implementing RSA. Yet AMD implemented it three times faster than Intel.I&#39;m also fascinated by AMD now making AVX512 worthwhile on consumer devices (where they would until quite recently artificially slow down Intel CPUs that had it), which presumably will lead to widespread adoption where it matters. Intels strategy of turning off AVX512 in the recent consumer devices because their energy efficiency cores don&#39;t have it may turn out to be a monumental mistake."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"phoronix:AMD Zen 4 AVX-512 Performance Analysis On The Ryzen 9 7950Xhttps://www.phoronix.com/review/amd-zen4-avx512&#34;On average for the tested AVX-512 workloads, making use of the AVX-512 instructions led to around 59% higher performance compared to when artificially limiting the Ryzen 9 7950X to AVX2 / no-AVX512.From these results I am rather impressed by the AVX-512 performance out of the AMD Ryzen 9 7950X. While initially being disappointed when hearing of their &#34;double pumping&#34; approach rather than going for a 512-bit data path, these benchmark results speak for themselves. For software that can effectively make use of AVX-512 (and compiled so), there is significant performance uplift to enjoy while no negative impact in terms of reduced CPU clock speeds / higher power consumption (with oneDNN being one of the only exceptions seen so far in terms of higher power draw).AVX-512 is looking good on the Ryzen 7000 series and I&#39;ll continue running more benchmarks over the weeks ahead. These AVX-512 results make me all the more excited for AMD EPYC &#34;Genoa&#34; where AVX-512 can be a lot more widely-used among HPC/server workloads. &#34;"</p>

Instead of assuming that phones can be insecure and developing appropriate crypto based mechanisms, Cloudflare is proposing to bring the phone inside a &#39;trusted&#39; network. Remember, ZT does not rely on trusted network.Solutions like this will increase confusion and fragment the already &#39;interpretation led&#39; as opposed to definition led ZT landscape."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why is there no opposition to this shit? SIMs were physical for a reason. As a consumer what do you get out of it? You have to go through the carriers to switch between phones now! You can&#39;t just pick up a random unlocked phone and put a sim in it. No more burner phones. I have been in situations where I changed SIM between phones multiple times a day.But it sounds like it is too late for this. It&#39;s like people who oppose cash payments out of the convenience of card/app payments. This small chipping away of a small libery adds up.I hope eveyone knows that you can&#39;t as a layman register an email address or any meaningful service you depend on without a phone number (i.e.: a sim), that is what is being regulated here even more."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Many are of the listed items are merely being deprecated. These shouldn’t really qualify as breaking changes. In fact, the ability to migrate away incrementally is precisely the point of deprecating instead of removing a feature.What surprises me is that a lot of the deprecated functionality seems really recent — C++14 or newer. Compatibility is C++’s big thing, that’s historically why it kept almost all of C as a sublanguage. I know organizations where migrating to C++11 is still an ongoing process. It’s not great news if features become obsolete faster than many users can adopt them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wait, so the words &#34;concepts&#34; and &#34;requires&#34; were newly made keywords, and this breaks code, but the words &#34;yield&#34; and &#34;await&#34; were determined too important and too common to standards members that they needed to be renamed to the horrifically ugly &#34;co_await&#34; and &#34;co_yield&#34;?Also, last time I actually tried to use C++20 none of the standard library implementations had std::format; has this changed now?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just a note but I&#39;m fairly certain this is purely from the perspective of Google Chrome, meaning it excludes google3 (Google&#39;s repo for nearly all Google services). I don&#39;t know this for a fact but I suspect it&#39;s the case. I only bring it up because google3 C++ is (or was; it&#39;s now been years since I&#39;ve done this directly) a very different beast. It was notionally compliant with recent standards but a very restrictive subset of features were allowed.The C++ standard currently sits at &gt;1800 pages. Looking through these examples, I&#39;m honestly horrified. The semantics around moving and copying and the many ways you can initialize a variable [1] and how you can mess that up so it&#39;s actually a copy instead of a move is just mind-bending.Can we also talk about how in 2022 we&#39;re still talking about and getting wrong const-correctness? I guess we&#39;re going ever further now because this presentation touches on constexpr correctness (as in const vs constexpr).Another thought: problems like comparisons between base and derived problems shouldn&#39;t even be problems (IMHO) because you&#39;ve already messed up by wanting that behaviour.The change about not doing arithmetic on enum values is a good one but pretty late.TIL this is a valid way to cast:    size_t{expanded_size}

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I didn&#39;t appreciate until recently that the calendar we live by today was personally designed by Julius Caesar.Like not by some forgotten technocrats incidentally during his time, but Julius Caesar himself as a subject matter expert, as a side-project.  With consultation, certainly, but by his initiative, from long-standing engagement with the problem in one of his early jobs from long before he was a main character of the Roman story.Digestable and entertaining (fragment of a) video on the topic:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fD-R35DSSZY&amp;t=1312s"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find the implication that aliens are rational and have no subrational concepts due to tradition and habit interesting, as it sort of implies that these kinds of outgrowths are not necessary and can just be done away with.  The narrator starts from a position of not wanting to legitimize or historicize beyond reductive statements like &#34;some ancient civilization did XYZ&#34;.  I&#39;ll admit that I skimmed through the last part of the thread, so I might have missed something, but I don&#39;t see any mention of the decimal calendar https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Republican_calendar, or why that failed.  I get that this is supposed to be funny, but the indirect message of getting rid of whatever doesn&#39;t make conscious sense is simplistic, and spoils the fun for me.  Humans are stupid, very funny."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is absolutely hilarious, and despite being long form, fits Twitter format very well, with each chunk funnier than the last :)A few notes:- Per my knowledge US is the only country which stubbornly (and illogically) considers Sunday to be the first day of the week;- US (and maybe one or two English-speaking countries) are the only ones using 12h time, the rest of the world uses 24hrs, however 12h _sometimes_ is used conversationally;- May be the author got tired (or whatever he took started to wear off) but I consider omitting the whole DST thing a major missed opportunity. :)Also, for those interested, look up Swatch time invented in late 90s and touted as more logical replacement of the mess that we have. I believe they still maintain some Internet presence but mostly gave up on promoting it. Good luck breaking 1000+yo habits."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"McMaster-Carr is an incredible example of how an existing physical-product distributor with a vaunted historical operations department, when faced with moving into the e-commerce world, could choose one of two paths:- Build an online presence cheaply because you can rely on your historical offline operations to paper over any shortcomings in the online system.- Build an online presence with the same ethos, standards, creativity, and long-term continued investment with which you built your offline operations to be your competitive advantage in the first place.There aren&#39;t many legacy organizations that successfully digitized with that second path in mind, at least not at first - McMaster, B&amp;H Photo, and Sweetwater come to mind as notable exceptions. It&#39;s a useful thought experiment, I think, even for those working on startups and green-field projects."</p>

Hence, a lot of screen space is wasted and the user has to scroll more. Larger font sizes on mobile are usually not a good idea as the device tends to be closer to your eyes anyway.A snippet that could work better in my opinion is the following:    html {
      max-width: 70ch;
      /* larger spacing on larger screens, very small spacing on tiny screens */
      padding: calc(1vmin + .5rem);

But we&#39;re 225 comments in (so far) and not a single answer.They&#39;re absolutely nothing like block-based JPEG, that&#39;s for sure. When I inspect the images Google Photos serves me in my browser, it is serving up JPEG (from the response headers). But is this an artifact that shows up in AVIF or WebP? I wonder if mobile clients are getting a different encoding.The only objective thing I notice is that the artifact lines tend to track a line of constant brightness, so you seem them appearing perpendicular to gradients of light and shade. And that each artifact line is black/dark on one side and white/light on the other -- and that the white edge seems to be in the direction of darkening, while the black is in the direction of lightening.Someone here who works with modern image codecs must be able to hypothesize what part of encoding/decoding must be bugging out here?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s funny how I&#39;ve witnessed a complete 180° change from how, in the 1990&#39;s, software was supposed to be entirely discoverable and it also came with a manual that documented literally everything, to now there&#39;s a ton that&#39;s hidden, often without any manual whatsoever... but you can Google everything you need to know.Probably the single most useful skill I&#39;ve had to learn in my life is, whenever you wonder something, just Google it. If you don&#39;t think your software does X... don&#39;t just assume it. Look it up.I&#39;ve been astonished at how often a feature was added 3 years ago to a program I&#39;ve used for 8 years, or there&#39;s a secret swipe that avoids a bunch of menus, or an unofficial command-line flag.And it really leaves me feeling deeply conflicted. Because on the one hand, I still believe in the virtue of learning your tools inside and out. I would read the manual and be proud I knew exactly what every program/language could and couldn&#39;t do. But on the other hand, is that really just a waste of time? Programs have so many features now, that instead of learning all the things via discoverability or a manual, we just learn them by... querying how to do things when we need them.I don&#39;t really like the idea of so fundamentally relying on Google and forums and tutorials and Reddit and YouTube videos as the main way of learning how to use software. But at the same time, software does so much now and adds new things so quickly that it appears to be the only reasonable way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Back Tap feature is my favorite &#34;hidden&#34; action on the iPhone. You can double (or triple) tap the back of the phone to trigger whatever action you want. For example, toggle the flashlight or lock rotation. Show Spotlight or run a Shortcut.https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/back-tap-iphaa57e7885...I think Apple does a decent job telling people about iOS features across the User Guide, Tips.app, and the Apple Support YouTube channel.The &#34;undiscoverable&#34; features in the article are all there.Delete the last digit: If you make a mistake when you enter a number, swipe left or right on the display at the top.https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/calculator-iph1ac0b5c...Turn the onscreen keyboard into a trackpad.1.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The actions listed in the article are fairly non-essential, but many fundamental iOS functions also have discoverability issues, as well as some head-scratching design choices.  For example:- seeing notifications requires swiping down specifically from the top left- turning on the flashlight requires swiping down specifically from the top right.  Swiping down from top left also gets you a flashlight button, but it is not actionable.  The flashlight button on the home screen is also not actionable.- universal search requires swiping to the left of the app pages.  Swiping past the right end of the app pages also gets you a search bar, but it will only show you apps- Seeing your open apps requires swiping up slowly from the bottom of the page.- turning the phone off requires holding two unrelated buttonsMobile UX generally is heavily-dependent on gestures, which inherently creates discoverability challenges, but it seems like Apple goes out of its way to hide every basic function behind a very specific swipe.  It makes me wonder if they intentionally design their products to be exclusively usable by tech-savvy people.Another possible explanation is that design requires users to develop muscle memory over time that will improve experience in the long run and makes competitors feel unnatural."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not a comment on the quality of this application, but rather a tangential topic: there should be some way of auditing the accuracy of emulators in general. If a genuine homebrew scene wants to exist (not just getting old games to work), new programmers who have little-to-no access to the original hardware need some practical way of knowing their software will work properly across different emulators. In the old days, most platforms had one good emulator that everyone used, and these emulators were supported by communities like AtariAge. In the Web 2.0 world, those communities are fractured or even gone completely, and often not easy to find in search engines. There are now much more platforms that emulators can be run on.Hardware emulation isn’t a solution. An FPGA emulator isn’t intrinsically more accurate than a software one, and documentation and schematics that are used to implement emulators can be incorrect and don’t specify ‘undefined behavior’ which was very much used reliably by software developers.The approach adopted by MAME has proven to be the only reliable: you have to measure some output on a real working system and compare it to the emulator behavior, but this can be impractical and becomes moreso over time as systems become more difficult to operate. (E.g. I can’t even operate most 8-bit computers without some kind of mod because I don’t have a CRT television anymore)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I dig the Netflix style navigation, I&#39;m curious if there are plans to support arbitrary ROMs for classic games. Probably can&#39;t host them, but maybe an easy way to load one from local?edit: should have scrolled down in the readme more, they say in the non-goals section:Directly playing locally stored game content (ROMs, etc.)
(Technically possible by using a local web server, but not a primary use case)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There are a lot of callouts of &#34;This is BS&#34; in regards to this article.Look at it from a different perspective. I would HIGHLY prefer this to a short press release blurb that allows pop-science clickbait aggregators (or even worse, the &#34;science&#34; sections of CBS/CNN and the like) to have first crack at it.This was produced by the university themselves, and provides a concise yet accurate and detailed overview of the biochemistry involved, as well as a nice short embedded youtube video demonstrating the movement in question and going over the main points of the research.Yes, improvements could be made, and yes, follow up studies will need to be performed. But this is head and shoulders above the &#34;ONE SMALL TRICK, DIETICIANS HATE HIM&#34; alternative we would have gotten otherwise."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For all the comments wondering what the particular movement and equipment is, see pages 5 and 6 of the supplementary materials: https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S25890042220114... The equipment is an electromyography system with realtime display. It measures the muscle contraction and is displayed to the subject so they can learn to recognize the movement that properly activates the muscle. Contrary to the video, you do not need to be an academic to buy one, they&#39;re fairly common in high-end sports coaching/rehab and you can find a cheap arduino-compatible system on Amazon if you want to DIY.If you don&#39;t read much exercise science, it&#39;s worth noting the paper says &#34;It is important to note that volunteers in Experiment I (Table S1) were typically sedentary (verified with an objective tracking device), and none of them had a high aerobic cardiorespiratory fitness (determined by treadmill VO2max or the maximal oxygen consumption test).&#34; A common pitfall of exercise science is that almost anything works wonderfully on untrained sedentary subjects. Wait for replication."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Instead of breaking down glycogen, the soleus can use other types of fuels such as blood glucose and fats. Glycogen is normally the predominant type of carbohydrate that fuels muscular exercise.&gt; When the SPU was tested, the whole-body effects on blood chemistry included a 52% improvement in the excursion of blood glucose (sugar) and 60% less insulin requirement over three hours after ingesting a glucose drink.That&#39;s amazing if it is true."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t necessarily agree with the step of putting the code in a separate function; that often works, but just as often makes it so that the code can&#39;t be read top-to-bottom anymore which hurts readability.In this case there&#39;s, I think, a better alternative; the equivalent-ish code in Ruby for the example code here would be something like this:   values = s
      .partition(&#39;?&#39;)[-1]
      .split(&#39;&amp;&#39;)
      .map { |key_value| key_value.partition(&#39;=&#39;)[-1] }

You can write these nice functional pipelines where you just read the code top-to-bottom and see step-by-step what is being done to the data on each line. You don&#39;t have to jump up-and-down around the code when reading it, and you don&#39;t have to keep too much context in your head when reading it.This is one of the reasons why I vastly prefer Ruby over Python for most data processing tasks. I wish more languages would support this style of programming."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Now I know where Rust got some of its syntax from...As an aside, when I see samples like this, it makes me itchy. I hope and assume that they&#39;re being used as made-up snippets just to illustrate a point, and aren&#39;t being lifted from an actual codebase.Because... ugh... isn&#39;t it obvious? Attacker-controlled input such as URLs should never be manipulated with naive string processing! Always use a proper parsing library. Not to mention that complexities of URL encoding, character escapes, etc...The problem is that the author is using abstractions at the wrong level, with or without his fixes. The correct solution would be something like:    var uri = new Uri( &#34;http://foo/demo?test=a&amp;blah=b%20c&#34; );
    var map = System.Web.HttpUtility.ParseQueryString( uri.Query );
    
    Console.Out.WriteLine( &#34;is blah equal to &#39;b c&#39;?\n{0}&#34;, map[&#34;blah&#34;] == &#34;b c&#34; );

The above example is C#, but similar code can be written in any language. It&#39;s simple, direct, and doesn&#39;t violate the &#34;rule of six&#34;. It can be read like English:1. Construct a URI from a given string.2. Parse the query part of the URI into a map.3. Test if the &#39;blah&#39; value in the query is &#34;b c&#34; as expected, with the escaped space decoded properly.The example of how to apply the &#34;MORF&#34; rule in the article still has low-level operations involved, which doesn&#39;t make the code more readable. It doesn&#39;t describe the intent, which is the key thing to writing code that doesn&#39;t need comments every second line."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What the author is missing is that easy to read/reason/understand about is within the context of making a change to the code to fix a bug, add a feature or make some non-functional improvement to it.This is what most of the &#34;easy to read&#34; articles forget.Show me why it is easier to fix a bug, add a feature or make a non-functional improvement to the code with their style than without.For example, if you&#39;ve extracted something into its own function, are you then sharing this function and using it in other places as well? If you then change the body of that function, are you now possibly breaking other parts of the code that relied on its old behavior?If you&#39;ve introduced a local mutable variable in between two lines, are you then mutating that variable prior/later? Is the query_params different at the end of the function then in the middle? Can you safely use it again?How easily can you now introduce new behavior before, in the middle, after, and anywhere in-between?When you modify the behavior to fix a bug, add a feature or make a non-functional improvement, is it an isolated change? How many tests break? Did it require major refactoring to make or very few things had to change? How easy was it to add a test for your new behavior? Was it easy to find the most appropriate place in the code to make the change? Etc.Sure sometimes maybe you just read code for the fun of understanding what it does, but almost always in practice when you&#39;re working on a code base, you only care to understand and reason about the code because you&#39;re looking to deliver that next sprint task that involves changing something about it.I wish more people focused on &#34;easy to change/modify&#34; then simply on &#34;easy to read/understand&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is not a new problem, back in the late 80s I worked for a Mac graphics card developer ... We made some of the first 24bit accelerated graphics cards.Our first was just an existing card with a small daughter card with pals an sram on it, it was so easy that we got our own logos put on many of the chips to put the competition off the scent, we designed that one in days and got it to market in weeks.We immediately started on 2 more designs. The next was all FPGA, it was as big a nubus card as one could build, it pulled too much power, and tilted under it&#39;s own weight out of the bus socket (Mac&#39;s didn&#39;t use screws to hold cards in place, that happened when you closed the chassis). We got it out the door about the point that the competition beat the first board&#39;s performance.The final card was built with custom silicon, designed backwards from &#34;how fast can we possibly make the vrams go if we use all the tricks?&#34;, In this case we essentially bet the company on whether a new ~200 pin plastic packaging technology was viable. This design really soaked the competition.In those days big monitors didn&#39;t work on just any card so if you owned the high end graphics card biz you owned the high end monitor biz too ... The 3 card play above was worth more than $120m"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m surprised this isn&#39;t mentioned here more clearly: Some high end cases like the be quiet silent base I&#39;m using have the option to mount the graphics card vertically, basically parallel to the mainboard, in a separate anchor slot. It needs an additional connector cable (~$20), but other than that is easy to setup, looks better with a look-in case (the illuminated fans face the glass side) and the weight pulls on a special anchor point just for that with no electronics involved. Plus the card itself is more sturdy in that orientation and there is no issues with bending through its own weight. It might even be beneficial ventilation-wise as the graphics card no longer causes a horizontal divide (basically creating separate ventilation-zones on the top and bottom of the card).Yes, the cable will add approximately ~0.3ns of additional latency due to the added 10cm of distance.This is how it looks like:https://www.hardware-journal.de/images/Bilder/2018/test/be-q...https://www.hardware-journal.de/images/Bilder/2018/test/be-q..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Good to hear the reaffirmation from Mozilla that the blocking WebRequest API would be retained. A little over three years ago, Mozilla had promised that it wouldn’t just blindly follow Google on Manifest v3 to the letter. [1]Considering that uBlock Origin works best and can do the most in Firefox with this continuing support, I’m glad Mozilla is still walking the talk on this one.We need at least one browser that makes the web usable, and that might as well be Firefox with uBlock Origin.Edit: Oops.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Seeing this in this context just made me realize that it&#39;s weird to consider them &#34;blockers&#34;, a loaded term. As if we&#39;re starting from some default, correct state, and then blocking part of it. We&#39;ve always been able to choose what content we navigate to. These are content selectors/choosers, which just support our existing ability to choose what content we request and actions we take."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I switched back to Firefox a while ago, and love it. I keep trying to think of how it could be kept afloat once Google stops funding it.IIRC they get $400 million annually. There are 200 million FF users. $2 each wouldn&#39;t be bad... But realistically only 1% of the users would donate and $200 is unpalatable.Maybe another organization picks it up and runs it more efficiently or at a loss for advertising?Or...?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m approaching 50.  Just a scant decade away from being old enough to tap my retirement accounts and have the OPTION to retire.  These next couple of years look like they might not be fun, but overall it looks like I&#39;m actually going to make it.For most of my career, I&#39;ve been told (and I believed) that I would probably get forced out of a hands-on individual contributor role as I aged.  During the late-2000&#39;s, I even had an early midlife crisis and earned a law degree, expecting that I would need to make a career change into IP or something.  That hasn&#39;t been the case.What I think people missed is the compounding effect.  The supply and demand for computer programmers seems to double every decade (maybe the interval is even shorter).  With each doubling, the older cohorts become a smaller and smaller share of the whole.  People look around and think, &#34;There aren&#39;t many older programmers here&#34;, and base predictions off that observation.  However, the more accurate observation would be, &#34;There have been A LOT of younger programmers added here!&#34;.  I don&#39;t believe that it&#39;s actually a zero-sum game, though.I don&#39;t know if this human resources cousin to Moore&#39;s Law will continue indefinitely, but it&#39;s certainly held up through my career.  Even when it inevitably slows down, I think that just means you&#39;ll see the age cohorts balance out more over time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At 64 years I am still going strong.  I consider myself blessed that I have landed a position that allows the to be the leader (I manage a small team) and still be hands on with everything: Architecture, desgin, coding, infrastructure, cloud engineering, DevOps engineer, DBA, the list goes on.  It is a Goldilocks job.  The technologies that we manage and master are miriad. We are a small company and my team owns the entire space.  All my years of knowledge and experience enable me to be coach, mentor, and teacher.  Over the course of my 44 year career I have played every instrument in the band.  I manage with a socratic method which my team enjoys.  Because I have been a life long learner, I have sought out and explored new technologies with eagerness and hunger.  This enables me to lead the team to adopt some of these technologies in usefull and vaulable (to the enterprise) ways.  The team absolutly enjoys learning and applying new and emerging technologies.  I could not have asked for more from what will probably be the last gig of my career. I don&#39;t intend to retire until 70 (assuming I am that lucky - you&#39;ll know what I mean when you get here).  I am having so much fun I wish had 30 more years ahead to enjoy what comes next.  I always like to say: It&#39;s good work if you can get it - not everybody can."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I found I lost interest in vapid work. Programming is still fun, but it&#39;s a big challenge to find a job that is fulfilling.When I was younger, I&#39;d work on whatever. Then everything started sounding like yet another get rich quick company, and is that what I was giving up my life for? Just to move little green pieces of paper around?The most appealing thing I&#39;d seen recently was a company that wrote software to help maximize farm yields. At least there was some real, effective benefit for a great many people.It&#39;s like the goal of the company gradually became more important than the tech or money. And altruistic companies are very rare.But I always really wanted to teach, so that&#39;s what I do now. Pays about 40% of what I&#39;d make in industry, but I get to geek out all day and do work that benefits the world."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Yeah, no. Maybe with old laptops, but newer laptops still have their fair share of issues. When I bought my thinkpad A485 kernels wouldn&#39;t boot without additional parameters, the graphics would freeze at times and cause a hardlock, sleep and hibernation have been fixed and broken again intermittently over several kernel versions, the wifi card&#39;s AP mode started causing segfaults in kernel 5.2 due to the driver&#39;s rewrite but has since been fixed, the fnlock key LED didn&#39;t update properly, which I spent a while debugging and submitted a kernel patch for, and while over the years the fingerprint scanner has been implemented, it&#39;s a pain to install and support for fingerprint scanning in linux is still in a very sorry state. Oh and bluetooth still can&#39;t connect more than one device at a time, so I had to buy a dongle to connect two joycon controllers.Granted, I&#39;ve always had these kinds of issues with new laptops, especially when it came to proprietary nvidia or AMD graphics (before AMDGPU) and I agree it&#39;s improved a lot, but I still need to tell people that there&#39;s caveats with some (especially newer) laptops."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have the reverse...Unless you have a thinkpad or some other popular hardware, you&#39;ll find Linux barely works at all out of the box, and even with hours of fiddling around, you&#39;ll still have to live without some features.For example, power saving features, sleep and hibernate, screen brightness controls, fingerprint readers, keyboard hotkeys and backlights, etc. rarely work.  Prepare for broken external hdmi ports or USB stuck at USB 2.0 speeds.  Have fun with the fan stuck on either max or zero, or the CPU stuck at the lowest clock speed.There are still lots of things you have to go hunting for the right old firmware version for.I think Linux is only great if you have whatever hardware distro developers have, because that will be all that works out of the box."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Every automotive code base I&#39;ve seen has been a dumpster fire. This (mostly) isn&#39;t the fault of the developers and Rust won&#39;t fix it. The business process creates this outcome. No one likes it but little is done to address it.The software development timeline is slaved to the rigid manufacturing timeline. There is no allowance for slippage, so making things work By Any Means Necessary is the rule of the day. Concurrency problems often are not debugged; locks and similar are just sprinkled around until they disappear in testing. It is TDD taken to an extreme -- passing the enumerated tests, technically, is the definition of done even if the code is obviously poor or broken.There are a vast number of software and hardware components sourced from myriad vendors that are swapped out every year to save a few dollars or deal with a supply chain issue. There is no stable baseline but all of these components need to work together. The code has to constantly adapt to the reality that someone sourced parts for a new model year that work differently or are in a different programming language.This code is usually required to be supported for 10+ years. The developers don&#39;t just have this year&#39;s tech stack and code base to deliver on a rigid schedule, they are required to maintain several older implementations concurrently, often built in different languages and architectures.Basically, the automotive industry has failed badly at the transition from being hardware manufacturing companies to being hardware + software manufacturing companies, and try to run their software processes the same way they ran their traditional hardware processes. Choice of programming language is the least of their concerns, that isn&#39;t the source of their code quality issues."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of comments so far are complaining about the software quality in cars now. But what did you expect? This is what happens when you hire the same kinds of people to write the software for your car that you&#39;ve hired for 25 years to write the terrible internal applications inside the company that everyone hates, and in the same terrible way. The end result is going to be exactly the same.Over the years, I&#39;ve seen various discussions brush up against the issue of professional certification. Professional Engineer, in civil engineering, is a serious credential, which can hold people professionally liable for bridges that fail, or buildings that fall over. Making cars a network of computers that all talk to each other, operated entirely &#34;by wire,&#34; and giving up any consideration of mechanical backups (like with a plane) is going to very quickly drive the point home that the programming profession needs a similar credential. As a mechanical engineer who has made a living writing software for 30 years, I understand the difference, but the legal externalities are not going to care that software is VASTLY more complicated than, say, designing a plane wing with a factor of safety.Now, I have to go figure out why my Rails application can no longer restart the delayed_job process on deploy. Is the problem in Rails, Ruby, my gems, Capistrano, permissions, SSH, or some updated package on my Linux VM? Designing a bridge, frankly, is easier, because it&#39;s &#34;concrete&#34; and closed-form. Sure, I&#39;ll figure out my deployment problem, but next month some obscure thing in the 24 layers that make up a simple web app these days is going to get updated, and break something else. At least once a bridge is built, it&#39;s done."</p>

They may blink fine for a awhile but then stops for a period, and then suddenly all missed blinks blinks in a rapid succession. It’s extremely annoying. There are other bugs, like when you are using the auto pilot where it sometimes may suddenly jerk the wheel even though there is nothing wrong with the road. Scares the shit out of you. That has happened thrice now."</p>

The most recent post is by the OP, and reads:&gt; I want to take a moment to recognize that the Homemade Heat Pump Manifesto has gone beyond 2 million page views. I would like to thank Daox and any other people who may have worked behind the scene to make it possible.&gt; My initial goal was to make available the knowledge and possibility that anybody with a few tools and gumption could convert discarded air conditioners, and dehumidifiers into very high efficiency heat ources, or cooling sources. Through the years, we have received reports of success from many people, living in many states, and countries.&gt; Another goal was to make zero money from this project, to give it away and to encourage others to take it, share it, sell it.&gt; In the beginning I thought that maybe 200 people would find this interesting. Obviously, I was wrong, gloriously wrong."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"One note of caution, he describes removing the lath and plaster and inserting eps insulation. It didn’t mention if he did this, he might have done, but it’s important to have a continuous taped vapour barrier on the warm side of the insulation to prevent water vapour from passing through, condensing on the timber structure and causing it to rot. Also ventilate the cold side of the insulation or a least have a gap to form a capillary break with the cold outside wall. I’ve seen a few badly done insulation jobs in timber buildings that have needed floor joists and studs cut out and replaced. It only takes about 15-20 years."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Removing all uses of undefined behaviour is probably a fool&#39;s errand, as it would require significant changes throughout the code that would take time and come with a performance impact, all for no immediate practical benefit. So I just hunted down the undefined behaviour cases that actually broke determinism. This was easy enough, as we have plenty of tools we use to test determinism. By comparing the game state CRC for every tick of every test (we have 2,417 tests) between x86 and ARM, I believe I got a pretty good coverage of potential issues.Holy hell."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; &#34;This is the first time we had to make sure the game is deterministic between ARM and x86. We should be fine, C++ is portable, right?

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I saw one of these at a job when I graduated undergrad. I had an over the phone interview with a consulting company, Revature specifically. I can&#39;t even remember if I applied to them or not (since I applied to so many). After what was a 10 trivia question type interview they decided to &#34;give me an offer!&#34;. It was a contract $50k a year, for two years with a $20k &#34;training fee&#34; that was fully repayable if you leave before 2 years. I obviously declined it because that is a ludicrously low salary for a software developer in the US, and also it was an insane &#34;training fee&#34;. So I presume, their business model is desperate people for jobs, &#34;train&#34; them, then keep them in indentured servitude. They also tried to hard sell a job which is obviously gross."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is debt peonage. The trouble is, the US law against peonage was not drafted tightly enough.&#34;The holding of any person to service or labor under the system known as peonage is abolished and forever prohibited in any Territory or State of the United States; and all acts, laws, resolutions, orders, regulations, or usages of any Territory or State, which have heretofore established, maintained, or enforced, or by virtue of which any attempt shall hereafter be made to establish, maintain, or enforce, directly or indirectly, the voluntary or involuntary service or labor of any persons as peons, in liquidation of any debt or obligation, or otherwise, are declared null and void.&#34;[1]As you can see, the reference is to &#34;the system known as peonage&#34;. So, new, innovative means of accomplishing the same result may or may not be covered. So far, cases involving training repayment agreements do not seem to have taken the peonage route.[2]The PetSmart case in California makes several arguments. One is that PetSmart is illegally operating an unlicensed educational institution. The &#34;California Education Code provides that “a note, instrument, or other evidence of indebtedness relating to payment for an educational program is not enforceable by an institution unless, at the time of execution . . . the institution held an approval to operate.” (Cal. Educ. Code § 94917&#34;) There are other specific California labor laws probably being violated here.
This case is just starting in San Mateo County Superior Court. Scheduling hearing in November.But that won&#39;t help in other states with weaker labor laws.[1] https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1994[2] https://towardsjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/PetSma..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t think it should be legal to charge employees for training in any form. Either provide it for free, or don&#39;t provide it at all. What possible purpose does putting yourself in the middle as both the lender and beneficiary have other than to fascilitate abuse?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Reminds me of a passion project I started in high school that went completely viral and took on a life of its own. Wrote a small script for my friends to check their AP scores a few days early. Required high schoolers giving clear text access to their entire CollegeBoard account so I could log on and scrape their scores. Somehow it got posted to Reddit and from that year on, grew wildly. Got to almost 2 million students checking their score in its peak year. It was immensely fun while it lasted (ran for about 7 years) and honestly I miss the thrill of it. CollegeBoard now releases all scores on the same day so the site is pretty much useless now. Definitely always looking to chase the thrill of that score release day again though.Congrats on a successful end to a fun high school project! Stories like this are always fun to read."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Epic stuff, and I think this experience may well be more valuable than the homework you avoided. Basically you did harder homework in order to avoid easier homework.The problem is letting other people use it; of course it&#39;s nice to help people, and it&#39;s altruistic to do so for free, but some of those people might actually need this homework to learn, and you may have deprived them of that. (Although I also think watching a video and doing some multiple choice questions is the laziest low-effort homework assignment there is, and the damage may not have been all that big.) But you used logic and programming to work around a math problem, which are roughly in the same field, so I think that&#39;s fair.A slightly similar situation: my previous job was at a bank, and banks over here are bound by all sorts of ethics and rules, and are required to regularly train all their employees in balancing the interests of customers, society, and the bank. This bank did that by gamifying it: we had an app where we had to answer all sorts of ethical questions and make sure our score in the app was over 70% at the end of every month.A coworker used our testing framework to access the app, answer questions randomly like you did, and store the correct answer to use next time. It apparently worked very well, but using tech to avoid ethics questions is quite a different issue than yours. (He shared it with me when he left, and I tried it, but it didn&#39;t work for me.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I was in university, I scraped an internal job postings site for students to find internships. The site was terrible- each job description would load in a pop-up window controlled by Javascript, and loading a second description would override the first. It was also really slow and had limited filtering. My version could load job descriptions in new tabs, presented the table on a single page, and you could mark jobs that you weren&#39;t interested in or had already applied to.The university didn&#39;t take kindly to that. They accused me of trying to take down the co-op system and threatened to sue me for copyright infringement. Since I linked into their system for job descriptions, I was able to show that the data I actually had (company, title, location) wasn&#39;t creative work and therefore not copyrightable. I also had some friends in the university faculty and staff who spoke up for me, since I had reported security vulnerabilities in the past, indicating that I wasn&#39;t acting with malicious intent. In the end, I just had to take a business ethics course, which I probably would have taken anyway."</p>

Still very thankful that SolveSpace exists.The Scala 3 compiler and the VSCode plugin for v3. Absolutely love the language and the experience is so much better than with IntelliJ, haven&#39;t had as much fun writing code in ages.This will be a bit controversial, but Kubernetes, because if people use it via GKE, EKS etc. then I won&#39;t have to learn their organically grown solution to the same dozen-or-so operations problems, and I have yet to see one that isn&#39;t a hot mess in some way or other. Also anything running on top of Kubernetes won&#39;t be built the very old-fashioned vi-edits-on-server way, great for sanity.Various modern messenger apps (Telegram, Whatsapp, Instagram&#39;s direct messages, ...) because I would hear a lot less from some highly cherished and very non-technical people in my life without these incredibly slick and fun and convenient apps. As one who&#39;s old enough to remember being dependent on landlines and payphones and letters, this still feels like a miracle."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The sounds probably aren&#39;t a prank or a recording of a human at all. I am guessing it is just a resonant frequency of a standard part being picked up as a feedback loop due to some component which was recently exposed after a change in maintenance protocols. (or something similarly mundane) I have heard all sorts of ghoulish sounds picked up while tinkering with RF and old microchips. Our brains tend to anthropomorphize such sounds when we have never experienced them before. Going straight to the wildest explanations like &#34;hacking&#34; or &#34;ghosts&#34; is fun for our brains but further reinforces the inaccurate picture we had painted for ourselves initially."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"They&#39;re right, recently I&#39;ve installed some Windows update for my parents and I had to reject like 5 suggested changes - installing Office trial, switching default browser to Edge yet again, and more.But this goes way beyond the browsers - I&#39;ve never explicitly installed Keychain on my iphone and yet it shows as an option next to 1password every time I fill in a password field. Google calendar asks me to install an app every time I open a web version on my phone, my work laptop has 1 active notification in system settings for a year because I didn&#39;t enable iCloud backup.I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s the solution here. I stick to the apps I use because I know what I&#39;m doing, but so many users will just click &#34;yes&#34; when shown a pop-up. On the other hand, the built-in integrations provide value (e.g. it&#39;s better that people use and save random passwords in Keychain than using the same one everywhere). I feel it&#39;s always a cat-and-mouse game where the big tech is punished after they&#39;ve already gained a lot, so they win anyway."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Without commenting on the claims, it&#39;s interesting to consider how times have changed. Microsoft originally lost an antitrust lawsuit [1] over little more than tying Internet Explorer into their OS and not readily including alternatives. They not only lost that case, but the initial judgement was that the company was to be broken up.Microsoft started spending dramatically more money on &#34;lobbying&#34; following that.[1] - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft_Cor...."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the next frontiers as a barrier to browser switching will be &#34;software&#34;-backed WebAuthn/FIDO2/&#34;passkeys&#34;.If you look at the APIs available on MacOS/iOS at present [0], and how WebAuthn works, you need to &#34;trust&#34; the client-side software to correctly identify the site origin (i.e. protocol, domain, port) and pass it to a physical security key. In the case of a software token, you need to restrict which app(s) can pass this information through to the system carrying out authentication.The end result right now, as I can see it, is that if you sign up to a website using a &#34;passkey&#34; via Safari (for example), there is no real supported workflow that isn&#39;t site-specific, for migrating to a new browser - you are effectively beholden to Apple&#39;s keychain for getting you back into that site.If you want to enrol a new device (say an Android phone using its own software implementation of WebAuthn), you would need to find a way to sign into your old account (which requires your MacOS/iOS passkey to log in), then enrol your Android device (which is a separate physical device). You&#39;ll likely get stuck here.An expert user could add a physical FIDO2 token to their account from the old device (Safari), and use that as the authenticator to log in on the new device, but this is significant friction for a non-technical user.While moving users away from passwords might make sense, I do think we&#39;ll see these &#34;passwordless&#34; authentication mechanisms become the next major point of friction in user browser choice. Even if you can implement WebAuthn in your rival browser, unless you get access to the system key store, you won&#39;t be able to let users sign in. That will prevent them switching.[0] https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/supporting-a..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think you partly may just be biased by happening to notice ads more if they fit the topic you sent to your wife or being lenient in deciding if ads meet the categorization. And if you dwell on an ad because it seems to match, you may get more similar ads.Here is how I think you could design a more robust (but less fun) experiment:- Come up with a bunch of topics, write them down on slips of paper, put the paper into a hat- Each Monday, draw three topics from the hat, send some WhatsApp messages about the first, Messenger messages about the second, and don’t discuss the third. Don’t put the topics back in the hat.- If you see any ads relating to one of the topics, screenshot them and save screenshots to eg your computer with a bit of the topic- Separately, record which topic went to which platform- After doing this for a while, go through the screenshots and (each of you and your wife or ideally other people) give a rating for how well the ad matches the topic. To avoid bias, you shouldn’t know which app saw the topic.- Now work out average ratings / the distribution across the three products (WhatsApp vs Messenger vs none) and compare"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"(wrt some comments in this thread)Is it so hard to believe that Meta is snooping on WhatsApp conversations? Meta, a company of unprecedented size that was built over monetizing your private data? A company who&#39;s been caught in plenty of scandals (like Cambridge Analytic) about this exact sort of thing (violating their users&#39; privacy)?Someone from this community, which generally means educated, tech-literate and sensitive to these topics shares a perfectly plausible observation, of something that has been experienced as well by plenty of other folks, me included; and then some people come and try to make up the most convoluted explanations (candy boxes from Kazakhstan just happened to be trending that specific day, nothing to see here, move along!) to this phenomena and try to shift the blame away from Meta. Why do you do this? Are you Meta employees? A PR agency they hired?It&#39;s just baffling. Apparently some people DO want to be abused.Plot twist: we all get ads about candy boxes from KZ now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who has actually worked on end to end encryption at Meta, I can tell you I am not aware of anything where the company reads your WhatsApp messages - either in transit or device. The company takes fairly serious measures to ensure it cannot even accidentally infer such contents.I don&#39;t know what is happening in this specific case. Perhaps the ads came from some other similar search queries. Perhaps they came from the keyboard intercepting what was typed. Or perhaps something else that I can&#39;t think of. But I&#39;m nearly certain it did not come from meta intercepting the contents of your messages.It&#39;s hard to convince people at this point because many have lost trust in Meta as a company, and I understand that. But I still find it stunning that so many people are making so many false claims without any actual knowledge to back it up."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m really happy that Gorhill has listened to feedback on the branding and explanation of this, and added back in the ability to &#34;opt in&#34; to extended permissions on individual sites. Thank you for your work, and I&#39;m sorry if my comments in the preview HN thread came off as overly hostile, because given the original comments you made about MV3, I couldn&#39;t imagine this sort of outcome. I hope that you or someone else still works to release an MV3-compatible &#34;Full site permissions&#34; version of uBlock as well, since I think there are a lot of potential options for improvement by using declarativeNetRequestFeedback, and it&#39;s certainly more convenient to not have to opt-in. And I&#39;m still worried that without an MV3-compatible version of full uBlock Origin, users are still going to assume that &#34;MV3 means that ad blockers are broken&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"How is everyone else&#39;s MV3 upgrade going?I have 3 extensions and each one has multiple feature-breaking changes that will take hundreds of hours to implement less than ideal work arounds.  I guess I&#39;ll focus on SnipCSS (https://www.snipcss.com) because that&#39;s the only one I have paying customers.For people who do manage the upgrade, at least we can look forward to less competition in the Chrome Web Store?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Yes, I understand why Apple doesn&#39;t pull FB/IG/WA/Uber/etc but as a smaller developer it&#39;s incredibly frustrating to have the full rules applied to me but not the big players.A week or two ago I had to fight with app review over some functionality that was behind a login screen (they thought it should be public, I disagreed) and for my pre-permission-request screens (you know, the screen almost every app shows before firing the system prompt). Turns out you can have that screen but you can&#39;t ask a question on that screen or offer a way to dismiss and not get the system dialog. That was news to me since I had seen countless &#34;Do you want to enable push notifications (yes|no)?&#34; screens in top apps but that rule has changed and no longer allows you to pre-ask. I complied but the very next day I opened an app from a billion dollar company and I got a pre-ask that I was able to dismiss without popping the system dialog. wtf...Why am I expected to bend over backwards for app review when these serial abusers get a free pass (no ban AND they can do things smaller apps get slapped down for)?I know the answer is &#34;money&#34; but I fucking hate it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A little while back I recall some pundit describing Facebook as believing that this kind of data was theirs. Not “theirs for the taking”, but literally if they could find a way to obtain it, they considered it their right to have it. Like it was baked into the culture of the company. The more I read about Facebook’s practices, the more it rings true."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If an app needs a webview, it should always strive to open that view in an embedded Safari webview (called an SFSafariViewController) or link to the view in the user&#39;s own choice of browser. 
The app is prevented from seeing ‘inside’ this view.Sometimes an app needs to control some aspect of the external view - for instance listen to some Js event, or inject authorization - and this can be for totally legitimate reasons in the flow of the app. Then the application needs to use another type of embedded webview called a WKWebView, which by definition allows the app to see into the user&#39;s interactions in the embedded browser.Most developers and apps use these for totally necessary reasons - but Facebook is deviously abusing this functionality.Some of the posters in this thread are blaming Apple for Facebook&#39;s evil behavior, but a lot of totally legitimate functionality that needs this type of app/browser communication would be impossible without the ability to enable it for genuine and well-founded reasons."</p>

Given it exists, IT will make everyone use it on Microsoft&#39;s behalf regardless of how bad it is.Or another way to look at it is that the real customers for Teams are IT departments. It makes their lives easier because they don&#39;t have to do anything and it meets all the compliance requirements they are supposed to enforce.Which in turn reflects that the real customers of IT are regulators and auditors.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Long ago Microsoft had MSN Messenger, which was one of the leading messaging apps. It worked well, and many &#39;normal&#39; users were using it. Then Microsoft dissolved the team behind it and screwed up the product so bad with bloatware and ads that everyone moved to WhatsApp (except in the US where people went back to texting).Then Microsoft came out with Communicator, renamed it to Lync, which was a corporate messenger/meeting software. It used its own server, that could federate outside. It worked very well. They added LiveMeeting as a separate app for meetings, built on the same protocols. Our company used it with the &#34;roundtable&#34; camera from 2008, and it all worked amazingly well. We had meetings with people joining in from home and other offices over the internet using inexpensive webcams, 15 years ago.Then they bought Skype and it went downhill from there. I don&#39;t know what happened, but they took a lot of time integrating technologies from Skype (peer-to-peer) with their own tech (which was more telecom/server based) and tried competing with ever-changing perceived competitors by copying parts of their features and UI, without ever making any feature really good. They integrated everything into a single program, Skype for Business, now renamed Teams, and made it bloated and obnoxious. Just try to get it to not start at login... It&#39;s like MSN all over again.I think the Communicator/LiveMeeting software combo they had 15 years ago would still (conceptually) do pretty well as messenger/meeting software now, when modernized. It was much less intrusive and behaved like nice software that you actually wanted to use."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My 2 cents of venting on this sorry excuse of software- Backtick formatting in a chat post only works after typing the closing backtick, deleting it, re-typing it- Text copied from a conversation is polluted with names and time stamps. &#34;I really want this feature&#34; said nobody ever- The mute/unmute button is hard to find, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever attended a Teams meeting without someone struggling with this. Teams should change its name to &#34;You&#39;re on mute&#34;- Multiple windows, I never know which is the &#39;main&#39; window, which is the meeting window, where are they, which has focus- Too hard to know which chat you&#39;re replying to, who is in it- Updates in chats are not consistently acknowledged, you have to change focus, and back again. Even then the &#34;Activity&#34; tab still shows unread items that I have read- Random crashing- Random communication freezes, everyone else is chatting, I don&#39;t see any updates nor notification of any problems until I restart the app- &#34;Reply&#34; is sometimes in the chat context menu, sometimes not.- Media handling is inconsistent, sometimes I can&#39;t paste photos, sometimes I can- The size of the text chat column in a meeting cannot be changed and is very narrow, forcing you to find the same chat in the &#39;main&#39; window"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A summary of the original findings by the European Commission (1):&#34;By decision of 18 July 2018, the Commission fined Google for having abused its dominant position by imposing anticompetitive contractual restrictions on manufacturers of mobile devices and on mobile network operators, in some cases since 1 January 2011. Three types of restriction were identified:1. those contained in ‘distribution agreements’, requiring manufacturers of mobile devices to pre-install the general search (Google Search) and (Chrome) browser apps in order to be able to obtain a licence from Google to use its app store (Play Store);2. those contained in ‘anti-fragmentation agreements’, under which the operating licences necessary for the pre-installation of the Google Search and Play Store apps could be obtained by mobile device manufacturers only if they undertook not to sell devices running versions of the Android operating system not approved by Google;3. those contained in ‘revenue share agreements’, under which the grant of a share of Google’s advertising revenue to the manufacturers of mobile devices and the mobile network operators concerned was subject to their undertaking not to pre-install a competing general search service on a predefined portfolio of devices.&#34;1: https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/p1_3862705/en/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Cool. The EU does have its [many!] faults. But they have a pretty good track record when it comes to consumer rights and consumer choice. Next up I&#39;d like to see them do the same for the plethora of incompatible cordless power-tool systems out there as they did with insisting all mobile phones standardise on a USB connector."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The fallout from this should be interesting. This fine is a substantial part (roughly 25%!) of Google&#39;s overall revenue from the EMEA region (Europe, Middle East, Africa), of which the EU is probably like 90%, at least, of the total, so it&#39;s probably toing the line of actually making the EU unprofitable to Google considering the costs of future compliance to avoid being fined again. Worse: this was not as steep as the fine could have been, they could&#39;ve fined them about double this amount under current regulations, but chose not to. Probably because that would have pushed Google&#39;s EU operations into the red for sure and made the decision easy for them.To be sure the company won&#39;t be in trouble financially, their global revenue can cover the fine, but that doesn&#39;t stop the EU from potentially being a net loss for the company going forward. Abandoning the EU would be a drastic step, though. It&#39;s going to be interesting to see how they adapt to this. Another fine on this scale and I think they will pull out."</p>

Seems like we&#39;ve been building toward this, the interactivity of the internet was the paradigm shift (to use a 90&#39;s term). EDIT: I realize it isn&#39;t news messing with youths&#39; self-esteem (well, in some cases it is), but it is related in that the media is custom-made to drive engagement at all costs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As with all studies in the social sciences, one of two principles apply.First, if the conclusions are counterintuitive or unexpected, then when you look closer, you will find that the methodology is garbage and that it does not support the conclusions given.Second, if the conclusions reflect things that you believe are true, when you look closer, you will find that the methodology is garbage and that it does not support the conclusions given."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I took a long break (maybe 5 years or so) but I have recently started using both FB and Instagram and have been surprised at how positive my time has been on these platforms. On FB I have been finding interesting local groups and events (just moved to a new city) and on Instagram, I have been enjoying seeing updates from real friends.On the other hand I recently deleted Twitter from my phone. I love twitter for getting interesting infromation and staying up to date with news, but the whole culture there has just turned into cheap dunking on one another, and its just guaranteed to leave you feeling angry about something. Extremely disruptive to mental state.I spend some time on the TikTok-like products as well (youtube shorts / fb reels) and have found them to be just a really easy way to completely waste an hour for no reason whatsoever. Less disruptive to mental state than twitter though."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I hate all these click-bait articles. Losing weight is simple, it&#39;s just CICO. Calories In, Crust of the earth OutEdit: I feel like a lot of people are arguing about something that should be considered totally uncontroversial, basic physics. Before you get all worked up over this, please look up Yuri Gagarin. His weight loss journey absolutely proved that it is possible to lose 100% of your body weight through simple orbital mechanics and hundreds of people have followed in his footsteps and experienced similar results. There is not room for debate, this is a proven weight loss method and what the I&#39;m suggesting is essentially a very similar thing, but one that could help a lot more people at once."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Kind of a meta comment, it&#39;s always interesting to see / hear that when a somewhat well-known author writes a new book, you see interviews with them cropping up on &#34;all the usual&#34; places, other outlets write about it etc.It&#39;s nice with something like &#34;What if? 2&#34;, because Randall is an interesting podcast guest, and there are just so many different things to talk about.It&#39;s a bit more annoying in other cases, where within two month you hear the same author on 5 different podcasts, and the author says the same thing on each of them. Time to use the skip button.I guess that&#39;s simply how it works nowadays in publishing: writing the book is work, but then you also need to spend quite some time promoting it, in the hopes not only that it boosts sales, but also that the boosted sales put the book in some bestseller lists, boosting sales even further."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m glad to hear there&#39;s a follow up book to What If? (How To was also good, of course) – it&#39;s one of the more entertaining, yet educational, audiobooks I&#39;ve listened to (and it really does work well in audio form unlike much non-fiction, plus Wil Wheaton is the narrator)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is amazing. It&#39;s truly bizarre that 5.1 surround sound, or HDR, or spatial audio, would be proprietary paid formats -- I mean, what if someone told you there was a license for stereo audio?And sure it&#39;s in Google&#39;s self-interest so that they can bring these technologies to YouTube without paying anyone else. But it benefits everybody, so this is really fantastic news for everyone if it&#39;s something that takes off."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We are seeing a deeper and deeper split between Google (webm/VP9, webp, AV1, strongly pushing their formats) and Apple (HEVC, HEIC, Atmos, completely boycotting Google&#39;s formats), with Microsoft caught in the middle, supporting neither that well.Apple&#39;s stance is especially interesting because it&#39;s unclear to me what they gain by pushing license fee encumbered formats."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is already an open media format (edit: for object-based immersive audio), it&#39;s called SMPTE 2098. Granted it&#39;s basically the mutant stepchild of DTS and Dolby ATMOS, but it does exist.The real problem isn&#39;t the hardware manufacturers but the content producers. Dolby engages in blatant anticompetitive behavior that basically requires hardware manufacturers to support their codecs and make it impossible to innovate on the actual media formats in a way that might compete. For example: paying for content to be released in atmos or giving away the tools to author it for free."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It was deeply disturbing to me that throughout the COVID epidemic many highly credentialed doctors and researchers were getting de-platformed for anything that remotely questioned the government&#39;s position on anything related to COVID.Science is about asking questions, testing hypotheses and independent research corroboration.  There have to be checks and balances.I expect the chilling effect from this experience will remain in the scientific community for a long time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To me the core of this issue is that sometimes government officials truly believe their missions are more important than free speech. They may think that their job is actually to suppress free speech unfortunately.Especially common is for national security to override free speech in the minds of government officials. They can easily convince themselves that they need to suppress certain viewpoints in order to save many lives. It just coincidentally also saves their own jobs.I think unfortunately that young people would prefer less free speech and for the government to enforce more confirming perspectives.One other core issue for people who want the tech companies to stop listening to government to consider is the fact that the government has police, guns, prisons, and legal sanctions available to enforce it&#39;s policy decisions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The central issue in these cases are the difference between the following two scenarios:1. The CDC or other government agency says &#34;We believe X is misinformation, do with that advice what you will&#34;.2. The CDC or other government agency says &#34;We believe X is misinformation, and if you don&#39;t act on that, we will penalize you in some way&#34;.The former is perfectly legitimate, and exactly what e.g. public health agencies ought to be doing: offering opinions and advice to the private sector and public. The latter is a first amendment violation.Presumably, some of these cases will also turn on whether there was an implicit regulatory threat in the &#34;recommendations&#34; given. In some cases, according to this article, the threats seem to have been fairly explicit."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article highlights that the easiest way for these companies to let go of staff right now is to dissolve entire teams. I&#39;ve heard from friends that work at these companies that recent hiring freezes have actually made managers more hesitant to fire low performers because anyone they fire can&#39;t be replaced and they&#39;d rather have a low performer than no one at all. The team dissolving process seems to sidestep this management hesitation to fire."</p>

Both look pretty strong, so I am not sure how cuts are justified or why Zuckerberg has a negative outlook, especially since 2021 was such a great year for both.Do American executives, investors, and start up owners not have the guts for even a moderate stock price drop? I guess the reaction is to cut staff, or threaten to, when there is a whiff of negativity. Fuckin weak."</p>

Although there exists some off the shelf underwater lidar solutions https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YevvMcc6Zu4 and underwater drones, it&#39;s likely to be too turbulent (and with air bubble) for them to stay in place at a known position to work properly out of the box (but maybe not because it seems to be possible to scuba dive the strid https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUamSryCUK4)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Neat, https://github.com/openai/whisper - they have open-sourced it, even the model weights, so they are living up to their name in this instance.The 4 examples are stunningly good (the examples have speakers with heavy accents, speaking in foreign language, speaking with dynamic background noise, etc.), this is far and away better than anything else I&#39;ve seen. Will be super curious to see other folks trying it out and seeing if it&#39;s as robust as it seems, including when confronted with audio speech with natural tics and uhhh&#39;s and uhmm&#39;s and everything in-between.I think it&#39;s fair to say that AI-transcription accuracy is now decidedly superior to the average human&#39;s, what the implications of this are I&#39;m not sure."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is distributed SQLite 3, running (I assume at least partially managed?) LiteFS[5] for you. Which is pretty cool!What I&#39;d like to have seen is how this compares to things like rqlite[1] or Cloudflare&#39;s D1[2] addressed directly in the articleThat said, I think this is pretty good for things like read replica&#39;s. I know the sales pitch here is as a full database, and I don&#39;t disagree with it, and if I was starting from scratch today and could use this, I totally would give it a try and benchmark / test accordingly, however I can&#39;t speak to that use case directly.What I find however and what I can speak to, is that most workloads already have database of some kind setup, typically not SQLite as their main database (MySQL or PostgreSQL seem most common). This is a great way to make very - insanely, really - fast read replica&#39;s across regions of your data. You can use an independent raft[3][4] implementation to do this on write. If your database supports it, you can even trigger a replication directly from a write to the database itself (I think Aurora has this ability, and I think - don&#39;t quote me! - PostgreSQL can do this natively via an extension to kick off a background job)To that point, in my experience one thing SQLite is actually really good at is storing JSON blobs. I have successfully used it for replicating JSON representations of read only data in the past to great success, cutting down on read times significantly for APIs as the data is &#34;pre-baked&#34; and the lightweight nature of SQLite allows you to - if you wanted to naively do this - just spawn a new database for each customer and transform their data accordingly ahead of time. Its like AOT compilation for your data.if you want to avoid some complexity with sharding (you can&#39;t always avoid it outright, but this can help cap its complexity) this approach helps enormously in my experience. Do try before you buy!EDIT: Looks like its running LiteFS[5] not LiteStream[0]. This is my error of understanding.[0]: https://litestream.io/[1]: https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite[2]: https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-d1/[3]: https://raft.github.io/[4]: https://raft.github.io/#implementations[5]: https://github.com/superfly/litefs"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is really cool! Unfortunately i primarily am interested in offline databases so perhaps i&#39;m just not the target audience. However i have to ask, on that note, does this have any application in the offline space?Ie i wonder if there&#39;s a way to can write your applications such that they have less/minimal contention, and then allow the databases to merge when back online? Of course, what happens when there inevitably _is_ contention? etcNot sure that idea would have a benefit over many SQLite DBs with userland schemas mirroring CRDT principles though. But a boy can dream.Regardless, very cool work being done here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Developing against a relational database requires devs to watch out for &#34;N+1&#34; query patterns, where a query leads to a loop that leads to more queries. N+1 queries against Postgres and MySQL can be lethal to performance. Not so much for SQLite.This is misleading AFAICT. The article(s) is actually comparing remote RDBMS to local RDBMS, not Postgres to SQLite.Postgres can also be served over a UNIX socket, removing the individual query overhead due to TCP roundtrip.SQLite is a great technology, but keep in mind that you can also deploy Postgres right next to your app as well. If your app is something like a company backend that could evolve a lot and benefit from Postgres&#39;s advanced features, this may be the right choice."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I hesitated posting this, because I don&#39;t want to be too negative, but: ugh.  ChromeOS is just more Google adware/tracking-ware, locking people into the Google ecosystem, and (by default, at least) creating a more locked-down environment than a general-purpose OS would have (not quite iOS or even Android, but still not with the flexibility of a &#34;mainstream&#34; OS).  I feel like Framework could be spending their time doing much better things.  Granted, if they believe that this will be a big boost to their bottom line / margins / sustainability, then I&#39;m in favor of it on the grounds of helping make sure Framework is a successful company.My hope was that this is just running on the standard Framework laptop hardware, but it looks like it required a bit of a mainboard redesign, as well as a different input cover and keyboard.  Extra hardware like that just makes their offering more difficult for a customer to navigate and understand, not to mention the added support and manufacturing burden on the company&#39;s side."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a couple HP Chromebook 13 G1 laptops that I loved quite a lot for ~5 years as my primary personal laptop.  It worked really well for 95% of my needs, especially once it got the Linux container support (which was ~4 years in).The first one I got was $550 for the 8GB RAM model with i5 and &#34;retina&#34; screen, that was a refurb from Woot, almost half off.  The second one I got around a year ago when Linux container support landed, 16GB RAM, i7, &#34;retina&#34; screen.  That one I got off ebay for $120 landed.  I also got my son one that he used until a few days ago.  Pretty decent little machine for that price.My son switched to a $120 Windows ASUS laptop this past weekend because the Chromebook wouldn&#39;t run Windows games.  I was half expecting him to give up on the new laptop because 4GB isn&#39;t much RAM, but he says it works great.My mother in law was recently asking for laptop advice for a &#34;ward of the court&#34; she oversees that could do with a laptop to do zoom meetings for the court appearances, and to use for school.  I went looking for Chromebooks and found: they are all priced the same as a similarly speced Windows laptop.  The things I value about ChromeOS (&#34;instant&#34; updates, &#34;nothing really on the device&#34;, &#34;security&#34;) aren&#39;t things the average person (let alone teen) really care about...  Kind of hard to recommend a Chromebook for the average person these days, unless I&#39;m missing something."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A little historical tangent:Tomorrow (23rd) marks the 176th anniversary  of the discovery of Neptune (~ 1.07 years on Neptune; 164.8 Earth years).Johann Gottfried Galle an astronomer at the Berlin observatory found Neptune at the behest of Urbain Le Verrier who calculated its position by hypothesizing that some body must perturb Uranus orbit to explain the distinct deviation from the predicted motion by Newton&#39;s law of universal gravitation.Le Verrier couldn&#39;t find a single French astronomer willing to take a look out at the sky after presenting his extensive calculations to the French Academy on 31 August. On 18 September he then wrote a letter to the German astronomer Galle at the Berlin observatory.After receiving the letter 5 days later Galle immediately set up his telescope the same night and found a +8 mag star (within 1 degree of the Le Verrier&#39;s calculation) not listed on the official Prussian star chart. The next night he managed to measure the star itself moving by 4 arcseconds, finally confirming Le Verrier prediction of a new planet (and to this day last).At ~30 AU (30x the distance sun-earth; Uranus being at ~20 AU) the discovery instantaneously made the solar system 1.5x bigger ;)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow! If anyone is curious as to why Triton is so bright...&gt; Covered in a frozen sheen of condensed nitrogen, Triton reflects an average of 70 percent of the sunlight that hits it. It far outshines Neptune in this image because the planet’s atmosphere is darkened by methane absorption at these near-infrared wavelengths.That&#39;s pretty neat!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For a second I thought this was Saturn and said “don’t we have better images of this?” Then I actually read it’s Neptune and realized all our good images of it come from probes. It’s crazy JWST can just see the rings and the moons, incredible observatory."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting to see the amount of negative comments.Most of the negativity seems to come from the following points:- EU-funded project cannot succeed in tech because previous EU-funded projects have failed in tech in the past (and generally government-funded project in tech are suspicious)- Search is hard, and therefore it will fail- The project is underfundedEven if the points above can all be valid (though the obvious US-funded startup launched by a bunch of uni students seemed to have fared pretty well) it seems we are missing the point of this project.The proposal is to contribute to the creation of open building blocks necessary to enable others (including private US companies) to make better search products.Better search product are needed.Shall we remember HN of some of the intense conversations that happened here about Google failing us:- Google Search is Dying [1]- Every Google result now looks like an ad [2]- Google no longer producing high quality search results in significant categories [3]So while, yes search is a hard topic, we should welcome initiatives aiming at improving the ground infrastructure needed to lower the barrier to entry on this subject and hope it will allow many companies to build better search products (or inspire other initiatives to contribute in similar and even more successful way)1: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=303477192: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=221078233: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29772136"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have written this before but I’ll put it here again. What I would like to see is a federated search engine. Based on activitypub that works like mastodon. Don’t like the results from one source? Just remove them from your sources, or lower their ranking. Similar to yacy but you can work with the protocol to connect or build whatever type of index you want using whatever technology you like, and communicate over an existing standard. Want to build the worlds best index of Pokémon sites, then go do it. Want to build a search engine using idris or ats? Sure! I did note the professors are on mastodon so perhaps this may actually happen.One of these days I’ll actually implement the above assuming nobody else does. I figured if I can at least get the basics done and a reference implementation that’s easy to run it could prove the concept. If anyone is interested in this do email my in my bio.What I worry about for this project is that it becomes another island which prohibits remixing of results like google and bing, and its own index and ranking algorithms become gamed.I wish the creators best of luck though. I am also hoping for some more blogs and papers about the internals of he engine. So little information is published in the space that anything is welcome, especially if it’s deeply technical."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Seriously... I really wanted to like this project, but it seems everything EU touches as of recently gets worse.From the webpafe that half of the time shows &#34;Resource Limit exceeded&#34; to a technology stack diagram on the bottom of this page https://openwebsearch.eu/the-project/ being completely unreadable due to bad scaling.It is very disappointing really. Another example from the top of my head. Here in Poland we have ID cards(as every other EU country) . Those ID cards have to be renewed every now and then (10~15years). In last years an online system for government services was implemented  including for renewal of those cards. One could take a photo with a mobile phone, submit an application and pick up a card from a gov office in few weeks time. Unfortunately, EU made a law that ID cards applications have to be acommpanied by biometrics (fingerprints) so this system has been thrown away. One has to physically go to the gov office, scan their fingerprints, apply for a new id card and then go again to pick it up...Ok, so what happens in 10 years time? They should have the fingerprints already, right? No. They take the fingerprints, they store them only until one picks up the id card and then they are deleted. There are no fingerprint database, they are not stored anywhere. The fingerprints are used only to ensure the same person that submitted the application picks up the document. It makes zero sense, other than to break the previous online system. Thanks EU."</p>

  (&#34;Plaintiffs remain open to considering an alternate proposal ... but
  cannot do without some indications of what the B/T Defendants intend to

  opportunities to make sample productions of the financial records RFPs,
  but have failed to do so despite Plaintiffs&#39; agreement to such proposal
  (id., Ex. 1 at 5). Plaintiffs plainly explain why they need this
  information: to assess the backing of USDT with US dollars, and to
  allow a forensic accountant to assess the USDT reserve...

  transactions &#34;were strategically timed to inflate the market.&#34;...

Just like RTX Voice and other gimmick &#34;exclusives&#34; I expect it to be available to older cards the moment they realize their backlog of 30 series cards aren&#39;t clearing as quickly as they thought.They&#39;re competing against an over-bloated secondhand market, AMD, Intel, much better integrated GPUs, and comparatively cheaper consoles that maintain sky-high demand with subsidized games via new subscription programs. They&#39;re vastly overestimating their brand loyalty (think Microsoft v Sony after the 360) and EVGA&#39;s exit makes more sense now than ever.[0] https://developer.nvidia.com/opticalflow-sdk"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So the 4090 is 38% faster (in FP32 FLOPS) than the current top server GPU (H100) and 105% faster than the current top desktop GPU (3090 Ti). And it&#39;s also more than twice as efficient (in FLOPS per watt) as all current top GPUs, even compared to the H100 which is manufactured on the same TSMC 4N process. This is impressive.The computing power of these new GPUs (in FP32 TFLOPS) is as below:  Nvidia RTX 4090:      82.6 TFLOPS (450 watts¹)
  Nvidia RTX 4080-16GB: 48.8 TFLOPS (320 watts¹)
  Nvidia RTX 4080-12GB: 40.1 TFLOPS (285 watts¹)

Compared to Nvidia&#39;s current top server and top desktop GPUs:  Nvidia H100 (SXM card): 60.1 TFLOPS (700 watts)
  Nvidia RTX 3090 Ti:     40.0 TFLOPS (450 watts)

Compared to AMD&#39;s current top server and top desktop GPUs:  AMD Instinct MI250X:    47.9 TFLOPS (560 watts)
  AMD Radeon RX 6950 XT:  23.7 TFLOPS (335 watts)

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It seems like they&#39;re really emphasizing the difference in RT performance from the previous generation, but I think the gaming market at least will care more about the difference in raw frames and memory size from the previous generation and AMD&#39;s offerings.Personally, I like using RT for some single player showpiece games with a 3080 Ti, RT was useless on my 2080, but the games that I play the most do not use RT at all. DLSS is always great on any title that offers it, but again the real issue is that most of the games that people put real time into are the types of games for which RT is irrelevant. Graphical showpiece stuff is just a lot less relevant to the contemporary gaming market than it used to be."</p>

Centiclops is a lot like a cyclops with one eye, except the as a reading of the roots clearly indicates, this is a creature with 100 eyes.Today I learn that Centiclops effectively has a Unicode character. As Centiclops&#39; representative in the world of the non-imaginary, we accept that a Unicode character with a hundred eyes is not practical and we accept the representation with just a few eyes, but generally agree that upgrading to 7 to 10 is a nice improvement, as 7 does not evenly divide into 100 but 10 does. This is important, because... reasons."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There were 84 errors for GCP, but the breakdown says 74 409s and 5 timeouts. Maybe it was 79 409s? Or 10 timeouts?I suspect the 409 conflicts are probably from the instance name not being unique in the test. It looks like the instance name used was:    instance_name = f&#34;gpu-test-{int(time())}&#34;

which has a 1-second precision. The test harness appears to do a `sleep(1)` between test creations, but this sort of thing can have weird boundary cases, particularly because (1) it does cleanup after creation, which will have variable latency, (2) `int()` will truncate the fractional part of the second from `time()`, and (3) `time.time()` is not monotonic.I would not ask the author to spend money to test it again, but I think the 409s would probably disappear if you replaced `int(time())` with `uuid.uuid4()`.Disclosure: I work at Google - on Google Compute Engine. :-)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Anecdotally I tend to agree with the author. But this really isn&#39;t a great way of comparing cloud services.The fundamental problem with cloud reliability is that it depends on a lot of stuff that&#39;s out of your control, that you have no visibility into. I have had services running happily on AWS with no errors, and the next month without changing anything they fail all the time.Why? Well, we look into it and it turns out AWS changed something behind the scenes. There&#39;s a different underlying hardware behind the instance, or some resource started being in high demand because of some other customers.So, I completely believe that at the time of this test, this particular API was performing a lot better on AWS than on GCP. But I wouldn&#39;t count on it still performing this way a month later. Cloud services aren&#39;t like a piece of dedicated hardware where you test it one month, and then the next month it behaves roughly the same. They are changing a lot of stuff that you can&#39;t see."</p>

Which I can&#39;t see until the form is submitted.At the time I was using Opera, so I wrote in to their customer support suggesting that the prompt appear after the new page loaded. I never heard back, but a couple months later their next major release implemented exactly that behavior. A few months after that, every other browser followed suit.I can&#39;t have been the only one bothered by the existing behavior, but given how long browsers had worked that way before I wrote in, I like to tell myself that the timing wasn&#39;t a coincidence, and that my little suggestion rippled out into a change that made a small thing better for the whole world :)"</p>

Just people who clearly dont get paid/paid much to make this content but I found it useful/interesting/helpful. I think that stuff goes a long way and it really doesnt take that long to do.I&#39;ve got a tech podcast now and about once every month or two someone contacts me to say they liked it or something nice.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve worked in a few roughly-the-same-size (~50 engineers) web development shops. It&#39;s always the same. Doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s React, Angular, Class based components, Functional components with hooks, Just Some HTML, PHP, Rails views, etc.The frontend just collects the cruft of a product organization changing course very frequently. There are always a dozen half-finished fix-the-world ideas conflicting with each other, half-finished move-to-new-framework initiatives.I just mean to say that when I hear &#34;it&#39;s because React&#34; or &#34;it&#39;s because rails views&#34;, any other of the infinite variations of this, I kind of just tune out. Some part of your organizations chaos is going to reflect in code, and honestly I&#39;d rather it be in a big ball of frontend than in the data models, infrastructure, etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a developer who’s been working with React since the beta, I can confidently say that the author is speaking the truth. Especially so near the end of the article where they can’t seem to quit React.For all the annoyances of Hooks, they really are a godsend when it comes to composing state. And refs do indeed suck, but they sucked even more with class based components. I can’t tell you how many times I was able to solve a complex DOM state issue with custom hooks wrapped around refs.Newer tools like Svelte and Solid do look promising as far as removing boilerplate, but they personally feel a step too far off the path of “it’s just JavaScript.”Has anyone else here successfully left for greener JS pastures?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I must be the only person in the world who likes class components in React.Sure, it&#39;s often overkill and a functional component does the same thing with less code. Use a functional component in these cases. But if you&#39;re doing something more complicated then stop treating class components like the fucking devil. They have their place."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A great idea.  Now, everyone that learns this stuff, show some restraint!The drawback of a powerful type system is you can very easily get yourself into a type complexity mudhole.  Nothing worse than trying to call a method where a simple `Foo` object would do but instead you&#39;ve defined 60 character definition of `Foo` capabilities in the type system in the method signature.Less is more."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Over the years, the type system of TypeScript has grown from basic type annotations to a large and complex programming language.Give someone (particularly a developer) the opportunity to build something complicated and undoubtedly they will. So now you have two problems, the complicated program that actually does some hopefully useful work, and another complicated program on top of it that fills your head and slows you down when trying to fix the first complicated program. You may say &#39;ah yes, but the second complicated program validates the first!&#39;. Not really, it just makes things more complicated. Almost all bugs are logic bugs or inconsistent state bugs (thanks OOP!), almost none are type bugs.However, static analysis of existing code (in Javascript), without having to write a single extra character, may well have great value in indicating correctness.Edit:&gt; TypeScript&#39;s type system is a full-fledged programming language in itself!Run! Run as fast as you can! Note that this &#39;full-fledged programming language&#39; doesn&#39;t actually do anything (to their credit they admit this later on)Edit2:&gt; [...] is a type-level unit test. It won&#39;t type-check until you find the correct solution.&gt; I sometimes use @ts-expect-error comments when I want to check that an invalid input is rejected by the type-checker. @ts-expect-error only type-checks if the next line does not!What new level of hell are we exploring now??I am genuinely afraid and I&#39;m only halfway through this thing. What&#39;s next? A meta type level language to check that our type checking checks??&gt; 3. Objects &amp; Records&gt; COMING SOON!&gt; this chapter hasn&#39;t been published yet.Thank God, I am saved."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I currently have to occasionally contribute to a TypeScript codebase at work. I appreciate how much better it is than Javascript. When I write code as an outsider (Java and Go developer), I feel like I use the type system in sensible and readable ways. When I look at the code written by the native TypeScript experts in my company it is a bewildering, abstract, unreadable morass. I have no idea what&#39;s going on half the time."</p>

So, if such a system was to &#34;denoise&#34; (or compress, which - if you think about it - is basically the same operation) CT scans, X-rays, MRIs, etc., in ambiguous areas it could plug-in diseased tissue where the ground-truth was actually healthy.Or the opposite, which is even worse: substitute diseased areas of the scan with healthy looking imagery it had been trained on.Reading recent publications that try to do &#34;denoising&#34; or resolution &#34;enhancement&#34; in medical imaging contexts, the authors seem to be completely oblivious to this pitfall.(maybe they had a background as World Bank / IMF economists?)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Something interesting about the San Francisco test image is that if you start to look into the details, its clear that some real changes have been made to the city. Rather than losing texture or grain or clarity, the information lost in this is information about the particular layout of a neighborhood of streets, which has now been replaced as if some one were drawing the scene from memory. A very different kind of loss that with out the original might be imperceptible because the information that was lost isn&#39;t replaced with random or systematic noise, but rather new, structured information.."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A few thoughts that aren&#39;t related to each other.1. This is a brilliant hack. Kudos.2. It would be great to see the best codecs included in the comparison - AVIF and JPEG XL. Without those it&#39;s rather incomplete. No surprise that JPEG and WEBP totally fall apart at that bitrate.3. A significant limitation of the approach seems to be that it targets extremely low bitrates where other codecs fall apart, but at these bitrates it incurs problems of its own (artifacts take the form of meaningful changes to the source image instead of blur or blocking, very high computational complexity for the decoder).When only moderate compression is needed, codecs like JPEG XL already achieve very good results. This proof of concept focuses on the extreme case, but I wonder what would happen if you targeted much higher bitrates, say 5x higher than used here. I suspect (but have no evidence) that JPEG XL would improve in fidelity faster as you gave it more bits than this SD-based technique. Transparent compression, where the eye can&#39;t tell a visual difference between source and transcode (at least without zooming in) is the optimal case for JPEG XL. I wonder what sort of bitrate you&#39;d need to provide that kind of guarantee with this technique."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; One bill opposed by the App Association is the Open App Markets Act, which aimed to help app developers use alternative in-app payment systems and avoid Apple&#39;s standard cuts of 15 to 30 percent.The cut is a platform fee, and collecting it via the in-app payment system is mechanism, not policy.The core issue is Apple&#39;s rate: although it is usually comparable to rates on other game platforms (eShop, Google Play, Steam...), (some) game and app developers want it reduced so that they receive a higher percentage of an app&#39;s retail price.The largely unfounded expectation that some developers seem to have is that changing IAP payment methods will cause Apple&#39;s platform fee to drop to zero, rather than causing Apple to simply collect it by other means.Edit: for some reason people are responding to me with complaints about Apple&#39;s policies and downvoting me because they don&#39;t like Apple&#39;s platform fees. I&#39;m trying to shed some light on what is actually going on: a dispute over platform fee rates.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Well into the second day of Cloudflare’s blockade of my home internet connection, Google Search also began blocking requests. It required me to resolve a CAPTCHA challenge for every other search. This luckily only lasted a day.Cloudflare shares IP reputation data with partners like Google, coordinated through a program called the Bandwidth Alliance. So, my original offense might not even have been against Cloudflare. It might have received the reputation data from a partner, and it just propagated through the Bandwidth Alliance network.That&#39;s not what Bandwidth Alliance is at all. It&#39;s about reducing or eliminating egress fees between a cloud provider and Cloudflare. Not sure where the idea that it&#39;s about sharing IP reputation data comes from.https://www.cloudflare.com/bandwidth-alliance/So, if Google Search started showing a CAPTCHA that&#39;s not Cloudflare."</p>

Captchas are everywhere: in many cases, you can&#39;t even complete simple GETs of blogs without donating free labor to CF.And the most infuriating part, you get CF marketing messages right in your face while your browser is calculating hashcash (I guess?)... At this point I can recognize every single one of them: something about bots making up 40% of all internet traffic, something about their web scraper protection racket, something about small businesses (???), etc etc...To be fair, Tor exit nodes have an awful reputation for sure.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Harsh blocking/limiting/challenging is way too valuable to sites that are actually trying to make money online. It&#39;s not going away short of legislation banning it. Losing 1/10,000 legitimate customers to cut fraud attempts, spam, exploit attempts, and so on, by 90% or more, is just too good a trade-off.I have bad news about the most-likely fix for it, longer term, so we can lay off the IP-based reputation stuff and the geo-blocking: it&#39;s tying some form of personal ID to your browsing activity, so that bears the reputation instead of the address.Sorry. Said it was bad news."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"PGs take on why early stage VCs gain so much experience reminds me of my opinions on why car sales is the best sales experience.I sold cars for almost a decade and was pretty good at it averaging 30 cars a month. That means every year I helped people sign for $16 million of products. In the end I probably sold 3000 cars for over $100 million.(Note, I stayed in it way too long. I think most of these benefits would come from 2 years)I made close to 50,000 phone calls, leaving probably 20,000 voicemails. I closed atleast 1000 deals purely on the phone.I&#39;ve heard excuses, stalls, lies, promises and objections over 10,000 times.I&#39;ve seen thousands of married couples discuss if they should go ahead with spending $30-100k. I&#39;ve seen how they interact while waiting. (Nothing pains me more than couples, or moreso one party, playing games on their phones ignoring each other).While there is a lot more to modern tech sales than just closing incoming leads, I think car sales is an accelerator course for interacting with, reading, and closing people."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This essay is getting a surprising amount of hate, and I must confess that my first impression on reading it was that it sounded an awful lot like a Robert Kiyosaki book [1].  But then I followed the two links in the essay [2] [3] and that put it into perspective: the thing that Paul learned from his users is that they are looking for The Answer, the formula, the procedure for how to succeed, and there is no such formula.  It&#39;s like Goedel&#39;s incompleteness theorem, except that it&#39;s not a theorem.  People come to YC and buy Robert Kiyosaki&#39;s books hoping to find an Answer that simply doesn&#39;t exist.The difference between Paul and Robert is that Paul is up-front about this while Robert is cagey and deceptive and makes his money by stringing people along thinking that The Answer can be found by buying one more of his books.  But I think a lot of the hate here is driven by disappointment that Paul is honest, and that his answer is that there is no Answer.  It can be frustrating to hear that (which is also something that Paul explicitly points out).---[1] https://www.amazon.com/Rich-Dad-Poor-Teach-Middle/dp/1612680...[2] http://paulgraham.com/lesson.html[3] http://paulgraham.com/before.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Prompted by the negative feedback that this essay received, ranging from being a sales pitch in disguise, to being a word salad going in all directions without answering the central question posed by the author right in the opening paragraphs, I had to go and re-examine the piece and see if these concerns are valid or not, and unexpectedly the second reading reaffirmed my initial positive reaction that this is actually a good piece, maybe not the best, but still good.In spirit of open discussion and intellectual curiosity here, I share my insights in the following order matching that of the post:1) PG opens with the best advice that he could dispense to prospective applicants which is &#34;what you&#39;ve learned from users&#34;.2) He proceeds to ask himself the same question.3) He then informs readers that his users; startup founders, usually face the same set of problems across the board.4) Since these problems are the same, he thought of automating the solution to scale his business (dogfooding in some sense).5) That blew up in his face spectacularly that he had to rework the plan and concede that his solution won&#39;t scale.6) But these same problems are not recognized uniformly by founders as they sometimes face difficulties identifying them in the first place, that&#39;s where the YC partners&#39; role come to fill this unmet need.7) Even when people are good at identifying problems, some are bad at determining the severity or urgency that these problems pose, cue again the YC partners&#39; role.8) Even when they&#39;re good at risk assessment, some are bad at risk mitigation, and won&#39;t listen to the advice given by the partners but it is not made clear what he means exactly by &#34;not listening&#34;, dismissing/not acting on solutions proposed by YC staff, or not acknowledging that there&#39;s a problem to begin with?9) Getting down to business to solve these problems warrants focus, and how this focus is tied into speed, and how YC can help with that.10) Startup colleagues are more important than YC partners when it comes to realizing success with their feedback, guidance and even practical help, and how YC is the best in class in this regard.Even though the marketing language, esp the value propositions in the piece is a bit stronger for my taste, but I can&#39;t say with honesty that it overpowered the core message of the essay nor was it incoherent or disjointed in anyway that made following or understanding impossible as some have claimed here.Verdict: 8/10"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Congrats to the Wasmtime team on the 1.0 release!I&#39;m happy to see that more runtimes are maturing and getting use on production cases... I can&#39;t wait to see and show what the future entails for WebAssembly on both the server side and the browser!Keep up the good work. Also I&#39;d like to use this message to congratulate other runtimes that I&#39;m excited about (apart from Wasmer, of course!): Wizard Engine [1], Wazero [2] and Lunatic [3].The future is bright in Wasm land :)[1] https://github.com/titzer/wizard-engine[2] https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero[3] https://github.com/lunatic-solutions/lunatic"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Instantiating a runtime in microseconds is deeply exciting!Though after skimming through the docs, I&#39;m still left wondering a few things:- JS is notably missing from the list of languages supported on the front page. But I see mentions of a Spidermonkey.wasm in the blog post. Is running JS on top of wasmtime in production a realistic prospect today? If so, where can I read more? (mainly interested in this for the instantiation time benefits, though maybe all/most of that will be negated by the embedded JS engine?)- How should I go about building a typical web service on top of wasmtime? Can wasmtime itself handle network requests/connections or would I need to build the web server in some other host language and pass request data to wasmtime modules? Haven&#39;t been able to find anything in the docs about this.- What would it take to build a multitenant web service where customer code is isolated using wasmtime, like the one like described in the post?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m sold on the future of wasm. What really still bothers me is the effort and hoops I have to jump through to actually leverage it. Networking, just fix networking so I can drop in most things and it would be great. The fact that I have to rewrite the majority of my network access to do any external IO is painful but I get that containers took more than a decade after Google&#39;s use to get there too."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Unfortunately this caching is still per-path. For example:    GET /v1/document/{document-id}/comments/{comment-id}

For every new document-id or comment-id, there will be a new pre-flight request.Alternative hacks: Offer a variant of your API format that either1. Moves the resource path to the request body (or to a header that is included in &#34;Vary&#34;). Though the rest of your stack (load balancing, observability, redaction) might not be ok with this, e.g. do your WAF rules support matching on the request body? You also will no longer get automatic path-based caching for GET requests.2. Conforms to the rules of a CORS &#34;simple&#34; request [1], which won&#39;t trigger a pre-flight request. This is what we did on the Dropbox API [2]. You&#39;ll need to move the auth information from the Authorization header to a query parameter or the body, which can be dangerous wrt redaction, e.g. many tools automatically redact the Authorization header but not query parameters.[1] https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#simpl...[2] https://www.dropbox.com/developers/documentation/http/docume...

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The trick to improving YouTube recommendations is to regularly prune uninteresting videos and channels. Eventually this should start surfacing videos you&#39;re more likely to find interesting.I&#39;ve actually hit the end of my recommendation stream on the mobile app after marking dozens of videos with Not Interested. Once this happens it starts recommending videos you&#39;ve already watched or older videos from creators you&#39;ve been watching lately.Personally, I&#39;d love it if you could curate the recommendation system a bit more. I&#39;m never interested in rewatching stuff I&#39;ve already seen. And the recency bias for recommendations means you&#39;re always getting more if what you&#39;ve recently consumed. I&#39;d like it if more older interests were mixed in. Finally, I&#39;d love to be able to blacklist certain topics and games entirely.There&#39;s so much missed potential with YouTube recommendations.Some might say that you can still use search, but that has been crippled to include unrelated recommendations after one page of results. Not only that, I want YouTube to help me discover new content. When the recommendation system works and it shows me new kinds of interesting stuff, it&#39;s superb. TikTok is eating YouTube&#39;s lunch in this regard.Edit: forgot to mention this. On mobile if you do a recommendation refresh it&#39;ll show a New to You filter which you can use to explore more diverse recommendations. I don&#39;t know why it&#39;s hidden in this manner."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I didn’t like when they removed the dislike counts, and I still don’t like it.When I look for videos of folks working on Subarus, I don’t want to have to manually scrub through the video to gauge the quality. Before I’d just look at the ratio and if I was feeling generous I’d preview the frames to see if they had what I wanted.Now it takes me at least 2 mins longer to get to the same judgement which begs the question of why I’m watching a video when I have a book on my lap and a car waiting outside."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of how games (coughLeagueOfLegendscough) match me up with a player that I literally just reported for harassment, griefing etc. in the previous match.  Like, there weren&#39;t any other possible players to match me with out of the many thousands?  I don&#39;t mind waiting a few more seconds to match up with someone else!I&#39;m getting a lot of responses as if I expect the player to be totally blocked from matching with me, but that&#39;s not really what I mean.  Even a basic &#34;temporary match score reduction&#34; would work.  I would also expect a cooldown system where the reduction caused by reporting no longer applies.  Arguing against the idea &#34;because it creates a prisoner&#39;s island&#34; misses the subtlety of a well-thought-out implementation where reporting simply lowers the matchup &#34;rank&#34; for a while, and serial-false-reporters have their reports basically nullified/ignored."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"On our product (air quality monitor[1]) we made the concious decision to design it for long life and repairability by e.g.:- using no glue or snaps- all components on one PCB, no thin cables that can break- standard philips/torx screws- four screws to open the enclosure, four screws to take out the pcb- expensive sensor modules on pin sockets for easy reaplacement- only using components that are certified for longe lifetime -even if they cost a few dollars more (e.g. DC to DC converter)- not using plastic for packaging and we ask our supplier to not use plastic when sending us the parts (e.g. no bag around the USB cable etc)We wrote about this [2] and often do presentations for customers and have a slide about this and it gets a great response and I believe gives us an advantage compared to competing products on the market. As the market more and more appreciates this, Apple probably also realized that this can be a competitive advantage and give them positive press.[1] https://www.airgradient.com/airgradient-one/

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Apple started offering home repair kits for iPhone this year, but they’re super difficult to use: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/25/technology/personaltech/a...There’s speculation that offering the kits is an attempt to head off right-to-repair legislation. But seeing this redesign, I wonder to what degree the repair program is incentivizing repairability within apple’s corporate structure. Now that “profit/loss per self service repair” is tracked in a spreadsheet - does repairability matter more?Anyways - it’s great to see some improvement here, for whatever motivation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This has got to be one extremely expensive toolchain and supply chain redesign to do, but since they have done it a few times before (instead of incremental changes) I suppose the money department has worked out when it is feasible to do that kind of thing while keeping the people in charge happy.I&#39;m curious to see if this is a &#39;test&#39; to see if this doesn&#39;t have too many downsides, I imagine ingress area increasing this much might be a point of worry (well, there are flexible seals for that now), and instead of having a one-way stack you now have a two-way stack so tooling and workstations around that (even if we just think in terms of assembly and rework) are going to be a PITA to convert or completely replace.Either this will be a success and allow for the architectural change to be applied to other products, or it&#39;s a medium-success in which this only works for specific parts/antenna/power envelope configurations and we won&#39;t see this design in other form factors.What does itch a little is iFixit whining about the parts needing be a signed set to work together. Nobody has come up with a better integrity protection method, and no-protection isn&#39;t an option either for the ecosystem. Besides, instead of having a &#39;safe&#39; and &#39;unsafe&#39; option for which practically no user will ever be able to make an informed decision, you can simply choose not to buy it if this is a feature you seriously despise."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some of the strong points of this calculator is the main thing I use in RPN calculators with stacks.  It&#39;s so helpful for me to duplicate a value and then operate on that, and be able to throw it away if I mess up, sanity check from where I started at intermediate calculations, etc.  it&#39;s not identical, but many points others are mentioning in this thread are what I value from an RPN stack based calculator.BTW, for anyone who is comfortable with RPNs, MacOS added the mode to their built-in calculator recently-ish.  it&#39;s not terrible either.  I&#39;ve switched to it for my default experience. (even though nothing beats the HP 48g, as it&#39;s what I&#39;m the most familiar with).Also, on the article, really cool that someone added this on mobile.  I love hearing about devs developing something that fills a niche and does so well.  I feel like I&#39;m out of ideas most days.  Good for her!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I want is a phone app calculator that works like the Python REPL/console. Save ALL previous calculations. Display the last dozen or so. Can scroll through them. Tap on one to recall it, edit one number, recompute. Done.This would beat by far the convenience and usability of this 2-in-1 calculator. I would KILL to have this.In fact, on my laptop, I use the Python REPL as a calculator. I hit Ctrl-T python ENTER. It opens a terminal and I start typing 48*152 ENTER and I see the result. The history of calculations is saved. I can access previous calculations, edit one number and recompute. I see the last 100 lines or so, on one screen.The only one somewhat usable Python REPL on Android is &#34;Pyonic Python 3 interpreter&#34; but it&#39;s clumsy to use as a calculator because it uses the standard alphabetic keyboard so you have to keep switching to the special characters layout to type math operators (-+/...) If this ONE detail would be fixed, and with some minor UI polish I believe it could become more popular than the 2-in-1 calculator..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What a wonderful kludge. People can’t imagine that they would be able to go back and edit, or even see, the history of their calculations, so putting two calculators side by side seems like a brilliant idea.It’s like if a new word processor consisted of two faithfully recreated typewriters, with a special button to send the most recently typed word back and forth between them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Pretty cool.The program itself was written in an existing intermediate language called URCL, which was then compiled to CHUNGUS2 assembly. CHUNGUS2 is the processor made with Minecraft&#39;s redstone mechanics. The processor was emulated for development, but the demo is running on MCHPRS, a Minecraft server that uses Wasmtime&#39;s Cranelift to JIT the redstone operations, which are represented as a weighted directed graph. Before MCHPRS, optimizing redstone performance using compiler techniques was not thought to be possible. With MCHPRS the demo takes 9 hours to run, it would take decades using Minecraft.https://github.com/sammyuri/minecrafthttps://github.com/MCHPR/MCHPRSAs for CHUNGUS2 itself, it&#39;s a proper RISC processor, it has a 4-stage instruction pipeline, 64 byte 8-way associative data cache, even branch prediction.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDiapbD0Xfg"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is truly amazing.Comment from one of the creators;This build does NOT run in real time. It runs on MCHPRS,   the server developed by StackDoubleFlow, which speeds up the game roughly 10-20,000x while running redstone. That brings the framerate to a much more reasonable 0.1fps, so the long timelapses in the video only took 9 hours to record in in total."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked on a CPU in Minecraft years ago and designed it to be a 7-bit CPU. I chose that number because it gave me the an appreciable number of operations plus space for arguments. I had only 6 bytes of RAM and about 32bytes of ROM. The ROM was just a circle of transparent blocks (zero) and solid blocks (one) pushed around by pistons.The whole thing was real slow, but it was so much fun trying to design something that would perform interesting calculations. I stopped working on it as at the time Minecraft had some odd bugs with pistons that would cause non-deterministic behavior.I think the most challenging aspect wasn&#39;t the programming or circuits, which were well understood and mapped out, but trying to create modules I could copy-paste inside a special Minecraft save editor to make the machine quickly, then manually dragging out data/command lines to hook the modules together."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Really love the idea, and the passion behind it. Def could have legs.Here’s the pitfalls I see you falling into:(1) seriously, what data are you collecting? “Everything” isn’t a great answer (who’s supposed to use ‘everything’, anyway? “Anyone”?). “Apples-to-apples police misconduct statistics” is a good one.(2) it’s important to clarify 1 because you need to know who you’re serving, and why. Different activists need different data. “Have all data” sounds good until you need to decide how to allocate your resources.(3) more deeply, data is the land of edge cases. Even just with police misconduct, you need to get DEEP to rigorously compare seemingly-simple stats like “# of unjustified police killings”. If you don’t start narrow, you’ll never show value. If you don’t show value, nobody will ever care you exist.When I look at the data you’ve collected, it ranges from annual reports, to municipal contact info, to crime stats. What’s important to collect at scale? To whom? What do they need it for?Again - great, ambitious idea! But $250k goes fast. Show value before it runs out!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You might try defining what the &#34;ideal&#34; department&#39;s data would look like: what categories of data, what columns each record has, what the values are for each, etc. Ideally you&#39;d stamp it with a year and give it a spiffy name so it could be the National Police Data Reporting Standard 2022 (NPDRS.2022) or something.Departments that are trying to be transparent (or who just don&#39;t want to deal with figuring it all out from scratch) may be happy to adopt something considered a &#34;standard&#34; for tracking and reporting data. In some cases it means it is a checkbox they can check without having to deal with annoying people and their annoying questions... but that hardly matters so long as the data is made available. It would also give companies developing software for police departments a target to aim for."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is important. Locally, we had a sheriff who was being heavily, heavily criticized due to several deaths at the county facility. This was at the height of the protests a few years ago.It was a lot of work to find data on policing nationwide, because the question really was &#34;Is the sheriff doing a bad job, or do bad things happen sometimes?&#34;After some hard work trying to identify other cities with similar socioeconomic circumstances and populations, it became clear that our local sheriff was actually better than average, and that much of the outrage was fabricated.That&#39;s also when I learned that many people don&#39;t want to listen to statistics unless they agree with their own preconceptions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I can&#39;t wait to get home to play it.Secret of Monkey Island 2 was my first PC game on a 486SX and VGA monitor.  The sound came out of the PC speakers... One day I got an Adlib card and was blown away.  Go ahead and download the remake on steam and notice something that kind of doesn&#39;t exist in any game (that I know):  when you enter the scene on Scabb Island, the relaxed reggae beat changes ever so subtly depending on the  bridge, the carpenter shop, the mapmaker, the bar, etc.For example, you enter the mapmaker and the Wally music comes on, which is the same reggae bagdrop to a clarinet or oboe, the music is a little deeper in the carpenter shop, there&#39;s an evil background tone when Largo LaGrande shows up and a more subtle one in the hotel, etc.With gorgeous hand painted digitized art.They don&#39;t make games like that anymore.  Can&#39;t wait to see if they actually did."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Two hours in and I&#39;m enjoying it.So far the puzzles have been fun, but not very difficult. The plot is a bit heavy with references to the story of the earlier games, but perhaps not too much (my partner enjoyed it too, having only played The Curse of Monkey Island, but not the others).The &#34;new&#34; art style is a bit odd at first but it&#39;s nice and consistent and it has a style of its own. All the earlier games had a different art style to each other too, partly because the early installments had technical limitations they had to cope with (and then there was that thing with the 3d graphics).The sound track is very nice with some tunes you&#39;ll probably know.I&#39;ll rate it four monkeys and a pegleg."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have the same problem (i.e. terrible short-term memory, though my long-term memory is fine), and I&#39;ve picked up a number of compensating behaviors over the years. By far, documentation is my #1 go-to strategy. I document code extensively, even if I&#39;m the only person who is ever going to read it again. People have mocked me for this, but I believe it&#39;s a superpower.Most programmers believe a number of blatant falsehoods about documentation, with the most prevalent being &#34;comments go out of date quickly, so there&#39;s no point in investing in them&#34;. Maybe I&#39;m just hyper-aware of it because my short-term memory sucks, but code comments have saved me on so many occasions that they&#39;re simply not optional.You can document your code. You can keep it up to date. It isn&#39;t that hard. You just don&#39;t want to."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve noticed as I&#39;ve gotten older that I lean more on remembering pointers to information rather than the specific information. I know something exists and can find it quickly, but may not know it off the top of my head.For example, how to get the length of an iterable in a given language. I may not remember the function name (or if it&#39;s a top-level function vs a method) but I know I can search &#34;string length in $LANGUAGE&#34; and find it. This scales better than memorizing every language feature I&#39;ll ever use.---PS: Dash is a great mac app, highly recommend. Your job will likely cover it if it&#39;s something you think you&#39;ll use."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wrote Private Comments[1] specifically to address this problem in code. My coworkers can maintain context about how a given thing works months after the fact. I can&#39;t. So, I leave private comments throughout the code. Things they&#39;d never want committed, but save me hours of re-leaning when next i encounter a given piece of code.Currently has plugins for Vim (proof of concept) and Emacs (actually good). It&#39;d be lovely if one of you folks would make a VSCode plugin for it. I&#39;ve thoroughly documented the API and diagrammed the code flow you&#39;d need[2], so that this would be as easy as possible to add to your favorite editor.[1]: https://github.com/masukomi/private_comments[2]: https://masukomi.github.io/private_comments/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I tried Rust about five years ago and I had trouble expressing cyclic data structures because there is no clear &#34;owner&#34; in a cyclic data structure. The &#34;safe&#34; solution recommended by the rustaceans was to use integers as references to the data in a vec or hashmap. I was rather put off by this: Instead of juggling pointers I was juggling integers. It made the code harder to debug and find logic errors. At least when I was troubleshooting C I could rely on the debugger to break on a bad pointer, but finding where an integer became &#34;bad&#34; was more time consuming.The borrow checker worked fine when all I needed to do was pass data up and down the callstack, but anything beyond that was difficult or impossible to express. Has the borrow checker become smarter since then? At the time I was very put off."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Another incredible ultra-runner from Lithuania is Aidas Ardzijauskas who last year completed his 444 day run covering 30303 km, which is on average 68km every day for almost 1.5 years! His plan originally was to run around the world, but during the pandemic it wasn&#39;t possible to do that so he just ran it all in Lithuania. Unfortunately there isn&#39;t much English-language coverage about the monumental feat, but this is readable with Google translate:
https://www.lrt.lt/naujienos/sportas/10/1568074/finisas-pasi...And he tracked everything on Strava too - https://www.strava.com/athletes/16416410"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Aleksandr&#39;s training is public on his Strava: https://www.strava.com/athletes/26934035Something to remember is that this is his pace _after_ pit stops, so his actual running pace was faster. Also notable is that this course was kind of terrible, with four 90 degree turns and three 180 degree turns each lap for 209 laps. There&#39;s little doubt that he could run &gt; 200 miles on a course with fewer turns."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I recently tried switching to Linux with a few different distro&#39;s (Ubuntu, Elementary OS, etc.) and use Wayland.The thing that sticks out like a sore thumb to me, and which I&#39;ve been unable to solve, is that apparently it&#39;s not possible to configure trackpad scroll speed. At all.From what I was able to gather, Wayland/libinput say they shouldn&#39;t be responsible for handling it and instead window managers should[0][1], meanwhile gnome says wayland/libinput should handle it[2] and ultimately - several years later - it&#39;s still not possible to in pretty much any Linux distro that uses Wayland(?)When I switch to my Linux laptop to test things, my trackpad is bonkers and I have to move my finger in like 1mm increments because otherwise I&#39;d scroll like 10 pages in Firefox. It&#39;s infuriatingly frustrating.[0] https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/libinput/libinput/-/issues/18...[1] https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland/-/issues/87[2] https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-control-center/-/issues..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Wayland
&#34;The X11 protocol was designed around running graphical apps across the network. While some people use this feature, it&#39;s far from common. Wayland drops this requirement as a way to greatly simplify its architecture.&#34;X client and server are usually the same machine, but they don&#39;t have to be.  While on the road, you can use your notebook to open a Gimp session on your home machine and edit an image stored there.  That is, the Gimp runs on your home machine while your notebook has the GUI.This is a lot to give up for cool compositing effects..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The thing I dislike about Wayland is:  Sometimes the server will crash. Video drivers or something. Hasn&#39;t happened much with 22.04, but used to happen more frequently before. Both with Intel and AMD.When this happens in X11, the server restarts, I see the screen go black for an instant, that&#39;s it.When this happens in Wayland, all my open programs are killed. No save prompts or anything, just insta-killed. This makes Wayland unusable unless they can guarantee no crashes, ever."</p>

Which is imho as it should be.It&#39;s neither wrong nor illegal to download someone&#39;s video and edit it. It&#39;s explicitly allowed in many jurisdictions under fair use. However, OP seems to accept complaint&#39;s framing.Speaking of youtube-dl, there&#39;s an excellent fork, yt-dlp[1], which circumvents the newer speed limiting features YouTube implemented.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"First off, no, a full rewrite is not only not necessary, but probably the worst possible approach. Do a piece at a time. You will eventually have re-written all the code, but do not ever fall into the trap of a &#34;full re-write&#34;. It doesn&#39;t work.But before you re-write once line of code - get some testing in place. Or, a lot of testing. If you have end-to-end tests that run through every feature that is currently used by your customer base, then you have a baseline to safely make changes. You can delete code as long as the tests pass. You can change code as long as the tests pass.Once you are at that point, start picking off pieces to modernize and improve.Also, respect the team. Maybe they aren&#39;t doing what you would, but they are keeping this beast alive, and probably have invaluable knowledge of how to do so. Don&#39;t come in pushing for change... come in embracing that this beast of a codebase makes 20 million a year. So talk about how the team can improve it, and modernize their skills at the same time.Because if you walk in, saying, &#34;This all sucks, and so do you, lets throw it out&#34;, do you really have to wonder why you are hitting resistance?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; this code generates more than 20 million dollars a year of revenueFrom a business perspective, nothing is broken. In fact, they laid a golden goose.&gt; team is 3 people, quite junior. One backend, one front, one iOS/android. Resistance to change is huge.My mistake, they didn&#39;t lay a golden goose--they built a money printer. The ROI here is insane.&gt; productivity is abysmal which is understandable. The mess is just too huge to be able to build anything.But you just told me they built a $20M revenue product with 3 bozos. That sounds unbelievably productive.&gt; This business unit has a pretty aggressive roadmap as management and HQ has no real understanding of these blockersYou should consider quitting your job.As far as the business is concerned, there are no problems... because well... they have a money printer, and your team seems not to care enough to advocate for change. Business people don&#39;t give a damn about code quality. They give a damn about value. If 2003 style PHP code does that, so be it. Forget a rewrite, why waste time and effort doing simple refactoring? To them, even that has negative financial value.From their perspective, you&#39;re not being paid to make code easy to work with, you&#39;re being paid to ship product in a rats nest. Maybe you could make a business case for why its valuable to use source control, dependency management, a framework, routing outside of nginx, and so on... but it doesn&#39;t sound like any of that mattered on the road to $20M a year, so it will be very difficult to convince them otherwise especially if your teammates resist.This, again, is why you should consider leaving.Some developers don&#39;t mind spaghetti, cowboy coding. You do. Don&#39;t subject yourself to a work environment and work style that&#39;s incompatible with you, especially when your teammates don&#39;t care either. I guarantee you will hate your job."</p>

Don’t worry about multiple jquery versions on a page, lack of mvc, lack of framework, unless overhauling that page."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"To some extent I disagree with this, not that Google+Meta are under attack, but that the threat is coming from competitors.I’ve spent most of the last 10 years earning my living from an e-commerce business I own. The online advertising industry is unrecognisable from when we started. My thesis, in beef, is that the industries excessive uses of personalised data and tracking lead to increased regulation, and then a massive pivot to even more “AI” as a means to circumvent that (to some extent). The AI in the ad industry now, I believe, is detrimental to the advertiser. It’s now just one big black box, you put money in one side and get traffic out the other. The control and useful tracking (what actual search terms people are using, proper visible conversion tracking of an ad) is now almost non-existent. As an advertiser your livelihood is dependant on an algorithm, not skill, not intuition, not experience, not even track record.Facebook, Google and the rest of the industry were so driven by profit at all cost, and at the expense of long term thinking, they shot themselves in the foot.Advertisers are searching for alternatives, but they are all the same.I think online advertising, as a whole, is probably f***ed…"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"‘Microsoft’s social network, LinkedIn, is unglamorous but its business-to-business ads allow it to monetise the time users spend on it at a rate roughly four times that of Facebook, estimates Andrew Lipsman of eMarketer. It generates more revenue than some medium-sized networks including Snap’s Snapchat and Twitter. &lt;...&gt; So far [Apple] is only dabbling in ads and does not report sales figures. But Bloomberg reported recently that Apple’s ad business was already generating sales of $4bn a year, making it about as big an ad platform as Twitter.’Twitter is now a unit of being moderately unsuccessful at advertising."</p>

Imagine if it included more realistic elements like economics and persistent characters. You could decide you have a vendetta against Bob and steal his cheese every time he goes out shopping for groceries. Heck, you could become the cheese kingpin and monopolize access to cheese. Although a more thematic approach would probably have to do with drugs, which doesn&#39;t seem like too far of a bridge to jump considering the game genre."</p>

Most other countries in the Anglosphere have been through a &#34;plain english&#34; language push in both contract &amp; legislation, while the US has stuck to &#34;this language is proven through precedent&#34; more stubbornly than anywhere else. This seems to be particularly prevalent in IP law, although that might be my tech bias showing.I would very much argue against those (even in this thread), that say that the lay-person isn&#39;t the intended audience for lots of contracts, particularly for T&amp;Cs where they are often written by a contracts lawyer, for a contracts lawyer or judge, but should ABSOLUTELY be written for the lay-person to understand.Anyway, I think the legal profession can &amp; should do better."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"One more vote for terrible audio mixes and one for actors who mumble their dialog.Whenever I watch movies with my wife, we constantly have to fiddle with the remote control. The loud parts (including explosions and music) are too loud for her, so we have to turn the volume down during those parts, but the dialog is too quiet and mumbly for me to hear, so we turn the volume up during those parts. We now just keep the volume low and turn on subtitles--easy but shitty solution.Sound engineers need to stop needlessly flexing all that dynamic range that modern tools give them, and just produce a watchable movie. Actors need to go do some stage acting and learn how to e n u n c i a t e and project their voices."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The fact that there&#39;s a claimed generational gap here speaks more to the values of the generations re: passive vs active entertainment. I could also ask: &#34;Why do all these 60-Somethings have the TV on as background noise while doing other tasks?&#34;To me it seems closed-caption usage is correlated with actually paying attention to television consumption.People who have their TV on at all hours, as background entertainment to support their lifestyle, tend to not use CC. Why should they? The words literally don&#39;t matter, it&#39;s just an aesthetic.People who actually desire an immersive experience, who deliberately pay attention to the shows they watch, tend to care about CC since it complements the audio &amp; visual nicely. I don&#39;t have any evidence for this but I&#39;d wager that plot synthesis and comprehension of television shows is greatly improved by CC. Or maybe it&#39;s that people who use CC tend to value and perform better at synthesis and comprehension? Regardless of causality, CC seems related to an individual&#39;s desire for more active entertainment."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A probably naieve question. If the VPU can be used as the bootstrap loader for the CPU, much as a PDP11 on the door of the Vax 11/780 acted as bootstrap loader for the Vax, can we not simply replace all the complex VPU resident functions with &#39;just run on the CPU&#39; and then resolve the external device bindings in normal CPU code?Maybe I misread it, but it read like the VPU does more than the tiny necessary bootstrap to find an image, and chain load it. It reads like it has to do some timing critical initialisations of subsystems, but I cannot but think a CPU should be able to do this for itself, once it has some run state with a kernel in memory.It&#39;s as if the VPU has to make the other bits of blobby hardware be alive, for the CPU to be able to see them. Most odd.Oftentimes there are magic bits of this to do with ring states, and priviledge to alter ring at runtime. Maybe this is part of the story: the VPU initialises a specific ring state and some outer higher trust ring MUST be pre-initialised for the CPU ring state to be allowed to talk to it: it would violate the ring model, if the CPU did it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This project focuses on being a drop in replacement to the proprietary firmware needed to bringup Linux on the other processor. (The ARM processor.)Isn&#39;t anyone going to talk about running random stuff on the VPU itself?!  Given it&#39;s the thing used for 3D and stuff, I imagine it&#39;s going to be crazy fast at certain computations, much faster than the ARM is.Untapped potential of all Raspberry Pies out there... maybe the VPU can be (ab)used to do stuff similar to what the Raspberry Pico can do."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ubers real disruption is labor exploitation but not in the way you think. Uber is allowed to get away with the mistreatment of the Drivers because they define them as independent contractors, but how do they do this?An employee of a company is in traditional terms, somebody who acts for the benefit and interests of a larger entity which engages in business to business or customer interaction, in return for earning a reasonable wage and defined employment terms set by the company.An independent contractor is an individual entity, who by setting their own terms and prices, provides a service for other individual entities for the purpose of earning a reasonable income for themselves.What Uber has done, is see all the protections afforded to employees of a company both traditionally and federally, and sidestep them because they call their drivers independent contractors. It is implied that the Driver is setting their own pricing and terms of employment. They may legally technically be doing so, but what they&#39;re really doing is agreeing to the same terms set by Uber and defined by Uber as every other driver, as if they were employees. This allows Uber to really do whatever they want to an &#34;independent contractor&#34; which has agreed to their terms of not setting their own rates, having no transparency, and being totally subject to Ubers conditional compensation agreements."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Pros:- Transpiling to C++ means it will work wherever C++ works. On any toolchain. With relatively little effort. It shouldn&#39;t be hard to add CMake and bazel support, for instance. Even mostly dumb makefiles should be workable.- Approaching the community this way could avoid fracturing the community more than it already is.- Targeting specific success metrics (like CVE causes) could provide focus around design and requirements- Seems simpler and easier to learn and teach.Cons:- The pitch assumes C++ modules are implemented, ready to use, and reasonable accessible.- There will be a lot of tooling to reinvent: static analyzers, syntax highlighters, etc.- At least for a while, debugging cpp2 problems will involve juggling multiple parallel realities: cpp2 code, C++ code, and actual program behavior (i.e. compiled binaries).- Doesn&#39;t address other major C++ ecosystem problems like build times, packaging, build systems, etc. cpp2 could make them slightly worse."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been engineering videogames in C++ for almost 20years working on AAA games and I can tell you that modern C++ is not very appealing to the vast majority of our industry. Modern C++ it&#39;s overcomplicated and from what I can see all the best software engineers I met in my careen write very simple C++98 code, maybe a bit of C++11 but that&#39;s it. They keep it simple. They don&#39;t need a move constructor because they&#39;ve been already clever enough to solve a prolbem from a different angle. Modern C++ is for experienced C++ developers and it&#39;s solving problems that experienced developers know already how to solve without all this extra complexity. And because of that it&#39;s keeping away young developers...

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Important to note that this 5th Circuit ruling conflicts with the 11th Circuit&#39;s ruling.  And SCOTUS had previously reinstated an injunction against this very same law.And this 5th Circuit opinion has very idiosyncratic reasoning [0, just the first few pages will blow your hair back].  A sample:  &#34;In urging such sweeping relief, the platforms offer a rather odd inversion of the First Amendment. That Amendment, of course, protects every person’s right to &#39;the freedom of speech.&#39; But the platforms argue that buried somewhere in the person’s enumerated right to free speech lies a corporation’s unenumerated right to muzzle speech.&#34;

How the 1st Amendment might protect a corporation&#39;s religious POV but not its exercise of editorial control is a very good question.  I&#39;m not saying this very conservative SCOTUS won&#39;t adopt the 5th Circuit&#39;s reasoning, but it still seems unlikely.  In my view -- much more likely is that they resolve the Circuit split by adopting the 11th Circuit&#39;s view wholeheartedly.[0]: https://techfreedom.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/2022-09-1..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Will this apply to bots? What if I have a big list of a complaints about a certain politician (use your imagination, there&#39;s more than one politician to complain about), but the &#34;other party&#34; doesn&#39;t follow me, in fact, I have very few followers overall.So I create a bot that spreads my opinions by replying to millions of other Tweets. Anyone who mentions the politician of interest will receive a reply from &#34;me&#34; (my bot) within 2 minutes. Now I will be heard by millions, and my lawyer is ready should I be banned from the entire site.Now imagine many people doing this, what a cesspool, you make a Tweet and the bot flood gates open. You Tweet about your grandchild and 30 seconds later you have 400 replies expressing &#34;political opinions&#34; about shady websites with cheap Viagra. Twitter can&#39;t ban them though. Welcome to truly free speech. You better learn to code if you want to be heard.We&#39;re already at the point where websites can&#39;t control bots. AI that can write better than most humans is knocking on the door, and it can run on my personal computer. This law will only make it worse by adding real legal risk to banning suspected bots.Am I exaggerating here, or is this actually possible?

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Here we are, deep down in the dystopia of Automatic Content Classification by robots.Far less important of an example, but I was just put in &#34;Facebook jail&#34; for 24 hours for posting a picture of my son at the beach in his bathing suit with no shirt. Y&#39;know, as one does at the beach. I can only assume it&#39;s because my son has long hair and the Convolutional Neural Network or whatever decided he was a girl and therefore I&#39;m a pervert.Sadly it was the &#34;appeal&#34; I submitted that got me blocked. Presumably by a &#34;human&#34;, but who knows.Before I appealed they were simply going to not show the picture. Appealing got me in &#34;trouble.&#34;  That might be even worse than the original misclassification. On top of that, if I was actually a &#34;community standards&#34; violator who posted potential child exploitation imagery, I&#39;m not sure how a 24-hour ban on activity on Facebook is of any use, either? Except I&#39;m terrified to imagine a world where Meta might have called police on me based on the output of a neural network image classification.Others have said but I&#39;ll say it again: This kind of business doesn&#39;t scale ethically. You can&#39;t have billions of people on a bulletin board. It doesn&#39;t work. Moderation is essential to modern communication. But you can&#39;t do moderation automatically or at scale and in a universal way.Very dark patterns emerge the moment you go FAANG scale and toss algorithms tuning for advertising and &#34;engagement&#34; into the mix, and attempt to do so with the help of computers.&#34;Sad&#34; as it is, we will need to &#34;retreat&#34; back into smaller forums and BBSs where communities self-police.Facebook has infiltrated so many aspects of society. Want to interact with the parents from the local school your kids go to? You have to do that on Facebook. Event announcements? Keeping in touch with your distant aunt? Facebook.If something like Facebook is really a universal utility, it will have to be put under public administration; like the post office. But clearly, that isn&#39;t going to happen and would have other problems.I am going to have to find some other way to engage with old friends and family.Frank Herbert had some intuition with his whole &#34;Butlerian Jihad&#34; thing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem is that no automatic method we have now will catch context. There is a difference between &#34;Jews were murdered by Germans during war&#34; and &#34;Jews destroyed German economy before the war&#34; that will not be recognized by any machine we have nowadays. The first is true, the second is bullshit, how algorithm can now this?More, even if Facebook employees humans to do moderation still for some contractor from Asia &#34;Jews destroyed German economy before the war&#34; might not be easy to verify. For a contractor maybe Jews did that, who cares, I have 20 seconds to moderate this and move to other post. The same way if I was asked to moderate some historical details about India-Pakistan conflict or other historical facts about Asia, Africa I have no knowledge about at all.I was reading quite a lot recently about war in Angola and still I have doubts which side was &#34;good&#34; and which was &#34;bad&#34;, besides that people who lived there were hurt in the history like almost no other nation.Even worst. Some, especially historical, facts are judged from different perspective. For instance in Poland Napoleon Bonaparte is a mythologized person that brought hope to Polish hearts to get back their homeland [1]. From the point of view of someone from Austria or Italy, well, Napoleon is considered to be far from hero.We don&#39;t have to go back that far in the history. US intervention in Afghanistan or Iraq can be seen differently depending on somebody views.How to moderate all this?[1] Fun fact: not a big surprise that Napoleon didn&#39;t give a crap about Poland, he even refused to give them a proper King at the short time he could (he has chosen some Saxon prince). At the end, when Napoleon lost, remains of Polish military units were sent to Haiti to help France to maintain their colonies. Many Polish soldiers died from tropical illnesses there, many joined Haitians as they saw that those people were fighting for their freedom like Poles were."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A little while ago, a patent for high throughput DNA synthesis using silicon chips went off-patent, so I have been learning analog IC chip design to build an open source high-throughput DNA synthesis chip. If it works, and I sold them at cost, it would reduce the cost of oligo pool synthesis by ~100x and possibly gene synthesis by 10x.For about 8-9 years now my goal has been to build a cell from scratch for less than $1000 and enable anyone to be able to do so. While I’m handling the other bits elsewhere, DNA synthesis is a key technology primed for open source disruption."</p>

The firmware would need some way to do aborts/timeouts and kick a partially complete request back to software too.Is it complex...?   Yes.    But will the compute savings be worth it...?   At cloudflare scale, I think the answer is yes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love reading these kinds of posts. Whenever I’m reminded that I’m not alone, I get a little bit more self-compassion and that makes me more excited to release my game and helps me appreciate all the progress and hard work to date.I’ve been working on King of Kalimpong [0] on and off since playtesting a one-week prototype of it in 2014. I had no idea how much work a networked physics vehicle/movement shooter game would be. (I should have, I was 8 years into a programming career).Working part-time was critical (for many reasons), but so was learning that progress is a product of discipline, not motivation, and that I needed to learn “infinite endurance” (I think that’s what Chris Hecker called it).Once I adopted the perspective that I was some finite number of 3-4 hour blocks of concentration away from turning a goofy idea into a game that anyone could play, finishing became something that felt inevitable — as long as I kept going.I’ll take the time to write about my experience after I release (which is now months instead of years away) in case any other game developers get anything out of it. Until then, thanks for another reminder that I’m not alone![0] https://store.steampowered.com/app/1989110/King_of_Kalimpong..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a game with +10 million installs on the both app stores, the truth of it is making the game is about 25% of the work - the rest is dealing with marketing, screenshots, videos, user reviews, Ad/IAP SDKs, waiting for Unity to switch between platforms, dealing with Unity bugs/upgrades, etc..
When you&#39;re making the games it&#39;s a joy - the rest of the stuff can be a real grind."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I started making games right after I joined my university. Those were simple flash-like games with simple gameplay and basic UI/UX. Fast forward 10 years; I started a game studio and we’re a team of 50+ but still making really simple games for mobile. Not that we didn’t try making “huge” games but constantly creating new games and publishing them and seeing them succeed is what it takes to keep making games. As an indie developer, you’ll probably make a dozen or more games before people actually play one of your games. It’s a long battle but making many simple games is more important than trying to make a blockbuster in the first try."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Thing is, it‘s true in essence, but talking about this stuff without numbers is completely pointless. It is written in a sensationalist way.1. Subsidies for wood pellets were a thing but are phased out in Germany.2. The awareness of some stupid calculations of burning wood come up quite frequently in the German media (the Twitter thread is like 2-3 years late).3. There are no numbers in the thread about the carbon emitted in the process of producing and shipping wood pellets.4. Not all wood burned in Germany is wood from the US.5. Not all stoves in Germany are utterly bad. The tech advanced in recent years.6. The comparison with coal is kinda dumb, because we had different goals a hundred years ago.- I personally think burning wood in housing areas should be banned entirely for health reasons.- I think the general gist of the thread is true: burning wood is at least partially some kind of green washing scheme.- But the reality is more complex than this thread claims."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well, I stopped reading here, because it is complete bull** &#34;Nearly 40% of Europe’s so-called renewable energy is currently obtained by combusting wood, much of it coming from forests in the US.&#34;I live in Poland and my (self built) house uses a wood pellet heat source. 30% of the surface area of my country is used for woodlands. Most of the wood produced is used by manufacturing industry. One of the byproducts made when manufacturing furniture and other things from wood are shavings, wood chips and wood dust. This can be made into many engineered wood products, but a lot of it is purchased by small manufacturers of wood pellets as fuel. Before I chose a heat source for my house I did enough research to know that the pellets I use (and are mostly accessible here) come from sustainable sources.So if there are countries in Europe that import their fuel wood from US it is not &#34;much of it coming from US&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Does not trump the absurdity of heavily subsidizing an american EV company in order to buy their cars, then telling users not to charge them during the winter.As an EU-country citizen I am concerned by the dominance of political appearances in all the workings of EU since before the pandemic. Insisting in formerly-popular CO2 deadlines in the face of long-lasting ukraine war is absurd. Phasing out ICE cars too early is absurd. Subsidizing buying EVs throughout europe, even though many countries clearly can&#39;t support the future EV load is absurd. Fining power production through coal is absurd, as is not having a nuclear strategy. Keeping the marginal pricing of wholesale energy during war, is absurd. Begging the dictator of azerbaijan for oil at the same time that they are attacking their neighbor, while also sanctioning russia for doing the same thing, is absurd.Ursula VdL is a bad leader, and Charles Michel (president of the council) has recently publicly called her out for her bad leadership in energy. This EU that we see now is unrecognizable: inward-looking, woefully stuck in its own processes and populist obsessions, preoccupied with appearances (e.g. demanding gas and and even power cuts from countries that are NOT dependent on russia), and complete lack of vision. I am personally thankful to the US for taking initiative in nearly all fronts: arming ukraine, providing LNG to northern europe, coordinating sanctions and even Pelosi showing her support for democracy in the region."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I believe it is time for regulatory support. I know it is fashionable to mock the EU regulatory efforts in the US, but the EU has a tendency to step in once something reaches proportions where regulation is actually needed. Ridiculously high roaming charges, for example, have been eliminated through regulation.Once you are the dominant provider of something that is nearing life-essential utility status, you should provide support and escalation routes, and you should be accountable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel that many of the answers here, which explain what could have been done beforehand to prevent this - are not very helpful to someone who&#39;s already locked out of their account.It&#39;s never gonna be possible to 100% prevent any possibility that could cause loss of access to your 2FA. Some people will always fall through the cracks - whether that&#39;s due to their own negligence, lack of technical understanding or some algorithmic false positive doesn&#39;t really matter imho.The real problem here is, that there&#39;s nothing that can be done to resolve something like that, AFTER it already happened. Not even if you were willing to pay for support to help you.If you got good contacts, are famous, manage to go viral or something, you might be able to actually get help - but as a regular, boring, everyday person, you&#39;re just fucked. The only &#34;advice&#34; you are gonna get is: &#34;you should have done this or that beforehand...&#34; - and the obvious answer to that is: &#34;I would have, had I only known!&#34;The only thing you can do, is post your story on HN and Twitter, and hope someone from Google reads it, and goes out of their way to actually help you - which obviously is AGAINST standard company procedure."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This might sound dumb, but if the phone number belongs to someone else now, could you just call/text them and explain the situation and (eventually) ask them to read you the code or something? Admittedly it&#39;d sound suspicious as heck, but if you&#39;re willing to provide sufficient proof of your identity and somehow offer a reward in a safe manner, the person might understand and be willing to help? You&#39;d have to be pretty smooth about it, but it seems worth preparing for and giving it a try.Alternative idea: If you&#39;re really desperate, you could even try to dig up the phone number owner&#39;s address and show up at their door or something and explain it that way. (Note I&#39;m not recommending these per se; I&#39;m just pointing out what&#39;s possible. Obviously be very careful to consider everything before doing such a thing.)"</p>

This, of course, is a few hours after an email saying that my &#34;free subscription&#34; will be expiring in a month, not within hours.The kicker is that the billing FAQ 404s, the &#34;account URL&#34; 500s, and there is no apparent way to log in to the account that they are billing me for.At this point the best I can do is hope they don&#39;t have any real PII to try to collect their bullshit bill."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great way to ruin the FogBugz brand and reputation: move everyone from free to paid tier without consent, and send out emails with a short notice telling them they will be charged $30/month - when most of these users haven&#39;t heard from/of them in over a decade. The flood of complaints is hilarious.https://twitter.com/search?q=fogbugz&amp;src=typed_query"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I got that e-mail too, on a decade-old test account: first an e-mail that reads like my account simply &#34;expires&#34; if I don&#39;t update. Then an invoice.Here&#39;s what I don&#39;t get: After a stunt like this, any reputation/brand value that you might have had is gone. So, the obvious conclusion is they bought the company purely to pull this trick. Any other value the company might have had is deleted. Can that have been worth it? Very few people will pay voluntarily, I can&#39;t imagine them successfully collecting the money, and the acquisition price probably wasn&#39;t 0 either. I can&#39;t imagine that the math checks out, or does it?"</p>
