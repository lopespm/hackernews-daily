								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This seems to have been announced a couple of weeks ago, so we don&#39;t need to just trust the tweet: https://www.macworld.com/article/1377200/apple-to-limit-aird...Having it open to everyone for only a limited amount of time actually kind of seems like the right thing, but it&#39;s hard to come up with a legit explanation for why they rushed that change to China first."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For context: AirDrop was one of the only ways protesters had to communicate en-masse.Signal is unsafe for Chinese protesters, since it requires SMS verification upon signup and is therefore linked to your identity.[0] Mesh networks are the only real solution there, and AirDrop is about the only mainstream one. AirDrop has been used by Asian protesters for years.[1] I highly recomment you read the full China Digital Times article, which gives excellent context, and lets these protesters explain the value of AirDrop in their own words.[1]Apple&#39;s timing is unmistakeably suspicious; keep in mind that there have been protests for weeks, which preceded the iOS update.It must also be pointed out that Apple issued an official statement to Western media outlets that the goal was to prevent spam.[2] At no point did Apple ever admit that this was done to follow any government demand. It&#39;s unknown whether Apple could be under a Chinese gag-order, but we shouldn&#39;t speculate that it&#39;s the case unless experts say it&#39;s likely. If Apple is complying with a Chinese government orders, then it has an ethical duty to make that public, and again, we have, as of yet, no reason to assume there are gag orders related to this. Apple deserves criticism for the update, and for trying to hide its true purpose.[0]: https://twitter.com/RealSexyCyborg/status/159707255662827929...[1]: https://chinadigitaltimes.net/2022/11/netizen-voices-apple-r...[2]: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-10/apple-lim..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have to admit that when you actually look at the details this is a rather perplexing change. Ditto for reading the comments here.Is Apple being Pro-CCP with this change? If you open airdrop to everyone, your device can be tracked and identified individually. When this setting is disabled, this becomes far harder.I&#39;m of the opinion that this change is good and actually increases security across the board, including for the people who are using it to exchange information during protests since it disables a vector for tracking devices."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"FFmpeg is powerful technology, yet approaching it can be very daunting. So we decided to create an approachable guide for intermediate devs.
Feedback is very much appreciated."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not to criticize the guide, it&#39;s brilliant!
If asked for improvements, I&#39;d suggest adding a table of contents.Slightly off topic, but the guide does suggests reading time. It&#39;s interesting that people keep using read estimates for technical/scientific/professional documentation. This one says it&#39;s a 58 minute read. Not 1 hour, not 59 minutes, but spot on 58 minutes.Now, I&#39;m not a novice in using ffmpeg and I think I&#39;m at least an average person. I can tell you that it would take me a _lot_ longer to read this guide in a meaningful manner.But, a brilliant guide. I&#39;m definitely going to use it to expand my ffmpeg knowledge."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I fortunately have close friends, but not through any of my own doing. Over the years, there were a lot of friendly extroverts that encouraged me to hang out and join them for burger night, or they’d message me when they were in town. Everyone I dated took the initiative to ask me out, including my wife. I always feel awkward when I reach out to people, as though I’m bothering them somehow, so I tend to avoid doing so. Once someone is a close friend, I go out of my way to maintain the connection, but it’s that in-between stage of “acquaintance” where I have a hard time.I had a bit of a revelation when I left my last job. There were very few comments from coworkers when I left. I don’t think I was disliked (hopefully?), but I don’t think anyone really considered me their friend either. Looking back I think I came across as somewhat of a NPC to coworkers. I preferred to eat lunch by myself and I only discussed the business topic at hand during meetings unless someone else brought up a personal discussion.I wouldn’t mind to start more personal discussions, but I’m always concerned it might come across the wrong way, so the furthest I seem to get is “how was your weekend?”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Making friends is easy, keeping friends and growing the relationships are difficult. I am mostly introverted but have periods of extreme extroversion. I&#39;m 34 but all of my best friends have passed away from various accidents over the past decade.I feel like a shell of my former self where all I do or have a desire to do is work. The only person I consider my friend is my former boss who, after losing his wife to ALS, I did everything I could to be there and support him because he took a chance on me by offering me a job that ultimately has led to a great career in the tech field.I&#39;ve noticed my personality has slipped away, I no longer have hobbies or anything of real passion in my life anymore and thus there&#39;s nothing I have to offer another person in a relationship.It&#39;s incredibly lonely and a poor place to be yet I really don&#39;t know how to escape it. Most other dudes my age have families or many of them only care to go out to breweries which I don&#39;t enjoy.There&#39;s still a bit of hope deep down that all isn&#39;t over yet and a ray of sunshine can still propagate itself somewhere, sometime."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very brief summary: a personal anecdote about forming good friends followed up by advice for how to have better conversions (vulnerability, curiosity) and how to meet more people who will become friends (meet people but filter out most of them, take initiative with following up), and lastly how to deepen friendships.As someone who has a fair number of close friends, I think this is a good post with lots of solid advice. And it&#39;s written well! Personally I&#39;ve been lucky to just naturally meet and form my best friends over time, but I definitely think taking initiative and following up are important to maintaining a close friendship.A general point in this post I also like is that making and keeping close friends may require work and energy, rather than being something that life just throws your way. I intentionally try to periodically message friends, come out to places they live, just generally keep in touch; as one gets older people move about and it&#39;s harder to maintain your closest friendships, but it is possible!Last comment: this is a very pragmatic and analytical post with a lot of discussions of things you can do, and not much discussion of how you should feel. I&#39;d add this - just CARE. Appreciate the people in your life and let that appreciation guide you."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I like it, but the array details are a little bit off. An actual array does have a known size, that&#39;s why when given a real array `sizeof` can give the size of the array itself rather than the size of a pointer. There&#39;s no particular reason why C doesn&#39;t allow you to assign one array to another of the same length, it&#39;s largely just an arbitrary restriction. As you noted, it already has to be able to do this when assigning `struct`s.Additionally a declared array such as `int arr[5]` does actually have the type `int [5]`, that is the array type. In most situations that decays to a pointer to the first element, but not always, such as with `sizeof`. This becomes a bit more relevant if you take the address of an array as you get a pointer to an array, Ex. `int (*ptr)[5] = &amp;arr;`. As you can see the size is still there in the type, and if you do `sizeof *ptr` you&#39;ll get the size of the array."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Everything I wish I knew when learning CBy far my biggest regret is that the learning materials I was exposed to (web pages, textbooks, lectures, professors, etc.) did not mention or emphasize how insidious undefined behavior is.Two of the worst C and C++ debugging experiences I had followed this template: Some coworker asked me why their function was crashing, I edit their function and it sometimes crashes or doesn&#39;t depending on how I rearrange lines of code, and later I figure out that some statement near the top of the function corrupted the stack and that the crashes had nothing to do with my edits.Undefined behavior is deceptive because the point at which the program state is corrupted can be arbitrarily far away from the point at which you visibly notice a crash or wrong data. UB can also be non-deterministic depending on OS/compiler/code/moonphase. Moreover, &#34;behaving correctly&#34; is one legal behavior of UB, which can fool you into believing your program is correct when it has a hidden bug.A related post on the HN front page: https://predr.ag/blog/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-u... , https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33771922My own write-up: https://www.nayuki.io/page/undefined-behavior-in-c-and-cplus...The take-home lesson about UB is to only rely on following the language rules strictly (e.g. don&#39;t dereference null pointer, don&#39;t overflow signed integer, don&#39;t go past end of array). Don&#39;t just assume that your program is correct because there were no compiler warnings and the runtime behavior passed your tests."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This looks decent, but I&#39;m (highly) opposed to recommending `strncpy()` as a fix for `strcpy()` lacking bounds-checking. That&#39;s not what it&#39;s for, it&#39;s weird and should be considered as obosolete as `gets()` in my opinion.If available, it&#39;s much better to do the `snprintf()` way as I mentioned in a comment last week, i.e. replace `strcpy(dest, src)` with `snprintf(dst, sizeof dst, &#34;%s&#34;, src)` and always remember that &#34;%s&#34; part. Never put src there, of course.There&#39;s also `strlcpy()` on some systems, but it&#39;s not standard."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel sorry for the retail investors caught up in yet another crypto scam. Let me try to articulate my view of what’s actually going on with these seemingly endless scams, in hopes of saving future retail investors some pain:Prominent venture capital firms like A16Z, Sequoia, etc have discovered a new get rich quick scheme: they raise a fund and invest it in a some shitcoin like FTX, SOL, etc. the shitcoin founders use the cash to market and shill the coin, hiring public figures like famous NFL players. Retail investors FOMO into these tokens, boosting prices and attracting more retail investors. Once the market cap of the shitcoin exceeds the VC/investor cost basis, they cash out and let the rest ride. Eventually the shitcoin implodes, but by this time the firms are already onto their next fund and another token.  A16Z is on their 4th fund now and it’s $4.5B[0]. There’s an entire political strategy at play as well, where shitcoins are employing folks in DC and lining pockets to further the scam.All of this is possible because there is no regulation on crypto tokens. In reality these are unregulated securities and these large VC firms are exploiting a loop hole for profit. This goes for literally every token starting at ETH and below.[0]: https://a16zcrypto.com/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"With projects like blockfi, users get all the disadvantages of the centralized traditional financial system without any of the regulatory protections that have built up over centuries. Terrible for the people with assets in blockfi but extremely predictable. The point of defi is that you can use financial services without a centralized counterparty. People who can’t handle their own keys should be using traditional banks, at least until the technology is improved. Compare to Aave and other actually decentralized lending protocols which are not at risk of bankruptcy."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; In the Chinese app store market [there are] five to ten commonly used app stores, and yet even the largest has less than a majority market share. Most Chinese people have more than one app store on their phone, so there is no monolith there, whereas “outside of China, Apple and Google control more than 95 percent of the app store market share”. Ecosystems with multiple app sources work, and governments around the world believe that monopoly forces are what keeps Google Play and Apple App Store dominant."</p>

And the charm of having almost no electronics[1] on the car control is that if something is wrong, you will know it by the sounds it makes, and you will have a lot of times to fix it before it&#39;s completely toast. I have heard of horror stories about newer cars with electric ABS accumulator that stopped working on the high way, not with my FZJ80[2].[1] The so called &#39;emission computer&#39; unit on the car is a simple pulse counter/comparator that activates a VSV on the carb to reduce backfire while descending downhill with the foot off the throttle.[2] My brake booster is leaking a little bit, but at least it won&#39;t suddenly gives up on me while I&#39;m riding, still looking for a replacement."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In case anyone from the US reads this, BSPP and BSPT fittings are rare and incredibly frustrating here, as our NPT (National Pipe Taper) threads are different and the selection of BSP(P/T) fittings is extremely poor in comparison.Also, I work with NPT fittings quite a lot:&gt; For what it’s worth, I tightly wrap the tape 10 times round the male thread and get an enraged mountain gorilla to tighten it up.This is a WTF NO!!! for NPT and I’ll assume a WTF NO!!! for BSPT as well. You need about 1.5 wraps of PTFE tape to seal a fitting. Any more is wasteful and asking for leaks (or damage, if you’re using plastic fittings). It helps if you use the correct tape width for the fittings (1/4”, 1/2”, and 1” for me) and develop a wrapping method that keeps the tape under tension at all time and in such a direction that threading it into the fitting doesn’t unwrap the tape.Also, in my experience, when someone inexperienced first learns what pipe tape is, they try to apply it to everything. 20 wraps around a tapered pipe? Wrap a Swagelok fitting? Try to make a butt joint or an adapter for two pieces of plastic tubing? I’ve seen it all."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article doesn&#39;t touch much about why plumbing is hard. I&#39;m from Poland so I&#39;m not only IT but also a plumber ;)Plumbing is hard because it is not forgiving. It&#39;s as binary as IT except you can learn the outcome with some delay, once you learnt about a damage caused by a leak. Either you do a pressure tests right or repair can be expensive. And bugfixing is always tricky.Water also goes down whether you like it or not. Think about all possible leaks inside the shower cabin. Or what is even more impressive that under a pressure the water goes everywhere possible.Plumbing is similar to electrical engineering, except it usually doesn&#39;t kill immidiately (though working with gas is tricky anyway) but requires similar strict mental model to do right.And when you see a plumber it seems like this person is just a physical worker. So work status misconception must be leveled with money..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve helped out with some plumbing work in an older house, and it&#39;s pretty fascinating to see the progression of technologies.100 years ago, most drain pipes in the US were massive cast-iron pieces with no threads at all. They were mated together, then the joint was filled with a compound called oakum. To really hold it together, the plumber would pour molten lead on top of the oakum. Just taking that stuff apart is a lot of work. I can&#39;t imagine putting it together as well, especially for 40 hours a week.I agree with the author&#39;s dismay about threaded fittings, but 100% disagree about PTFE tape versus thread sealant. PTFE tape is garbage. If you use thread sealer the way it&#39;s supposed to be used (put on a decent amount, then thread the pieces together with the &#34;nudge and a grunt&#34; technique instead of cranking down on it with a huge amount of force), it will seal perfectly almost every time, and any minor leaks can usually be fixed by tightening the joint slightly. If that&#39;s not enough, just take it apart and redo it. I&#39;ve rarely had to try twice, and never three times.Not sure about British threaded pipe, but NPT threaded pipe actually doesn&#39;t benefit from being tightened beyond a certain point because of the way the threads are designed. I redid the seals and some of the fittings[1] on all the antique hot water radiators in a house because no contractor within a day&#39;s travel would work on antique hydronic heating systems. Good quality thread sealant, no garbagey PTFE tape, no leaks, even in constant use.That having been said, modern pipes and fittings make things dead simple. PVC (or ABS, but PVC is nicer IMO) for drains, push-to-connect fittings for water lines (I like PEX, but I know opinions vary). No lead, no torches. Easy to cut with hand tools. Lightweight. Anyone who&#39;s interested can probably do at least basic work with modern pipes.[1] https://youtube.com/watch?v=MeHiE-j1KuQ"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This problem first occurred in the mid-&#39;90s, and people saw it was a problem, and that&#39;s why we specified the image dimensions in HTML (before the GIF or JPEG header was loaded), so the layout wouldn&#39;t shift during load, when people were already reading and navigating.Since almost the beginning, graphic designers were trying to layout Web pages like an advertising brochure, lots of bad ways, rather than as hypertext.  When, in a sense, they finally did take control of the Web, HCI (usability in service of user) had evolved into &#34;UX&#34; (advertising-like graphic design in service of non-users).There&#39;s often disincentive for things like &#34;user can understand what the controls are and what the state is&#34;, &#34;user can focus on the information they want&#34;, etc.  UX won&#39;t care about these things until some time after users are so aware of the problems that it affects engagement metrics and eventually A/B testing figures out why.I&#39;m imagining a eureka moment, during which a UX researcher, trying to find a new, improved dark pattern, to screw over hapless users harder, accidentally lets slip in some old-school good usability, which wasn&#39;t even supposed to be in the test sets, but discovers that this strangely resonates with users."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A particular bane of mine is the self-oscillating UIs, youtube is particularly bad at it these days - if the mouse pointer is in &#39;just the right place&#39; (which is bigger than it sounds) then you get the seek-bar preview frames popup, which moves things just enough that the mouse pointer is no longer over the area that triggers it, so it vanishes, and the whole thing starts again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Way back when I first started learning to build web pages [when HTML4 was just a glint in Tim Berners-Lees eye], it was conidered bad form not to prvide a &#39;width&#39; and &#39;height&#39; attribute for an image you were placing on the page.Because if you provided these, the browser would know how much space to leave for the image to occupy after it had downloaded [this was back in the dial-up modem days. So images usually loaded gradually after the rest of the page] and so the layout of the page would not change. Conversely, if you didn&#39;t provide &#39;width&#39; and &#39;height&#39; attributes, the browser would only leave a default small icon sized space for the image and then you&#39;d have the page content move and shuffle about as each image downloaded and the rest of the page content got elbowed out of the way, to accommodate it.It&#39;s funny how such basic concepts of usability seem to have fallen by the wayside in our new modern Web3 [or whatever version buzzword we&#39;re on now] in favour of moving content, modal overlays and the like. And, since so many sites these days just aggregate content from countless other external sources, even that basic notion of pre-defining your image sizes is often neglected too."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Back when the Apache OpenOffice project was still alive, the LibreOffice project used git notes to track, for each commit to Apache OpenOffice, whether it was ignored (usually for being specific to the obsolete openoffice.org build system), redundant with a libreoffice commit (usually because the LibreOffice project had already fixed the same issue in a better way several years before), or cherry-picked into the libreoffice tree (this was the rarest case; in these last two cases, it also pointed to the relevant libreoffice commit); an aoo commit without git notes meant it had not been looked at yet. While the LibreOffice project stopped doing that a couple of years ago (probably because there was no longer anything interesting happening in the aoo repository), you can still see the branch they used to mirror the Apache OpenOffice tree, still with the git notes, at https://git.libreoffice.org/core/+/refs/heads/aoo/trunk (follow the parent links to see more, or clone the repository locally and look at that branch with gitk, which also shows the git notes)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve tried to use git notes over the years but unfortunately notes are tied to a specific commit hash. It&#39;s a blessing and a curse.Works great for some types of review system, or for &#34;tagging&#34; things related to deploy. Notes on commits on the master/main branch, which doesn&#39;t get rebased? Awesome thing, they work.But you can&#39;t as easily use them on branches: the moment a branch whose commits had notes is rebased, and SHAs change, good-bye notes associated with the &#34;previous&#34; SHAs :/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a question totally unrelated to the post, but that I finally decided to ask because of it.In the tweet by Simon Willson at the top of the blog post, he uses the word &#34;against&#34;:  Started experimenting with &#34;git notes&#34; against a new repo [...]

English is not my native tongue, but I always take the use of this preposition as if to state an adversarial relationship between two things, a relationship of opposition between them.
Therefore, sometimes I find it odd the way it is used in programming-related context.
A few examples of what I mean:  - &#34;to program against a standard&#34; instead of &#34;to program based on a standard&#34;
  - &#34;to match against a pattern&#34; instead of &#34;to match the pattern onto the thing&#34;
  - &#34;to compare against a list&#34; instead of &#34;to compare with items from a list&#34;
  - &#34;to file an issue against the repository&#34; instead of &#34;file an issue at the repository&#34;

It is possible (and very likely) that my proposed meanings are grammatically or even semantically wrong,
but I feel that &#34;against&#34; is being correctly used in these examples because I can see a slight opposition between the two things in them,
and I can understand that some people might even find an adversarial relationship there.
However, in the specific case of Simon Willson&#39;s tweet, the use of &#34;against&#34; sounds even more off because I fail to see a repository and Git notes as being adversaries or opposite to each other.
So the question is: is only me, as non-native speaker, that finds this usage (not only Willson&#39;s, but the examples too) a bit weird, or do native speaker also have similar sentiments?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"At a place I used to work for, the four day week question was put to the CEO at an all-hands company town hall.Not a fan of the idea, he scoffed and said something like, ‘I pay you to be at your desk from 9am-5.30pm Monday-Friday. Why should I pay you the same for a day less?’I don’t think he realised it at the time, but that answer was devastating to company productivity and morale. He’d just demonstrated to everyone that he didn’t value results and all that was important was bums on seats.People stopped putting in extra effort, waited out their hours as that was all that was required and started brushing up their CVs. I left not long after and so did many others."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In the US nuclear navy, the power plants have to be manned 24 hours a day both operating and shutdown. Ships in maintenance periods also generally go through a phase where ship personnel have to support maintenance work around the clock. Additionally, some parts of the training pipeline are run 24 hours a day.I say all that to say that while I am not a subject matter expert, I have a significantly above average amount of experience working various types of rotating shift work as well as duty rotations (a duty rotation is working 24 hours every 2, 3, 4, or 5 days depending on available manpower. Yes, you read that right - for a month, I was at work 28 to 32 out of every 48 hours).Forget 4 8 hour days, I would work 4 10 hour days right now in a heartbeat with no discussion or regrets.1) it is invaluable to have a normal working day where you can do tasks - change your oil, get your haircut, go grocery shopping without a crowd, see a matinee, the list is endless.2) the scope of weekend trip you can plan across 3 days instead of two is exponentially higher. So much room for activities.3) time after the working day just isn&#39;t that useful. Drive home, eat dinner, now it&#39;s 630/7pm. Waste a couple hours, go to sleep. After a 10hour day, the time after work is precious and useful to relax, but then you get a whole other day off.It surely isn&#39;t for everyone, but it surely is for a lot of people. The thing that blows my mind is no one is even willing to try."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The key to this in my view is having it be an officially &#34;approved&#34; option. Working at a FAANG company in the UK, I could already afford to take a 20% pay cut and work a 4 day week. I would love to do so in fact - but since that working pattern is relatively uncommon, I don&#39;t have the confidence that colleagues would respect or acknowledge it - basically I see myself spending an excessive amount of time telling people that I am not available on Friday for that meeting, and no I won&#39;t make an exception just for this week. Or, I would make an exception and get sucked into work - and now the company is getting 20% of my time for free.If a 4-day week was more widespread, I would have more confidence in maintaining it - and on the odd occasion I have to work the extra day, I wouldn&#39;t feel so bad given the 100% pay model described here."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Once again, absolutely amazing. Those are more details of a really interesting internal CPU bug than I could have ever hopes for.Ken, do you think in some future it might be feasible for a hobbyist (even if just a very advanced one like you) to do some sort of precise x-ray imaging that would obviate the need to destructively dismantle the chip? For a chip of that vintage, I mean.Obviously that&#39;s not an issue for 8086 or 6502, since there are more than plenty around. But if there were ever for example an engineering sample appearing, it would be incredibly interesting to know what might have changed. But if it&#39;s the only one, dissecting it could go very wrong and you lose both the chip and the insight it could have given.[1]Also in terms of footnotes, I always meant to ask: I think they make sense as footnotes, but unlike footnotes in a book or paper (or in this short comment), I cannot just let my eyes jump down and back up, which interrupts flow a little. I&#39;ve seen at least one website having footnotes on the side, i.e. in the margin next to the text that they apply to. Maybe with a little JS or CSS to fully unveil then. Would that work?[1] Case in point, from that very errata, I don&#39;t know how rare 8086s with (C)1978 are, but it&#39;s conceivable they could be rare enough that dissolving them to compare the bugfix area isn&#39;t desirable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I was at C-Cube Microsystems in the mid 90&#39;s, during the bring-up of a new chip they would test fixes with a FIB (Focused Ion Beam). Basically a direct edit of the silicon."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The obvious workaround for this problem is to disable interrupts while you&#39;re changing the Stack Segment register, and then turn interrupts back on when you&#39;re done. This is the standard way to prevent interrupts from happening at a &#34;bad time&#34;. The problem is that the 8086 (like most microprocessors) has a non-maskable interrupt (NMI), an interrupt for very important things that can&#39;t be disabled.Although it&#39;s unclear whether the very first revisions of the 8088 (not 8086) with this bug ended up in IBM PCs, since that would be a few years before its introduction, the original PC and successors have the ability to disable NMI in the external logic via an I/O port."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A fun fact (and I&#39;m not violating any NDA here) my client https://paireyewear.com is growing very fast and last year they raised $73 million from VC investors. They have their main store on Shopify, so they didn&#39;t need too much on the backend: only their CRM for keeping customers happy and handling returns and damaged goods and refunds and special sales. Also, on the backend, they had all the integrations with the 3PL, that is, 3rd Party Logistics, which is to say, they worked with external warehouses, because they weren&#39;t ready to have their own warehouses. They did have integrations with the warehouses so they could track inventory levels.So the fun fact is this: they were running entirely on free Heroku dynos.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The things I’m drawn to in life is where art meets science. In hindsight, so much of the secret is knowing how to avoid failure. Baking bread? Build the intuition over time and you’ll realize baking is forgiving so long as you don’t do these “5 bad things.” Gardening/farming? Yeah, there’s a big list of bad things. Brewing beer? Another list of things to avoid. The basic rules (rooted in science) are like guardrails and everything else is the art. I love this so much.In my early 20s I had a week long mind meld knowledge transfer from a self taught photographer. It made me fall in love with photography. I’m still using it to this day to photograph new label printers (black plastic is terrible to photograph) and labels (oh god they are 2D!).I’m doing an OK job. Room for improvement but fine for the initial launch. You can see them here: https://mydpi.com/products/professional-synthetic-direct-the...In case you’re like “why is this guy selling label printers?!”I’m a solo software dev that wrote Label LIVE (electron) to design and print labels. Now I’m vertically integrating with a printer I’ve imported from China and labels made in the USA.Business and entrepreneurship: just avoid these 9999 things and you’ll be fine! Science and art…"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is very well done for a new-to-photography audience. Will be sharing around to people who say all their things look like snapshots, what&#39;s up with that.Great use of examples, except for one: kid on  bridge.&gt; At the same time, it must be said that color and tone can be what separates a mediocre photograph from a memorable one. To illustrate, let&#39;s look at the potential evolution of this vacation shot deliberately chosen for its mediocrity...Then the dynamism is removed by &#39;correcting&#39; the dutch angle to horizon, the surprisingly good color balance is skewed off, and the whole thing gets that circa mid-2000s HDR look from Flickr and Shutterfly and the like where every photo got tone-mapped.Underwhelming of an end result, especially compared to the later color and tone examples (e.g. kitchen superhero)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If anyone wants to move beyond using the &#34;auto&#34; setting on their camera (or phone), I would recommend the book Understanding Exposure by Bryan Peterson, the first edition of which was published in 1990:* https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/142239.Understanding_Exp...The principles involved haven&#39;t changed much in the intervening decades; the current fourth edition was publish in 2016.If all you have is a phone you don&#39;t have to get new equipment: just perhaps a third-party &#39;camera app&#39; that allows you manual control of aperture, shutter speed, ISO/sensitivity.Once you know how each of these settings alter the resulting photo you can use them to alter the composition of photos, which is a whole other craft.Edit: seems recent smartphones have little-to-no adjustable camera settings."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To me the other algorithms described in the list are more novel and interesting:https://madebyevan.com/algos/crdt-tree-based-indexing/ - for when precise order is critical, like paragraphs in a document. This algorithm is almost like storing adjacency information like a linked list, but is more convergent. Very interesting for [my use-case](https://www.notion.so/blog/data-model-behind-notion).https://madebyevan.com/algos/crdt-mutable-tree-hierarchy/ - for tree-shaped data, like blocks in a Notion page that should have exactly one parent, but allow concurrent re-parenting operationshttps://madebyevan.com/algos/log-spaced-snapshots/ - log space snapshots, for choosing what fidelity of historical information to store. For context, many CRDTs for rich text or sequences store unbounded history so that any edit made at any time can be merged into the sequence. For long-lived documents, this could be impractical to sync to all clients or keep in &#34;hot&#34; memory. Instead, we can decide to compact historical data and move it to cold storage, imposing a time boundary on what writes the system can accept on the hot path. The log-spaced snapshots algorithm here could be used to decide what should be kept &#34;hot&#34;, and how to tune the cold storage."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Anyone unsure of what a CRDT is (I think everyone on HN must know by now), this is the perfect intro: https://www.inkandswitch.com/peritext/The two most widely used CRDT implementations (combining JSON like general purpose types and rich text editing types) are:- Automerge https://github.com/automerge/automerge- Yjs https://github.com/yjs/yjsBoth have JS and Rust implementations, and have bindings to most online rich text editors.CRDTs are addictive one you get into them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"CRDTs are often talked about in the same breath as collaborative editing software, but they&#39;re useful for much more than that.They really are a theoretical model of how distributed, convergent, multi-master systems have to work. IE the DT in CRDT could be a whole datastore, not as just an individual document.(Wish I could remember who on HN alerted me to this. I had read the paper but didn&#39;t grok the full implications)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Slightly off topic...Back before my Phoenix/Elixir days, we used to have to cache almost everything. Now we don&#39;t cache anything -- even with more traffic and less servers. Now, the projects I work on are not getting millions of views every day. But they are still important for many customers.We don&#39;t really design anything that needs to be cached anymore. Just better access patterns and table design as we get wiser.Take Wordpress as an example. There really should not be a need to cache a Wordpress site. But some of the most popular plugins are those that cache. To be fair, I suppose, their legacy non-optimal database design access pattern and code is responsible for this.Just getting something up and aiming for product-market fit is priority #1 and then struggling with caching if it gets popular, at which point, more resources can be thrown at it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Cache coherency ensures that the behavior is correct, but every time a cache is invalidated and the same memory has to be retrieved from main memory again, it pays the performance penalty of reading from main memory.1. First no. If any such rereads occur, they will be from the LLC (last-level cache, or L3 cache for Intel/AMD CPUs).2. Second no. IIRC, modern caches are snooping and/or directory caches. This means that when Core#0 says &#34;I&#39;m changing cacheline X&#34;, Core#0 knows that Core#1 has it in its L2 (or deeper) caches. So Core#0 will publish the results of that change to Core#13. The examples they gave are missing read/write barriers, which are rather important. #2 will only happen during read/write barriers. That is to say: your code is memory-unsafe by default. If order and cache-invalidation matters, you actually need a barrier instruction (!!!) to make sure all these messages are passed to the right place at the right time.---------For better or for worse, modern CPU design is about doing things thread-unsafe by default. If the programmer recognizes a problem may occur, it is the responsibility of the programmer to put the memory barriers in the right place.This is because the CPU is not the only thing that can reorder things... but also the cache system... as well as the compiler. So memory barriers inform the compiler + CPU + cache system when to synchronize.The original Netflix article is more precisely worded.&gt; This consistency is ensured with so-called “cache coherency protocol.”With a link to MESIF (F for Forwarding state, which is one such protocol / way to share L1 cache info without going all the way to LLC or DRAM)I&#39;m pretty sure that GPUs actually invalidate the cache dumbly, without any MESI / MESIF (or whatever). GPUs are actually really bad at these kinds of ping-pong operations and synchronization... preferring thread-fences and other synchronization mechanisms instead.------That being said, I think the blogpost is a good introduction to the subject. But note that its a bit imprecise with some of the low level details. I guess its correct for the GPU-world though, so its not completely inaccurate...-----The original Netflix article has an even more difficult problem revolving around Java&#39;s Superclass cache and how it is affecting &#34;true sharing&#34; of caches. I&#39;m not very familiar with JVM internals, so I lost track of the discussion at that point."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m not laid off but actively looking to change after spending a couple of years at my current employer. Despite being a staff engineer, managing 12 engineers, and having a solid revenue stream tied to my current team - I&#39;ve mostly gotten rejections without interviews, 1-2 low ball offers, or radio silence. I cannot imagine how hard this must be for those laid-off, hopefully this storm passes soon.EDIT: you cannot make this up, it&#39;s a saturday and we got an email 1/3 of our team got laid off (I didn&#39;t yet, but I have a feeling it might happen soon)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I keep getting the same amount of emails from recruiters as before, mostly startups.Found a new job (non-startup) by responding to one of those. Signed the offer and was going to quit FB on a certain date, then got the FB layoff severance package a week before that date as a nice bonus.I also interviewed at Google and got the thumbs up to proceed to team matching, but no team matches after a month. This makes me believe that they have at least a partial hiring freeze, although their recruiters are pretending that this is not the case - they&#39;re just saying that team matching takes a bit longer. Google interviews were useful as practice for the other jobs, but not for actually getting an offer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those of you feeling down about being ignored, keep in mind this is the slowest hiring time of the year, with holidays and vacations, and end of year budgets.Even in down markets, hiring tends to pick up in January as managers get their hiring budgets for the new year and are back in the office.Hang in there!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wow. This gives a lot of false positives, but it found all ~10 of my old accounts over the years.The most interesting thing is that my writing style changed pretty drastically since a decade ago. Searching for my oldest account matches my earliest usernames, whereas searching this account matched the rest.The details of the algorithm are fascinating: https://stylometry.net/about Mostly because of how simple it is. I assumed it would measure word embeddings against a trained ML model, but nothing so fancy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The method used, i.e. to calculate the cosine of the two authors&#39; word vectors, is poorly suited for stylometric analysis because it is based on a poster&#39;s lexicon and the word frequencies of each word, but ignoring stylistically relevant factors like word order.Also, the cosine of the vectors of word frequencies conflates author-specific vocabulary and topics; in other words, my account is grouped (with &gt;51% similarity, according to the demo) with someone probably because we wrote about similar things. A strong stylometric matcher ought to be robust against topic shifts (our personal writing style is what stays constant when we move from writing about one topic to writing about another topic, just like our personality is what stays constant about our behavior over time - of course styles do change, but the premise then has to be that such changes happen very slowly).Stylometrics/authorship identification is interesting and has led to some surprising findings, e.g. in forensic linguistics (Malcolm Coulthard wrote several good books about the topic).This paper lists some other features that could be used and compares a bunch of techniques: https://research.ijcaonline.org/volume86/number12/pxc3893384..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s interesting that the article&#39;s thesis is about reading, but most of the article is actually about writing. And I think that&#39;s an understated point. I myself wrote a blog piece about &#34;Blogging as Structured Thinking&#34; earlier this year.I think that actually plenty of people do reading in various forms of content. The real challenge is getting people to do more writing.If you want to be a thinker, you have to write.It really forces you to address your ideas more formulaically and concretizes your theses.Start a blog! If you&#39;re reading this chances are you know how to buy a domain and spin up a blog in less than 30 minutes. Try Wordpress, or hugo with templates if you want more control. And if you don&#39;t know what to write about, this link was recently shared on HN, I thought it was pretty useful: https://simonwillison.net/2022/Nov/6/what-to-blog-about/And yes, it&#39;s important to publish it. It makes your thoughts real. And ideas were meant to be shared."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Many of us are programmers. Some of us are also trying to be writers. Trust me: writing is like programming. Reading code is very useful to become a better programmer, but you learn programming mostly by writing code. Similarly you mostly learn how to write prose by writing prose, tons of it. Reading is especially useful if you identify certain books that are very high in style (for me one of such books was &#34;Vite di uomini non illustri&#34; by Giuseppe Pontiggia), for your taste at least, for what you beleive the best writing is. You read these books many times, to understand what&#39;s going on, what are the patterns, how to do the same magic. As a casual reader you can read 200 books every year and yet remain a terrible writer.EDIT: more about that on my blog if you care -&gt; http://antirez.com/news/136"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think there is clear historical evidence that this thesis is, at a minimum, greatly exaggerated.  Socrates never wrote, and I think he had more good ideas than Paul Graham ever will.  Muhammad was not even literate, and unless he was inspired by divinity, his ideas were extremely powerful.I mean, I do personally find that writing is a powerful tool for thinking.  Maybe that means that Paul Graham and I are normal, and Socrates and Muhammad were atypical.  But maybe it says more about humans-in-our-society than it does about the essential human condition.  If humans learned &#34;by tape&#34; (as per the SF books from the Silver Age, referenced in TFA&#39;s opening para), maybe idea-production would work along different lines.I admit, I tend to agree with him about the usefulness of writing.  But I think it&#39;s just an irrational intuition, not the clear argument he implies."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Yes, sequential I/O bandwidth is closing the gap to memory. [1] The I/O pattern to watch out for, and the biggest reason why e.g. databases do careful caching to memory, is that _random_ I/O is still dreadfully slow. I/O bandwidth is brilliant, but latency is still disappointing compared to memory. Not to mention, in typical Cloud workloads, IOPS are far more expensive than memory.[1]: https://github.com/sirupsen/napkin-math"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I question the methodology.To measure this I would have N processes reading the file from disk with the max number of parallel heads (typically 16 I think). These would go straight into memory. It&#39;s possible you could do this with one process and the kernel will split up the block read into 16 parallel reads as well, needs investigation.Then I would use the rest of the compute for number crunching as fast as possible using as many available cores as possible: for this problem, I think that would basically boil down to a map reduce. Possibly a lock-free concurrent hashmap could be competitive.Now, run these in parallel and measure the real time from start to finish of both. Also gets the total CPU time spent for reference.I&#39;m pretty sure the author&#39;s results are polluted: while they are processing data the kernel is caching the next block. Also, it&#39;s not really fair to compare single threaded disk IO to a single process: one of the reasons for IO being a bottleneck is that it has concurrency constraints. Never the less I would be interested in both the single threaded and concurrent results."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I haven’t shown an optimized Python version because it’s hard to optimize Python much further! (I got the time down from 8.4 to 7.5 seconds). It’s as fast as it is because the core operations are happening in C code – that’s why it so often doesn’t matter that “Python is slow”.An obvious optimization would be to utilize all available CPU cores by using the MapReduce pattern with multiple threads.I believe that&#39;d be necessary for a fair conclusion anyway, as you can&#39;t claim that I/O isn&#39;t the bottleneck, without utilizing all of the available CPU and memory resources."</p>

For me, this is the moment I realized AI art had become something &#34;useful&#34;, and the world isn&#39;t going to be the same.I can see where this is going... The commercial implications are enormous. Speeding up the concept art process for movies, etc.  As someone here mentioned, why not make entire movies this way?  Once they figure out how to animate this stuff, it puts the movie industry out of business.I can only imagine what my grandkids are going to be using this for."</p>

The content at the link the OP posted appears to be an oversimplified, high level and naive overview"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have absolutely loved working in genomics. I am a huge believer that genomics will be a huge part of healthcare in the future, and i have two examples to motivate that point that I think may be interesting to the reader.1) The Moderna vaccine was made with the help of illumina genome sequencing. They were able to sequence the virus and send that sequence of nucleotides over to moderna for them to develop the vaccine - turning a classically biology problem, into a software problem, reducing the need for them to bring the virus in house.2) Illumina has a cancer screening test called Galleri, that can identify a bunch of cancers from a blood test. It identifies mutated dna released by cancer cells. This is huge, if we can identify cancer before someone even starts to show symptoms, the chances of having a useful treatment dramatically go up.Disclaimer: I work for illumina, views my own.I wrote some more about why genomics is cool from a technical point of view here (truly big data, hardware accelerated bioinformatics) : https://dddiaz.com/post/genomics-is-cool/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Really glad to see this, but it reminds me of the earlier HN post that said engineers don&#39;t go into genomics because it doesn&#39;t pay and requires a lot of investment in learning biology."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There’s an alternate way to save space: the discrete Hartley transform.https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27386319https://twitter.com/theshawwn/status/1400383554673065984  dht(x) = fft( (1 + 1j)*x ).real / area(x)**0.5

  area(x) = np.prod(np.shape(x))

The dht is its own inverse, which is a neat trick. No need for an inverse fft. In other words, dht(dht(x)) == x.Notice that the output is the real component of the fft. That means the storage required is exactly identical to the input signal. And since the input signal is copied to the real and imaginary components (1 + 1j)*x, the intermediate representation size is also equal to the input signal size. (Just take sin and cos of the input signal.)The dht has almost all the same properties of the fft. You can blur an image by taking a hamming window and multiplying. You can resize an image by fftshift + pad with zeros + fftshift. Etc.In practice the dht seems to have all the benefits of fft with very few downsides. I’m amazed it isn’t more popular."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oof, that sucks and I feel for you. That said...&gt; setting up in a new region would be complicated for us.Sounds to me like you&#39;ve got a few weeks to get this working. Deprioritize all other work, get everyone working on this little DevOps/Infra project. You should&#39;ve been multi-region from the outset, if not multi-cloud.When using the public cloud, we do tend to take it all for granted and don&#39;t even think about the fact that physical hardware is required for our clusters and that, yes, they can run out.Anyways, however hard getting another region set up may be, it seems you&#39;ve no choice but to prioritize that work now. May also want to look into other cloud providers as well, depending on how practical or how overkill going multi-cloud may or may not be for your needs.I wish you luck."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is nothing new, Azure has been having capacity problem for over a year now[1]. Germany is not the only region affected at all, it&#39;s the case for a number of instance types in some of their larger US regions as well. In the meantime you can still commit to reserved instances, there is just not a guarantee of getting those instances when you need them.The biggest advice I can give is 1. keep trying and grabbing capacity continuously, then run with more than what you need. 2. Explore migrating to another Azure region that runs less constrained.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Great potato story. Loosely related story here. My late grandfather in Belarus (the land of potatoes) loved potatoes just like everyone around. Well, he was an electrician at the concrete/brick making factory for entirety of his career, from right after the war until he retired in the late 80ies. The amount of electricity used to fire the kilns for bricks is well known to be huge. He said that they&#39;d see the rats scutter along the power lines on the wall and every once in a while they&#39;d touch the rails wrong and disappear in the scintillating disintegration. Oh, and he let me weld random junk together with his own cobbled together electrical welding kit when I was like 8, oh I loved that so much. I miss him."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ah I thought this would be a new take on that apocryphal bayesian story&gt;An engineer draws a random sample of electron tubes and measures their voltage. The measurements range from 75 to 99 volts. A statistician computes the sample mean and a confidence interval for the true mean. Later the statistician discovers that the voltmeter reads only as far as 100, so the population appears to be &#39;censored&#39;. This necessitates a new analysis, if the statistician is orthodox. However, the engineer says he has another meter reading to 1000 volts, which he would have used if any voltage had been over 100. This is a relief to the statistician, because it means the population was effectively uncensored after all. But, the next day the engineer informs the statistician that this second meter was not working at the time of the measuring. The statistician ascertains that the engineer would not have held up the measurements until the meter was fixed, and informs him that new measurements are required. The engineer is astounded. &#34;Next you&#39;ll be asking about my oscilloscope&#34;."</p>

We literally manage our domain in GCP but they wouldn&#39;t accept that we own our own domain and thus won&#39;t let us use our domain with Workspaces, which screws you out of a lot of Google functionality. Never seen a company that was too incompetent to allow users to use its own product and make zero attempt to solve the customer&#39;s problem.Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian said &#34;We need scale to be profitable.&#34; No, you need to stop treating your customers like crap to be profitable. We don&#39;t trust you, you are a pain in our asses, and we have alternatives, so there is really no need for us to spend our money on you. It&#39;s now a matter of when we all move to AWS and Azure, not if."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow I&#39;m really sorry this happened to you. I do believe your conclusions are correct about AWS. Azure generally seems fine too.Google&#39;s aversion to customer service makes them extremely dangerous as a cloud provider in my mind. This also goes for other critical business services, like Gsuite (I know! It&#39;s convenient).If you have GCP or Gsuite now and you&#39;re trying to evaluate how big of a deal it is my suggestion would be to pick up a phone and attempt to talk with someone at Google about your account. This experience can act as a preview of what that process might look like when services are turned off.If you try to call Amazon on the other hand it feels like Jeff Bezos might hop on the call if things aren&#39;t going well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In the beginning of the year, I was recommended by a friend working at Google to test GCP using the tutorials on https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/Google banned my account while I was doing one tutorial. One step failed, the provisioning of something, and I had to redo a few things again. It succeeded but I had used more egress bandwidth than allowed to run the tutorial correctly so they banned me automatically a few minutes later.The support unbanned me after some time but I thought it was a sign to not use GCP yet."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a wonderful article. Thanks for sharing. As always, Cloudflare blog posts do not disappoint.It’s very interesting that they are essentially treating IP addresses as “data”. Once looking at the problem from a distributed system lens, the solution here can be mapped to distributed systems almost perfectly.- Replicating a piece of data on every host in the fleet is expensive, but fast and reliable. The compromise is usually to keep one replica in a region; same as how they share a single /32 IP address in a region.- “sending datagram to IP X” is no different than “fetching data X from a distributed system”. This is essentially the underlying philosophy of the soft-unicast. Just like data lives in a distributed system/cloud, you no longer know where is an IP address located.It’s ingenious.They said they don’t like stateful NAT, which is understandable. But the load balancer has to be stateful still to perform the routing correctly. It would be an interesting follow up blog post talking about how they coordinate port/data movements (moving a port from server A to server B), as it’s state management (not very different from moving data in a distributed system again)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Whenever I see the name Marek Majkowski come up, I know the blog post is going to be good.I had to solve this exact problem a year ago when attempting to build an anycast forward proxy, quickly came to the conclusion that it&#39;d be impossible without a massive infrastructure presence. Ironically I was using CF connections to debug how they might go about this problem, when I realized they were just using local unicast routes for egress traffic I stopped digging any deeper.Maintaining a routing table in unimog to forward lopsided egress connections to the correct DC is brilliant and shows what is possible when you have a global network to play with, however I wonder if this opens up an attack vector where previously distributed connections are now being forwarded &amp; centralized at a single DC, especially if they are all destined for the same port slice..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; However, while anycast works well in the ingress direction, it can&#39;t operate on egress. Establishing an outgoing connection from an anycast IP won&#39;t work. Consider the response packet. It&#39;s likely to be routed back to a wrong place - a data center geographically closest to the sender, not necessarily the source data center!Slightly OT question, but why wouldn&#39;t this be a problem with ingress, too?E.g. suppose I want to send a request to https://1.2.3.4. What I don&#39;t know is that 1.2.3.4 is an anycast address.So my client sends a SYN packet to 1.2.3.4:443 to open the connection. The packet is routed to data center #1. The data center duly replies with a SYN/ACK packet, which my client answers with an ACK packet.However, due to some bad luck, the ACK packet is routed to data center #2 which is also a destination for the anycast address.Of course, data center #2 doesn&#39;t know anything about my connection, so it just drops the ACK or replies with a RST. In the best case, I can eventually resend my ACK and reach the right data center (with multi-second delay), in the worst case, the connection setup will fail.Why does this not happen on ingress, but is a problem for egress?Even if the handshake uses SYN cookies and got through on data center #2, what would keep subsequent packets that I send on that connection from being routed to random data centers that don&#39;t know anything about the connection?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; 99.9% of websites on the Internet will only let you create one account for each email address. So if you want to see if an email address has an account, try signing up for a new account with the same email address.This is not true if the signup flow is implemented correctly. Signing up for an account should always respond with the same message &#34;we sent an email for you to confirm your account signup&#34;. The owner of that email address then receives an email - either 1) normal signup process, or 2) &#34;did you just try to sign up? You already have a valid account for this email address.&#34;This way you cannot tell via the signup web form alone whether an account exists or not. You need to have access to the email address."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"But the error message can be true. If you mistype your username, you might have entered another, existing username. Just telling the user &#39;wrong password&#39; will mean they are less likely to check that the username was correct.The website doesn&#39;t always know which one you got wrong, and assuming one way or the other just makes things worse."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t get it. It&#39;s fine to leak/allow user enumeration on the login page because it&#39;s leaked elsewhere anyway? That&#39;s a pretty big assumption.One way to allow users to register using their email address without leaking any information is to just say &#34;user created, please check your inbox to confirm your email address&#34; or something like that. If the user already exists, swap the confirmation email for a warning email if they already have an account.Or am I missing something?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I used to work for a large mobile network, we would spend ages testing the firmware of new devices. Even giants (at the time) like Nokia would release phones which couldn&#39;t dial the emergency services, or put out more than the legal limit of radiation, or were in other ways defective.We&#39;d test, send a report back, wait a few weeks, get a new firmware, test again, repeat until everything worked. It took months. That was fine when phones weren&#39;t expected to be updated by users.But when more modern phones arrived with flashable firmware, customers couldn&#39;t stand the delays associated with testing.  They&#39;d see a new firmware had been released and complained that the mobile network operators were delaying progress, dragging our feet, deliberately depriving customers of something cool.The fact was, operators very often didn&#39;t certify the firmware because it contained *dangerous* bugs.  I&#39;m sure there was also a cost element - why pay to re-test a phone that you&#39;re no longer selling? - but that wasn&#39;t the primary driver.Well, the manufacturers and customers &#34;won&#34;. If you buy a phone through your network, it probably has a network-certified firmware blob.  If not, you&#39;re at the mercy of the manufacturer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article, dating back to January, lays it out pretty clearly: https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/01/google-fixes-nightma...&gt; If you&#39;re logged out, launching Microsoft Teams 10 times will result in 10 duplicate PhoneAccounts from Teams clogging your phone. Teams shouldn&#39;t do this, and Microsoft&#39;s update stopped Teams from doing this, but a bunch of duplicate PhoneAccounts also shouldn&#39;t be enough to bring Android&#39;s phone system to its knees.&gt; Next bug: when picking a PhoneAccount to run the emergency call through, [...] it&#39;s possible for this to result in an integer overflow or underflow, and now the phone subsystem is going to crash.&gt; A third bug in this mess is that Microsoft Teams does not even register itself as an emergency call handler.&gt; An update is not arriving for the Pixel 6 yet. Google&#39;s newest flagship is going though a bit of an update crisis at the moment. The December 2021 update was pulled due to unrelated &#34;mobile connectivity issues&#34; (phone calls don&#39;t work). While Google scrambles to fix everything, the next Pixel 6 update with this 911 fix is due in &#34;late January.&#34; Until then, it&#39;s normal to be on the November patch. Both of Google&#39;s &#34;early January&#34; and &#34;late January&#34; patch timelines seem incredibly slow for a bug that could cause users to literally die.If the OP article is correct, then apparently this still hasn&#39;t actually been fixed yet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m all over the place with pocket computing devices and remain confused.  I once has an iphone.  Beautifully crafted, both inside and out, but so frustratingly locked down that I was desperate to leave it behind.  They have progressively opened up the platform, but it always lags behind (I remember I couldn&#39;t access the cloud storage from anything other than a mac).My favourite devices have been more alternative.  E90 running symbian, which was fairly &#39;open&#39; for its time - I could install any software, proper multitasking.  The N900 also, full linux system, great phone.  But then the apps I find useful, are often not available for that platform.At the moment I&#39;m on Pixel, which has been a good balance between being well supported, while still fairly open.  I can sideload apps, run a linux distro in the form of termux.  As a bonus the camera is great.  I have to remind myself that while it might not quite compare to iphones in terms of refinement and hardware, I do at least have more freedom on the platform, and it&#39;s easy to take that for granted until you lose it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I recall from my time in Google Geo years ago that the idea of integrating Search and Maps was a big part of the &#34;New Maps&#34; release that happened around 2014. The rumor I heard was that someone (possibly even Larry himself) wanted to be able to have interactive maps directly on the search results page, so that the navigation from a search query to a map wouldn&#39;t involve even a page reload. So the big Maps frontend rewrite actually ended up merging MFE into GWS, the web search frontend server. I recall seeing maps hosted at google.com/maps around that time, but I don&#39;t know if that was ever launched fully or if it was just an experiment.In any case, though, my understanding is that the technical capacity for this has existed for nearly 10 years now, just behind a configuration setting. So it&#39;s possible that this change is just a code cleanup. It&#39;s also possible that someone is trying to increase the percentage of searches that have location information, that doesn&#39;t seem terribly far-fetched either, and I can imagine lots of ways people could try to rationalize it as actually benefiting users. (Whether it actually does benefit users is of course debatable.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a fantastic example of motivated reasoning. This &#34;change&#34; (which apparently isn&#39;t even new) can have so many different reasons, some of which are less harmful and some of which are probably worse (privacy-wise) than the one mentioned here. There is no indication that re/mis-using permissions is specifically what they wanted to do here, there is also no example of them doing it right now. Don&#39;t get me wrong, there is also no evidence that this isn&#39;t the real reason and that they wouldn&#39;t do that in the future. But the blog post basically list a single symptom and jumps right to the one conclusion that fits what the author expects."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Funny thing is, it depends on your threat model.Using google.com/XXX for all its services protect the user from being spied by external actors such as ISP because everything is hidden behind HTTPS.Whereas, with XXX.google.com, external actors knows that you are using service XXX."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Amazon is the third largest advertising company after Google and Meta. Its ad revenue is $32B (and growing fast, the run rate is $40B). That is half the revenue of AWS, which is worth 70% of Amazon&#39;s market cap. The inescapable conclusion is that Amazon&#39;s advertising is worth the remaining 30% of Amazon&#39;s market cap and Amazon&#39;s e-commerce arm is deemed worthless by Wall Street, its only purpose being to support the advertising business, just what Google Search is to Alphabet.Think on that for a moment. The other inescapable conclusion is that whenever the quality of the shopping experience on Amazon and the needs of Amazon&#39;s advertising business clash, advertising will win (just as it has on Google). That&#39;s an even more foregone conclusion since Andy Jassy took on the top job, he&#39;s from AWS and owes no special allegiance to the historical e-commerce business."</p>

Closely scrutinise 1 and 2 star reviews.But sometimes even this _still_ doesn&#39;t get me quite what I want, because when an item is sold both by Amazon and a 3rd-party it can be sorted based on the non-Amazon price.It does feel just a little like Amazon&#39;s goals might not be perfectly aligned with those of the customer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"So the 8 pin modular connector(rj-45) may not be the best connector in the world(the 8088 sas connector is a serious contender for that honor), but it does one thing better than any most connectors, it is designed to be field terminated, and as such is easy to fix. the crimping dies are ubiquitous, the process is simple. because of this single fact, I think it is better than just about any other connector in widespread use. because you can fix the infernal thing.As such the article left me a bit confused, why not just cut off the end and putting a new plug on? with an 8 pin connector this is very easy. But I am in the industry and tend to have a crimper close to hand. perhaps some are not as fortunate."</p>

For the next one, I&#39;ll try to focus on making the codebase fully ready for multi-entities and introduce a Project Board. Later we can add support for code review!If you are looking for how it works, you can have a look at the data model introduction[2].git-bug is only pushed forward by volunteers so it&#39;s taking its time to fully grow, so I&#39;ll take the opportunity to welcome everyone to join the fun :-)[1]: https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/releases/tag/v0.8.0[2]: https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/blob/master/doc/model..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Around 2010-2015 there were a whole bunch of these distributed git bugtrackers and none of them took off.  Most are completely dead.  IIRC one of the biggest problems was its feature: issue state being distributed as it is, it was very easy for developers to end up with issues having different states/comments, and depending on the implementation even differed across local branches.  But also in a work environment there was no place for project managers to view/create/update issues.I remember listing out 4-5 of these in the past when the topic has come up, but the only old one I can remember/find right now is https://github.com/dspinellis/git-issueEdit - Found some more using duckduckgo instead of google:* https://github.com/jashmenn/ditz (last update 12 years ago)* https://bugseverywhere.org/ (I think this was the most popular at one point)* https://github.com/marekjm/issue (this is separate from git-issue above)* A blog post from 2012 that lists these and a few others (half the links are dead): http://www.cs.unb.ca/~bremner/blog/posts/git-issue-trackers/From the blog post, the additional ones where the links still work:* https://github.com/chilts/cil (last updated 11 years ago)* http://syncwith.us/sd/ (last updated 6 years ago)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I understand why the bug IDs are hashes, but that&#39;s going to be pretty inconvenient for practical use. Yes I know we manage it with Git commit names, but bug IDs are printed and spoken much more than commits, e.g. when communicating with a test team, management, or even in release notes.I wonder if we could use some sort of distributed naming scheme for this, similar to Blockchain DNS?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Valve&#39;s continual focus on Linux (SteamOS 1.0 was released eight years ago) is honestly incredible, Proton even sometimes works better than native Linux builds. Truly nobody else (in the gaming space) is doing it like Valve are. I saw a talk[1] from a KDE dev talking about features Valve sponsored to be added to KDE Plasma and it&#39;s things that are useful for everyone outside the context of the steam deck.The only thing that doesn&#39;t really work I&#39;ve noticed is when games have an online component, whether it&#39;s like easy anti cheat which I&#39;ve heard should be just flipping a switch to enable but I haven&#39;t seen anyone actually do that,  or some weirdness happening with whatever the new Microsoft Flight Simulator is doing that makes it seemingly a 50/50 coin toss as to whether it&#39;ll run with the exact same settings.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0gEIeFgDX0"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Proton was instrumental in my move from Windows to Linux. With over 400 games in my back catalog, I didn&#39;t want to lose thousands of dollars not to mention thousands of hours on games which I enjoy.Thus far, 92% of games have ran flawlessly for me on Fedora (4 failures in the last 50). The main issues have been related to games that have kernel mode drivers for copy protection or other exotic types of anti-cheat. Perhaps most amazing (to me anyway) is the fact that mods and workshop items work perfectly. In most cases, I could pop open a saved game and continue on Linux, custom mods included.Performance-wise, I haven&#39;t noticed a difference but I generally run very modern hardware which works better with the DirectX to Vulcan implementation. I also swapped to an AMD chip/gpu when moving to Linux and I think that removed the headaches that people often have with Nvidia drivers. Overall, it&#39;s been fantastic."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had to go figure out what Proton is:&#34;Proton is a tool for use with the Steam client which allows games which are exclusive to Windows to run on the Linux operating system. It uses Wine to facilitate this.&#34;https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton"</p>

Most &#34;You might like this&#34; algorithms go straight for the low-hanging fruit, and often fail to take any kind of nuance into account.I can&#39;t tell you how many of the streaming services will see my Black Sabbath play history and immediately recommend, &#34;If you like Black Sabbath, you should love...Slipknot!&#34; But I&#39;ve never had a real person make that mistake, because a real person who looks at my last.fm history and has an understanding of the genre says &#34;Gee, this guy has plenty of Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden, and tons of doom metal on his list, but doesn&#39;t have Slipknot, Korn, or Pantera in his history.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Last.fm died (as in for me personally) when I stopped cultivating my own music library. I used to have gigabytes of MP3s and FLACs, all neatly organised into folders, usually by artist/album, and meticulously maintained ID3 tags. All played through software like Winamp with the audioscrobbler plugin, or iTunes when I had my beloved iPod classic.All of that drifted away as I got older, and the dawn of streaming services like Spotify came onto the scene. I&#39;m not sure where my music is now, probably on a hard drive somewhere, dumped amongst other junk.I think spotify used to come with last.fm support but I think I just lost interest in the whole thing, I don&#39;t consume music in the same way as when I was a younger man.EDIT: Just logged into my last.fm account and it looks like the scrobbling still works from spotify, so it&#39;s been scrobbling all this time, probably for 10+ years without me logging in!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Contrary to popular belief Last.fm never really died (and I hope it never will), however it lost years ago its most valuable thing: *its own streaming service*.It was just perfect at everything, was it finding new releases, discovery obscure gems, or play your favorite things all over. It was so magical that you could hardly believe it was computer generated.Also, it was a wonderful &#34;sane&#34; social network where music and only music was at its heart: no vanity metrics (eg: counting likes) / vanity egos (eg: influencers) or purely material interests (eg: make money from this or that).Anyway, it&#39;s sad it lost the streaming war pretty soon. Maybe it was just too genuine to compete with services driven by dark patterns, suspicious agendas, and mostly, greed.Wait, is this a metaphor of the old internet versus the present state of digital affairs? Or am I just getting nostalgic here?I don&#39;t know. Long live Last.fm!111,920 Scrobbles from 9,137 Artists since Jul 2006."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s a liquid-sodium-cooled, graphite-core system with no need for pumps, aka &#39;passively cooled&#39; via heat [edit] pipes. Output is:&gt; &#34;The microreactor can generate 5 MW of electricity or 13 MW of heat from a 15 MW thermal core. Exhaust heat from the power conversion system can be used for district heating applications or low-temperature steam.&#34;Control systems are kind of interesting:&gt; &#34;The only moving or mechanical parts in the reactor system are reactivity control drums, which manage the power level and allow absorber material to passively turn inward toward the core if power demand is reduced or lost, and turn a reflector material toward the core if demand increases automatically. Hence the term “nuclear battery.”&#34;I&#39;m generally not a nuclear advocate but if they&#39;ve really managed to eliminate the need for active cooling, and have a robust system that can safely shut down with concerns about meltdown even without external power, that&#39;s a pretty big advance.  Looks remarkably promising... keep your fingers crossed. (New nuclear tech hasn&#39;t had the greatest track record over the past several decades, i.e. pebble beds didn&#39;t work out etc.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If the price is right and medium size communities could get their acts together, something like this could potentially disrupt the entire grid model. In California, regardless of what wholesale electricity costs, the retail cost is something like $200/MWh more than could be considered reasonable. Put another way, the utility (PG&amp;E) is charging an immense premium.  Normally, displacing PG&amp;E would be impractical:a. The actual transmission system is a phenomenally large capital investment developed over many decades.  You can’t just VC up a new electric grid in a developed area.  And the incumbent mostly owns the existing infrastructure.b. Regulation, good and bad.It’s possible to sell power to the utility for a reasonable price per MWh.  But one can’t easily sell to the utility’s customers.But this reactor is small!  5 MW could serve maybe 1000 expensive homes in an expensive area without an enormous transmission system.  Anyone trying to disrupt the incumbent utility with something like this has $200/MWh of inefficiency to exploit. $24k per day of operation will offset a decent amount of capital cost and regulatory effort to get the electricity to customers.Put another way, a wealthy community could buy a few of these, figure out local distribution, and ditch the incumbent utility. This could be fantastic."</p>

Then the second speaker got up, and spent his entire presentation telling why the first person was an idiot and totally wrong and his research was garbage because his was better.  That&#39;s how I found out my field of study was broken into two warring factions, who spent the rest of the conference arguing with each other.I left the conference somewhat disillusioned, having learned the important life lesson that just because you&#39;re a scientist doesn&#39;t mean you aren&#39;t also a human, with all the lovely human characteristics that entails.

One of the things that improved my flex usage was using Penpot to draw my designs before implementing them.They have alignment properties for graphical elements that work like flex&#39;s justify-content and align-items properties so once you design a view in Penpot it becomes almost trivial to translate it into HTML/CSS using flex.It really changed my mindset from working with relative or absolute positioning, blocks, margins, padding, etc... to simply working with flex everywhere.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;I like to think of CSS as a collection of layout modes. Each layout mode is an algorithm that can implement or redefine each CSS property. We provide an algorithm with our CSS declarations (key/value pairs), and the algorithm decides how to use them.&#34;Brilliant. The way basic CSS properties are taught often ignores the layout mode. Even MDN does not mention that &#34;width&#34; is a CSS property that is not always respected when &#34;display: flex&#34;.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Coppicing, Hedge laying, Bocage, drystone walling, wattle-and-daub are all domestic comparable ancient crafts of Europe. The point being that probably only drystone walling is valued in a way comparable to the Japanese version of Coppicing, which really has been transformed into an artform. European coppices are cut close to the rootstock and cut down far younger for use as poles, for wood turning, for hedge laying.Timber framed construction in Europe was nailless (wooden tree nails permitted) but the mortice and tenon joinery of Japan is in another league. Maybe European Gothic cathedral roofs come close, little else would.Japan modernised in the modern era, it&#39;s industrial revolution was comparatively recent and it remained feudal far longer than Europe (Russian serfdom aside)There are probably more continuous family heritage firms in Japan practising some art (brewing, soy sauce, woodwork, coppicing) than anywhere else. Can you name a European family concern doing the same thing continuously since before 1600? I can&#39;t name any Japanese ones but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if there were many. Institutional enterprises like Oxford university press exist since deep time, but in Japan it would be a continuous lineage of printers continuing to use woodblock printing (maybe alongside hot type or photo typesetting)Farming does remain in the family but European farming practices have modernised since forever."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Everyone here is mentioning coppicing, so I suspect there will be some interest in the Low Tech Magazine articles on the subject:https://www.lowtechmagazine.com/coppicing/And since we&#39;re talking about doing cool things with trees, I just wanted to mention that LTM has more interesting articles slightly &#34;adjacent&#34; to this topic, like this one about a half-forgotten technique for growing citrus trees in climates with freezing temperatures:https://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2020/04/fruit-trenches-culti..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wish there was a way to apply this technique to some of the rarer woods that have fantastic uses in production, like teak, rosewood, and grenadilla.If you&#39;re into hardwoods like musical instruments or fine furniture there&#39;s an appreciation you grow for the character of these woods. And a moral quandary with the sourcing of it. It seems impossible to find a sustainable method to source the material. A lot of what we make today will seem impossible in the coming decades.Grenadilla trees in particular are suffering due to over harvesting and poor oversight in the markets where it is sourced. It is prized for woodwind instruments - and the day is coming where it&#39;s only going to be economical to use recycled polymer composites (which have many benefits besides commercial) over true solid wood instruments. If we could sustainably turn these trees into fruit trees harvested over centuries it would be a great service to nature and the industry."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Is there a good explanation of how to train this from scratch with a custom dataset[0]?I&#39;ve been looking around the documentation on Huggingface, but all I could find was either how to train unconditional U-Nets[1], or how to use the pretrained Stable Diffusion model to process image prompts (which I already know how to do). Writing a training loop for CLIP manually wound up with me banging against all sorts of strange roadblocks and missing bits of documentation, and I still don&#39;t have it working. I&#39;m pretty sure I also need some other trainables at some point, too.[0] Specifically, Wikimedia Commons images in the PD-Art-100 category, because the images will be public domain in the US and the labels CC-BY-SA. This would rule out a lot of the complaints people have about living artists&#39; work getting scraped into the machine; and probably satisfy Debian&#39;s ML guidelines.[1] Which actually does work"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am a solo dev working on a creative content creation app to leverage the latest developments in AI.Demoing even the v1 of stable diffusion to the non-technical general users blows them away completely.Now that v2 is here, it’s clear we’re not able to keep pace in developing products to take advantage of it.The general public still is blown away by autosuggest in mobile OS keyboards. Very few really know how far AI tech has evolved.Huge market opportunity for folks wanting to ride the wave here.This is exciting for me personally, since I can keep plugging in newer and better versions of these models into my app and it becomes better.Even some of the tech folks I demo my app to, are simply amazed how I can manage to do this solo."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In addition to removing NSFW images from the training set, this 2.0 release apparently also removed commercial artist styles and celebrities [1]. While it should be possible to fine tune this model to create them anyway using DreamBooth or a similar approach, they clearly went for the safe route after taking some heat.1. https://twitter.com/emostaque/status/1595731407095140352?s=4..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s nice but could you make it so that the rotation direction can additionally be toggled by holding down shift while clicking? I find it very irritating to always move the mouse to the bottom right corner to select the rotation direction - especially since &#34;every click counts&#34;.Other than that, I first thought that some of the tiles should start with correct orientation but soon realized that would make this puzzle just really easy, because our brains are just excellent at seeing the correct image from just a few correctly oriented tiles I think."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like how well this specific picture works for this puzzle. The coastline lines up perfectly with a square border. The cat&#39;s face is sideways. The two steps are the same color, so the rotation could be in one of two possible positions. It makes it just tricky enough to make the right answer not immediately obvious, but it&#39;s not so hard that there&#39;s any chance for being frustrated. Plus, it&#39;s a kitty."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I can attest to this and took all of my notes on paper in college. However, once I started a real job I realized that this strategy doesn&#39;t scale to all situations. In college, I needed to be able to recall all of the information I had ingested: it was low-write, high-read. In the workplace, there&#39;s much more information, but I&#39;m unlikely to need most of it: it&#39;s high-write, low-read. I need to be able to reference the information, but not necessarily recall it. Taking paper notes became too much of a burden and I moved to a wiki of markdown notes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you&#39;re in charge of other people, it&#39;s worth noting that some very common cognitive problems like ADHD, Dysgraphia, and Dyslexia negate these benefits in some affected people. The cognitive load of making legible marks can become high enough to become the focus, rather than the actual content. Pressuring someone already struggling with working memory to do things like this, is counterproductive, if not demoralizing. Work style advice is great, but make sure you listen if they say it doesn&#39;t work for them rather than getting into the &#34;it worked for me so you must be doing it wrong&#34; mindset."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d be curious if anyone had good advice on how to improve your handwriting ability well into adulthood (I&#39;m 35). My penmanship was so bad in grade school that I attended special education classes to improve it, but it still was and remains horrible. This is a source of insecurity for me and since I&#39;ve always been glued to a keyboard it has been easy to handwave away as &#34;screw this, the world is all typing-based anyhow&#34;.But I have seen evidence before that handwriting notes leads to improved retention, and seeing it here now, I&#39;m wondering if there&#39;s a framework or resource that can help me feel a little bit more confident in my ability to, you know...write words with pen and paper. It&#39;s embarrassing even talking about it, honestly."</p>

No, we don&#39;t watch anything like 6 hours of TV a day. We have our evening meal, like every meal, at a table. We mostly watch one thing a day on streaming, usually well made fiction.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The question is not now much time you spend at a screen, but who is on
the other side of it.Much of the conversation so far concerns time, and the virtues or
vices of how we spend it. Not all pastimes are equal. Knitting a
jumper, taking a hike, or skateboarding are actions one performs on or
in the world. Reading a book is more of an action that the world (the
author especially) performs upon you. It is a different frame. Movies
and video gaming are somewhere in the middle. Some media forms, such
as daytime trash-TV and TiKTok are at the extreme of the
passive/receptive frame. It is a pipeline of affect directly to your
hypothalamus. Any discussion of harms or benefits must be understood
in that light."</p>

The iOS App Store only comes on iOS devices, it comes on all iOS devices, and it is the only way to access a crucial feature of the device. It is, for all meaningful purposes, part of the iPhone in the same way iOS is.It would be a bit like Microsoft saying &#34;explorer.exe? Policy A only covers the OS, and that is clearly not part of Windows! - so therefore you are covered by Policy B&#34;. While Apple may be legally in the right, I strongly believe they are morally in the wrong and have betrayed the trust their users put in them to safeguard their privacy.I believe that a casual user of the iPhone would take a look at Apple&#39;s iPhone privacy policy and expect that to apply to the iOS App Store as well, as for all intents and purposes that is a part of the iPhone."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Not many people want to trust an AI with spending their money or buying an item without seeing a picture or reading reviews.I wonder how much the decline in quality of Amazon&#39;s marketplace has affected other parts of the company&#39;s business including Alexa. I remember a time when, if I wanted to buy something online, I&#39;d just buy off Amazon without shopping around. They almost always had the best price, their shipping was fast, and I trusted the quality of what I received. In that world, I could see myself saying my shopping list out lout to an Echo to make things easier.But in Amazon&#39;s current free-for-all marketplace, I would never do that. Now I typically check traditional big box stores first, and only go with Amazon if I can&#39;t find what I need elsewhere."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Perhaps a silly question, but can somebody describe how they might lose $10 billion on Alexa in one year? I don&#39;t understand the math. That&#39;s enough to pay 33,000 employees $330k a year, or some recombination of such.  I don&#39;t think the real numbers come even remotely close to that.So it presumably has to be hardware costs, but Alexa is software, and they have vertical integration of all servers which presumably would drive voice processing costs to negligible levels as well (and that&#39;s assuming 0 on-device caching/learning ability). And this is all assuming that the gross revenue generated by Alexa is $0, which also certainly isn&#39;t true. So I don&#39;t see where the numbers are coming from?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I use my Alexa all the time, but 99% of it is:Alexa, time!
Alexa, set an alarm for 5 minutes!
Alexa how many minutes left?
Alexa, turn off/on all the lights!That’s basically it.  I wrote some apps for it a long time ago to do custom stuff like read me some Reddit pages, but the SDK changed or something and eventually they just died and it wasn’t obvious to me how to recreate it/not worth the effort.  I really wish there was an easy way to just put python scripts onto the device or something.  The process of going through Amazon is pretty unnecessarily complex and annoying.I know there are ways of doing this stuff with raspberry pi, but also: not really worth the effort.  If I cared that much I’d just make a PWA for my house and give that to my wife and kids."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My current employer was sold to me as a &#34;high documentation&#34; place. What it means in practice is that if you&#39;re trying to do something there are 5 outdated documents describing the decision making process for how the project was run, and no documents about how to actually use the resulting software. Occasionally if you ask how to actually do a task in Slack someone will yell at you that you should have searched for a specific, obscurely named document in Google Drive, Confluence, or Github. We&#39;ve tried a bunch of search tools which successfully surface the million product documents, design documents, PM reports, planning docs, retro docs and standup and oncall notes related to any feature, none of which are up to date."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m convinced that documentation, even for large companies, should just be an Obsidian vault of markdown files maintained via git which is just rendered on the web either using a simple static site generator or using Obsidian Publish. When I brought this up at my last company it got dismissed as being &#39;too technical&#39;.I know git can be tricky but it cannot be that difficult to teach people from non technical departments add, commit and push and then show maybe one person from each department how to solve conflicts. Alternatively, build non technical people a web interface for editing and committing but allow the devs to just use git as standard. Or there&#39;s Obsidian&#39;s built in sync but I don&#39;t know enough about it to know if it scales well in large organisations.What absolutely is definitely not the solution is Confluence. I have not met anyone who has a positive thing to say about it. The only reason it is being so widely used is because it satisfies whoever is in charge of the finances because it comes bundled with Bitbucket and Jira."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Moving to America from France, one of my biggest surprises was how poor the average engineer (person really, but engineers affect me directly at work) is at summarizing concepts clearly.I learned a little later that &#34;summary&#34; exercises are not a thing taught in school here, which surprised me. In France, &#34;le résumé&#34; is an exercise that they constantly drill into students (particularly technical ones), in which you take a 3 page paper and condense it into 100 words. I really hated doing it back in the day, but as an adult I now am very grateful I did and wished other countries made this more prevalent."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi HN, I&#39;m Alex, at Terrastruct, where we&#39;ve been making D2. This actually popped up on HN a couple months back, though it wasn&#39;t ready, e.g. not open source yet. It is now!We also put up a site for you to compare D2 with MermaidJS, Graphviz, and PlantUML: https://text-to-diagram.com.Full disclosure, we&#39;re a for-profit company. The open-core part is that we make an alternative layout engine which we sell (Jetbrains model, i.e. your copy is your&#39;s forever if you&#39;ve paid for 12+ months). It&#39;s not packaged with D2, so you won&#39;t see it if you don&#39;t want it. D2 is perfectly usable without it, and integrates with multiple free open source layout engines (e.g. the one that Mermaid uses, &#34;dagre&#34;, is D2&#39;s default).

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been using PlantUML and Mermaid for my own diagrams.Mermaid is quite basic; it lacks functionalities that for me were necessary; for example, direct connection between attributes of different classes.All in all, PlantUML seems superior to Mermaid, at no cost (both languages are relatively simple to learn).Mermaid is supported by Github, which may be a necessary requirement for some. On the other hand, among the many functionalities, PlantUML&#39;s JSON is unusually good looking out of the box, and if one required the diagram it outputs, it&#39;s a great feature, because it requires no syntax knowledge.Both PlantUML and Mermaid mostly produce (Mermaid more) ugly-looking diagrams (dated, to say the least). In PlantUML, this problem is compounded by the explicit lack of layout, by design.Other warts: both (PlantUML and Mermaid) languages have limited comment support - they are only supported in specific locations of the diagram declarations.D2 could be a very welcome &#34;next gen&#34; diagramming language. However, the devil is in the details - text-to-diagram.com show a very basic functionality, so one must carefully check the requirements.Regarding text-to-diagram.com:- there&#39;s a mistake - PlantUML does support rich text (although &#34;rich&#34; is a fuzzy definition)- class diagrams are an important use case, which is currently missingEDIT: clarification about the comment limitations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recently discovered Pikchr from Sqlite/Fossil [0] if anyone is looking for something in a similar vein, although it has it&#39;s own scripting/layout language rather than using go (a plus IMO, as it&#39;s not tied to a specific ecosystem).It&#39;s fantastic for making diagrams when you want more control over the layout than graphviz or mermaidjs but are looking for a similar type of tool. It&#39;s also clean C so easy to embed, and there&#39;s a WASM build for browser use.It is fairly simple in any general purpose language to output pikchr code - I&#39;ve done this previously for producing autogenerated packet diagrams in documentation.0: https://pikchr.org/home/doc/trunk/homepage.md"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For a few months now I saw a huge improvement on Linux regarding the memory management of Firefox. Previously I had to run Firefox in a separate cgroup to limit its memory usage, because it could easily deplete my whole RAM. And if I did close most of my tabs it did not release the memory back to the system. Now I never actually get to the limit I&#39;ve set before and also with Auto Tab Discard extension it is well managed. So kudos to the team for such improvements."</p>

I don&#39;t think I got more than one or two dozen crashes in total. A crash was a special occasion and I would walk to someone&#39;s desk to show an explore. It barely every happened. On Nightly. So much love for all the stability work that is happening."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Github-style rebase-only PRs have revealed the best compromise between &#39;preserve history&#39; and &#39;linear history&#39; strategies:All PRs are rebased and merged in a linear history of merge commits that reference the PR#. If you intentionally crafted a logical series of commits, merge them as a series (ideally you&#39;ve tested each commit independently), otherwise squash.If you want more detail about the development of the PR than the merge commit, aka the &#39;real history&#39;, then open up the PR and browse through Updates, which include commits that were force-pushed to the branch and also fast-forward commits that were appended to the branch. You also get discussion context and intermediate build statuses etc. To represent this convention within native git, maybe tag each Update with pr/123/update-N.The funny thing about this design is that it&#39;s actually more similar to the kernel development workflow (emailing crafted patches around until they are accepted) than BOTH of the typical hard-line stances taken by most people with a strong opinion about how to maintain git history (only merge/only rebase)."</p>

Despite much progress in training AI systems to imitate human language, building agents that use language to communicate intentionally with humans in interactive environments remains a major challenge. We introduce CICERO, the first AI agent to achieve human-level performance in Diplomacy, a strategy game involving both cooperation and competition that emphasizes natural language negotiation and tactical coordination between seven players. CICERO integrates a language model with planning and reinforcement learn- ing algorithms by inferring players’ beliefs and intentions from its conversations and generating dialogue in pursuit of its plans. Across 40 games of an anonymous online Diplomacy league, CICERO achieved more than double the average score of the human players and ranked in the top 10% of participants who played more than one game."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; With the tail-call approach, each bytecode now gets its own function, and the pathological case for the C/C++ compiler is gone. And as shown by the experience of the Google protobuf developers, the tail-call approach can indeed be used to build very good interpreters. But can it push to the limit of hand-written assembly interpreters? Unfortunately, the answer is still no, at least at its current state.&gt; The main blockade to the tail-call approach is the callee-saved registers. Since each bytecode function is still a function, it is required to abide to the calling convention, specifically, every callee-saved register must retain its old value at function exit.This is correct, wasting of callee-saved registers is a shortcoming of the approach I published about protobuf parsing (linked from the first paragraph above).  More recently I have been experimenting with a new calling convention that uses no callee-saved registers to work around this, but the results so far are inconclusive.  The new calling convention would use all registers for arguments, but allocate registers in the opposite order of normal functions, to reduce the chance of overlap.  I have been calling this calling convention &#34;reverse_cc&#34;.I need to spend some time reading this article in more detail, to more fully understand this new work.  I would like to know if a new calling convention in Clang would have the same performance benefits, or if Deegen is able to perform optimizations that go beyond this.  Inline caching seems like a higher-level technique that operates above the level of individual opcode dispatch, and therefore somewhat orthogonal."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve been working on an early design of a high-performance dynamic binary translator that cannot JIT, and have reached a very similar conclusion as the author. We have an existing threaded interpreter but it’s a mess of hard-to-maintain assembly for two architectures, and we run into funny issues all the time where the two diverge. Plus, being handwritten by people who are not scheduling experts, there is probably some performance left on the table because of our poor choices and the design making it difficult to write complex-but-more-performant code. Nobody wants to write an efficient hash for TLB lookups in a software MMU using GAS macros.The core point I’ve identified is that existing compilers are pretty good at converting high level descriptions of operations into architecture-specific code (at least, better than we are given the amount of instructions we have to implement) but absolutely awful at doing register selection or dealing with open control flow that is important for an interpreter. Writing everything in assembly lets you do these two but you miss out on all the nice processor stuff that LLVM has encoded into Tablegen.Anyways, the current plan is that we’re going to generate LLVM IR for each case and run it through a custom calling convention to take that load off the compiler, similar to what the author did here. There’s a lot more than I’m handwaving over that’s still going to be work, like whether we can automate the process of translating the semantics for each instruction into code, how we plan to pin registers, and how we plan to perform further optimizations on top of what the compiler spits out, but I think this is going to be the new way that people write interpreters. Nobody needs another bespoke macro assembler for every interpreter :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I work on a game, that mostly uses lua as logic code, saddling on a c/c++ engine. One of the engine developers implemented lua jit years ago and found that for the actual performance, the interpreter/jit  was neglibable, the most expensive thing being the actual switch between luacode and c-code, which is with a large API a constant ugly background performance loss.The lua code by itself did not ran long enough to actually profit much from optimizations much.So, back then we did discuss possible solutions, and one idea was to basically notice a upcoming C-Call in bytecode ahead of execution, detect the stability of the arguments ahead of time. A background thread, extracts the values, perform the Call-processing of arguments and return pushes the values onto the stack, finally setting a &#34;valid&#34; bit to unblock the c-call (which by then actually is no longer a call). Both sides never have a complete cache eviction and live happily ever after. Unfortunatly i have a game dev addiction, so nothing ever came of it.But similar minds might have pushed similar ideas.. so asking the hive for this jive. Anyone ever seen something similar in the wild?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Amazingly brilliant work, especially given the CPU capabilities at the time. Carmack&#39;s use of BSP trees inspired my own work on the Crash Bandicoot renderer. I was also really intrigued by Seth Teller&#39;s Ph.D. thesis on Precomputed Visibility Sets though I knew that would never run on home console hardware.None of these techniques is relevant anymore given that all the hardware has Z buffers, obviating the need to explicitly order the polygons during the rendering process. But at the time (mid 90s) it was arguably the key problem 3D game developers needed to solve. (The other was camera control; for Crash Andy Gavin did that.)A key insight is that sorting polygons correctly is inherently O(N^2), not O(N lg N) as most would initially assume. This is because polygon overlap is not a transitive property (A in front of B and B in front of C does NOT imply A in front of C, due to cyclic overlap.) This means you can&#39;t use O(N lg N) sorting, which in turn means sorting 1000 polygons requires a million comparisons -- infeasible for hardware at the time.This is why many games from that era (3DO, PS1, etc) suffer from polygons that flicker back and forth, in front of and behind each other: most games used bucket sorting, which is O(N) but only approximate, and not stable frame to frame.The handful of games that did something more clever to enable correct polygon sorting (Doom, Crash and I&#39;m sure a few others) looked much better as a result.Finally, just to screw with other developers, I generated a giant file of random data to fill up the Crash 1 CD and labeled it &#34;bsptree.dat&#34;. I feel a bit guilty about that given that everyone has to download it when installing the game from the internet, even though it is completely useless to the game."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"BSP (binary space partitioning) was a well known algorithm, not something Carmack picked out of obscurity. It is well covered in every edition of Foley and van Dam&#39;s bible &#34;Computer Graphics&#34;. The arcade game &#34;I, Robot&#34; from Atari (1983) used BSP to render the polygons back to front -- there was no z-buffer.That isn&#39;t to deny that Carmack was brilliant. But him using BSP isn&#39;t some masterstroke of genius in itself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was studying computer graphics at the time. The book we used was &#34;Computer Graphics Principles and Practice&#34; I don&#39;t recall which edition. BSP trees are covered in the book, and like the article says, had been written about more than a decade prior.What Carmack had was the ability to read research papers and translate them into working code. I can do that too, but it does seem to be a less common skill in the software world."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"How come these map projects still use raster tiles? Are there no open source map projects that render the OSM data to vector data, and renders that vector data on the clients GPU? Maybe raster tiles are better at something I&#39;m missing, but vector maps are easier to style[0], localize, they&#39;re sharper, easier to rotate and zoom smoothly. Maybe it&#39;s harder than I think to render it on all sorts of clients including mobile?When writing this I found out that MapTiler[1] is maintaining MapLibre GL JS[2], a fork of a Mapbox project to do just that. It would be interesting to see the difference between self hosting raster and vector maps and compare pros and cons. You can even render raster tiles from vector tiles on the server if the client needs it[3].[0] https://openmaptiles.org/docs/style/mapbox-gl-style-spec/[1] https://www.maptiler.com/open-source/[2] https://github.com/MapLibre/maplibre-gl-js[3] https://openmaptiles.org/docs/host/tileserver-gl/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Do they have enough logs to reach out to people that were affected? As far as vulnerabilities go, this set is one is one of the worst ones I&#39;ve seen this decade, and they seem rather straightforward.Would be nice to get a blog post from them that goes a bit into impact, not just a report that tells you to update. It&#39;s nice that they responded quickly, but I feel like this shouldn&#39;t have happened in the first place for a network security company and it makes the Windows client feel like a bit of an afterthought. Looks like they have a PR open to switch it to named pipes, I hope that is properly reviewed by someone that knows Windows APIs before it&#39;s merged."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Blockchain was invented to solve one particular problem: distributed consensus on a sequence of transactions, where the choice of which transaction to include from a set of conflicting transactions is irrelevant.The latter property here is key to understanding where blockchain is useful. It was created to solve the &#34;double spend problem&#34;, ie. two transitions that spend the same coin but send it to different recipients (and so they conflict and cannot both be included in the canonical list of transactions). A double spend is the result of the sender either (a) making a mistake, or (b) attempting fraud. In both cases the important property is that as long as only a single of these conflicting transactions is included, the systems works.Only if your problem exhibits the above property (and it&#39;s a distributed system) does using a blockchain make sense."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had a real experience that perfectly reflects the research presented here (safer ledgers useful, blockchains are not).I accidentally got wrapped up in a project to automate some HR functions, and the product manager demanded that it must be blockchain because blockchains are the future.It turns out that append-only databases are well-suited for HR records, and (especially when dealing with things like background checks, immigration papers, etc.) it doesn&#39;t hurt to have a history with cryptographically-verifiable date stamps.We used an existing database that did all of the above, told everyone it was blockchain, and released the product.That was a great strategy for a few years until everyone realized blockchain was a boondoggle, and now you never need to work with anyone who still believes in it. You can just understand their mention of blockchain to be a sign that you need to avoid doing business with them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; [Andy Jassey] said something like this: “All these leaders [CIOs and CTOs of huge enterprises] are asking me what our blockchain strategy is. They tell me that everyone’s saying it’s the future, the platform that’s going to obsolete everything else. I need to have a good answer for them. I’ll be honest, when they explain why it’s wonderful I just don’t get it. You guys got to go figure it out for us.”To me the tell is not just that Andy didn&#39;t understand.It&#39;s that all of these leaders said &#34;everyone says it&#39;s the future&#34;, but not one of them said &#34;I have this problem and here&#39;s how blockchain solves it for me.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Because corporations are doing the majority of that pro-environmental advertising. I mean that both in terms of companies making changes (both real and greenwashing) and the News/Media corporations reporting on it.Telecommuting could be absolutely massive for reduced emissions, could bring down urban house prices, improve inter-family relationships, and revitalized suburban neighborhoods (e.g. more walkable areas). Plus increase wealth to relatively poor rural areas.Even some corporations are starting to realize that telecommuting isn&#39;t their enemy, but large ships move slowly, and recently we&#39;ve been seeing a lot of &#34;return to work&#34; used as a way to conduct layoffs with lower negative PR/stock tanking. This isn&#39;t a byproduct but a goal of return-to-work (e.g. see Musk&#39;s text message conversation during Twitter-lawsuit discovery)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is nothing more illogical in modern society than commuting to an office every day. Employees waste 2 of their 16 available waking hours in the non-productive commute while incurring significant financial costs (lease/insurance/fuel/energy) in order to support this patently absurd activity. Employers waste time and energy negotiating leases, re-arranging offices, purchasing AV equipment for meeting rooms, etc., in addition to paying the likely enormously expensive lease itself. The impacts on the environment, the number of hours of human life wasted in commute, the pointless buildings and associated costs to employers as well as the public infrastructure to support it (roads, trains, busses, etc.) are all incredibly wasteful. Surely, all of this could only be justified if physical presence had a dramatic impact on productivity. Yet, we cannot tell one way or the other if it actually improves outcomes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Two main problems1. Middle and senior management who don&#39;t want to lose control or be rendered less effective.
2. Engineers who are not trained in written communication and largely cannot autonomously move a group towards a goal without a lot of supervision.If you solve for no 2, then that acts counter to no 1 - because middle management will be questioned - why do we need you ? If a group of engineers can function on their own towards a common goal, then the manager&#39;s role is more or less rendered redundant. Sure there may be a need for psychological support but you surely won&#39;t need the current ratio of engineers: managers.There is a deep rooted old school interest in staying physically connected. This won&#39;t go away anytime soon. I am not debating whether that is right or wrong, but the general notion that &#39;we are better if we are physically together&#39; still persists. I don&#39;t know if this is a genuine feel-good-together feeling or just a made up emotion to mask point no 1 above.I am flummoxed by how executive leadership is simply blind to these facts in most companies. I mean the CEO can declare a fully remote constraint sort of like the exact opposite of what Musk did at Twitter and drive productivity higher. The cynic in me says execs can&#39;t force this decision because the senior management simply will come back and say &#39;we cannot be this productive with a fully remote team anymore&#39;. I don&#39;t know but I for one cannot understand the irrational exuberance behind RTO."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of my professors in grad school was really into wine and every couple of years he would put on an after-hours wine tasting class for a semester.  One of the points he made was that there are absolutely wines which are objectively better and worse and that experts can reliably tell them apart.  He had met enough experts who could identify a vineyard and vintage blind to know there was something to it.  But sitting on top of that there is a frothy market that is driven by fads, speculation, and hype.He was of the opinion that generally speaking the quality of a typical wine increases monotonically with price up until around the $40 range with the big steps around the $5, $10, and $20 price points.  But above $50 or so, you&#39;re no longer paying for higher quality, per se.  It&#39;s more that you are paying for a unique flavor profile and reliability.  But unless you&#39;re seeking out that particular flavor profile, you can get a bottle that is just as good for $30-40 (and occasionally even cheaper).  And above a few hundred dollars it&#39;s all just fads, speculation, and hype.  (He liked to say that the people who buy those wines have &#34;more money than sense.&#34;)  They&#39;re good wines, but you can get a bottle that is just as good for a fraction of the price."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked at WineSpectator.com in 2012-2013. I&#39;ll say this in their favor: the wine tastings were blind. A bunch of interns would set up the wine tasting, pouring the wine into glasses and then hiding the bottles. Only after everything was setup were the editors allowed into the room. So when the editors drank the wine, they had no idea if they were drinking a $9 bottle or a $900 bottle. They had to focus on the taste and balance, and write their report. Only afterwards were they told which wine they had tasted.Having said that, I&#39;ll also mention, the way the editors struggled for new adjectives did sometimes make me laugh:&#34;a vast, hearty body, notes of blue and a hint of graphite steel&#34;&#34;a radiance similar to the sun at dawn, a strong body, notes of orange&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Two scientific points to bring up about this article:1. When the author talks about Coke vs. Pepsi, he comes to the conclusion that the reason people prefer Pepsi in blind taste tests but Coke in unblinded ones is &#34;Think of it as the brain combining two sources of input to make a final taste perception: the actual taste of the two sodas and a preconceived notion (probably based on great marketing) that Coke should taste better.&#34; I&#39;ve read elsewhere, though, that the reason for this difference is actually because of the difference between &#34;sip tests&#34; vs. &#34;drinking tests&#34;. Pepsi is objectively sweeter than Coke, so if you&#39;re just taking a few quick sips (as most taste tests are set up), you may prefer the sweeter taste of Pepsi because it stands out more, but if you&#39;re drinking a whole bunch, the sweeter taste of Pepsi can feel cloying.2. The article includes this quote, &#34;the correlation between price and overall rating is small and negative, suggesting that individuals on average enjoy more expensive wines slightly less.&#34; I wonder if this could be due to Berkon&#39;s paradox, a statistical paradox that was on the HN front page yesterday, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33677781. After all, I&#39;m guessing most truly bad wines may not be rated at all."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My wife and I use Briar for household communication because of subsidiarity rather than any direct privacy concerns. Out of all the messenger projects that we&#39;ve tried, Briar actually works for local communication. It&#39;s actually instant messaging without any client hiccups or latency (looking at you, Signal). We&#39;ve tried a ton of other options, but we keep ending up back at Briar.There are points of UX friction in the name of good opsec that are inconvenient but totally understandable given the project goals. The big ones being that you have to manually login after any reboots and notifications are intentionally sparse, so good luck using a smartwatch for reading or replying. Otherwise, the forums and blogs are great for managing household projects, IM is a dream, and as a bonus, anyone willing to install and use it probably has a large enough values overlap that we can use it as a social pre-filter for close friends.The only other option that has come even remotely close to being as functional as Briar is DeltaChat. The only issue that stops us from using DeltaChat (or email in general) is that we both have email hosting in Europe while we live in the US, so neither of us, being frugal in principal, wants to send information to Europe and back in order to tell the person 100 ft away to come help bring in the groceries."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just wanna say this app saved my family and I when we went on a cruise. Normally, we would had had to pay to use the chat service via the ship&#39;s paid-only Wi-Fi (since we get no phone reception on the seas). Without needing to pay for the Wi-Fi, we were all able to use Briar to communicate whilst connected to the network, which made coordinating and finding each other on the ship way easier. It was great and worked really well. So thanks, Briar!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t know if I have ADHD, but if I do an online survey it says I most probably definitely do. I was never diagnosed as a child because I largely functioned as a kid and was quiet and non-disruptive, but looking back the signs were all there.Fast forward as an adult I have a number of coping mechanisms and one of them is to have something on in the background. I have never associated the effectiveness with the noise itself, but rather with something that is keeping part of my brain quiet. It prevents my mind from wandering. It is ideally something I already know. Like a show I have seen before or a podcast that I am okay not fully retaining. Not enough stimulation and I get distracted easily, too much stimulation and I shut down completely. Music doesn&#39;t usually work for me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have ADHD and I straight-up don&#39;t do silence. Between restless brain and tinnitus, actual silence, or anything with a noise floor below ~15dB, just doesn&#39;t sit right with me. 20-30dB is about ideal. Especially when trying to sleep. I have some sort of fan/filter in just about every room. When I&#39;m working, I&#39;m almost always listening to music (unless I&#39;m way over stimulated).It probably started when I was much younger with much worse asthma and always had a HEPA filter running in the background. Eventually this turned into basically always having some kind of fan in my primary locations. Right now I dig the Coway air filters on low or medium.Even beyond the alleged &#34;noise floor dopamine boost&#34;, I find some kind of background whoosh really nice for masking otherwise variable sounds, such as cars, airplanes, and the wind, which are far more distracting.10/10 would recommend running some sort of air filter all the time. Plus, cleaner air (air pollution has all kinds of bad effects)."</p>

About two decades ago, I had a Via Unichrome integrated GPU and the OpenChrome project had me able to run games on Linux. It was sick. I played Unreal Tournament (which had a Linux version that worked better for me than on Windows), and I think at one point my introduction to open source was having to modify another game&#39;s source code so that it would allocate less GPU memory for a texture (the texture then kind of smeared over the rest of the screen, but it was for a UI element so the game was still playable).Love to see there are people still doing that stuff today, especially since this stuff is probably more complex than then."</p>

It would show what looked like one right click, but no context menu, or a context menu that appeared and was immediately dismissed.But this revealed that it&#39;s actually rapidly sending multiple logical clicks per physical click. The logical clicks are fast enough that the screen recordings didn&#39;t differentiate them as separate events - which sent me in the wrong direction, making me think the OS was disregarding clicks. But here, the multiple clicks are clearly audible.So thanks!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From this operations engineer&#39;s perspective, there are only 3 main things that bring a site down: new code, disk space, and &#39;outages&#39;. If you don&#39;t push new code, your apps will be pretty stable. If you don&#39;t run out of disk space, your apps will keep running. And if your network/power/etc doesn&#39;t mysteriously disappear, your apps will keep running. And running, and running, and running.The biggest thing that brings down a site is changes. Typically code changes, but also schema/data changes, infra/network/config changes, etc. As long as nothing changes, and you don&#39;t run out of disk space (from logs for example), things stay working pretty much just fine. The trick is to design it to be as immutable and simple as possible.There are other things that can bring a site down, like security issues, or bugs triggered by unusual states, too much traffic, etc. But generally speaking those things are rare and don&#39;t bring down an entire site.The last thing off the top of my head that will absolutely bring a site down over time, is expired certs. If, for any reason at all, a cert fails to be regenerated (say, your etcd certs, or some weird one-off tool underpinning everything that somebody has to remember to regen every 360 days), they will expire, and it will be a very fun day at the office. Over a long enough period of time, your web server&#39;s TLS version will be obsoleted in new browser versions, and nobody will be able to load it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; This left a lot wondering what exactly was going on with all those engineers and made it seem like it was all just bloat.I was partly expecting the rest of the article to explain to me why exactly it wasn&#39;t just bloat. But it goes on talking about this 1~3-person cache SRE team that built solid infra automation that&#39;s really resilient to both hardware and software failures. If anything, the article might actually persuade me that it was all bloat."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I did SRE consulting work for a phase of my career... as the author points out, these systems are scaled out and resilient, but what happens next is entropy. Team sizes shrink, everything starts to be viewed through a cost cutting / savings lens, overtaxed staff start ignoring problems or the long-term view because they are in firefighting mode, it becomes hard to attract new talent because the perception is 
&#34;the good times are over.&#34; Things start to become brittle and/or not get the attention needed, contractors are brought in because they are cheaper and/or bits get outsourced to the cheapest bidder... the professional care and attention like the author clearly brought just starts to shift over time. Consultants like me are brought in to diagnose what&#39;s wrong - the good staff could write our briefs, they know what&#39;s going on - and generally we slap a band-aid on the problem because management just wants to squeeze whatever value they can out of the assets rather than actually improve anything."</p>

Gladly it was just tangential to that idea.Idea: Train an ai to construct entire threads based on the input of the title and link. There should be plenty of training material, and frankly I think it would be hilariously similar to the real threads.When new submissions are added to HN, the system will fetch the title and link, and predict the entire thread. You can view the thread on something like hnpredicted.com/?id=33680661 . When the real thread has had no new comment added for five days, it is reintegrated into the system further training the model.Possibly, the model could be trained on the actual content of the link. But I suspect just using the short title might be better. Larger concentration on the actual material there, websites contain lots of text which is useless.Now that I&#39;ve posted the idea, feel free to steal it ofcourse.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Our diagnosis is that individual developers do not pay for tools.I know this first hand, building a developer tool startup and failing to reach any level of revenue. In the end, the tech was bought out by a larger company to recover a fraction of our VC investment.The challenge is that when you&#39;re building software for developers, they already know how it must work.It&#39;s like trying to sell magic tricks to magicians. Sell magic to regular people, and you&#39;ll see some significant revenue.I&#39;ve used Kite before. It was ok. But I am a SWE. It&#39;s entirely possible that Kite would have seen major adoption if the push was towards non-technical folks trying to get their feet wet in software. Eg: Data scientists or business.The reason why BI tools sell so well at the moment is that you have tons of C-level execs that like the appeal of a business-optimizing tool requiring little to none of any actual software development.Let that be a lesson to everyone. You can&#39;t blow away developers. They&#39;re just too damn ~~smart~~ well-informed.Edit: Another anecdote: A buddy of mine built a bespoke OCR and document indexing/search tool. He has ~60 paying clients (almost exclusively law-firms and banks) that primarily work with printed pages on paper. No Saas. No free tier. The client data resides on an on-premise Windows box, avoiding issues with sensitive data in the cloud etc.He&#39;s a solo dev with support contracts and nets something like $1000/month from each client.For your average lawyer/paralegal, the ability to locate and reference a single page from thousands of pages in under a second is magic. So they pay for it wholeheartedly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Our diagnosis is that individual developers do not pay for tools. Their manager might, but engineering managers only want to pay for discrete new capabilities, i.e. making their developers 18% faster when writing code did not resonate strongly enough.&#34;I never used Kite, but I&#39;ve tried Github Copilot twice, and found it marginal at best (and distracting at worst - which is why I turned it off both times). If Kite was similar, the reason I&#39;m not paying is that coder AIs are not providing any value.Developers are somewhat reluctant to pay for tools but I think you can get them to pay for things that are worth it. I&#39;ve been paying for code editors for years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"“Our 500k developers would not pay to use it. Our diagnosis is that individual developers do not pay for tools.”I don’t like depending on something I could lose in a month or tethers me to the internet. I consider that more a service than a tool. I’d prefer to just buy something once that just works, but that business model might be dead too since people will pirate things that aren&#39;t tethered to some serverside component.I guess what I’m saying is that I want to buy tools, but people are only renting. Personally I’m largely holding out hope this becomes someone’s open source passion project and I can truly own my tools."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I built a lighting system for &lt;hotel chain you&#39;ve heard of&gt; to save energy by turning off hallway lights when not in use. The environmental aspect was great and saved hundreds of thousands in electricity. Someone eventually realized that the mesh network I built to connect all the lights together and report usage statistics could also be used to track employees moving throughout the building and catch them taking unauthorized breaks in the stairwell, so that&#39;s its main purpose now.I&#39;m a lot more paranoid about privacy these days."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I was at Akamai about 5 years ago, I was involved in building the system for making their CDN compliant in China. There were two main features, and they were activated on all servers running inside mainland china (not HK, macau or Taiwan)1. Logs of the CDN were sent in real time to the ministry of technology -- there was about a 15 minute delay if I remember correctly, and they could impose fines if they were delayed. The log included the url visited, the IP address of the visitor, and a few other things. Perhaps the user agent? I forget.2. The ministry of technology had a special API to block URLs on the CDN. Basically, they provided a list of URLs that would return a 451, and of course those logs also went to the government.No other country had this kind of access at the time, but it was considered critical for the business to continue to operate in China. As I understand it, these are required to comply with chinese government regulations, and other CDNs like Cloudflare and Cloudfront have also built similar capabilities. Perhaps jgrahamc can comment on what cloudflare did?I feel quite guilty about being involved with that project, but the business was set on building it, so I did what I could to limit the blast radius. I would not be surprised if someone got arrested or was killed because of it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked in an Ad-tech start-up in Berlin run by two of the most evil f*kers I&#39;ve ever encountered. I built out their principal ad auction algorithm and a lot of the back-end to support it, and all they did with it was target vulnerable groups of people at particular times of the week when they thought they were at their lowest ebb.One meeting in particular really stands out still, a social media giant that everyone knows was in town meeting the founders to sell additional personalization data. Before that meeting, I thought things the start-up were doing were a bit sketchy, maybe borderline unethical. During the meeting itself, it was more like sitting around a table with Dr. Evil and a few henchmen. They were actively, unambiguously picking vulnerable groups for ad re-targeting. And that&#39;s not even the worst of it, the meeting wraps up and one of the founders says &#34;OK guys, let&#39;s go get some beers and bring some girls&#34;. Then this despicable excuse for a man promptly walked out into the office, points at a few female employees and says &#34;You, you and you, come with us now&#34;."</p>

We&#39;re only beginning to explore the area of what&#39;s possible, so please give as much feedback as you have."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"this, devbox, and others seem to be alternatives to `nix-env shell` or the flake-based `nix develop`. spurred i think by a desire for better UX. these are excellent for any project off-the-ground enough that you’ve run `git init` or created a repo.the adjacent area i’m struggling with is the “i want to write a tiny program to verify some conjecture, and i’ll probably throw it away an hour from now”. think codegolf competitions, if you can’t relate.the environments i create for these follow similar patterns. it’s either python with numpy, pandas and plotly, or it’s Rust with clap and serde, say. i’d love a tool where i can just `cd /tmp/my-hourlong-project` and then `devenv python` to get a python shell that’ll have everything i often use (and probably more).hearing from people who use these tools, nobody has told me that any of these can do this — except that since they crawl up the fs tree looking for their env definition maybe i could just stash some definitions at the fs root and get globally-invokable environments that way. seems hacky though: i’d hope for a method that’s more officially supported."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This post really starts to show the right direction:Z-Library - &#34;the desktop app&#34;,
with built in Tor (for seeders safety), IPFS (for p2p distribution), IPNS (to download updated indexes), with local search engine (no SPOF &amp; convenience), optional at-rest file encryption, and some random pining algorithm to let users donate 1-10GB of local disk space to host random chunks of the library.It needs to be dead easy to let anyone use and contribute."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Considering the goals of IPFS, I’m surprised it has trouble at this scale. I mean, it’s supposed to be “interplanetary” but this data would fit on two hard drives. The post talks about performance problems with advertising “hundreds” of content IDs. Is it a design problem or just an early implementation problem?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m fairly sure this isn&#39;t really safe or really reliable.To my knowledge, IPFS isn&#39;t really private, in that both the nodes hosting content can be easily known, and the users requesting content can be monitored. This is bad news for something law enforcement has already taken a serious interest in.IPFS also requires &#34;pinning&#34;, which means that unless other people decide to dedicate a few TB to this out of their own initiative, what we have currently is a single machine providing data through an obscure mechanism. If this machine is taken down, the content goes with it.The amount of people that have 31 TB worth of spare storage, care about this particular issue, and are willing to get into legal trouble for it (or at least anger their ISP/host) is probably not terribly large. The work could be split up, but then there needs to be some sort of coordination to somehow divide up hosting the archive among a group of volunteers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a nurse and I find the 7th point on the post especially relevant. I will add a disclaimer that I never worked in the ICU so I can&#39;t speak for what happens in that type of unit.There is a serious issue with the flow of information in healthcare, (or at least in the U.S, I never worked elsewhere to know if it&#39;s any different). But If you find something during your shift which will be important to know later on, it will certainly be lost as soon as you are off for a few days, or even as soon as a new nurse comes on. To think of a somewhat crude example, if you find out that it is much easier to obtain a blood sample from the veins on the left arm of a patients vs the right, many nurses will still stick the right arm countless times hoping to get something.And you can leave a chart note about things like that or speak about it during report, but for the most part few people will think &#34;hm, I wonder what everybody else had to deal with.&#34; They are probably too busy handling a thousand different things happening all at once. And, even if that is not the case, from what I observed it&#39;s simply not part of how things are done. And very often patients will get (justifiably) angry, saying &#34;I&#39;ve been complaining of x thing for days!&#34; or some version of that. I think it would be much better for both patients and healthcare staff alike if there was a greater emphasis placed on focusing on the series of successes and failures that happen over the course of someone&#39;s care, not just seeing it as a single shift or a single problem happening in some isolated point in time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I noticed a lot of the same things when my dad was in the ICU.  Some additional thoughts:1. &#34;Almost every patient has delusions and nightmares&#34; I personally felt &#34;off&#34; when visiting my father.  The sounds, smells, lights and constant buzz of activity all contributed to a feeling of being in a surreal dreamworld.   Lack of sleep contributes.  I can&#39;t imagine what my father experiencing.2. Food was HORRIBLE.  One meal was a low quality hamburger on a plain, white bread bun with a slice of &#34;american cheese&#34;, fries, iceberg lettuce salad with a couple of slices of cucumber and a single slice of tomato, a container of apple sauce and glass of milk.  Lots of salad dressing and ketchup.   They wouldn&#39;t let us bring better food into the ICU and my dad didn&#39;t want to &#34;make waves&#34;.3. Family is critical.  My father got better care because I, or my brother, was there to act on his behalf.  Having obnoxious family members is worse than having none from what I saw."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; There’s no sense of a scientific method, reasoning from first principles, or even reasoning from similar cases though. It’s all shooting in the dark, and most of the time I felt like I could have done just as good a job on these longterm issues...This articulates very well what I&#39;ve usually felt when dealing with doctors. It&#39;s like the story of a programmer finding that his code outputs 5 when it should be 4, and then adding...    if(return_value == 5):
        return_value = 4

...to fix it, and being satisfied. What I want is something like in the television show House. The main character is unhinged and anti-social and takes extreme risks, but at least he demonstrates curiosity to really figure out and understand the root of what&#39;s going on. To be fair, I don&#39;t actually think that doctors lack curiosity or are incapable of doing this, the medical system as it&#39;s set up just doesn&#39;t allow it. For chronic issues, I&#39;ve usually figured them out for myself, as a layperson, by persistently keeping track of things, searching the web, reading, and experimenting over months and years."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Being accommodative of small minorities seems to be a kind, and thoughtful thing to do.However having large majorities(95%+ of the population) make concessions in order to accommodate a small group imposes a cost (however small) born by many to the benefit of a few. My questions is how do you decide where to make that trade off? What’s the cost benefit analysis? At some point where do people say the cost of accommodating this 1/100k/1m people by another 300m+ people is not a worthwhile use of societal resources?"</p>

Fine.HN news is discussion about technology, start ups, and creating stupid moral panics to stir up hatred against groups you want to oppress.In this case I actually have first hand experience of this topic, my wife is currently pregnant. Not once have I seen any price of advice or information that in any way has been less useful because of inclusive language. This whole article is attacking a problem - using inclusive language - that only exists if you hate the people being included and don’t want them included. Which apart from being obviously morally repugnant is also something that seems like an odd discussion to have on a tech website. I guess we’re interested in ethics in game journalism again…"</p>

    ‘The question is,’ said Alice, ‘whether you can make words mean so many different things.’

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article’s main point is that AI technology has economic  potential. It goes about this by parodying common arguments against whether such AI can develop into goal-driven beings.One example of such criticism is this five year old piece: https://www.wired.com/2017/04/the-myth-of-a-superhuman-ai/ Few are skeptical about AI technologies’ economic impact. In that sense, the article misses the ball slightly, but it’s so funny that I don’t mind.To state my point in the vein of the article: The bulldozer did change our economy. It does most, if not all, of its productive work in cooperation with a human. Turning a bulldozer on and letting it run by itself is usually a waste, and may be dangerous."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I used to grow my own in Australia, as a hobby, patience is the hardest part really. 5-7 years after planting seems to be needed.At one stage I was the northern most producer of truffles (very few produced actually but I only had 40 trees and didn&#39;t really look after them to the utmost detail) in the southern hemisphere, then a guy 150km further north, and in soil that was near total sand, got some to grow. This was totally unexpected.It seems the conditions required are not quite so special as thought, and some totally unsuited conditions (as previously thought) might be good due to reduced competition from other fungi.The action of inoculating trees is simple as well, get a ripe couple of real truffles, blender them up and pour it over the small saplings in pots, if the mycorrhizal sets in you can see it as white bits on the roots. (I think you need two, but not even sure on that).A wide range of trees will work, oak, hazel, cork to name a few. There is a preferred pH range for the soil, as would be expected for all fungi pH has a strong role to play.There has been a lot of secrecy enshrouding the whole game for a long time.I refer only to Tuber melanosporum in the above, I am not sure anyone has been able to get the white truffles growing out of the wild, there will be some special condition or symbiosis with an animal or something that is needed, but not understood yet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Maybe 5 years ago I was hanging out with a buddy and we took an angle grinder to an empty propane tank. When we were finished, we smelled uniquely awful. It turns out that added to propane is a tiny amount of the odourant Ethyl Mercaptan. Now when you’re using propane you get just enough of a whiff of it to remind you that you’re using propane, but if you get a smell of the inside of an empty propane tank? Well, something about the liquid propane residue that remains, some miracle of science and chemistry, creates a density of Ethyl Mercaptan that is shocking. Room-fillingly shocking. Clothes throwing away shocking. Many showers worth of shocking.A couple years ago I had my first “truffle” experience with some truffle cheese and was like cutting back into that propane tank. Not the same in scale, but certainly in type. Tremendously similar smells. Since then I’ve been sad and thought I just managed to ruin truffles for myself. This article has given me hope."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m French and I live in France. Here, most of our truffles are real truffle.We do get some Tuber aestivum as well, but that&#39;s alright because they&#39;re displayed as &#34;truffe d&#39;été&#34;. No harm done.As the article said, the &#34;truffle flavour&#34; has nothing to do with the real stuff, and outside of France, Italy and Spain, you probably won&#39;t get them on the market. You might be lucky in some restaurants all over Europe. But everywhere else it&#39;s propably not the &#34;real&#34; black truffle. Especially, if they put some in ketchup..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"2038 is going to be an interesting year that’s for sure. I’m big into Final Fantasy VII modding/speedrunning and while reverse engineering the game I stumbled upon some code that actually checks if the current date is before 2038. If it’s not it refuses to run. I have no idea why they put this kind of check in the game&#39;s code, I tried to remove it but the game actually still didn’t start so there is probably some issue that prevents it from working when the date overflows.I can only imagine that a lot of other legacy software will have similar issues when we reach year 2038."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It’s good this came up here.  I just spent the last week or so going through the MaraDNS code base and fixing all of the little Y2038 issues.I know, time_t is 64-bit with pretty much any new Linux distro out there, so why are people seeing Y2038 issues?  It’s because the Windows 32-bit POSIX compatibility layer handles Y2038 very poorly.  Once Y2038 is reached, the POSIX time() call in a 32-bit app fails with a -1.  It doesn’t use a rolling timestamp somewhere in 1901 the way 32-bit Linux applications with 32-bit time_t do.  It fails hard, returning -1 for every call to time().Now, it’s true that Microsoft does have proprietary calls for time and date which are Y2038 compliant, and, yes, native Windows32 apps should use those calls instead of the POSIX ones, but in the real world, it’s sometimes a lot easier to, say, just use stat() to get a file’s timestamp instead of having to use CreateFile() followed by GetFileTime().This is why a lot of Windows apps are still seeing Y2038 issues.In terms of Linux apps, the Y2038 stuff is mainly seen in old 32-bit binary only apps.  Since that stuff is mainly games, where an inaccurate datestamp isn’t a serious issue, I think we will see emulation libraries which give old games a synthetic time and date so they aren’t outside of the Y2038 window.  New apps will use a 64-bit time_t even if compiled as a 32-bit binary."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those of us that chuckle at it at this time, this is likely to be far far far bigger than Y2K.  The reason is because software that runs critical aspects of human life will have proliferated to a greater degree when compared to &gt;2000, and &lt;2038.Before 2000, we had software running our systems, yes.  But it was not as distributed, and not as ubiquitous, and not as deeply ingrained into human culture as it is today.  This proliferation will obviously continue past today, and while hardware and low-level OS/software mitigations (as well as a herculean effort to clean up the mess) will make up the gap, it&#39;s not hard to see that this is likely to be much more impactful upon failure because of the &#34;embeddedness&#34; of these systems.A box that has just been doing its thing for 40-50-60 years and all of a sudden fails, is likely to be more impactful than one that was 20-30 years old even."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Learning how to speak chicken is not becoming a chicken. That&#39;s a frequent misconception that borders cultural appropriation. Chickens aren&#39;t just about a few bock-bock and cockle-doodle-doos. They have a rich set of physical expressions as well (flap flaps, head kicks, grating the soil, etc) and a vibrant culture that is transmitted between generations. Their philosophy on death and their capacity to always see life on the sunny-side is both unique and deep, the fruit of seeing their children being picked for food on a daily basis. This should be celebrated. The article completely missed the point on that aspect.Pretending you became a chicken because you&#39;re now performing a few chicken-like sounds is plain wrong, an insult to the poultry community."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; rainbow palette for use in my data visualisations.Indeed for her kind of data the rainbow palette works okay. But if you have to visualize more complex / denser data, beware of the pitfalls of the rainbow color palette. It is not always the best choice.IBM did research back in the 90s on perceptually-based colormaps and how to best represent various types of data within the color dimensions of luminescence, saturation and hue [1]. For example, they found that,(1) Hue was not a good dimension for encoding magnitude information, i.e. rainbow color maps are bad.(2) The mechanisms in human vision responsible for high spatial frequency information processing are luminance channels. If the data to be represented have high spatial frequency, use a color map which has a strong luminance variation across the data range.(3) For interval and ratio data, both luminance- and saturation-varying color maps should produce the effect of having equal steps in data value correspond to equal perceptual steps, but the first will be most effective for high spatial frequency data variations and the second will be most effective for low spatial frequency variations.===[1] the original link got removed from IBMs website.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There was definitely a hack (perhaps in addition to government action). The FTX holdings database was wiped, and malware was hosted on their website and mobile apps: https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/11/12/ftx-crypto-wall..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Maybe this is a stupid question, but how? Was the Bahamas&#39; SEC holding its own copies of FTX&#39;s keys? I thought the entire point of these schemes was that this kind of seizure-by-force wasn&#39;t possible (absent exploits or insiders)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"interesting, since FTX was headquartered in the bahamas this seems lawful and not unreasonable. though some will argue the government doesn&#39;t have the right to do that, I think you sacrifice your protection when you commit fraud.how quickly should the bahamas have announced about the asset seizure? is it common in other countries to not comment about (seizures in) ongoing investigations?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is very clever, and it’s nice that it’s fully accessible and requires no JS.However, looking at that final CSS just makes me wish that we added new interface elements to HTML far more often. Folks run rings around themselves to implement things that have been in any desktop UI toolkit worth its salt since the 90s."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; A tree view (collapsible list) can be created using only HTML and CSS, without the need for JavaScriptA bit tangential, but so much more should be done in CSS rather than resorting to JavaScript. One gripe I&#39;ve always had are hamburger menus that fail to work with JS disabled. Most of my browsing is done with Safari on iOS and I&#39;ve disabled JS on that browser since 1) I enjoy the privacy benefits 2) popup modals and other distractions are non-existent.You can code a hamburger menu that opens when you click on it, without JS. Yes, CSS is not just for styling it can also be used for functionality."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I made another totally different kind of &#34;tree view&#34; in CSS a while back, in this case to see some kind of JSON-html tree into a tree:https://francisco.io/demo/tree/It was a fork of a much earlier project but I improved it a lot IIRC; unfortunately I lost the original source and now chances of finding it are very small (unless someone here knows it!)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am a South African.  We have lived through some of the most draconian Orwellian autocratic measures in the world.  Furthermore, our journey to democracy has not been smooth - the last 10 years were marred by massive corruption.Through all of this, our constitutional rights to freedom of expression, and freedom of press, has stayed sound.  We have had multiple instances where journalists reported on some nefarious action and were intimidated or even legally threatened by authorities.  However, our courts have, for the most part, sided with our freedom of expression and press rights.  The South African government has had quite a couple of punches on the nose in our courts ;-).I have read most of the comments in this thread.  I think I understand most of the viewpoints, and I always try and have an open mind.  I am also not an American citizen.  However, like every Earth citizen I have a keen interest (possibly forced...) on USA issues.  &#34;If America sneeze the world catches a cold&#34;.This is clearly a very contentious topic, and I will reply with some specific thoughts on specific comments.  I just wanted to give the perspective of a citizen in a country where this is a serious history of government abuse.  We cannot take these things likely.  Now that I think about it, I think the Germans feel the same way (living through the Gestapo and Stasi years could not have been fun....)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a software engineer who works on genomics. I see a lot of negativity in this thread, which mirrors my experience: in most places, you&#39;ll be paid like a researcher with the respect of a lab assistant – unless you have a PhD and a postdoc.That said, it&#39;s possible find work that&#39;s respected and pays well. Most of that kind of work is happening in the context of startups or freelancing. My favorite example of this is Robert Edgar: he&#39;s a freelance computational biologist with over 100k citations who has made a living for the past 20 years by selling licenses to his bioinformatics software (https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RzVMRc0AAAAJ).To find those kinds of jobs, I&#39;d try YC&#39;s Work at a Startup, Flagship Pioneering&#39;s portfolio companies, and emailing founders of companies that have a bioinformatics component (my email is in my profile!).I think the issues with the field are because it&#39;s a new and growing space. We do need better tooling, respect for engineering, and established best practices, but that seems to have been the case in the past for other domains that moved from research to industry – including software engineering itself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Usually, scientific oriented companies or organizations have little regard for software as a domain, craft, etc. It’s just a thing that gets in the way, despite being vital. It’s almost just a utility to them rather than a differentiator and active component of the advanced work going on.For example, the Broad Institute is super interesting, but having applied there several times, they are esoteric, to say the least, in their hiring. They pay well below market, and their process is opaque and slow and sometimes downright non-communicative. They are also not really open to remote work, so you gotta move there and commute to the heart of Cambridge. Budgets are set by folks maybe a couple years out of a PhD program, who will also make technical decisions in terms of the software design (the latter an assumption given my experience in similar places).These organizations are also pretty traditional in their selection of stacks. Good luck trying to use a functional-first  language, aside from maybe Scala (usually lots of Java stacks), and be prepared to write lots of Python, the only language that exists to many scientists. I once saw a Python signature (function name and arguments) spill over 10-20 lines, in a file over 10,000 lines long. They had given up on another software stack because “it wasn’t working for them”.This is all painting with broad strokes, of course. But I think scientific organizations that would embrace software as a major component of their technological and scientific development would do well. There’s a lot of opportunity."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve worked on genomics, at the Broad. Can confirm there is a ton of toxicity. There&#39;s also a lot of smart and great people, if you can find a team specifically dedicated to software I would recommend it. Also the pay is good...for a non-profit.More broadly...shortages like this aren&#39;t because SWEs just love ad-tracking and hate health improvements. People need to be willing to pay for these services (case in point; the jobs link for AWS has 3 links which appear unrelated to genomics, for Microsoft there are 2 for interns, and for Google its empty).There are a lot of opportunities in biotech for SWEs, and many firms (though not all) really do respect the power of software. Worth looking around if you&#39;re interested in the area."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is so cute and cool! While I don&#39;t know, whether I want to play long Quake sessions on my watch, it shows that the Apple watch is a quite powerful compute device. Actually, it should be more powerful than most workstations of the 90ies, as it has a dual-core 64bit Processor.It also shows, how much the watch and some other Apple devices are held back by the software restrictions. Basically any software released in the 90ies should run easily on the watch. Of course, due to the small screen size and the lack of a keyboard, a totally different UI would be needed, but if people were really free to experiment and distribute, a huge field of new software could be opened."</p>
