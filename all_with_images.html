								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a big frustration of mine, too. The other is that Spotify is extremely biased towards playlist listening and makes browsing and listening to a library of albums really painful.The good news is that Spotify&#39;s SDK and API are actually powerful enough that you can build up an entire alternative interface, which is actually what I recently started doing: https://i.imgur.com/ar7VrYy.png.It&#39;s still work in progress but actually works perfectly well already. It&#39;s not ready for public use yet and also isn&#39;t open source yet though. If you want to follow development I guess the best place to do that is my twitter: https://twitter.com/tom_j_watson."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I use Winamp for my MP3 collection that I downloaded of my T1 line at the office.When I turn that mother up on and my CRT monitor starts smoking because of the Winamp addons that spikes all kinds of shit whenever the tune is changing, then I know I have found the right track.Then I get cracking on the floor. Break dancing and caps flying around. The neighbors come jumping in the door and starts clapping and the music just keeps going.Everybody can understand a list of songs, even my grandma who&#39;s pushing 84. So we battle out songs on each of ours computers, but we don&#39;t use Spotify any more."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Spotify&#39;s UI is a case study of the negative impact of assigning single screens to single teams, designers and managers. There is no cohesive vision. The useful functionality is all obscured by esthetics. I am perpetually annoyed at how poor spotify is at it&#39;s basic purpose. They have leaned way too far into recommendation systems and over designed layout. 99% of the time, I know what I want to listen to. Spotify&#39;s UX is designed for people to &#39;browse&#39; the app. That doesnt resonate with me, at all. I know what I want.My biggest gripe with spotify is it&#39;s inability to reliably answer the question of &#34;what playlist or source am I currently listening too?&#34;. A constant flow that spotify fails to deliver on is this: Search for a song, play the song, then the rest of the album, on repeat, without shuffle. It&#39;s annoying to have to load multiple slow UIs to navigate from search to album, visually search the album&#39;s track list and play the song your after.Itunes and Windows Media Player set the standard for how media should be navigated and Spotify should use some of those old standard concepts.EDIT:Try browsing Armin Van Buuren&#39;s massive discography on Spotify."</p>

Kudos to whoever wrote this! (and rr sounds like a nice tool too ;) )"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Historically, rr has not worked on AMD processors, which is a bummer. However, I have been able to make good use of it on my 5950X now with the workaround script and newer versions of rr. This is good news.I&#39;ve not read their extended technical report, but I am kind of curious exactly what performance counters AMD is implementing poorly and how that impacts rr."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is incredible!For those that have used it, how useful it is for debugging multithreading heisenbugs? Can I let a process run under rr for days, wait until it crashes to due a heisenbug, and replay the trace without rr having to go through days of recording? i.e. is it possible to fast forward the trace, somehow?(I nerd sniped myself a bit here, wondering how fast forwarding could be implemented. I think it might be achievable with periodic process memory snapshots and incremental traces.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m the co-author of one of the papers referenced in the blogpost, (Fast Quicksort Implementation Using AVX Instructions), we did write the AVX512 code back in 2015, just had nowhere to run it, at least publicly. The paper also very explicitly says that the lookup tables can be instead replaced by the AVX512 compress instructions. The code for that paper is available in https://github.com/vkrasnov/avx_qsort"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wonder how fast it is compared to djbsort https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/blob/master/libc/nexgen... and longsort https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/blob/e011973593407f576d... djbsort is outrageously fast for 32-bit ints with avx2 (which unlike avx512 it&#39;s the avx we can reliably use in open source). But there&#39;s never been a clear instruction set to use on Intel / AMD for sorting 64-bit ints that&#39;s reliably fast. So if this thing can actually sort 64-bit integers 10x faster on avx2 I&#39;d be so thrilled."</p>

Just a tip to everyone job hunting I guess. Watch what executives do (not what they say). Well, and human history of speculative bubbles.I didn&#39;t think it was a coincidence Coinbase did a direct listing rather than an IPO, since an IPO has a waiting period for insiders to sell.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Losing confidence? No, I lost that years ago. For quite some time the vast majority of the listings have been drop-shipped AliExpress garbage. Many of them are obvious because of terrible photoshops, randomly named branding, and those strange bold brackets in the product description.But some can be harder to spot because of tricks that sellers use to essentially hijack listings for other products to carry all the positive reviews along. Or they may just go the route of putting completely fake reviews on the product. Some may even be from verified purchasers because they packed a card along with the product offering compensation for a 5 star review. Or they can get verified reviews in an even slimier way involving ordering from themselves and then shipping random crap to people who&#39;ve they&#39;ve sent stuff to before.And then there&#39;s the inventory that&#39;s poisoned with counterfeits. Thanks to inventory co-mingling counterfeit and legit products can end up getting mixed together. There&#39;s a chance that even buying from a fully legit listing will end up with you getting sent a counterfeit product.However, despite all of that I do still use Amazon. Their immense investment into logistics means that many things will make it to me next-day. And their return policies allow me to order with the confidence that if I get a fraudulent item (or just something I don&#39;t like) it will be fairly painless to get a replacement or my money back.That said, I have also been making more efforts over the years to not use Amazon. I tend to buy all my major electronics from Best Buy or direct from the manufacturer. And I would never buy any food or medicine from Amazon. I don&#39;t want to risk things that go into me being counterfeit."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A seller offered me a gift certificate if I left a 5 star review.  Basically a little note in the box saying if I left a 5 star review, took a screenshot &amp; sent it to their email address, they&#39;d send me the gift certificate.It was not a 5 star product.  It was a 2 star product, at best.I tried to mention the fact they were paying for reviews in my review (to explain the other 5 stars).Amazon rejected my review.It&#39;s against Amazon policy to let others know that sellers are buying reviews."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like you&#39;re several years late to the party here. I think it&#39;s pretty common knowledge at this point that certain types of goods sold on Amazon have a huge chance of being counterfeit and everyone knows reviews are faked/not to be trusted blindly.At this point people seem to not care since Amazon will give a refund/exchange pretty much no questions asked. It&#39;s still extremely annoying and it&#39;s definitely not a good look for their business, but I assume the number crunchers have determined actually dealing with the fraud isn&#39;t yet worth it financially."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Seems like an innocent enough mistake. Remind me of when I once helped organize a volunteer hackathon with people from different companies. We created a Slack organization just for the occasion. At the end of the event, I was supposed to ask all attendees to delete all the data we had given them before they went home. The message I posted to #general (the channel everyone in a Slack organization is required to be in) with @everyone tagged was something to the effect of:&#34;Thank you everyone for contributing to our shared mission. When you are done with your work today, please delete all the data from your machines. Hope we see each other again soon!&#34;Slack gave me a dire warning that my message would send notifications to so many people across so many time zones. This didn&#39;t surprise me because attendees came from various countries for the event. So I dismissed it.But I had accidentally sent it to my company&#39;s Slack organization instead of the hackathon-specific one. I didn&#39;t realize it until a co-worker sent me a private message asking why I had just tried to fire everyone at our company."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The only notable thing here IMO is the lack of limits imposed by GitHub on notifications. Apparently a random tag of `@microsoft` in the comments was enough to notify 4000 people [1] as well.I have no idea why the user is even being mentioned in this headline. I haven&#39;t used GitHub in a while, and am unfamiliar with orgs and subgroups, but tagging a developer subgroup on a PR seems...a reasonable thing for a new contributor to do? How is it their fault that the developer subgroup has been hijacked by this organization to mean &#34;Anyone who has ever signed the Terms of Service To View Our Code&#34;?The correct thing for Epic Games to do here would be to rename the group to `@EpicGames/terms-of-service-signatories`, and restrict `@EpicGames/developers` to people who have requested access to open a PR. Assuming that people should magically know not to mention `@EpicGames/developers` in their PRs because Epic is doing some ToS shenanigans is preposterous.I guess I&#39;ll be looking carefully at mentions the next time I have to use this social network [2] masquerading poorly as a code review tool to submit a pull request.----------------------------------------[1] https://github.com/EpicGames/Signup/pull/24#issuecomment-114...[2] Looking at the profile of the contributor making the PR tells me that GitHub has apparently decided to let their users independently rediscover the experience of SuperWall on Facebook circa 2007."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Innocent mistake.The kid is barely 18. The emotion and stress resulting from mistakenly sending a notification to 400,000 is likely overwhelming. Now his real name is going to stay at the center of the internet for a while thanks to being 1st on HN. I would definitely not have coped well with that much internet attention at his age. Some Github replies are more immature than the initial action and I hope he does not receive any threat.I hope the Epic developers reach out to him nicely with constructive feedback and maybe a thanks for his well-meaning PR."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The one thing that sours the entire experience for me is that songs take like 5-15s to start playing when selecting one that isn&#39;t super popular.This happens on my ipad, mac, android phone.It feels like some server is spinning up a hard drive to stream it.Apart from that, why the hell is the title and artist only shown in one line that starts scolling instead of showing multiple lines if it doesn&#39;t fit, at least in the album view and the player. It&#39;s such a pain listening to classical music when the composer and the performer and section are not visible without playing it and waiting for the line to scroll, like wtf."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve never seen a search box that couldn&#39;t actually handle input before, but Apple Music made it.If I click in the search box and start typing, the box will lose focus at some random time and all my next keystrokes will count as play commands, usually pausing the music. If I come back to the search box, it happens again.I know &#34;text boxes&#34; are cutting-edge technology that&#39;s barely 3 seconds old and developers are still learning to program them safely. Still, I expected more from a trillion-dollar company."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like Apple Music because it integrates well with the Apple line.More importantly though it is one of the highest paying per stream to artists [1].  Streaming needs to be much more lucrative for artists and consumer choice helps that.It is nice to be able to buy the music as well if you want to support. Being part of Apple One is huge as well.The latest music streaming royalty rates are as follows.    PLATFORM     ROYALTY (PER STREAM) STREAMS TO MAKE $1

    Tidal Music        $0.01284       78

    Apple Music        $0.008         125

    Amazon Music       $0.00402       249

    Spotify            $0.00318       314

    YouTube Music      $0.002         500

    Pandora            $0.00133       752

    Deezer             $0.0011        909

I have lots of mp3/stored music as well and Spotify client started taking like 20-30 minutes to start up. Wasn&#39;t sure what it was doing...Some of their patents for tracking are a bit dystopian as well.New Spotify Patent Involves Monitoring Users’ Speech to Recommend Music&gt; The streaming platform is interested in extracting data points like emotional state, gender, age, and accent to hone its recommendations [2].Nah. Apple already has my info and reasonably treats it well eventhough it is too much, I don&#39;t need another service to invade privacy.[1] https://producerhive.com/music-marketing-tips/streaming-roya...[2] https://pitchfork.com/news/new-spotify-patent-involves-monit..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This protocol has some downsides - if you share the link with large adversarial group (e.g. your school) they can brute force your crush name and it’s basically no different then embarrassingly shouting out your crush name in public and it has problems with canonical names.Instead we can alter it and fix this problems:
Bob will find out his crush’s public key, encrypt &#34;you are my crush&#34; message to it and post it with his own signature to public bulletin (blockchain can be good shelling point). When crush decrypts message they will see proper string, while everyone else will see gibberish.- to solve problems with key distribution we can use &#34;identity based encryption&#34;. it requires trusted third party (e.g. school administrators) but it solves problem for key generation of participants. With identity encryption bob can encrypt message to some canonical identity such as school email. Owner of that email can prove it’s identity to the third party and receive corresponding private key."</p>

Currently, it has only been a benefit, I think, as it enables detailed quality control of say health care services and high-quality register studies.For example, all health/hospital records of deceased Norwegians are digitalized ten years after death and added to a national register. No way to refuse. In my opinion, that is much more invasive, yet it hasn&#39;t been discussed at all by the publichttps://helsedata.no/en/about-helsedata.no/https://www.digitalarkivet.no/en/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"That&#39;s a really awesome story with a great opening, middle, and especially the end, if one ignores the adolescent fraud. I think it really highlights the simple joy that technology that literally just works can bring. I&#39;m around the same age as the author, a little younger in fact, but there&#39;s just something about today&#39;s Internet and a lot of the overwhelming amount of technology that just isn&#39;t fun or memorable. From game consoles to land lines to various other things, there were pieces of technology that just worked and worked well. Of course, there was technology that didn&#39;t work well, but I think part of the tragedy is that a lot of technology that worked well has been replaced by &#34;better&#34; technology that doesn&#39;t work well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just last month I got the opportunity to assist with an art installation that involved a phonebooth, which meant I got to take one home and poke around its insides. It was some of the most delightfully 90s tech I&#39;ve seen in a while - 2-layer PCBs, all through-hole components, only a few well-known ICs... I ended up carefully removing all the &#34;brains&#34; and hooking up the insides to a raspberry pi, which could join a  Discord channel or answer an incoming call when you picked up the phone.Standing next to the phone talking to friends was strangely fun and nostalgic experience, despite the fact I had only used a payphone once in my life. I got a cellphone very quickly (perks of having a tech journalist in the family), so by the time I was old enough to be able to buy a phone card with my own money I no longer needed it. During the pandemic, all of the remaining phonebooths in the country were quietly shut down and dismantled.I know it&#39;s completely irrational, but I&#39;m still sad that I had to eventually return the one I worked on and that in the many years the system was still operational it never occurred to me to buy a card and call someone from a phone booth just for the fun of it.P.S.: If anyone from Slovenia or other ex-Yu countries has any ideas how I could get my hands on one of those Iskra payphones, drop me an email (address in bio). I have so many ideas for projects involving them, but it seems that I&#39;m a bit too late to stand behind the Telekom dumpster and snag a few before they&#39;re scrapped."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thanks for this article and the comments.
Reminds me of a trick we kids did in the early 60s (yeah, sorry) with the British &#39;phone box&#39; pay phones. We called it &#39;tapping the phone&#39;, but it wasn&#39;t spy style listening. Passed from kid to kid the amazing trick was you could dial the number by tapping the handset (10 taps for zero, 9 taps for 9, ..) and the phone would ring the number but you didn&#39;t then have to &#39;press button A&#39; to speak.. you simply made the call, spoke normally, hung up, and pressed button B to get your money back! Sadly, I never tried international calls...
When we moved to New Zealand around &#39;63-4, I discovered the phone dial was reversed, in the UK it was 1-9,0, in NZ it was 9-1,0. (So emergency calls were 111 not 999 as in the UK.) The trick still worked but, except for 0, you had to &#39;10s complement&#39; the taps. Maybe because of that none of the kids I knew at the time in NZ appeared to know the trick..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hey folks, Geoff here from Gitpod. Very pleased to see there continues to be strong interest in open (and FOSS) software development tooling. VSCodium uses the OpenVSX registry (which Gitpod folks created) because the VS Market place is proprietary and can only be connected to from official  Visual Studio branded products.If you can&#39;t find an extension when using VSCodium then please send a pull-request to this repository https://github.com/open-vsx/publish-extensions with the identifier and that will help grow the ecosystem of open tooling.ICMYI - We blogged more about this over at:- https://www.gitpod.io/blog/cloud-ide-history- https://www.gitpod.io/blog/openvscode-server-launch- https://www.gitpod.io/blog/open-vsxIf you got any questions lemme know. &lt;3"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If anyone is interested in an experience report, I&#39;ve been using it for about three years and it&#39;s exactly the same experience as VSCode (even works with Live Share, for example).The main thing you&#39;ll have to contend with is that the extension registry for VSCode is different from Codium, as Geoff says here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31606704This means you might find that extensions you use in VSCode aren&#39;t in Codium. This is usually remedied by just downloading the extension manually yourself or by asking the extension developers to cross-publish."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So glad this exists. It took people quite some time to group up for this.I find it... borderline immoral to have an open source product and then have binaries contain telemetry and other stuff that&#39;s not in the main tree.But, hey, we couldn&#39;t expect Microsoft not to muddy the waters a bit."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Another data point: After writing / (re)writing 20K+ lines of code as a CLI side project in Rust (without touching async), I think I can say it&#39;s the best language for me after 20+ years of experience in other languages. I like the compiler, and I learn a lot from clippy.The &#34;hard&#34; part about Rust is you have to &#34;unlearn&#34; some of the basic mechanisms like scope and ownership that you bring from other languages. It doesn&#39;t allow you to build quick and easy solutions that allows you to lie to yourself (or your boss.) You have to spend more time upfront to compile and fix all warnings, but in my experience so far, fixing these at the right time (i.e. before compilation) is better than fixing them after someone writes a Github issue. I can&#39;t say it eliminates all bugs, but my trust level to my Rust code is around 10x more than my Python code for the same problem. (And I&#39;m writing Python since 2002.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wish there was a Rust-like programming language that was just a little bit higher level than Rust. I like Rust&#39;s wide ecosystem with high quality packages, the nice type system, traits, the idea that my code generally runs pretty fast even if I&#39;m being lazy about writing good code, and my code usually working correctly if it compiles.I care about speed and correctness but Rust makes me also care about ownership and lifetimes even when I don&#39;t really want to care about that stuff. I&#39;ve written Rust for years now and this still occasionally can really slow me down. Rust is still a very nice language so I just deal with it :) no pain no gain.I would love a Rust-with-GC or something in that spirit that is similar to Rust but automatically figures out lifetimes as much as possible and GCs whatever it cannot figure out automatically. I&#39;ve looked at languages like Nim and read about research languages like Koka so I&#39;m optimistic something will emerge from this space I really like."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is rusts most loved status simply Stockholm syndrome? I&#39;ve really tried with rust, and we simply don&#39;t get on. I hear all the arguments about CVEs and wonder if rust will reduce the number of these problems simply by disabling the programmers that create them. I understand the draw, I want to love it, but i think I might not be smart enough."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is amazing, thank you.Seems like several others, my actual development career began on WebOS. In high school, I was intrigued by the idea of a web-based, multitasking capable smartphone and begged my parents to buy me one.Ultimately I learned a ton and have great stories such as staying up all night re-architecting Weatherman (https://appcatalog.webosarchive.com/showMuseumDetails.php?&amp;a...) because of the popularity (and this was before it was on the WebOS store, at this time it was invite-only so I had to post it on a forum!). Weatherman was just a hack on top of a hack on top of a hack. There was no Canvas API on the device so I had to generate the weather images on a server and then send them to the device, for example.The highlight for me was winning one of the top spots in the Palm Hot Apps competition for the &#34;free apps&#34; category with Pixi Dust (https://appcatalog.webosarchive.com/showMuseumDetails.php?ca...). The physics weren&#39;t accurate by any means, but it was the first time I had seriously used C++ (I think it was, it was so long ago!).I miss having platforms like these with innovative ideas and small communities. I learned so much by having to hack my way around the limitations of the operating system, and really miss WebOS overall. I think I might still have an old Palm Pre sitting a drawer somewhere."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow! The Pre was the reason I got into development, because I wanted to be able to run through flashcards on the bus to school. So I built Study Buddy[1]. The joke is by the time I figured out how to really build it, I had a car so it wasn&#39;t quite as personally useful as it could have been. It was a small community but there was a decent amount of teenage developers, maybe 8 or so of us, and I think 10 years later we&#39;re all still in the engineering space, basically because of webOS.[1]: https://appcatalog.webosarchive.com/showMuseumDetails.php?ca..."</p>

Just imagine all the decisions the AI made in incorporating Kermit into the movies: the clothing it&#39;s chosen, how the character wears the clothing, the facial expressions, how to make Kermit himself look similar to the other movies characters. Should he be lanky? pudgy? Even simple decisions like obliviously Kermit in Wall-E is going to be a robot, it has to figure out what he looks like as a robot, what his mouth looks like, that his eyes should be enlarged.It gets a lot of things wrong, like I&#39;m not sure why kermit has a plastic texture in many of the pictures. If you showed me ten pictures of Kermit and ten frames of total recall, and for some reason 8 of your pictures had a plastic Kermit, and asked me to combine them in my head, I&#39;d probably imagine something on-par or worse than what Dalle has managed to do.

Going to be hard to get a new job considering most of the other places have hiring freezes and I chose Coinbase over other offers (mostly from FAANG), these offers have probably been out for over a month now doubt i can resuscitate them.On top of that most of the other offers were for SF, and my partner already has a job in NYC on this basis.Nothing but pain.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; We will rescind a number of accepted offers.This continues to happen over and over again in the industry, and is the reason why I always advise people who get exploding offers from companies to just accept them and then back out later if they need to. Loyalty and respect cannot be a one way street. There&#39;s so much propaganda around &#34;burning bridges&#34; that keeps prospective employees in line (and it also extends to stuff like negotiating wages, discussing salaries at work, job hopping and more).

It blows me away how fraud that&#39;s already had proof dug up by journalists can just sit there with no action from regulators for years on end. Maybe it just needs to go more viral before it stops being ignored or left unseen?[0]: https://seekingalpha.com/article/4307809-enochian-bioscience..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;As part of our research, we purchased a similar black market Russian medical degree from the same school, with the same claimed major, the same date, and the same “official” stamp as Gumrukcu’s. The process was surprisingly easy—the hardest part was smuggling it out of Russia through a neighboring country to the U.S., given new wartime export restrictions.Wow... that&#39;s... interesting. Did their lawyers sign off on that?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In Turkey, there are some fascinating scams and corruption going on or blowing up, Turks don&#39;t get impressed for anything less than a billion dollars these days. Sometimes I feel for the people who don&#39;t speak Turkish and missing out the drama. Now I see that scam exports are happening.The person in question seems to have some footprint in Turkish media too, presented as the genius Turkish doctor doing cutting edge research in the USA. These people often exploit the patriotic feelings of the people. Any questioning  of their claims is viewed as treason by the wider public, so they are usually immune of scrutiny up until the money dries out and someone starts screaming &#34;where is my money&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This really bums me out.I was a convicted felon at 18 years old, poor, living on the street.It wasn&#39;t any government re-integration program that helped me, it was a random person I met in highschool.I worked my way through everything -&gt; college -&gt; jobs -&gt; startups -&gt; lucky windfalls -&gt; owning my own company. I&#39;ve immigrated to Europe (3 times in the last 10 years technically), beating the legal issues each time.And finally, after 17 years, I&#39;m no longer a felon thanks to a pardon and expungement.I really wish something like 70MR would stay up. Not everyone can be as lucky as me. Is there some place I can donate?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I announced the launch of 70 Million Jobs on HN back in 2017, it proved to be one of the most widely read and discussed posts ever on the site. I was totally blown away. Once again, I am struck by the incredibly sensitive and supportive tenor of the reactions to my news here.For some context, besides having a criminal record, I was/am a solo founder who somehow talked his way into Y Comb. Perhaps most surprising is my age: I&#39;m 68. To my friends I grew up with, I&#39;m f&#39;-ing Steve Jobs. To you guys, you&#39;d no doubt see me as the bumbling great uncle at Thanksgiving that isn&#39;t allowed to touch the TV remote control.So it&#39;s all been pretty weird. (wanna see it get weirder? google me and check out my past)As you all know, doing a 2-sided marketplace is always tough. But imagine if neither side of your marketplace was convinced they wanted your product. Chances are you keep your distance from such an undertaking (&#34;Build something people want,&#34; my YC t-shirt says). I build something arguably no one wanted, but I knew they needed. Does that make me a schmuck? Probably.But to those who&#39;ve never gotten close to someone with as record--particularly someone with a different color than you, who was brought into an unfair world from Day One, someone who wanted the same things as you, but never quite figured out how to get there, I&#39;m here to say that some of these folks are the most honorable, humble, appreciate, hard-working people you could imagine. They just want a peaceful life, to take care of their family and get a good night sleep.So that&#39;s where the mission comes in, and that&#39;s when zealots are born. The truth is, I have nothing in my life other than my work. No wife, no kids, no home, nothing. But the satisfaction I got from helping these heroic folks, and the smiles I&#39;d see on their kids&#39; faces when they were reunited, meant/means the world to me. If you don&#39;t have something like this in your life, I urge you to find it. Your karma will thank you for it.I invite you all to ask your questions and continue to opine. If you have something to share that isn&#39;t merely an attempt to win an argument, I&#39;d appreciate your taking the time to email me. More importantly, if you&#39;re ever in a position to hire someone with a record, take the chance. Life is too short not to take chances.  Richard"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There seems to be some confusion here over my use of the expression, &#34;The Great Resignation.&#34; https://www.investopedia.com/the-great-resignation-5199074
This is a economic/workforce phenomenon that began amidst the pandemic and continues. (The NY Times reported today that there are 11.4 million unfilled jobs. That&#39;s historically off the charts.)My company operates/ed a job board and a staffing business. Both ran like traditional job boards (Indeed, Zip Recruiter, etc) and staffing companies (Kelly, Adecco, etc.), except being focused entirely on the formerly incarcerated. This is how large employers source many, many employees.The staffing business was much larger. In this model, we serve as the hirer-of-record, and essentially lease out the workers to our client employers, who cover all our costs (wages, unemployment insurance, taxes, etc.) plus our mark-up (profit). It&#39;s a high volume, low margin business.During the Great Resignation, we found it took 10x the time and effort to get someone placed, eroding our already thin margins. Plus, if a worker left (which they began doing at a great rate), we&#39;re obligated to replace them. All of this made it pretty much impossible for us to make money. (Again, we&#39;re a for-profit business).  I hope this clarifies things."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Related, Washington Post previously published an anonymous open letter from Dalit women in 2020 in the wake of Cisco being sued for caste discrimination: https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/a-statement-on-caste-...One of the most interesting things that stood out to me from this letter and that lawsuit was the assertion by those affected that discrimination on the basis of caste was more impactful and more severe than discrimination suffered due to immigration status, race, and gender in US society, and the letter goes so far as to state &#34;We know that we thrive when we work under a non-Indian boss.  Our work is seen and evaluated on merit, and we are integrated rather than being excluded.&#34;It makes these discussions of castes even more important, especially as Indian immigration continues to rise and Indian culture begins to take precedence in the tech industry.  Being a white American from the Midwest, I had no awareness of caste or caste discrimination when I began my career, but as I got more experienced began to learn about it and unfortunately I have personally witnessed some incidents in the workplace during my career.  I wish that Google had allowed this talk to move forward, because I think ending workplace discrimination is a critical path to ensuring a merit-based free market open to all."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a well-written article with excellent explanations and I thoroughly enjoyed it.However, none of the variants using vmsplice (i.e., all but the slowest) are safe. When you gift [1] pages to the kernel there is no reliable general purpose way to know when the pages are safe to reuse again.This post (and the earlier FizzBuzz variant) try to get around this by assuming the pages are available again after &#34;pipe size&#34; bytes have been written after the gift, _but this is not true in general_. For example, the read side may also use splice-like calls to move the pages to another pipe or IO queue in zero-copy way so the lifetime of the page can extend beyond the original pipe.This will show up as race conditions and spontaneously changing data where a downstream consumer sees the page suddenly change as it it overwritten by the original process.The author of these splice methods, Jens Axboe, had proposed a mechanism which enabled you to determine when it was safe to reuse the page, but as far as I know nothing was ever merged. So the scenarios where you can use this are limited to those where you control both ends of the pipe and can be sure of the exact page lifetime.---[1] Specifically, using SPLICE_F_GIFT."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I once had to change my mental model for how fast some of these things were. I was using `seq` as an input for something else, and my thinking was along the lines that it is a small generator program running hot in the cpu and would be super quick. Specifically because it would only be writing things out to memory for the next program to consume, not reading anything in.But that was way off and `seq` turned out to be ridiculously slow. I dug down a little and made a faster version of `seq`, that kind of got me what I wanted. But then noticed at the end that the point was moot anyway, because just piping it to the next program over the command line was going to be the slow point, so it didn&#39;t matter anyway.https://github.com/tverniquet/hseq"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"That is just cool!  If the author releases an STL, I might actually buy a Gameboy camera just to try it out!  Lost my original one but I&#39;ve still got my Gameboy and other stuff.The thing I loved about Nintendo back then was how they did little things that overloaded the original intent of their devices.  The printer is probably the best example, but the camera is a great one too.  There was just something magical about that.  Same goes for initially owning a Nintendo 64 then getting the Rumble Pak, plugging it in, and suddenly adding a whole new dimension to the game.Those days are long gone, for better and for worse.  Nobody would want or even need such devices because they&#39;d either be built right in or just be a part of the household, as would be the case of a printer.  But even though everyone knew the Gameboy&#39; screen was really crappy for the purpose, there was just something novel about turning it into a camera.  It&#39;s an experience of its time that I&#39;m not sure will be recreated any time soon."</p>

Really interesting to see the modding scene still strong, been thinking of upgrading my gameboy color with a new large screen IPS with Bung Enterprises flash.Lots of interesting and neat stuff on the Game Boy Color, there&#39;s wifi mods, etc"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article takes an off-the-cuff comment from the CEO of Ford and reads too much into it IMO. He wasn’t saying dealerships are going away; he was actually saying the opposite. The point he was making was that Ford is going to adopt some of Tesla’s practices while using the dealership network to compete with them.Here’s the quote with more context:
“I believe for retail, we have to -- it&#39;s kind of like what happened between Amazon and Target. Target could have gone away, but they didn&#39;t. They bolted on an e-commerce platform and then they used their physical store to add groceries and return -- make returns really much easier than Amazon. They used their expertise as a physical retailer to their advantage, but they modernized the e-commerce piece. So it would be really easy to do business with them. It&#39;s exactly what we have to do on the retail side. We got to go to non-negotiated price. We&#39;ve got to go to a 100% online, the vehicle there is no inventory goes directly to the customer, 100% remote pickup and delivery, but then we have this opportunity to use our physical presence, they outperform them. Like, I believe some Mach-E and Lightning customers would love to have a Mustang for the weekend. Maybe they want a Super Duty. I can do that, they can&#39;t do that, unless they ran a Ford.”Source: https://seekingalpha.com/article/4515793-ford-motor-company-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot has been said about the dealership model in the last few years, and the almost universal consensus is that it is an unnecessary and predatory industry and all auto makers should just sell cars directly like Tesla does.That being said, is there any counterpoint to this view? Are there any benefits that dealerships offer today over direct sales? What would we lose if we got rid of every dealership? If there is truly little or no advantage, why has this obvious disruption never come up in the last ~100+ years of car sales in this country and all over the world?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This story makes me smile.Back in the late-2000&#39;s, I worked at CNN on a 12-month contract.  While there, I built a predecessor to the current &#34;Breaking News&#34; website banner.At least at the time, Turner did not allow contractors to extend beyond the 12-month mark.  So when my contract came up, they offered to convert me over to perm.  I declined, because my interests lay more on the backend side of the tech stack, and my role there had been far more frontend-focused than I wanted for the long term.Fast-forward 10 to 15 years, and I&#39;ve had a lot of experiences that I&#39;m very proud of.  I&#39;ve built concurrent systems that scaled to impressive levels of data.  I&#39;ve built event busses that moved hundreds of millions of dollars worth of financial transactions per year.  Etc.STILL, &#34;my son built the Breaking News banner on cnn.com!&#34; is the thing that my mom tells her friends.  It&#39;s the only thing that my wife ever understood about what I do for a living.There is such power in the visual, and in the consumer-side.  In a very real sense, this silly thing was the crowning achievement of my career... and it was about two days of work and a few hundred lines of HTML and jQuery."</p>

That&#39;s very welcome - I hope they succeed. I imagine it could be very hard to pull this off after a ~decade of whatever CNN has been doing though.More context: Discovery and WarnerMedia (former CNN parent company) merged back in April.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"OpenTTD is probably my favourite, but let me put a classic that I really enjoyed into the mix: XBattle [1]. Real-time strategy with an emphasis on area of control and supply line “flow”. All while “abusing” X11 to get multi-player support. It gave me many hours of joy at the Solaris boxes we had at university in the mid 00s. My only concern would be whether it counts as open source with its home-made license [2].[1]: https://web.archive.org/web/20011128105604/http://cns-web.bu...[2]: https://paste.sr.ht/~ninjin/fdd615d6e32e1316014dece892128697..."</p>

But everything else about wordle is great: no barriers, easy to pick up, replayable. So I made rrpg and intend to add content to it.I haven&#39;t really thought about licensing, but I guess I will open-source it, if people like it. Right now it&#39;s just js in the browser, so anyone could copy it. Written with nx in typescript."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve long been enamored with the idea of learning from analog computers to build the next generation of digital ones. In some perspective all our computers are analog, of a sort - today&#39;s computer chips are effectively leveraging electron flow through a carefully arranged metal/silicon substrate, with self-interference via electromagnetic fields used to construct transistors and build up higher order logic units. We&#39;re now working on photonic computers, presumably with some new property leading to self interference, and allowing transistors/logic above that.&#34;Wires&#34; are a useful convenience in the electron world, to build pathways that don&#39;t degrade with the passing of the elections themselves. But if we relax that constraint a bit, are there other ways we can build up arrangements of &#34;organized flow&#34; sufficient to have logic units arise? E.g. imagine pressure waves in a fluid -filled container, with mini barriers throughout defining the possible flow arrangement that allows for interesting self-reflections. Or way further out, could we use gravitational waves through some dense substance with carefully arranged holes, self-interfering via their effect on space-time, to do computations for us? And maybe before we get there, is there a way we could capitalize on the strong or weak nuclear force to &#34;arrange&#34; higher frequency logical computations to happen?Physics permits all sorts of interactions, and we only really use the simple/easy-to-conceptualize ones as yet, which I hope and believe leaves lots more for us to grow into yet :)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I believe one of the earliest applications incorporating this line of thought was MONIAC, the Monetary National Income Analogue Computer, which used water levels to model the economy [0].

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I bought it last night and played for about 5 hours and can&#39;t wait for my work day to end today to get back into it.Overall, I&#39;m pretty happy with it.  Factory building with a dash of colony sim mechanics.  My only criticism is that the tutorial is a bit lacking and basically info-dumps a lot of &#34;what&#34; without a lot of &#34;why&#34;.  If I didn&#39;t have experience with other factory building games, I&#39;d probably be completely lost.  It&#39;d be nice if the game guided you more through the first couple tech tiers.It was also a bit frustrating at first with how expensive conveyer belts are, but then I had a light-bulb moment where I accepted that this is not Factorio/DSP/Satisfactory, and that I don&#39;t NEED conveyer belts everywhere.  In the early game, trucks are cheap and can easily handle the load until I&#39;ve got steady production of Construction Parts II.The Recipe window is REALLY nice.  I love it!  It makes planning so easy!  My only request would be to make it so you can click on a product and have it take you to the recipes involving it.I also really like the design choice to not have to lay power lines everywhere.  In other factory games, it&#39;s such a chore and not at all a fun mechanic.Looking forward to seeing how the game evolves over time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Looks awesome! Congrats on the release, and it seems like you&#39;re getting a pretty good reception so far as well.A few questions:1. How did you get all the assets for your game? Did you make them yourselves? I also work on games as a hobby, but I&#39;m no artist so I struggle to get things looking as good as this game.2. How did you decide to use Unity for your game engine? Did you consider any others, and if so, what was the deciding factor?3. How did you organize your code in Unity, especially on a big, multi-year project like this? I find Unity scenes and prefabs get messy really fast. The only way around this I&#39;ve found is to avoid using the scene/prefab stuff as much as possible and just focus on doing stuff with code instead. But I&#39;d love to hear any strategies you have.4. (Probably most related to the art question) How did you decide to make the game 3d? It just seems a lot more difficult than 2d so it seems like indies tend to avoid 3d when possible. And it definitely seems possible for a top-dow-view strategy game."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m a sad. No Mac. :-(Looks really good. Congrats man. 84% overwhelmingly positive isn’t anything to sneeze at too. The experience must have been amazing. I learned more about computers in developing games that were 1% of what you’ve done. No matter the financial outcome you are winning at nerd life, which is the only life that matters (other than to your spouse your family and friends)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I recently attended an automotive dealership conference where I was being pitched for a product that would let me know if my customers were at rival dealerships. I poked and prodded to understand if these were legitimate claims or just marketing hype. They revealed that they purchased location data from app developers. I was shocked and surprised -- I don&#39;t know why I was because this should have been expected. It really enlightened me on the exploitation and misuse of data by crappy apps."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those of you who don&#39;t know who/what &#34;Tim Horton&#39;s&#34; is allow me to educate and enlighten.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_HortonsIt&#39;s a &#39;fast food/coffee&#39; chain that really was made popular by a recurring skit on a TV show called:  Royal Canadian Air Farce (Sketch based usually heavy on the political satire)The skit had 3 people sitting around a table drinking coffee and cracking jokes about current-events and mostly political fiascos.  It was this lampooning of &#39;typical Canadian behaviour&#39; of art imitating life that caused more people to show up and start hanging out at the corner coffee shop.  In my small home town (40,000 people) there were maybe 3 shops (aka Timmies).  During this boom to it&#39;s popularity that number increased by atleast 10.  They made their doughnuts in-house every morning, and the coffee was tolerated as being acceptable.As the franchise grew in popularity it became something of a joke and expectation that a person could find a Timmies on nearly every block, and you would never need to drive more then 10 minutes to get to the closest one.Throughout it&#39;s financial hardships and ownership changes there has been a lot of complaints that &#34;The coffee isn&#39;t as good as it used to be.&#34; And rumours that McDonalds (with it&#39;s McCafee push) bought Timmies old supplier of beans.Now the food is no longer made in store, and my impression is that the coffee is worse.  There have been other cost-cutting measures like making the popular contest &#34;Roll up the Rim&#34; (where a person could unroll the lip of the cup of coffee to reveal a prize from free confections, to money and a car); becoming an APP-only prize (more like a lottery style jackpot then a winning cup).In total, I am not surprised.  Their quality has gone downhill, and the treatment of staff is horrendous."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I assume every app that has location permission does this. I can&#39;t imagine google doesn&#39;t, or the phone company. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s right (and even less right that apparently google will provide this information to law enforcement). I just think the only practical thing to do is assume you are being tracked and don&#39;t install apps unless you&#39;re ok with the tradeoff.The flip side of this, is why would I ever install a Tim Hortons app, why do I think they are offering an app, and what possible meaningful benefit (even assuming I went there regularly) would I drive from having an app?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I increasingly believe that Facebook’s pivot to Meta will end up going down as one of the biggest misses in the history of business. The metaverse is a real idea yes - but strapping a phone to your face and walking through your coffee table isn’t it. Especially not with a mediocre centralized FB owned “virtual world” where they inflict heavy taxes and content moderation. Facebook has neglected its core businesses for years and seems to have real trouble shipping hardware with reasonable spending.Now they’re scrambling to ship an iPhone alternative to get out from under Apple policy, but it really seems like they’re on constant defense now and have a very tough lift to actually get something truly mass market. I would be shocked if Apple, Microsoft or Google were irrelevant in 2030, but it is really possible (if not yet necessarily probable) that Facebook/Meta might actually just not exist in the same kind of way anymore then.When they first announced the rebrand I actually thought it could be genius and that there’s no way they could have been doing it without a really well considered, heavily backstopped plan… but epic strategic miscalculation seems to be going around a lot this year."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hadn&#39;t seen this before today, but NY Times claims that around a year ago (after the Jan 6th insurrection), Zuckerberg and Sandberg started to go their separate ways.https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/08/business/mark-zuckerberg-...&#34;The pair continued their twice-weekly meetings, but Mr. Zuckerberg took over more of the areas once under her purview. He made the final call on issues surrounding Mr. Trump’s spread of hate speech and dangerous misinformation, decisions Ms. Sandberg often lobbied against or told allies she felt uncomfortable with. Mr. Zuckerberg oversaw efforts in Washington to fend off regulations and had forged a friendly relationship with Mr. Trump.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Sitting by Mark’s side for these 14 years has been the honor and privilege of a lifetime. [...] In the critical moments of my life, in the highest highs and in the depths of true lows, I have never had to turn to Mark, because he was already there.&#34;If this is an accurate reflection of her experience, I don&#39;t expect it&#39;s a side of Mark Zuckerberg most of us imagine exists."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This looks great, and I would have loved to see this when I was in the lab.When the software industry says to you: &#34;We will nearly triple your salary, you don&#39;t have to work weekends, and you also don&#39;t have to feed the mice on a Sunday night.&#34;You will 100% take this deal.I was a 10yr+ academic tool maker in biochemistry, built cutting edge microscopes, hardware, and image analysis software. My lab was successful in our field. I got some papers out of the deal. I also saw things that no human had seen before in a microscope. I worked with very interesting people from around the world. The work in academia is great. You&#39;re moving the needle, new data, new failures. These are the perks. It is also highly possible that you have complete creative control of your project. I did, and it was amazing. Custom designed UIs to streamline our experiments, derived from watching students use the system to do their work. A decathalon of software design.Some reality: Your PI and organization will never compensate you the way the software industry will. In pay, expectations, and benefits. When you&#39;re over 30, and you don&#39;t technically have a real 401k, you are still paying your student loans that you needed to get into this field, and you&#39;re still in the same shitty apartment, something has to give.Comparison is the thief of joy, and when you see your cohort of computer science graduates your joy will be stolen :). It&#39;s good, honest work. A short tour of duty would be useful, and can teach you the difference between splitting the atom and splitting the check.Academia, at least in bioscience, is still very much an ivory tower. You don&#39;t have enough letters after your name to matter, and you will likely be a pet instead of a peer.Don&#39;t stay underwater for too long. Life is short. :D"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well, then science needs to do more to create an environment where software engineers would want to be an RSE.From my experience &#34;science&#34; does not appreciate RSEs, the compensation is bad, the freedom is bad, and you get all of the big company bureaucracy from the University.It&#39;s just a bad environment and to top it off, even if you have a PhD many will see you as &#34;less than.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve worked at a top research university for the past 15 years as a research software engineer. Many of these comments have some truth but a lot are definitely not universally true.Poor compensation: Yup, I&#39;ll cop to that. I could be making way more in &#34;industry&#34; but I make enough to live and I don&#39;t build ad-ware and do take pride in my work.Being a PhD but little respect: I actually have the opposite experience. I&#39;m not a PhD, I don&#39;t even have a Masters. But I can write decent software and I get respect and recognition from my PIs and other top-tier faculty that we&#39;ve collaborated with. I feel like I&#39;ve gotten just as much respect with my humble BS in Comp Sci from a state school than if I got a MS/PhD.Micromanagement: I have the total opposite experience. I&#39;ve worked with the same group for a long time, maybe that changes things. We apply for and receive grants to work on projects. We make high-level assertions for what we will do during the course of the grant and our PI gives us lots of lee-way to meet the goals of the grant in whatever technical way gets results, is FAIR, and open. Granted, I may have just lucked out here."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Kinda related, here&#39;s a few ffmpeg commands i&#39;ve probably spent many hours getting to work just right recently (and they might not even the right way to do these things), perhaps someone will find it helpful. All of these are on a macbook.- play facetime camera (or any avfoundation camera, like a capture card) to mpv  ffmpeg -f avfoundation -video_size 1920x1080  -framerate 30 -drop_late_frames true -i &#34;FaceTime HD Camera&#34; -c:v rawvideo -f matroska -r 30 - | mpv -profile=low-latency -untimed -

- play raw video stream from the usb camlink capture card  ffmpeg -f avfoundation -video_size 3840x2160 -framerate 23.98 -pixel_format uyvy422 -drop_late_frames true  -i &#34;Cam Link 4K&#34; -c:v rawvideo -f matroska - | mpv -profile=low-latency -untimed -

- Capture video, and do live HVEC hardware encoding on apple hardware and save result. Control quality with q variable. q=85 is around 250Mb/s:  ffmpeg -f avfoundation -video_size 3840x2160 -framerate 23.98 -i &#34;Cam Link 4K&#34; -c:v hevc_videotoolbox -q:v 85 -r 23.98 -tag:v hvc1 &lt;filename&gt;_x265.mp4

- Use named pipe with mkfifo to play a stream. Sometimes this produces less input lag than other methods.  mkfifo /tmp/fifo1
  cat /tmp/fifo1 | mpv -profile=low-latency -untimed -
  ffmpeg -f avfoundation -video_size 1920x1080  -framerate 30 -drop_late_frames true -i &#34;FaceTime HD Camera&#34; -c:v rawvideo -f matroska -r 30 - &gt; /tmp/fifo1"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some codecs, like h264, require the width and height be divisible by 2. Scaling with -1 will sometimes fail because of that.If you use -2 instead it will adjust so that it is even.[^1]For example:    ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf scale=720:-2 output.mp4

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"  &gt;   1) internal users: mainly developers by providing CI/CD
  &gt;   2) external users: end users
  &gt;
  &gt; Nowadays we call people that do 1) DevOps and people that do
  &gt; 2) SREs (so one could argue that the role of sys admins just
  &gt; got more specialized).

Both are called sysadmins.SRE is a specialized software engineering role -- you&#39;d hire SREs if you wanted to create something like Kubernetes in-house, or do extensive customization of an existing solution. If you hire an SRE to do sysadmin work, they&#39;ll be bored and you&#39;ll be drastically overpaying.DevOps is the idea that there shouldn&#39;t be separate &#34;dev&#34; and &#34;ops&#34; organizations, but instead that operational load of running in-house software should be borne primarily by the developers of that software. DevOps can be considered in the same category as Scrum or Agile, a way of organizing the distribution and prioritization of tasks between members of an engineering org.---With this in mind, the question could be reframed as: if projects such as Kubernetes are changing the nature of sysadmin work, why has that caused more sysadmin jobs to exist?I think a general answer is that it&#39;s reduced the cost associated with running distributed software, so there are more niches where hiring someone to babysit a few hundred VMs is profitable compared to a team of mainframe operators."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Kubernetes is a Google scale solution.  Lots of teams said “hey if Google does it then it must be good!”…but forgot that they didn’t have the scale.  It caught on so much that for whatever reason it’s now the horrendous default.  I’ve worked on at least 3 consulting projects that incorporated K8s and it slowed everything down and took way too much time, and we got nothing in return - because those projects only needed several instances, and not dozens or hundreds.If you need less than 8 instances to do host your product, run far away anytime anyone mentions k8s"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Threads like the below are why DevOps jobs exist and why Kubernetes infrastructure skills pay so much and why there&#39;s such a large demand.Yes, it&#39;s quite complicated.No, an API to control a managed EKS/GCK cluster + terraform + Jenkins/Azure DevOps/etc. does not mean that magically the developer can &#39;just deploy&#39; and infrastructure jobs are obsoleted.  That&#39;s old AWS marketing nonsense predating Kubernetes.There&#39;s a whole maintenance of the CI/CD factory and its ever demanding new requirements around performance, around Infosec requirements, around scale, and around whatever unique business requirements throw a wrench in the operation.Sticking to ECS I guess is a valid point.  What Kubernetes gives you is a more sophisticated highly available environment built for integration (Helm charts and operators and setups that when they work give you more levers to control resources allocations, separations of app environments, etc.)And as an aside, I&#39;ve been doing this for 20 years and long before Kubernetes, before Docker, hell, before VMs were used widely in production, I observed the developer mindset: Oh but it&#39;s so easy, just do X.  Here, let me do it.  Fast forward a year of complexity later, you start hiring staff to manage the mess, the insane tech debt the developers made unwittingly, and you realize managing infrastructure is an art and a full time job.A story that is visible with many startups that suddenly need to make their first DevOps hire, who in turn inherit a vast amount of tech debt and security nightmares.Get out of here with, it&#39;s just API calls.  DevOps jobs aren&#39;t going away.  It&#39;s just the DevOps folks doing those API calls now."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The tool is useful, but let down by Wikipedia images not being linked to the relevant Wikidata ID. I selected just the red circles (no photo). About half of these already have photos in the Wikipedia article that isn&#39;t linked to the Wikidata ID. Adding the image attribute to the Wikidata fixes it and the red dot disappears about 60 seconds later.So before you head out with your camera, perhaps do some linking first. What&#39;s left surprises me with articles with no photo, which I would have thought someone would have done by now. So I&#39;ll be the first!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A word on Creative Common licenses:Wikipedia only considers CC0, CC-BY and CC-BY-SA licenses free enough for the image to be included without any issues. With these licenses, you could also add images to Wikipedia that are not your own, which would greatly speed up coverage.I&#39;m specifically mentioning this because some CC licenses seem permissive, but are not permissive enough for Wikipedia. A key example of this is iNaturalist, which contains millions of photos of all kinds of species that would be useful to add to Wikipedia articles.Their default license is CC-BY-NC. Most photographers on that platform just leave it to that default unaware or not interested in licensing in the first place. Some might be aware of this default license and think they&#39;re being permissive and generous, making possible exactly sharing across services like Wikipedia.Unfortunately, no. It&#39;s a painful mismatch as many of those photographers would likely be perfectly fine with the image being used in that context, but the Wikipedia license requirements prevent this.Similarly, even a license containing an attribution requirement (which is morally perfectly reasonable) is problematic. You find a photo from user &#34;anon2522&#34; on platform X that last posted 8 years ago. The attribution information is really soft and fragile, it doesn&#39;t really link to an actual person and the little information you have may disappear at any time.Bottom line, if you&#39;re truly creating an image &#34;for the good of the world&#34;, CC0 is highly recommended. You can still attribute yourself in EXIF or as a small stamp on the photo itself."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"FWIW I also had a recent experience with Cloudflare &#34;Trust &amp; Safety&#34; and it was my first negative Cloudflare experience, unfortunately.A client-of-a-client had their site reported to CF for malware distribution via Netcraft. I reviewed the site and found nothing unsual-looking. I dug out a month&#39;s worth of access logs for the site, carefully filtered them, and then eyeballed all of the tens of thousands of remaining lines, and again, nothing unusual. No sign whatsoever that the site had ever distributed any malware.There were signs that the site had been probed a number of times by one or a few bad actors, a bit more than just the usual background scanning. Best guess was that, having failed to take the site down through direct means, somebody filed some fraudulent reports against it.DigitalOcean also received a report on the site, and that&#39;s where the difference in handling the issue really became apparent. I sent essentially the same response to both DO and CF. DO sent back a quick, &#34;thanks for taking a look at it, we&#39;re not going to take any action at this time, have a nice day&#34; response.Cloudflare on the other hand pre-emptively took the site down and then took a while to reply at all. When they did, the reply was extremely opaque: &#34;this report has been processed&#34;. Like, okay... and?I had by that time already routed the site off of Cloudflare and had it back online, so the impact was minimal, but now that I know what it&#39;s like to deal with this category of issue at Cloudflare, I have to ensure that it&#39;s always easy to take anything off of Cloudflare. I love Cloudflare generally, so this is really disappointing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can’t believe how lightheartedly you are taking this.
(edit: I guess your initial reaction when the domain was reinstated was probably a bit of euphoria).This faceless corporation simply took away your property without explanation or warning, and didn’t even feel any obligation to explain why.For many people the consequences might have been losing their own or even their family’s source of income.Their behavior was despicable and callous.When did these tech companies start thinking they were all-powerful and above the law like this?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Anyone saying &#34;Good riddance! Go enjoy your life without Facebook!&#34; is missing the point. Please read this bit from the article:&gt; Thing is I’m a Mum of two who has just moved to a new area. Facebook groups have offered me support and community, and Mums I’ve met in local playgrounds have added me as a friend so we can use messenger to plan playdates. Without these apps sadly my little social life becomes a lot lonelier, and harder.This is the pernicious effect of Facebook&#39;s dominance among social networks added to their policy of poor support. It&#39;s not really an &#34;optional&#34; social network if large swathes of your social circle have started using it for essential life functions, it&#39;s more like a utility and should be regulated like one. And no, telling all the mums at the playground about how Facebook&#39;s ban policies are bad and we should all use the Fediverse instead is not going to work for the average person. If anything, it&#39;s more likely to mark you down as one of those weird parents to avoid.It wouldn&#39;t be good for your power company to have the option of arbitrarily cutting you off as a customer, and never giving you a chance to get back your power. Similarly, we should regulate Facebook to the point where they are exposed to genuine regulatory consequences for disrupting people&#39;s lives."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s not just hackers you need to worry about.I joined Facebook in 2020 - immediately secured, 2FA switched on and all the settings reviewed.I lost the account in 2021 after I made the world&#39;s dullest post about the 12V system in a Nissan Leaf. In a Leaf car group. An automatic system determined my post breached community standards and required me to verify my account to continue using it.Fiiine, OK, I upload my driving licence. And it won&#39;t accept the upload. I try JPEG, PNG, different sizes, different browsers, different computers. Nothing seems to stick and after a certain number of attempts it says I have to wait a week to try again. After as couple of rounds of this the expiry deadline passes and my account is gone.I created another without hassle (and still treat FB as the contact method of last resort), but was still surprised at how easily they nuked a genuine user doing ordinary things."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Increasing we automate processes, have programs do the work humans once did.It&#39;s extremely helpful and productive, but it has a darker side. The processes are rigid because machines are rigid, and the designers cater to the 99% cases.But then the 1% happens, and you&#39;re left out in the cold.In the old world of humans and paper, as wasteful as it was, it was easy for exceptions to be made if the clerk was willing, and if they weren&#39;t you&#39;d find another clerk, or a clerks supervisor. The processes tended towards being flexible.But today, you increasingly don&#39;t interact with any humans, or if you do don&#39;t be surprised if, in your unusual case, they say &#34;the computer won&#39;t let me&#34;.As governments move more and more towards digitization, and embrace machine learning, I expect similar stories might unfold - only it won&#39;t be with an opt in social media website."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Arbitration consumer protection attorney here! Nice work, and nice write up.If nothing else, I hope folks will run with your first point. Far too many people are scared of arbitration, and it can be a really powerful tool for situations like this. It’s fairly accessible and straightforward, especially for folks in the HN crowd.One pointer for other folks in the future is to make sure you look into your state’s specific consumer protection law. (Sometimes called UDAP law or deceptive practices act.) Often times, these laws will allow you to recover more than just your out of pocket damages to punish companies that are deceptive.One other way to “enlarge the pie” in situations like this is to hire an attorney. I know, it sounds like I’m shilling for my peers, but hear me out. This same UDAP consumer protection laws let you recover attorneys’ fees as part of a judgment/win. If you’re not an attorney, you simply can’t seek those.So let’s say your claim is $2,000. Under those laws, maybe you can “treble” (triple) your damages if you win. So now your best day is $6,000. And the company knows it.But if that same law says you can get attorneys’ fees too, the company knows that they could be facing a 50k+ judgment at the end (almost entirely comprising attorneys’ fees), and then that often incentivizes earlier, higher settlements. My involvement in cases, and the threat of attorneys’ fees often results in higher settlements than my client would get on their “best day,” and even after paying out my portion. (I typically do these on contingency — I don’t get paid unless you get paid).Lastly, let’s just say I’ve done an arbitration or two with a home warranty company. They don’t make money by paying out claims!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; It went pretty well....&gt; [...] I counter-offered 80% plus arbitration filing fee reimbursement. The next day, they responded back with an acceptance and sent over a release form. Case pretty much closed. I didn’t get 100% back, [...]So author had to jump through hoops and in the end only got a percentage of what was owed. The text is written in the format of a feel-good success story, but the result is the oposite. What is described is a broken system, if the only punishment for the crime is to do what they should have done in the first place then there is no incentive for companies to do the right thing to begin with. Customer protection laws absolutely need a clause for double the reimbursement and I&#39;m shocked that this person&#39;s country (I&#39;m assuming it is the USA) doesn&#39;t have it. Without such a clause it is best for the company to just deny ALL claims and profit out of the people too lazy to go through arbitration."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In my experience, lots of companies have more or less automatic denial on requests. This is to filter out those that simply give up on step 1. Then the same companies will, like OP points out, offer some % in reimbursement / whatever to those that bother to appeal the initial denial. It&#39;s a disgusting practice, IMO - but what can you do?A bit OT:But ESPECIALLY the rental market - professional or private - is horrible on this. Before purchasing my home, I had rented 7 different apartments over the years.No mater how thorough I&#39;d be on washing out apartment, or how careful I&#39;d be with it, they would always find something - and claim deductions on the deposit.This worked for the first apartment I rented - after that I got wiser, and took pictures of everything before actually moving in. Better yet, with the landlord or representative as witness. Document everything. I even recorded the phone conversation - informing that the conversation would be recorded, and if that was a problem, we&#39;d take everything in writing.This saved me lots of deposits. Like clockwork, I&#39;d be informed that they found something - sending evidence. I&#39;d reply back with my evidence, and suddenly everything&#39;s OK."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been donating to SomaFM for many years, and it is my music provider of choice in my home office (Space Station Soma for me).  Some years ago I had an afternoon to kill while visiting San Francisco and Rusty was kind enough to let me stop by and say hello.  A quick 10 minute visit turned into one of the most interesting two hours I&#39;ve spent in my entire life.  Rusty gave me the whole tour of the software interface that runs SomaFM and we had a fascinating discussion about the history of SomaFM in particular and streaming music in general.  Thanks again Rusty!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"SomeFM is such a rarity these days, a reminder of how we believed the Internet was going to be.They take recurring donations. Probably the best way to help them and one of the best investments for me, as keeping it up and running is a way to keep these naive ideas alive.The music is curated and is most excellent (for my taste, of course). I have Groove Salad on speed dial in my HomePods around the house (through TuneIn radio).Thank you Rusty for sticking with it!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really miss Shoutcast/Icecast being such an active part of my life. The quality is way down, and there&#39;s like 1/6th the channels there used to be. For electronica in particular, there was just so much. But there were also so many random niche stations!SomaFM continues to be a great place for highly genre-d music. I make sure to give em money semi-regularly. Suburbs of Goa[1] is one of my favorite.[1] https://somafm.com/suburbsofgoa/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hello! I am the creator of Don’t Wordle. Really excited to see this took off today.I thought I would share some background about the game, some of the iterations I went through, and some of the future features I would like to add.Background:
Like many others, I have been playing Wordle daily. Recently, my Wordle win streak hit 99. I was admittedly very careful with my guesses on Day 100, not wanting to ruin my streak. Then I began to wonder…even if I wanted to lose intentionally, could I do it? Obviously, I could make intentionally bad guesses, but that would take the fun out of it. So I decided to build Don’t Wordle.Iterations I have gone through:The first version of the game was simpler and much worse IMO. I did not display the “Valid Words Remaining” at the top, and there was no concept of “Undos&#34;. Initially, I actually displayed the Wordle word at the top throughout the entire game! To be honest, that doesn’t change the difficulty of the game that much. However, given that the spirit of the game is not to guess the Wordle word, it seemed like the right decision to hide it.I created the “Valid Words Remaining” feature when I realized how challenging the game was. I kept getting stuck and wondering whether there were even any words left besides to Wordle word. When I saw how fast the count shrinks, I felt the game was a lot more interesting.I then added the concept of “Undos” when I realized the game was still too challenging. It’s particulary lame if you’re playing the game for the first time and you get eliminated after just 1 or 2 guesses.Current Tech Stack:-Route53 + Cloudfront + S3 + Create React AppUnexpected challenges:1. The animations. I obviously copied all the concepts from the original Wordle, but I failed to appreciate the complexity.2. The nuances of the repeat letter words.3. What makes a Wordle square yellow? The answer is not so simple4. Trying to get www.dontwordle.com and dontwordle.com to take you to the same URL (either www.dontwordle.com or dontwordle.com) and still support TLS and only use the tech I mentioned above. I actually still don’t have it working perfectly. I know of a solution, but it’s overly complicatedFeatures I would like to still add:1. I have heard from multiple people that it’s annoying how you could get the game in an unwinnable state without realizing it. For example, maybe 20 valid words remain, but there is no valid sequence of words remaining to finish the puzzle. While the “Valid Words Remaining” feature is nice, it would also be cool to have a “Valid Solutions Remaining” feature2. I would like to build a brute force solver that you can watch attempt to play the game in real-time. I have built something similar for a crossword puzzle and really enjoyed watching the computer try to fill the grid. I think it would be cool to do that same thing with this game.Question I don’t yet know the answer to:Do any words exist that would not have a single valid solution in this game?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It would be nice if there was a Give Up button. I got down to 30 possible words but could not for the life of me think of what they could be. I was craving that “Ohhhhh!!!!!” feeling when you see what the remaining possible words are."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The essence of any wildly popular single-player game = hard to win quickly + very hard to lose."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have a mildly surprising snippet which I believe they don&#39;t have. It&#39;s about interaction of class and instance attributes with behavior of &#34;X += Y&#34;. Python expands it to &#34;X = X + Y&#34; but only if X implements &#34;+&#34; but not &#34;+=&#34;    class A:
        a = (1,)  # tuples are immutable and don&#39;t have &#34;+=&#34;
        b = [1,]  # lists have &#34;+=&#34;
   
    obj = A()
    obj.a += (2,)  # this creates obj.a
    obj.b += (2,)  # this modifies A.b

The snippet prints &#34;(1,) [1,2]&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The article is better than the headline.Remember that the reason we use so much land is because that&#39;s the cheapest way to grow food.   We could grow more food on less land by farming more intensively.   We don&#39;t because that would make the food more expensive.   At an extreme, a greenhouse can increase yields 100x but at an increase in costs of 10x."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You can already see this trend in the western world. In our county, we may have rezoned 1/2 of our farmland in the last few decades.It&#39;s just a pity they all turn into housing developments. We should really be setting aside more as green space."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is promising, but it does basically rely on human populations stabilizing fairly soon.  Interestingly the most solid factors for that is women&#39;s education and rights and children&#39;s health care, that correlates most closely with reduced population growth (I mean, not many people would really want to pump out ten kids and watch six to eight of them die of childhood diseases, which was about the pre-industrial norm, given the choice - having two kids is the basic replacement number assuming they survive to adulthood).Hydroponics plus desalination is kind of interesting, as then you could grow some crops on seriously non-arable land, although I don&#39;t recall ever seeing high-protein crops (such as legumes with associated nitrogen-fixing bacteria) grown hydroponically.  In terms of total calories per land area IIRC potatoes are the big winners there, never seen hydroponic potatoes either."</p>

I was recently talking with a potential customer in the legal field, and he was interested in my startup&#39;s software, which helps people read on screen more quickly/easily. But at one point he turned to me and said &#34;I know one of the senior lawyers is going to ask me if using your software is going to cause the billable volume to go down for their associates.

People have all sorts of weird excuses to talk themselves out of billing days --- &#34;what if I only have an hour worth of work to do?&#34; Bill a day. See how easy it is?The last consulting company I built had a minimum billing increment of a fiscal quarter. I co-ran a consulting company for almost 10 years that did minimum-daily billing, for a pretty big and diverse set of clients, and nobody pushed back on the billable day.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"So long story short: after decades of mergers and acquisitions, the only 2 options to get home Internet in Canada is through TV cable (owned by one monopoly) or the phone cable (owned by another monopoly).Monopolies being monopolies are charging the consumers exorbitant prices, making Canada one of the countries with the most expensive Internet.To create some semblance of competition, the 2 companies owning the infrastructure are required to rent it to smaller service providers (although at arbitrary prices effectively pricing them out). The arbitrary pricing was contested by the smaller providers and the regulator attempted to mandate fixed prices for infrastructure access. That was in turn contested by the monopolies, arguing that they were forced to subsidize the smaller providers.That said, I think it would be a much better idea if our government had balls to actually separate infrastructure owners from the service providers, and block further mergers. So multiple end user facing companies would compete for access to the same infrastructure, and the infrastructure owners would compete for servicing the providers, not being able to directly own either of them. Both layers would be have the incentives to offer good service at reasonable prices, while the current incentive for the infrastructure owners is to hamper the small players as much as they can."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Montrealer here: We&#39;re fucked.Bell, one of the two main internet providers, just bought my independent provider Ebox. There were a rather dependent independent mind you, all their lines were rented.If I want fiber, Bell is my only option. Not the main one, the only one. Their pricing is reasonable if memory serves, but their customer experience is notoriously awful. I will never deal with them again unless I&#39;m absolutely forced to.Anyway, good article, we&#39;re fucked, deregulation brings us misery once more."</p>

Can it be used as a standalone library  for implementing fibers in application code?Also it seems that spinlock has become a defacto standard in the DB world today, thanks for not falling into the trap (because 90% of the users of any DB do not need spinlocks).Another curious question would be - why not implement with seastar (since you&#39;re not speaking to disk often enough)?"</p>

Repairability. While we could _technically_ replace the burnt out fuse in the Maytag, it would take at least two hours for a skilled technician (translated to several days for me and my spouse spread across a few weeks) and frankly we want to repair and get back to life. After a few days of looking into the issue and considering the option, we bit the bullet and bought a new one.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great project and writeup; just one more example why we should always be cautious about &#34;smart&#34; devices, for that smartness nearly always aimed at eliminating customers choices.I wonder what does the device electronics do beyond checking for the original cassette and its eeprom; it doesnt seem it would have to do anything more complex than opening water, and detergent valves/pumps for a certain time while keeping the right temperature; nothing that even the simplest uC and couldn&#39;t do; a further development could involve probing all signals at sensors and actuators during normal operation, then getting rid of the old electronic to allow the device taking detergents directly from the tanks, so resetting the cassette eeprom wouldn&#39;t be needed anymore because there would be no need to insert one.
This of course would invalidate the warranty, but for some of us that is a plus point:)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Has anyone worked on fighting back this kind of telemetry/spyware of essential consumer appliances?I&#39;m thinking something similar to what https://adnauseam.io/ does, but but amplified:1. Someone reverse engineer what does the device send to which address.
2. Block the particular device to access internet (and make it easy for others too).
3. Constantly send bogus data to the manufacturer so the personal data they get overall loses value or is unusable. Make it easy for a lot of people to do it as well, or even just rent a bot farm.There&#39;s too many legit and good services that end up being turned down due to abuse and DDos, and they don&#39;t even bring anything good to the attackers. Why not using these techniques for something actually good to consumers privacy?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just wait until device manufacturers start integrating always-on LTE modems with their own SIM cards and billing so they can pull device analytics, sell you new advertising, and sell your usage patterns to 3rd parties whether or not you ever connect the things to your home wifi.At which point you&#39;ll have to disassemble the damned thing and physically rip out the LTE modem, possibly resulting in the device bricking itself when it can&#39;t phone home after a while.I bet if you&#39;re a device manufacturer right now and go to t-mobile enterprise sales and tell them you want 200MB of data per month per IMEI and you&#39;re going to have 50,000 units, you&#39;ll get a very attractive monthly price per unit.Mark my words, it&#39;ll be commonplace in another 8-10 years.https://me.me/i/tech-enthusiasts-everything-in-my-house-is-w...https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/01/unauthorized-bread-a-..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s sad, but not only because it means people are forced to buy new too often or because of the atrocious increasing e-waste associated with it.It&#39;s sad because folks will be less and less interested in fixing their things or simply opening their devices to understand how they work. It&#39;ll be general knowledge that it&#39;s &#34;dangerous&#34; to attempt a repair, and they&#39;re impossible to fix anyway.Attempting a repair is one of those sparks that nurture curiosity. It&#39;s the same spark that ultimately gave us Apple and many other great businesses. Why are we indirectly undermining ingenuity and inventiveness? Is it a false perception? Or maybe Hanlon&#39;s razor?On the other side, China has relatively affordable access to parts (low-level components included), schematics, extensive tooling and a growing hacker/maker culture.Sometimes, I feel we (occidentals) are going into reverse."</p>

Do they just throw cash/donations at them?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you&#39;ve been exposed to both Western and Eastern cultures, this is probably something you&#39;ve seen both sides of.I grew up in Egypt. Family was family, including extended family. You don&#39;t choose them, and you can&#39;t really distance yourself from them (you&#39;d be crazy to try). You can to some extent choose your friends in school, but that is mostly &#34;shared context&#34;—they are people who probably are from your neighborhood or from the same &#34;social class&#34; (yes, Egypt was/is very class-ist).I live in the US. Everything is very individualistic, and even for those with families, it&#39;s very nuclear-family-oriented. Boundaries are well-respected. I&#39;d say when friendships are formed, they&#39;re usually more around shared activities, regardless of where someone might be originally from, what their background is, etc.Very different worlds, with pros and cons in each."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this phenomenon is part of the reason it&#39;s difficult to form friendships as adults. The shared context that the article mentions requires a lot of time around your circle of people, just &#34;hanging out&#34;. It&#39;s tough to make that time as an adult with a career, family, etc.This may be why college friendships can be so strong – often a lot of time is spent living and working around friends by default, without needing to schedule it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The NYTimes has an article &#34;Why it is hard to make friends over 30&#34; that gets reposted almost every year [1]. There&#39;s a quote about friendship conditions:&#34;As external conditions change, it becomes tougher to meet the three conditions that sociologists since the 1950s have considered crucial to making close friends: proximity; repeated, unplanned interactions; and a setting that encourages people to let their guard down and confide in each other, said Rebecca G. Adams, a professor of sociology and gerontology at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. This is why so many people meet their lifelong friends in college, she added.&#34;But it&#39;s worthwhile noting that these conditions are simply that: conditions. Their existence do not inexorably lead to friendships. They are necessary but insufficient conditions.I&#39;ve been in many situations where all 3 were present but I didn&#39;t feel a simpatico with the other person. I&#39;ve taken weekend trips with people whom I never wanted to interact with again because I did not like what I saw on the trip (vulnerability can backfire -- if someone is vulnerable about how evil they are, I&#39;m not likely to appreciate that). I don&#39;t really keep in touch with most college friends either.On the other hand, there&#39;s something that does lead to fast and lasting friendships for me: it&#39;s that indescribable feeling when someone is on the same &#34;wavelength&#34;. It&#39;s a collocation of a bunch of things: the way they view the world (even if they are of a different political stripe), a shared sense of humor, and something you admire about them.Shared context definitely creates the conditions under which such people can be identified, but mere shared context itself cannot create resonant frequencies that are not there.[1] https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/fashion/the-challenge-of-..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a good one, I hope I&#39;ll have mine for that long (started 2019).Personally, I stopped worrying about dotfiles and GNU stow after joining the cult of Nix. While I gave honest attempt to everything else, Nix made it stick. Now I only have one single repo, where In write config for (almost) all of my applications in Nix, deploy them with Nix, rollback with Nix etc. Compared to hodgepodge of INI/YAML/TOML/XML/JSON/WHATHAVEYOU it is nice to to only have single tool to worry about.I wished Guix had the momentum and size of Nixpkgs. I&#39;d much prefer a Lisp than the language contraption of Nix."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Saying that I’ve been maintaining my dotfiles for a decade is like saying that I’ve been decorating my home for a decade.I think it&#39;s more like decorating your home for the first time (which is a lot of work), but then in the proceeding years you keep tweaking a few bits to your liking as you learn more about &#34;decoration&#34;.The true benefits of the analogy break down a little, for instance one big advantage is persistence, stability and control - that some large corporation doesn&#39;t keep rudely breaking into your home every month and forcefully redecorate everything with the latest trend, or keep moving the furniture and light switches around while you are asleep, and inserting annoying store fronts into critical appliances like the fridge, or your toothpaste... The other benefit being that you can fairly effortlessly take your decorations with you to your next home!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For my dotfiles [1] I use https://www.chezmoi.io which I really like using and stuck (as opposed to my previous dotfiles attempts which didn’t stick). 
Albeit I have only been using it for a few months as opposed to the author’s decade.I guess the idea is to find the one tool/methodology that sticks with you.[1] https://github.com/politician/dotfiles"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I know Yubikeys are pretty old hat by now, but I still feel weirded out by relying something like this into a USB stick. I just know I would lose the key at some point locking me out from everything. Of course the solution is to have two keys, but don&#39;t really know where I would feel comfortable storing the extra key (also how often do you check that it still works?)I&#39;m probably just over thinking this and overly paranoid."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; As of OpenSSH 8.2 (Feburary 14, 2020) you are able to store an SSH private key on a yubikey! Here&#39;s how to do it.Many systems still don&#39;t have OpenSSH 8.2 (Windows 11, older debian stable, etc). For those, another solution is to use the PGP applet of the YubiKey, which exposes a regular RSA key.This guide has worked well for me: https://github.com/drduh/YubiKey-GuideYou can jump to the SSH sections if that&#39;s all you&#39;re after.There&#39;s a missing piece for Windows, since the agent coming with WinGPG won&#39;t be reachable by SSH. Some guy on GitHub put out a workaround, but I can&#39;t find it right now.--edit: The workaround for Windows is this one: https://github.com/rupor-github/win-gpg-agent"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You can use a GPG key stored on a YubiKey with openssh, but with some caveats:1. gpg-agent must act as your ssh-agent (which means ssh-agent should be disabled and replaced by gpg-agent).2. If using `pinentry-curses` (YubiKey usually permits access to the contained GPG key via the use of a pin), you must have `export GPG_TTY=$(tty)` (or your shell&#39;s equivalent of setting the GPG_TTY environment value to the output of `tty`).3. You can fetch the public key of your GPG key with `ssh-add -L` (gpg-agent must be acting as your ssh-agent, and the YubiKey with the GPG key has to be plugged in).4. You must have the line `enable-ssh-support` in your `$GNUPGHOME/gpg-agent.conf`.I used a guide[1] to set up a GPG key on to a YubiKey, and for those who don&#39;t want to use GPG, the guide also has a section[2] about just using an SSH key as well.[1]: https://github.com/drduh/YubiKey-Guide[2]: https://github.com/drduh/YubiKey-Guide#ssh"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"1. Take time off, like a month or more. [1]  Use it to do anything other than coding.  Hone a hobby, travel, volunteer, etc.  No-one will care about a month or two gap on your resume.2. You are worth more than you currently think you are.  Internalize this, know this, that is key.  &#34;I am a sole developer for Mobile and Web platforms at this startup in a very small team&#34; --&gt; is a desirable skill in and of itself.3. Stop working 80 hour weeks, stop working weekends.  When the only thing you do has little/no reward, that is what causes burnout.4. Fill your time with something else that you prioritize above work.  Make it hard to find time to work.  This both prevents slipping back to 80 hr weeks, and forces your brain to prioritize important things within your work life (like executing and finishing projects).5. Networking is key.  I don&#39;t have good advice here as this is a challenge for me also.  But -- switch jobs often (every couple years), and be friendly and helpful (within reason) to your co-workers.  They&#39;re now your network.My background -- coding since I was 6, now 36 -- but I&#39;ve shared many of the same feelings.[1] I am assuming you have the basic financial stability to support this.  My apologies if not."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of stuff going on here.1. You&#39;re clearly NOT incompetent. If you were, you couldn&#39;t possibly hold the web and mobile platform together entirely on your own for that long AND handle every on call incident.2. The thing that surprised me most about burnout was the physical symptoms. You&#39;ve got them. It only gets worse from here if you keep doing what you&#39;re doing.3. It makes perfect sense to me that you don&#39;t feel like you&#39;re getting better in that environment. The rockstar developer is a myth, but the band is not. You get better by practicing with other talented people.4. You already know this, but you&#39;re being taken advantage of.So given all that...1. Everyone telling you to take a break is correct. Go outside and look at trees, read a book somewhere scenic, shut off your phone. If you need to take sick time to do this, so be it. It&#39;s not going to make you feel normal, but it will give your wildly overworked brain some relief.2. Hit up recruiters, hit up whatever network you have (including old acquaintances). Your story is incredibly straightforward: you held the line on these systems by yourself for years on end, including all their on-call needs, it&#39;s enough work for a 4-person team, and no help is coming. You&#39;re looking to work on an actual team where people actually learn from each other.3. If possible, take some time off between the old job and the new job just to take care of yourself.Good luck."</p>

Your boss pays for 40 hours, you do 40 hours. He wants more? He pays more. He thinks it&#39;s a bad deal? You go work somewhere else for someone that does want to pay for your service.Even though you are an employee, imagine that you are a freelancer selling your service. No pay, no service.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The pandemic taught me a lot about apocalypse. While people are a lot slower to buy into collective action and changing their way of life than I thought, society is far more robust than I expected. Covid looked nothing like a pandemic film, thank god.With that in mind, I have some ideas on what programming will look like in 30 years:1. New frameworks and abstractions for making apps even more disposable while maintaining privacy will come along. New languages will happen. Corporations that just finished moving to the cloud will now be moving to even greater abstractions like Airtable or whatever comes next.2. Programmer pay will decrease compared to other industries. This is a hunch and I’m only 60% confident of it happening.3. Satellite internet will be more of a norm for no better reason than it’s the most efficient way to manage infrastructure. More rural communities will need it, and remote trends will continue. The cost of launches are going down and there’s a lot of land.4. Everything will get more energy efficient, and most intense activity will be pushed to compute farms.5. VR will once again come around as the next big revolution in computing, but will be ultimately disappointing and won’t see mass adoption.Beyond these ideas, I think too much plays into our personal optimism or pessimism. I think things will change, but we’re a scrappy species that will fight to preserve its way of life. It will look a lot like our global pandemic response…warts and all. There’s a lot there to be disappointed about, but it’s actually incredible it wasn’t worse.When these predictions hit I’ll be 70. I hope I’ll live to see it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I agree that we need to plan for climate adaptation (preparing for predictable problems) and resilience (preparing for unpredictable problems), but I have a few kneejerk responses:- Although it&#39;s looking increasingly unlikely that we can avert climate disaster, we can never give up. For example, 8 degrees of warming would be much worse than 4 degrees of warming, and could mean the difference between human extinction and the mere collapse of our civilization. The lives of billions hang in the balance, and even if some will inevitably suffer and die, we can&#39;t just throw up our hands and let everyone die. Climate change mitigation, cutting emissions as quickly and thoroughly as we can, must remain a priority for the rest of our lives, even if we can no longer reach the best/safest scenarios. Every little bit of avoided global heating matters.- This post, as dire as its predictions are, may underestimate the difficulty of computing in 2050, given current trends. If you are/were living in Ukraine recently, programming is not most people&#39;s top priority, they have other problems. Famines, extreme weather events, and resource wars will affect programmers who live in comfortable locations today. It&#39;s not just your users/audience who might be computing from a shitty mobile phone in a refugee camp, it could be you. Don&#39;t forget that we&#39;re not only dealing with climate change, but with the reaction of other people to climate change: they might want to kill you for your water. And heatwaves are predictable in India/Pakistan, but look at the freak heatwaves in Canada recently, nowhere on Earth is safe, the climate crisis is a global problem.- Why are we programming what we&#39;re programming? Shouldn&#39;t our activities and their purposes change given the dramatic change in circumstances? Isn&#39;t there something wrong with the system that produced this result, the impending destruction of the biosphere that supports us? Fighting valiantly to preserve the functionality that is killing the world may not be a wise or ethical use of your time. (And if you&#39;re programming something for a fossil fuel company, now is a good time to reconsider.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Haha. Literally just finished a game with my family and was thinking &#34;you know I should laser cut and engrave/mill some metal pieces because these move too much&#34;.For this project I would&#39;ve had each board host an analog switch (neighbour selection) and use SPI and/or I2C rather than onewire. This would allow cheap flash memory (unique ID per tile + local storage/configuration) with SPI/I2C passthru. That way the host could determine topology easily and deduplicate redundant routes. A dumb read-only MCU could populate the local RGB from flash if required. With the spare cycles thus obtained you could even implement animation.So... who&#39;s got wood for my sheep? https://youtu.be/VBmRCclzCVU?t=33"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was a C student in high school. I never took a math class beyond basic algebra. I started from Khan Academy&#39;s first exercise when I was 33 years old. It seems silly looking back that I was solving problems on the number line as an adult.At that time, around 10 years ago, Khan Academy had excellent coverage through trigonometry and single variable calculus. Once I reached that point I went to my local community college and took all of their math classes. I transferred to University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and continued onward to get a BS CS, BS EE, and MS EE. I finished at 41 years old and landed a dream job that I would have never thought possible when I started.I guess my advice is to start from the beginning and see where it takes you."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m in my 40s and I started a machine learning degree in Nov 2020, so it&#39;s been about 1.5 years for me till now. I am a slow learner and my recommendations may reflect the same.1) Maths (precalculus and calculus) - I started with Khan Academy 10th grade onwards. I finished till grade 12 in a week. By this time I had gone through content elsewhere, so 1 week may (not) be enough. Regardless, Khan Academy app comes highly recommended.I did realise that there were a few gaps (more basic in nature), I covered those with Eddie Woo on YouTube (e.g. why is zero factorial 1). For others I just looked up relevant searches online.2) Maths (calculus) - MITs videos on YouTube. That is the pace of content I really love. Lots of overlap with Khan academy calculus, but do go through both. Also 3blue1brown &#34;essence of calculus&#34; playlist.3) Maths (Basic Linear Algebra) - although if someone were to say Gilbert Strang&#39;s MIT videos, they would be bang on perfect, I had to start slower. Bingewatch (with popcorn and beer) 3blue1browns &#34;Essence of linear algebra&#34; on YouTube. Then move ahead to the channel &#34;Math the beautiful&#34; which has a slower pace. You would also wish to visit their website www.lem.ma where they have exercises. Then of course come back and start Prof Strang&#39;s lectures (you&#39;re delving into heavier stuff midway through his course).4) Statistics - hands down professor Leonard on YouTube, he is the statistics equivalent of Eddie Woo. Slow, smart, funny and he has biceps too ;-) After this Prof Tsitsikilis (MIT) on YouTube.It goes without saying that you&#39;ll need to practice problems (ironical, coming from me). You can download question sets of your country from online.5) When you&#39;ve done the above, your search for &#34;linear algebra&#34; and &#34;calculus&#34; on HN will yield a lot of lovely results. Hidden gems will be there in comments too. Check those books, interactive books, websites, etc out. Your pace will be good by this time, but you will occassionally come across something which you have not come across before.If there&#39;s anything else, feel free to ask."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve done this and would echo the good advice you&#39;ve already gotten about Khan Academy but I think the comments in this thread are skipping over the most important part: pace. Work slowly. Don&#39;t move on until you really &#34;get&#34; the concept you&#39;re working with. Some topics might &#34;click&#34; right away and others might take weeks of bashing your head against the wall until your brain makes sense of it. That&#39;s okay. It can definitely be tedious at times (so be kind to yourself!) but a lot of learning happens when you&#39;re struggling to make sense of something so it&#39;s worthwhile to lean into the trouble you&#39;re having and figure out what it is that you&#39;re struggling to understand.The downside of formal education is that the teacher has a timeline that needs to be kept and the class will move on without you. It might not seem like a big deal in the moment but in math the foundation is so important because the concepts build on one another. Sometimes in really subtle ways. If you have the motivation (and it sounds like you do!) then the huge upside to self-paced learning is that you can build a really strong foundation and the more complicated advanced topics will be so much easier to master. Khan Academy is really good at breaking subjects down into tiny bites and then slowly building on what you&#39;ve learned but if you don&#39;t quite understand a lesson or if you haven&#39;t properly paid attention don&#39;t be afraid to do it again. If you guessed the right answer but don&#39;t understand why your answer was right, don&#39;t be afraid to go back and do it again.So just because one person here could do all of the Khan Academy 9th grade algebra in a week that doesn&#39;t mean you should set that timeline for yourself. Everyone is starting from a different place. So maybe it&#39;ll take you a day, or a week, or a month, or even months. But however long it takes is how long it takes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In my car-centric city (southeast USA, population ~125k) when I visit private property with no bicycle parking, I try to find the owner and offer to install one of these just for the cost of materials. The idea being, they can put in another one when they see more than one customer on a bicycle at the same time. It&#39;s very cheap, less than 100 bucks typically as I have the requisite tools in my garage to make them from scratch out of metal tubing. There&#39;s a variety of materials, finishing, and mounting options the property owner can choose from. I&#39;ve done about a dozen of them, it makes biking around my city much more pleasant and my day is brighter when I see someone else using one."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In general, the author is right, and the simple design is by far the best. But the classic Sheffield stand with a circular cross section can be easily cut with a pipe cutter. Contrary to an angle grinder, a pipe cutter doesn&#39;t make any noise.
Thus, the design has been improved by making it solid instead of hollow and giving it a rectangular cross section, like [1].
I used to hate the improved design because it&#39;s obviously less friendly to a nice bike&#39;s paint job until I learned the reasoning behind it.[1] https://www.thieme-stadtmobiliar.com/de/produkte/fahrradstae..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For most bike &#34;racks&#34; here in NL it seems like the primary purpose is not security, but just having somewhere to lean bikes against and give people a sensible place to park their bikes (as opposed to &#34;in a huge pile&#34;)Most people don&#39;t bother physically locking their regular city bikes to anything (only using a ring lock on the bike itself), primarily cheap beater bikes but also there&#39;s a guy in my street with a €2000 Van Moof e-bike that I think is just leaning against his front wall."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In the post, multiplications and 2 additions are not faster than 2 additions.The post compares (1) loop code that can be vectorized, as loop rounds are independent and do not depend on the result from the previous round, and (2) an &#34;optimization&#34; that makes calculations shorter, but also makes each loop round depend on the result of the previous round, so this cannot be vectorized."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Tldr: autovectorizer transforms the first code into SIMD instructions, but the second into 64 bit instructions.SIMD is very powerful, and modern compilers can sometimes simd-ify your code automatically.-------The second code can probably become SIMD as well, but it&#39;s beyond GCC&#39;s ability to autovectorizer it in that form. I kinda want to give it a go myself but don&#39;t have time today...Autovectorizers are mysterious, often harder to see and use than explicitly SIMD code (like OpenCL or CUDA)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think it&#39;s worth pointing out that the reason why these two examples execute at different speed is due to how compiler translated code AND because CPU was able to parallelize work. Compilers take knowledge about target platform (e.g. instruction set) and code and translate it into executable code. Compiler CAN (but doesn&#39;t have to) rewrite code only if it ALWAYS produces the same result as input code.I feel like last 110-15 years (majority of) people have stopped thinking about specific CPU and only think about ISA. That works for a lot of workloads but in recent years I have observed that there is more and more interest in how specific CPU can execute code as efficiently as possible.If you&#39;re interested in the kind of optimizations performed in the example you should check out polyhedral compilation (https://polyhedral.info/) and halide (https://halide-lang.org/). Both can be used to speed up certain workloads significantly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article seems right up my alley, so here are some thoughts:- ZFS is pretty amazing in it&#39;s abilities, with it ushering in the age of software RAID over hardware RAID- ZFS shouldn&#39;t be limited to FreeBSD. The Linux port has come quite a long way. I&#39;d advise you to use PPA over repo though, as many key features are missing from the version on repos.- TrueNAS is more targeted towards enterprise applications. If you want good utility as a home user then give Proxmox or the like a look. Then you can make it into more than just a NAS (if you&#39;re open to it).- If you want to make things even more simple then consider something like UnRAID.- ZFS&#39; snapshotting can really shine on a virtualization server application, with the ability to revert KVM VMs to a previous state in a matter of seconds. Lookup Jim Salter&#39;s (great dude) Sanoid project to see a prime example.- I don&#39;t recall why, but I&#39;ve heard that RAIDZ should be avoided, in favor of stripped mirrors."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Author here.I consider myself an intermediate homelabber and a TrueNAS beginner.

I hope it&#39;s helpful for anyone else thinking about building their first NAS server.Any questions or feedback about the post are more than welcome."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have worked at home my whole career. It was life changing when I discovered I could aim several LED shop lights at my ceilings (90,000 lumens total, in a vaulted living room) to create a summer day indoors, even on the dimmest cloudiest winter day.When I remodeled my new home, I put 3 dimmable LED light strips around each ceiling, hidden above molding, so every ceiling is effectively a diffuse but high lumen light.Then I use smart bulbs in accent lamps and other lighting, to add color for variety and mood."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Threads like these are always frustrating, because as usual people (programmers in this case) freely air their opinions on how schools are broken with phrases like “we need to fix the system”.As someone who studied pedagogy for years and quit due to an immense frustration with exactly this — how broken the system is — I would encourage you to entertain the thought that maybe, you as a person who is almost in all cases not a teacher, nor someone with any experience apart from once having been a student, do not have a good understanding of how exactly this system should be fixed, and that it’s not broken for fun but because there are some very difficult unresolved issues.People love to rant about how bad tests are. “We just study for the tests” and so on. And yet this complaint seems to be international. Curious, isn’t it, how all these systems seem to fail in the same way?In the case of testing it’s because you choose to focus on the obviously bad thing (current state of testing) rather than the very complex and difficult question behind it: HOW do you measure knowledge? And when you decide how, how do you scale it?These are very hard questions, and it’s frustrating to read the phrase “we need to fix the system” because yes, obviously we do, but agreeing that things are bad isn’t the hard part, and probably input from people who have never worked in the field is of pretty limited value in how to resolve the hard part, and will not do much more than annoy teachers even more.So what’s the solution then? Well, maybe we should start by rolling back this common conception that when it comes to schools, everyone’s opinion matters an equal amount, and then listen to the teachers and academics.Cynically, this will never happen because reforms to battle educational issues in any democratic society usually takes more than 5 election cycles to show obvious results (and when the bad results start stacking up current leaders will take the flak regardless)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This happened to me in undergrad with an autograded class. I remember soloing the class and thinking that the assignments were super hard. They would post grade averages for assignments and I was doing worse than usual.I remember a TA posting about cheating being an issue. They even released a graph of anonymized student repositories with edges indicating a detected instance of cheatingTurned out that a HUGE cohort of people were cheating (I think maybe over half the class).The scariest thing about cheating is that whenever a bunch of people do it (and aren&#39;t caught), it screws up the class curve so much that people who don&#39;t cheat will be forced to put in way more time studying, which will then take time away from other classes. It also screws up metrics that the professors and TAs use to understand how well they&#39;re teaching material, which assignments to drop, etcimo this is why people shouldn&#39;t cheat. If nobody cheats, the grades might on average be lower but once the class is curved or assignments are dropped it will be a fair indicator of where everyone is at. If people cheat, it screws up the fairness and can encourage others to start cheating. If everyone (or most) are cheating, you have people who aren&#39;t getting anything out of the class, getting credits as prerequisite that they shouldn&#39;t be getting, moving on to future classes and continuing the cycle"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ah cheating ! I did a year abroad in California when I was studying computer science and I remember there was a huge difference between cheating there and cheating in my French school.In the later, we were given harder exercises and asked to deliver a working program with some constraints. This program is then tested and graded by a CI and examined by TAs. Usually TAs would get a cheating report for reused bits of code and things that would solve an exercise with techniques far away from students knowledge or forbidden functions. TAs would ask you questions about your code and trigger cheating review if you could not explain why you wrote it this way. It was usually effective for detecting people that didn&#39;t wrote their own exercises. As the exercises were harder than expected for a class and projects were long and difficult, students were encouraged to talk, discuss and exchange ideas. Ideas sure, code meh.Then, in the US, exercises were stupid checkboxes-style questions and graded on a curve. So of course everyone &#34;cheated&#34;.. I must confess that I did it too. It was unworthy of my time and attention, as it was just about taking the course material and regurgitate it with different words. Of course, I can&#39;t imagine anyone learning anything from this way of working.Stupid assignments encourage students to cheat. Make them interesting and this problem will go away."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is the missing piece on cloud for masses  * we already have compute scale-to-zero (cloudrun, lambda, fly.io).

  * Network is default pay for use. Storage (S3) is default pay for use.

  * The only piece in the stack that was always-on was the database (only serverless db thus far was firestore, or something like sqlite+litestream)

With something like this we get a solid RDBMS engineered to be scale-to-zero, and with good developer experience.This opens up a world of try-out mini applications that cost cents to host. serverless db (postgres) + serverless compute (cloud-run) + use as you go storage+network. This is a paradigm-shift stack. Exciting days ahead."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Neon allows to instantly branch your Postgres database to support a modern development workflow. You can create a branch for your test environments for every code deployment in your CI/CD pipeline.&gt; Branches are virtually free and implemented using the &#34;copy on write&#34; technique.Unless I missed that everyone supports this, this here could be a killer feature and should be advertised higher."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Really interesting. I&#39;ve seen so much disagregated database work, and so so so much of that exposes postgres interfaces. But all the good stuff has been closed source!I&#39;m very very excited to hear about a team taking this effort to postgres itself, in an open source fashion! From the Architecture[1] section of the README:&gt; A Neon installation consists of compute nodes and Neon storage engine.&gt; Compute nodes are stateless PostgreSQL nodes, backed by Neon storage engine.&gt; *Neon storage engine consists of two major components: A) Pageserver. Scalable storage backend for compute nodes. B) WAL service. The service that receives WAL from compute node and ensures that it is stored durably.Sounds like a very reasonable disaggregation strategy. Really hope to hear about this wonderful effort for many more years. Ticks the boxes: open-source with a great service offering: nice. Rust: nice."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One unique Firefox feature I love that I don&#39;t see talked about often is how awesome Firefox&#39;s address bar suggestions are. I can type just a snippet of a URL or a web page title and it&#39;ll instantly show me all matching URLs I&#39;ve visited, whether on my desktop or on my phone. It&#39;s become my primary second brain for finding Google docs, or articles I&#39;ve read, or GitHub issues. It&#39;s usually only a few characters before it finds exactly what I want.Eg I type in &#34;Ed&#34;? It shows the URL to my &#34;editions in solr&#34; GitHub issues I&#39;ve been working on recently. I vaguely recall an article I read months ago on CSS grid? I type &#34;grid guide&#34; and bam it&#39;s the first suggestion. The spreadsheet I made about user languages? &#34;sheets lang&#34;. That vague API I can never remember the parameters to? Just type &#34;/query.json?&#34; And I get all my previous requests as examples!I find Chrome&#39;s address bar has been way less reliable and much more frequently just gives me Google autocomplete suggestions -- even when I know that I visited a URL recently that should match!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"FireFox Containers are a killer feature for me. It allows you to run sandboxed sessions. So you can ostensibly make every site a private tab by default but have a small few sites persistent.Eg I’ll have a work group with GitHub, Okta, etc in it so I only need to log in once a day. But random websites cannot track me between sites.Couple that with DNS blocking of trackers and ads, and the web is actually a lot more pleasant to use.Unfortunately you cannot fix everything locally though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I honestly want to ditch Firefox and try a Chromium browser for a minute [1], but I&#39;m stuck on Firefox because it&#39;s the only one with a killer feature: send a tab to/from iOS and my Linux desktop.I skip Chrome and Edge for privacy reasons, Brave have a crappy and buggy sync feature that I don&#39;t know what OSes it supports, but not my combination. Can&#39;t send tabs with them. Vivaldi doesn&#39;t have an iOS port. Impossible to do with Chromium.Firefox can send tabs to all my machines, and I use that feature multiple times daily, such as finding a cool article while I&#39;m sitting on the couch and sending it to my desktop so I can read it later. Mr. Eich, if you&#39;re around here, please please fix syncing tabs in your browser, it&#39;s the only thing stopping me from switching honestly.--1: I quite like Firefox, but it&#39;s in a dying spiral, and I&#39;m starting to see broken sites. The Web is such a complicated nightmare &#34;protesting&#34; won&#39;t change anything, and forking neither, because it&#39;s too bloody complex. Chromium has won. Our only hope is Mozilla takes their head out of their arse and start working on their browser instead of faffing about and making small, meaningless changes every release, but I don&#39;t see that happening any time soon."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The article misses a key bit of information TF needs when making a plan:   4. The previous Terraform configuration

This is effectively stored by state.We need this because if a resource is removed from the new config then Terraform needs to be able to delete the existing resource from the world. If we don’t have the state then Terraform must either:    1. Not delete it from the world

    2. Or risk deleting something not managed by Terraform

If everything were managed by Terraform then perhaps we would not need state, but this is not realistic in my view."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I respectfully disagree. If TF was stateless, you&#39;d have to manage situations by hand that involve changing the idempotency key, such as the name of a VM. You&#39;d also have to manage situations by hand where a resource is removed from the config.The whole point of TF is that it has state and doesn&#39;t require workarounds for these scenarios. Yes, you have to maintain state, but the state problems usually come from buggy providers, not Terraform itself. For example, try and use the GitHub provider to create a repo with GitHub Pages enabled from the gh-pages branch. It won&#39;t work because the authors didn&#39;t respect a fundamental rule of writing a provider: one state-changing API call = one resource. If you don&#39;t respect that, you have to do state handling yourself and you&#39;re almost certain to have state-related bugs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Having worked with both Terraform and Ansible code that created AWS resources - and operates very similarly to the model described here [0, see `filters` arg] - I generally disagree.For example, if you changed an ID in your stateless Terraform, you&#39;d have to insert some kind of code to destroy (or rename, if possible) the old resource. Or modify the Terraform DSL to include that kind of information, I suppose, and keep a historical record in the code perhaps. Then there&#39;s the question of what happens if someone modifies the physical resource out from under you -- could end up creating brand new resources rather than tracking the existing ones.Also, it&#39;s nice to know that your Terraform instance is what created a thing -- if you ran a stateless `terraform destroy`, it&#39;s possible you could be deleting resources that someone else created that happened to match what your Terraform code defined. More of an edge case, I admit, but at scale these things have a way of happening...That said, resources that don&#39;t have &#34;physical&#34; IDs work similarly to the stateless model by necessity. For example, VPC route table rules: [1, see the &#34;Import&#34; section].Refactoring Terraform code is super annoying because of state, though, I&#39;ll give you that.[0]: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/amazon/a...

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Well done and thank you. Not just for the work, but for the attitude
and courage of your convictions that come across clearly in your
comments here on HN.Search is presently a neighbourhood of technology that&#39;s fallen into a
downtrodden ghetto. Maybe you&#39;ve sowed some seeds that can grow
between the cracks. But I think there are gangs and pushers roaming
the streets that would be happy for it remain derelict.Thinking about the dynamics of open source, with respect to the many
different interpretations of search that create tension within such a
project: It occurs to me that whenever a somewhat mature project
enters the ecosystem a robust strategy is to immediately clone-fork
multiple identical copies of a project. This is like a &#34;backup
strategy&#34;. From there, form several loosely coordinated project groups
that can spread risk, share threat intelligence, but each work with
different models of crawling, filtering, funding, presentation and so
on. Keep the original as an upstream parent. One of the children may
survive."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I read a lot of comments here wanting to block the connections, but wouldn’t be easier/better to switch to an OS that doesn’t spy you? The answers possibly is no, because they might use X or Y that requires them to use Windows, so a better question is, what holds you back to switch to Linux? (macOS also talks to a lot of servers and collect telemetry as Windows, maybe in a different scale, so isn’t an alternative if you are worried about your data being collected).I personally prefer Linux, but what’s holding me are the streaming services (netflix, amazon, etc), I can only watch SD content if I’m on Linux, so my second opinion is macOS, I can watch at least in a decent resolution and also their notebooks are the best ones out there (the air is amazing between price, performance and battery life) for my use case, that’s also work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There seems to be some degree of overcounting in the reported figures: the number of “hosts” is the number of unique hostnames in the table, but the number of “IPs” is a straightforward sum of IP address counts that the table segregates by service, and I refuse to believe that (e.g.) the IP address of login.live.com as resolved by OneDrive is always different from same as resolved by Skype.  $ curl -fsSL &#39;https://helgeklein.com/blog/windows-os-services-apps-network-connection-target-hosts/&#39; | pup &#39;td:nth-child(5)&#39; text{} | sed &#39;s/:.*$//&#39; | sort -u | wc -l

  2764

There’s also a fair amount of infrastructural stuff such as DigiCert’s OCSP service, and every shard(?) in the Windows Update, OneDrive, etc. CDNs is counted as a separate hostname.Not that I’m happy about of any of these connections, but the report looks much less interesting than the totals alone suggest."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s time we start legislating based on empirical evidence instead of lofty ideals. Yes, if everyone was responsible perhaps it would be OK for all of us to own firearms. But so many people are utterly irresponsible, and guns make that irresponsibility lethal.People should safely store their fire-arms, but they don&#39;t and guns get stolen and sold illegally, or used by their teenage child.People shouldn&#39;t point a gun at someone unless their life is in danger and they&#39;re prepared to take a life, but they do and people get shot by accident, or road rage turns deadly.Not to mention the suicides. If you own a gun ideation can turn into action in less than 30 seconds and it can seem like a painless, easy way to go.And when everyone is armed everyone wants to be armed. Cops pull their guns quickly out of fear of armed criminals. Regular people want to own a gun because they feel like everyone else does, and they&#39;re now less safe unless they also get one.Growing up outside the US I never saw any guns. I don&#39;t know of anyone who had a gun. I don&#39;t know of anyone who knew anyone who had a gun. I remember seeing military members in parades carrying guns because it was one of the few times I&#39;d actually seen one. Cops didn&#39;t walk around armed. There are other ways to kill people but guns are an especially effective, intuitive, and easy way to do so."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a foreigner, I do not see it as productive to seek any explanation or expect any reaction when yet another news story like this comes along.It&#39;s clear that this is the way Americans wish to live, and it is their perogative to do so."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think a good first step everyone can agree on to stop gun violence is: stop it&#39;s gamification.Almost every mass shooting in the last decade was someone looking for media attention and  high score. And yet, every shooting is followed by detailed biography and a tally of bodies.Something as simple as a one month moratorium on information for anyone outside the community would probably work wonders, as the public eye will have moved on by then."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I took pandemic time to learn some knots, and then forget a bunch of them that didn&#39;t offer enough distinct utility to me.  I highly recommend the Farrimond Friction Hitch: https://www.animatedknots.com/farrimond-friction-hitch-knotIt&#39;s simple and fast to tie (with a little practice for muscle memory), and with an extra turn has exceptional friction preventing loop collapse in some situations where even a bowline would have an issue.  However, by relieving tension on one side of the knot, like a taut-line hitch it can slide.I use it for its common application of tensioning, but I also find it useful for cinching. It can go anywhere a cord lock might have been useful in but a few seconds."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like Knots3D, but there are some alternatives that made it easier for me:1. The Klutz Book of Knots (it&#39;s a book with holes around the pages so you can practice the knots next to their instructions). I think it&#39;s supposed to be a kid&#39;s book, but I bought for myself few years ago and was probably the resource I used the most.2. I find it _much_ easier to learn how to tie a knot by watching someone&#39;s hands while they explain what they&#39;re doing. KnottingKnots on Youtube is incredible at that:
https://www.youtube.com/c/KnottingKnots/I think the knots I use the most, both in everyday life as well as for hiking are (from most used to least used):  - Trucker Hitch
  - Bowline knot
  - Clove hitch
  - Figure of Eight knot (bend too but less often)
  - Sheet Bend
  - Prusik knot
  - Square knot
  - Taut line hitch"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My favorite knot is the Zeppelin Bend: [1]It&#39;s used to tie the ends of two ropes together.It&#39;s super easy to tie, super easy to untie (when you want to), and will not untie accidentally.[1] - https://www.animatedknots.com/zeppelin-bend-knot"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Great article and great collection of links!I have taken up coding simple SVG icons by hand, and it&#39;s easier than it looks. Also, a great feature of SVG is the &lt;defs&gt; element, which lets one define shapes anywhere in an HTML page, and reuse them anywhere else (ie, not inside the same SVG).So for example one can have an SVG element at the top of the page that lists a bunch of symbols in a global defs element, and reuse them at will some other places, without loading anything externally, or copy-pasting anything.Used shapes can also be transformed: different colors for fill or stroke, scaled up or down, rotated, moved, etc.&gt; Good news, you can achieve fractional ratings with only CSS and inline SVG. Samuel Kraft explains how it works.The technique presented in that other page is overly complex and convoluted.Fractional stars can be done very simply in pure SVG with gradients. Here&#39;s an example of a grey star filled at 40% with red:    &lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; viewbox=&#34;0 0 60 60&#34;&gt;
      &lt;defs&gt;
        &lt;polygon points=&#34;30,0 10,60 60,22 0,22 50,60&#34; id=&#34;star&#34;/&gt;
        &lt;/defs&gt;
      &lt;linearGradient id=&#34;gradid&#34;&gt;
        &lt;stop offset=&#34;40%&#34; stop-color=&#34;red&#34;/&gt;
        &lt;stop stop-color=&#34;grey&#34;/&gt;
        &lt;/linearGradient&gt;
      &lt;use href=&#34;#star&#34; fill=&#34;url(&#39;#gradid&#39;)&#34;/&gt;
      &lt;/svg&gt;

In order to change the fill one just needs to manipulate the offset attribute of the first stop.If there are many stars it can be tiresome to attach a different gradient to each star; what I do in that case is define 8 gradients from 10% to 90% fill, and reference them as needed for each object that needs to be filled to approx. that percentage."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"sounds like the same experience I have with pretty much every language I&#39;m not used to.I just want to try this C++, download, unzip, oh it&#39;s windows so .project file.

You don&#39;t but there are several magic spells you must execute and runes you must set in the rigtt places. Oh ... I think I got that setup but it getting this new error.....I&#39;m sypathetic it sucks but it&#39;s not unique to js"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My experience also. As a backend engineer trying to create a front end app, the whole toolchain of JS, bundlers, minifiers, Typescript, React... is basically; works if you have one magical init script that wires up everything, and much more than you really need since its tailored for more complex apps, but if you need just simplest thing, like run Typescript app in browser, well, good luck with that! Hundreds of tutorials (unofficial blog posts) on internents, none of them work.   
Front end dev work is broken.Also, funny experience: asked few senior FE devs how to configure React, webpack and TS manually, absolutely nobody could do it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"JS tooling has come a long way in the last couple of years, Vite for example is so much better than everything that came before. Esbuild is incredible and clearly the future of all JS build tools.The trouble is that to people who are only just outside JS ecosystem it’s not very accessible. If you are a PHP, Python or Ruby developer who cut your teeth in the era of jQuery or earlier (prototype.js &amp; script.aculo.us!) it can be quite difficult to make the transition.Combining the modern JS environments with platforms like Django, Laravel or Rails often means having to install and setup from scratch a full Node/NPM toolchain in parallel with your backend toolchain. I believe this is some of the reason for such a disconnect between the the “backend” and “frontend” unless you go 100% JS. I think it&#39;s pushed a lot of devs who used to think of themselves as &#34;full stack&#34; towards the backend.I’m trying to fix this with Tetra (https://www.tetraframework.com) for the Django ecosystem, the plan is to eventually bundle a esbuild/postcss/sass/less toolchain along with built in tools for installing JS dependancies so you can completely live within the Python/Django environment. It will manage all the complexities of JS tooling for you.The vast majority of developers don&#39;t want to think about tooling, they just want to build something quickly and get it out there."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was going to criticize &amp; point out how usb-c chargers at and over 100W are just so small, but there&#39;s a photo comparing it to an iphone &amp; ok, it looks adequately impressively dense! (I have a &gt;2 year old 100W charger that is 66x64x30mm, this 250W unit is 170x50x25)It&#39;s been such a great synergy. Energy efficiency has been a concern already yes, but I really view usb-c chargers as pushing the consumerization &amp; massification &amp; development of this technology to the superb, common, un-exotic levels it&#39;s come down to. We just got tired of doing less good, actively explored trying to use a somewhat harder to drive switching semiconductor, &amp; have reaped great rewards. Miniaturization mandated optimization &amp; we all win. I really think the interchangable-parts/modularity &amp; resulting competition that usb-c begot started this ball rolling.(Hoping USB-PD, with it&#39;s bump from 20 up to 48V, once again proves another huge win!)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"$145 is pretty steep, and I&#39;d like to see the Vpp (also called ripple) before considering this. I currently use picoPSU (ASIN B005TWE5E6), 50W and 80W versions to power 7th and 8th gen atoms and celerons. I use a &#34;UPS&#34; style 12VDC PSU connected to a fairly large sealed lead acid battery - about 4x the volume of a standard UPS battery. As far as my measurements go with the induced noise from the PSU for radio reception work, it seems to work pretty good. I&#39;ve looked at using SBCs instead, but you&#39;re never really going to get away from buck/boost on boards, since some things need 3.3 or less volts (memory, etc). The picoPSU also have survived for years up in elevator attics with all of the machinery and dust. never had an outage caused by the picoPSU or the attached 12V UPS stuff.I wonder if it is possible to run more than one board off the same PSU. I know you can run a board off multiple PSUs, but is the inverse true? If i ever get a new batch of these 25W TDP computers racked, having 2 of these connected to two UPS and 6 computers might be cool. It&#39;s just the ATX connector that needs population, i use NVME whenever possible, no GPU, no cards, just USB and ethernet onboard."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Context: I’ve been working with iOS full time since a few years before Swift came out.A few startups ago we built our app using SwiftUI 1.0. At that time, while 90% of it was fantastic, 10% was either unworkable or extremely unreliable, causing for some maddening bugs. The documentation was laughable so for these reasons I chose to do the app for a subsequent startup in UIKit.Fast forward to my most recent company; decided to give SwiftUI another shot (targeting iOS 14 &amp; SwiftUI 2). I am 100% glad we did. It’s been pretty incredible; we’ve built a reasonably complex banking app at a pace not possible with UIKit. The animations in particular are crazy good to work with; we’ve got some very complex animated flows that would have taken weeks and thousands of lines with UIKit… with SwiftUI it was about 5 days.It’s definitely not without its downsides; documentation is still slim at best, but there’s plenty of blogs and resources (https://swiftui-lab.com/ is the most helpful IMO) available now. There are also still some maddening bugs that appear in production and take a day or two of head scratching only to discover it’s a bug in the framework (most recently; using #available causes code to crash on the platform it’s protecting against lol), but there are always workarounds. Still, time wasted on these has been vastly outweighed by the weeks / months of time saved.Finally, you can always use UIKit as an escape hatch through UIViewRepresentable.iOS 15 is at 85% adoption, so we plan to drop support for 14 somewhat soon, which will give us an even more robust framework as well as async await APIs. Not feasible for most companies I know, but even supporting 14+ Will be pretty reasonable when iOS 16 drops in September."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You could write an opposite article featuring people using SwiftUI that have never touched UIKit or iOS code before and it would be nothing but glowing praise.That&#39;s kinda like my story. Covid started and I wanted to learn something new so I started with Swift/SwiftUI. 2 years later I&#39;ve been doing tons of crazy custom stuff in my portfolio tracker app https://stocketa.com (not launched yet) - I kept a thread with my progress since the first day I started my journey: https://twitter.com/Stammy/status/1527288954935922688 (scroll up).This was last june but I wrote about my experience with SwiftUI at the time: https://paulstamatiou.com/getting-started-with-swiftui/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m really looking forward to what comes of it, but I have chosen to do my current major project in UIKit.A couple of reasons:1) The documentation for SwiftUI, when I started (about two years ago) was awful. I was shocked at how bad it was. I believe that it has since improved.2) I knew of no major apps (even Apple ones) that had been done with it.I already knew that UIKit was up to the task, and held my nose, while I set things up. It&#39;s working out extremely well, but (of course) I&#39;d like to rewrite the whole thing (a sure sign that I&#39;m approaching ship).I like things like the MVVM pattern, but it&#39;s been my experience that it&#39;s really not such a good idea to implement it in UIKit, because UIKit was designed explicitly for MVC. I have learned that those ugly-ass UIViewControllers are really important, and I circumvent them at my peril.I&#39;m able to release fairly basic Apple apps in UIKit, in just hours, so speed of development isn&#39;t compelling.What is compelling, is the ability to design a reactive system for a complex app (like the one I&#39;m writing now). AppKit has allowed this for some time, and it&#39;s possible to force UIKit to do it (but it isn&#39;t really designed for that).I really wish that SwiftUI had been a bit more mature, when I started this system, but I would have also needed to rewrite the two server SDKs I use, anyway. It wouldn&#39;t have worked, no matter how hard I bang my heels together.But I&#39;m looking forward to it.One thing that I&#39;ve learned, is that it&#39;s really OK to wait for things to mature. Companies always screech about how we need to jump on the bandwagon, but that&#39;s all hype. I have taken OpenDoc courses at Apple DU. I also busted my ass, getting my app ready for Copland. I have scars from Apple hype.I did take a big chance, by jumping directly into Swift, but that has turned out to be a good decision."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One thing to note is that the 2021 population is an estimate, and if you are a Census buff as I am, and compare the Census&#39; 2019 estimates to the 2020 actual populations (as calculated from the census), there are often very large differences.The article also says that CA&#39;s estimate of the population decline is much smaller, and arguably CA itself would have more accurate data for this particular metric (residency and voter rolls).So while I&#39;m sure the gist of the argument is true, there is probably a larger margin of error on the calculation than you&#39;d think at first glance. I&#39;m not quite going to say the article is sensationalist, but if you look at the totality of the data (house prices, rental prices, CA&#39;s population estimates, etc), I&#39;m not sure the &#34;SF is in freefall&#34; narrative holds up."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you compare rent trends of SF vs NYC or LAhttps://www.zumper.com/rent-research/san-francisco-cahttps://www.zumper.com/rent-research/new-york-nyhttps://www.zumper.com/rent-research/los-angeles-caYou&#39;ll notice a huge difference between in SF and the other cities. Rent prices still hasn&#39;t gone back to pre pandemic level."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think remote work is often understated in reasons people move away. When you go into the office every day, it&#39;s pretty obvious that you have to live in whatever city you live in. But with remote work, the question becomes &#34;if I don&#39;t have to live here, do I want to keep living here&#34;. For many (including myself), the answer was a definitive NO.Sure many headlines and news segments make it seem that it&#39;s the crime, the high rent, and all these super visible indicators and while I&#39;m sure that factored into the decisions of some, for many it was that they just wanted a change and got the golden opportunity to do so.EDIT: It&#39;s not even that one may even &#34;want a change&#34;, it&#39;s when you&#39;re presented with the opportunity to make a change, the gears in your head start turning as to what options you have at your disposal. I would imagine many people that moved had previously no intention to but just got the opportunity and decided to take it while it lasted."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the consequences of the effectiveness of click-bait titles on youtube is that searching for videos you watched historically is extremely difficult, because quite often the primary thing in the video is never mentioned in the title. The descriptions are almost universally used to store common links that are about the channel not the video and the consequence of this is that click-bait titled content is very hard to find after the fact. The other problem is quite a lot of channels are testing one title and then changing to another, the video wont then be found using the initial title and so even if you do remember elements of the title the channel may have made that impossible to use some hours or days later as another title with better performance was used.I can see a need for search in the contents of the videos but I don&#39;t want to specify the channel, I likely don&#39;t know especially since channels can also change their name."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hey HN! I just launched VideoMentions Search, a free tool that allows you to search YouTube to find videos that contain specific spoken words.Here&#39;s how to quickly try it out -Let&#39;s say you want to find every video on The Verge&#39;s YouTube channel within the last several months in which &#34;MacBook Pro&#34; is mentioned. Here&#39;s a pre-populated search to accomplish that:https://videomentions.com/search?channelUrl=https%253A%252F%...If you follow that ^ link, then click the button to perform the search, you&#39;ll see all matching videos, with every single mention of &#34;MacBook Pro&#34; highlighted.My favorite part is that all the highlighted matches are timestamped. So you can click on any of them to jump to that exact moment in the video when that keyword was said!VideoMentions Search is great for these scenarios:- You want to find all videos within a YouTube channel that mention your brand, your product, or the topics you care about.- You remember watching a video where a certain topic was discussed, and now you&#39;re trying to remember which video it was to rewatch it.- You run your own YouTube channel and want to quickly find the exact moments in your videos where you cover certain topics, so you can link others to that content.I have wanted a way to search YouTube based on spoken words for a while. I couldn&#39;t find a tool that provides that capability though, so I built it!I hope you find VideoMentions Search useful! I&#39;d love to hear any feedback you have on it. Please let me know!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very interesting tool could see myself using it a lot.Couldn&#39;t help but search the guy that uploaded 2 million vids to yt, sorry if it breaks anything.It would be cool to search for a specific quote like &#34;buddy of mine&#34; (frequently said by Joe Rogan). Also searching for parts of a word (similar to regex options?) might be difficult to implement but would be super useful as an option i.e if i searched for any word that starts with yc with a correct pattern (or given option on the UI) i could find results for both &#34;yc&#34; and &#34;ycombinator&#34;."</p>

So even if you pop the workstation and have root, you still can&#39;t beacon out directly without going through the gateway - you&#39;d have to find an exploit in that bit as well, with only network access.  Not impossible, but a lot harder.And then package all that into Qubes and use it that way, because a disposable Whonix VM set is probably the safest way to browse the web...And still disable Javascript."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"That&#39;s a very interesting set of findings. What is important to realize when reading this that it is a case of survivorship bias. The startups that were audited were obviously still alive, and any that suffered from such flaws that they were fatal had most likely already left the pool.In 15 years of doing technical due diligence (200+ jobs) I have yet to come across a company where the tech was what eventually killed them. But business case problems, for instance being unaware of the true cost of fielding a product and losing money on every transaction are extremely common. Improper cost allocation, product market mismatch, wishful thinking, founder conflicts, founder-investor conflicts, relying on non-existent technology while faking it for the time being and so on have all killed quite a few companies.Tech can be fixed, and if everything else is working fine there will be budget to do so. These other issues usually can&#39;t be fixed, no matter what the budget."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Simple Outperformed Smart. As a self-admitted elitist, it pains me to say this, but it’s true: the startups we audited that are now doing the best usually had an almost brazenly ‘Keep It Simple’ approach to engineering.I wrote about this before that as an industry, we have made writing software complex for complexity&#39;s sake.&gt; imagine, in a world where there wasn&#39;t a concept of clean code but to write code as simply as possible. not having thousands of classes with indirection.what if your code logic was simple functions and a bunch of if statements. not clever right, but it would work.what if your hiring process was not optimizing for algorithm efficiency but that something simply works reliably.imagine a world where the tooling used by software engineers wasn&#39;t fragile but simple to use and learn. oh the world would be a wonderful place, but the thing is most people don&#39;t know how to craft software. but here we&#39;re building software on a house of cards [0]:[0] - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30166677"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve seen most of the architectural problems in consulting - it&#39;s amazing how a team of clever engineers can take a simple thing and make it sooo convoluted.Microservices, craptons of cloud-only dependencies, no way to easily create environments, ORMs and tooling that wraps databases creating crazy schemas... The list goes on and on; if you&#39;re early, you could do a lot worse than create a sensible monolith in a monorepo that uses just postgres, redis, and nginx and deploys using &#39;git pull&#39; ..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"898 KB even without compression. Pretty good for what it is. Properly compressed, it’d be well under half that on the wire.(The server seems to be serving with only extremely mild compression, and none on the biggest part, the WASM. Feeding it all through `gzip -9` cuts it to 408 KB, of which 374 KB is the WASM. `brotli` cuts it to 352 KB, of which 323 KB is the WASM. The HTML, CSS and JavaScript are also largely unminified, and even a simple conservative pass roughly halves their gzipped size. No idea of the state of the WASM, I’m not going prodding inside it just now. I know that I’m never impressed with the JavaScript side of the bindings produced by Empscripten, Rust’s wasm-bindgen and any other such tools I’ve seen—with a little manual effort, I’ve very easily reduced 50 KB files—minified!—to under 5 KB. Optimising such things and immediately discarding the results is a strange hobby of mine.)For comparison, the similar parts of https://sql.js.org/examples/GUI/index.html are a bit under 1.2 MB uncompressed (most notably excluding CodeMirror), around 450 KB on the wire."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Richard Hipp, of sqlite fame, just announced the project&#39;s new WASM-based &#34;fiddle&#34; app in the sqlite forum (https://sqlite.org/forum/forumpost/5cfd681451), providing a way for users to run a slightly-hacked build of the sqlite3 shell app in their browsers (with no server-side backend).(Edit: this was my first-ever HN post and i _thought_ that this comment was going to &#34;stick&#34; up top with the link to serve as an introduction/explanation. Didn&#39;t realize that it would be &#34;just another comment.&#34;)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you find this useful, you may also benefit from the fact that Python compiled to WASM (by Pyodide) also includes a working build of SQLite in the sqlite3 standard library module.You can try that out in a REPL here: https://pyodide.org/en/stable/console.html    import sqlite3
    db = sqlite3.connect(&#34;:memory:&#34;)
    db.execute(&#34;select 4 * 5&#34;).fetchall()

Or in a full client-side WASM Jupyter notebook interface using https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/try/labI also used Pyodide to get my Datasette SQLite Python web application running entirely in the browser at https://lite.datasette.io - more details on how that works here: https://simonwillison.net/2022/May/4/datasette-lite/"</p>

Super-resolution on H264 is probably the way to go.- It&#39;s hard to turn this into a business (corporates that pay for Zoom don&#39;t seem to care much).PS Also a big fan of super-tiny AI models (binarized NNs, frequency-domain NNs, etc) for edge applications.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Awesome!A thought: now that neural compression is becoming widespread, it could be a good idea to put some kind of indicator or watermark stating the compression is neural (learned/function approximation in general). I think this would avoid liabilities and criticism around the fact that some weird things may appear (incorrect detail generation), maybe giving a wrong semantic idea. It may also be a good idea to put a mean squared error term in your objective function to help preserve general meaning."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wow Will was such a part of my childhood watching Star Trek. Obviously, he didn&#39;t appear often but he was memorable simply because there were so few people as young as him on the show.Sad to hear this all around. This also brought back memories of me being required to play piano growing up. I hated piano, performing (recitals), playing in general. I was terrrribbleee (still am) and was put up in lessons for 12 years. I fought tooth and nail as I got older and eventually was so bad my parents stopped at 16.Music is a very &#34;asian&#34; or &#34;chinese&#34; thing to put your child through. As well as being good academically. This part of my life was a sore spot, but not even close Will&#39;s situation.As I have young children of my own today, I&#39;m faced with these questions. What is a healthy amount of pushing vs too much? I don&#39;t need my kid to be the best at anything - I just don&#39;t want them to be lost/dead-in-the-water or unable to fend for themselves."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Now think how many children suffered the same fate, but we’ll never hear about it because they did not become famous.Reminds me of “dance moms” or “cheer moms”, “football dads”, etc.If you’re a parent, remember not to live your unfulfilled dreams through your children."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of my friend&#39;s daughters really, really enjoyed dancing, singing, acting, auditioning for commercials.  Her aunt had won Survivor, or American Race, or Big Brother, or whatever (they&#39;re all the same to me, I can&#39;t remember which it was) and she wanted to be just like her!   Until the day at seven years old that she had to go to an audition, she sat herself down in the middle of the driveway and said, &#34;No, no, no, no, I hate this, I hate this, please never, please,&#34; and wouldn&#39;t budge.  My friend was forced to realize finally it had been all her, and not her daughter.  Thankfully, she did get the message, was self-reflective enough to listen.What a strong little girl, I thought.  I remember years of &#34;loving&#34; horseback riding lessons and shows as a kid because I wasn&#39;t strong enough to tell my mother I hated every minute of it.  As a father myself now, I try very hard to listen and support what my kid is interested in, and not manufacture what I want him to be, and wonder if I still screw it up."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi HN, I built this.  It&#39;s been posted several times before, so I can answer some common questions:How does this work?
I adapted GPlates [1], an academic project that creates desktop software for geologists to investigate plate tectonic data.Is the geocoding accurate?
Even though plate tectonic models return precise results, you should consider the plots approximate within ~100km. In my tests I found that model results can vary significantly. I chose this model because it is widely cited and covers the greatest length of time.How should I interpret the maps/colors?
The graphics that wrap the globe are provided by Dr. Christopher Scotese, a geologist who runs the PALEOMAP project.  You can learn more about the project and the creation of the rasters here [2].  You might also notice some old national borders.  I just work with what I can get!Why can&#39;t it look up my location?
Your location probably didn&#39;t exist at the time, geologically speaking.  Try switching to closer to present day (e.g. 66 Mya)Where are all the dinosaurs?
Despite the title of this post, the visualization isn&#39;t really meant to show an exhaustive list of dinosaurs or fossils (the list doesn&#39;t even show on mobile).  If you want to dig into data on fossils near you, check out the Paleobiology Database Navigator [3].[1] https://www.gplates.org[2] https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-q0WIa7ofISFHyBe4UxvN8DIPs8...[3] https://paleobiodb.org/navigator/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the neat bits from this is going to 340 Mya and look at where the Appalachian mountain range runs.You can hike part of the Appalachian trail in Spain https://www.geologiadesegovia.info/the-international-appalac... and Ireland https://iatulsterireland.comhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Appalachian_Trai..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Dang, wish this title was updated to be less misleading. I spent way too long looking for functionality that didn&#39;t exist. The author (not same person as poster) posted in the comments:&gt; Where are all the dinosaurs? Despite the title of this post, the visualization isn&#39;t really meant to show an exhaustive list of dinosaurs or fossils (the list doesn&#39;t even show on mobile).That said, this is a really cool visualization of how the water fill and plates evolved over time. Love it!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Rumors going around on blind (posted by bolt employees) that over the course of a few rounds of layoffs it will be 30-50% of the total workforce. A lot of the initial layoff are software engineers. Apparently they only have 12-18 months of runway, and need to effectively double that. Current revenue is 40M.I guess this is the beginning of the tech washout. clings to large tech company jobEDIT: 33% layoff today"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The founder also encouraged employees to take on what was effectively personal debt at an ~11B valuation when they only did $5.2M in Q1…"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Bolt Financial, the finops company, not Bolt the car sharing service which seems to be doing fine:&gt; In January 2022, Bolt raised €628 million from investors led by Sequoia Capital and Fidelity Management and Research Co, taking the company&#39;s valuation to €7.4 billion"</p>

He&#39;s a beast!As a thank you to him -- he also does for work for commission/etc, check hus GitHub page for more info. I&#39;m not fiscally or currently otherwise directly linked to him too closely, I&#39;ve just hung around a while and think he deserves far more credit than he gets. This is literally the smallest piece of the pie of what the man does across several subdisciplines, send him a thank-you please, if possible!"</p>

So there must be some commercial reasoning behind it?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think the more interesting thing here is the fact that so much code in their repository appears to be bit-rotted or half baked, despite being documented. KASLR is mentioned all over the place but doesn&#39;t work and the answer is &#34;we know, it&#39;s there only to stop it bit-rotting&#34;. You need to patch the system to do kernel debugging because otherwise the toolchain hangs. Syscalls are documented as enforcing security rules yet the actual checks are //TODO comments (and they are still willing to assign CVEs so apparently they just forgot?!). The syzcaller tool is advertised as working with Fuschia, yet despite trying multiple different versions he can&#39;t even compile them due to API churn. Apparently downloading and executed a binary isn&#39;t even an option, despite their vision being that Fuschia is a sea of components downloaded and run from the internet.It&#39;s hard not to feel like maybe Google has lost the ability to develop operating systems. Fuschia has been in development for years now, it has no users outside of Google yet if you flick through their docs you&#39;ll notice a whole bunch of pages talking about deprecated components, migrations, etc. When I last looked at their docs, they read like it&#39;s been around for 20 years and has millions of apps, even though that&#39;s not true. Oh yeah and of course the giant BLM banners everywhere they have/used to have. Just checked, now those banners are replaced with &#34;Honoring Asian Pacific American Heritage Month&#34;, lol. Apparently their vision of a futuristic OS is one in which every page in the docs has some random totally US centric bit of virtue signalling in it. No wonder they somehow can&#39;t even finish a microkernel, a design that reduces performance in return for a much smaller syscall surface area."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My takeaway from the article is that Fuchsia exposes a capability-based interface externally, but uses the old kind of privilege-checking inside the kernel. Once a single sloppy check was found, the game was over: a privilege escalation and planting of arbitrary code into the kernel followed.Did I miss anything?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Something that I haven&#39;t seen brought up yet is the &#34;weird C++ vtable layout.&#34; This is actually the &#34;relative vtable layout&#34; that&#39;s first described here: https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=26723, and is usable in clang via the -fexperimental-relative-c++-abi-vtables option.The basic idea is that you don&#39;t need to waste a whole 64 bits for vtable entry, especially since you can usually assume that code within the same DSO will be within 32 bits of each other. So, instead, you do a 32-bit offset from a known address (the vtable&#39;s address) to get the function pointer, and in the rare case you need a cross-DSO entry, just emit a thunk for the symbol that&#39;s in the same DSO to get an address within 32 bits."</p>
