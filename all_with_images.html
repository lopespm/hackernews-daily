								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Text is mightier than the Metaverse.Kids can do video calls with their smartphones but prefer texting.We could discuss Hacker News stories with video chat but we prefer text.News and politics junkies prefer reading text tweets on Twitter to watching talking news anchors.Once upon a time Amazon was a company that only sold books. Dried ink on dead trees. And in the early internet age this book seller outperformed many more &#34;forward looking visionary&#34; startups.Billions and billions spent on making movies as polished as possible, yet &#34;I thought the book was better&#34; is what we always hear.The Metaverse will be programmed with text.The quarterly reports outlining its financial losses will be written in text.When journalists ultimately write its obituary, they will write text."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Metaverse is not bullshit. It&#39;s a sign of desperation.Facebook has _nothing_ for the future.* Blue app is already on it&#39;s death bed.* Instagram is already seeing a massive decline in quality and engagement as its getting close to the end of its lifecycle.* They managed to survive Snapchat, but I think that made them think Instagram is too big to fail. Thus, they didn&#39;t go after TikTok. It was a mistake.* What&#39;s App is not monetizable.* Oculus is not becoming the next PS4/Xbox like they hoped.Facebook is usually being compared to the likes of Apple, Google and Amazon. It&#39;s nothing compared to them. It&#39;s not even gonna be able to do a Microsoft/IBM pivot as it has no monetizable developer ecosystem.I personally think they should&#39;ve acquired TikTok last year when TikTok was looking to be acquired by Microsoft. They probably would&#39;ve extended their survival for another 10-ish years (lifecycle of a social media)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This thread feels like 1860&#39;s consilium on what future will look like 500 years later. The shape of the metaverse will be formed by a new generation, not by older guys (and not by fortnite addicts who play by the rules of the former) who know nothing better than drive a fancy “car” on the “road”, as if roads or a concept of physical movement or the euclidean rule would still be there for common use and not for museums. Virtual worlds up to date, like second life, were mostly just stupid copies of “real life”, which was designed after some physical limitations, or fantasy worlds of parallel earth-likes with a limited magic.If the only limitation of metaverse is Code and Content, and if that would be much easier to create, then in a blink of an eye it will turn into something absolutely inconceivable to mercedes benz drivers. What really is bullshit, is lack of imagination in people and a shitload of thought inertia. Personally, it feels like the article author has never ever been in the internet, confining themselves at a small circle of “social” networks bs. Those will live in an exact copy of their current environment, paying to bigcorps with their work hours to achieve “expensive” toys, to impress similar narrow-minded guys. I’ve seen second life at its peak, and this is exactly what they were doing there."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As an 80&#39;s kid I have fond memories of this toy. Being all mechanical you could explore and marvel at it.I remember trying to get the spin faster/slower, stopping the spring, etc.Since it required no batteries it was always working, even when you found it at the bottom of toy bin after months/years.This modern version is a complete scam, especially since the outside look seems absolutely identical to the original. I&#39;d be very disappointed if I bought one for a toddler, only to realize when unboxing it&#39;s crap.By the way, we still have the original toy from my childhood. It&#39;s been passed around to relatives, but last I heard, it still works after what must be almost 40 years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The original Fisher-Price &#34;Record Player&#34; is really a kids version of a Polyphon [0] a type of record like music player that was popular in the late 1800&#39;s to early 1900&#39;s.  You can see some playing on YouTube [1]I thought it would be interesting to 3D print additional records for the thing. Was super disappointed when I bought one for our daughter last year and found that they had changed it to a digital music player that only uses the records for song selection.A lot of the modern day versions of the original Fisher-Price toys don&#39;t hold up to the originals.  For example on the xylophone they replaced the Wood base with plastic and the thing sounds like crap.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphon[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk4zjQshq14[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soQLAvqnTOQ"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not sure how common this is in other countries, but here in Germany we have quite a few &#34;water playgrounds&#34;. There are some pumps in the sand, sometimes small aqueducts and the likes, so during summer, the kids can play with water. The pumps used to be real pumps. Now they are electronic. They have a sensor to detect how fast the handle is moving and at a certain speed you&#39;ll hear a clicking sound, a valve opens and the water starts flowing.I think some children will realize how these things work. They might start to find them dumb if they find out that the strenuous repetitive movement is in fact unnecessary. At least to me it feels like a dishonest contraption and I&#39;d prefer if they simply put a button on it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When you make housing an investment, by definition, it has to become less affordable in the future.Until a country decides to stop making policy to support this notion that a basic need should be an appreciating asset and not a depreciating one like food, transportation, etc, this completely unsurprising trend will continue. It is a strange world we live in where we collectively believe that a basic need should increase in price over time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unfortunately the article is extremely sloppy with the numbers and that makes it very hard to understand what is really going on.Primarily, they keep mentioning &#34;average house-price-to-income ratio&#34; but appear to be using average home price and median income.  Both housing price and income distributions are enormously skewed.  In the Unites States average income is almost double median income and that difference has been increasing over time.  So right there, even if median house price to median income has stayed constant, you would notice the pattern pointed out.I don&#39;t doubt the central premise that housing prices are rising faster than income within household, but unfortunately the article does nothing to show it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m always a bit amused at this sort of article.At it&#39;s heart it is an attempt by someone who makes their living selling a thing (real estate) to instill a since of FOMO in order to motivate you to buy something now rather than perhaps later. You can&#39;t really fault them, it does tend to work.I happen to live in the &#34;red hot&#34; Bay Area and twice wince I&#39;ve been living in my house its value has gone DOWN year over year rather than up. I have never considered it an &#34;investment&#34;, rather it is a fixed cost that I have to pay to live indoors. My parents live in Las Vegas, and that housing market, which has been largely unconstrained, demonstrated exactly what that means. Houses in Vegas for a long time depreciated after you bought them, just like cars. They did that because there was so much new housing being built that you could buy a &#34;new&#34; house for the same price as a &#34;used&#34; house. Guess what, people opted for &#34;new&#34; and used houses needed to sell at a discount if they wanted to sell.One of the truisms for years was the value of a house was intimately tied to its location. This because it was close to jobs, or schools or what not. It is my hope that remote work really takes hold and you can work just as reasonably in a $100,000 house in Missouri as you can in a million dollar house in the Bay Area. That would really create some downward pressure on prices because of simple market dynamics."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Tangentially, the physical labor jobs I had when younger never really tired me out the way that the mental/bureaucratic/political job I have now does.Physical work actually energized me, I mean this is all confirmed today as well, we know all the benefits exercise brings on well being.There&#39;s something about desk jobs that is frankly soul sucking and literally mentally draining in a way where when the day ends, it&#39;s as if you suffer from temporary depression. Even getting motivated to do things you want to do is hard, resorting to the laziest activity is often what happens, phone, social media, television. Sometimes I can&#39;t even get myself to play a video game and I love video games.And when the night comes, you&#39;d think sleep is what you need, but that same day of desk job actually gives you insomnia, falling asleep is hard, and while you sleep it&#39;s as if all of that mental activity is still happening in your head from the work day.If physical labor work paid me as well and provided the same benefits, I&#39;d probably switch back to it honestly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This feels off.Farming today is a seven day, every day work week.  There is no day off with livestock, no matter what century, and what season.  If the sun sets, or the weather is bad outside, there are plenty of work to be done indoors.I would presume it was even harder without all the automation and technology in the Middle Ages.  Maybe they did not labour for the employer all the time, but all the &#39;free time&#39; was spent labouring for sustenance, and other life&#39;s maintenance.If I recall correctly, the 8 hour day, 40 hour week, and five day work-week are all 19th century trends."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This analysis is solely focused on the &#34;job&#34; aspects of pre-industrial life and includes almost none of the domestic considerations. I&#39;m not sure if it would be fair to call all non-wage time &#34;leisure&#34;. Once work was still over there were still things to clean, fix, prepare, butcher, etc.Although, I think it goes without saying that before affordable lighting and heating, we all underestimate how lazy winters were for the average peasant, whether idyllic or not (accounts I have read make it sound incredibly, incessantly dull).And I think the best evidence we have that we are overrating the quality of pre-industrial leisure time is that people developed almost no leisure activities! Common people had almost no sports, no games (beyond precursors to Bocce or backgammon), no literature! They supposedly had half a year of doing nothing, and perhaps singing and drinking was sufficient to fill the time, but you&#39;d think they would show lots of other innovations. Or even steal the activities of the rich (organized sports)!Instead you don&#39;t see leisure activities develop until the rise of the 40 hour workweek and the availability of consumer appliances.Edit: I hope people understand that the argument the article presents is largely a romanticization of poverty."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I already force-enabled EGL in firefox 93 on Arch Linux with the 470.74 nvidia driver, and the performance is stellar compared with what it used to be. Before EGL all desktop applications (including firefox) would stutter when a video was playing in firefox.I did not encounter any bugs so far."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Will you be affected? Here&#39;s the gist from the article: As of Firefox 94, users using Mesa driver &gt;= 21 will get it by default. Users of the proprietary Nvidia driver will need to wait a little bit longer as the currently released drivers lack an important extension. However, most likely we’ll be able to enable EGL on the 470 series onwards. DMABUF support (and thus better WebGL performance) requires GBM support and will be limited to the 495 series onwards.Ubuntu 21.10 currently comes with the 470 series driver."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The &#34;dark star&#34; hypothesis given a finite speed and momentum of light (particle nature) combining with the escape velocity of stars isn&#39;t impressive by itself.But his scientific reasoning and methods very much so.
He carefully conjectured what could be observed e.g. binary stars in amassing data points. Naturally, in a logical progression, he looked for stars which behaved as if they were in a binary systems but the partner i.e. &#34;dark stars&#34; could not been seen because its mass would be so big that  the finite speed of light couldn&#39;t &#34;escape&#34;. Brilliant.He, also, inherited Cavendish his &#34;torsion balance&#34; apparatus for measuring the mass of the earth for what later became the famous &#34;Cavendish experiment&#34; yielding an accurate measurement of the gravitational constant. The experimental basis for the advancement into the nature of gravity.Quite impressive.And he did not yell about it or seemed to care about what nowadays would be called the &#34;impact factor&#34;.His impact was quite of another nature."</p>

My pretty modest home network and the various services running make 20-25k queries per day and I get a lot of REFUSED responses. Google on the other hand has no problem serving all of them.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"You don&#39;t start by choosing an architecture. You start by understanding the problem and the pieces in the solution space. You then figure out how those pieces can work together to solve the problem. After that you can see the system as nested subsystems and interactions, which you can draw as diagrams and call it an architecture.So I see &#34;architecture&#34; more as a teaching and communication technique, applied after the fact. Altho since we&#39;re always moving between the details and the big picture, having organized abstractions (ie an architecture) in mind will help keep the design clean.The architecture evolves and sharpens as a system comes together. And this evolving architecture provides the team with a common terminology and overall direction.But you rarely start by choosing a specific architecture. Unless you already know a lot about your solution."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’m kinda confused by the criticism of the industry and NASA not designing for Starship.The author argues that NASA doesn’t understand Tempe game changer that Starship is, but I don’t think that’s accurate. I think the risk to NASA of assuming the benefits of Starship before it’s proven are just too high.If NASA (or other industry players), assume Starship will deliver the benefits it promises, they to fundamentally alter their approach to space. But that leaves them with no backup plan in the event that Starship fails to materialize or deliver on its promises.Whereas this other approach, of treating Starship like a much better vehicle but integrating it into its old processes, gives them an out if Starship fails in some way. Because they’re still using the “old” assumptions, they can fall back to other “old space” style providers.I think once Starship has proven itself capable of deliver on its promises, you’ll see NASA changing its approach radically in the manner the author describes.So, fundamentally, I think it’s not a lack of “understanding”, but a different calibration of “risk”. This also applies to many existing space companies, and I also think this gives opportunities for new companies that have a higher risk tolerance to take advantage."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Spacex is building the transcontinental railroads of the solar system. There is mind boggling upside for them. I&#39;m kinda disappointed Blue Origin seems to have fallen in a rut. I&#39;m sure Musk will be happy to provide transportation for Bezos space colony construction projects!https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railroad_TycoonEdit My point isn&#39;t to disparage Bezos, but to highlight the fact that anyone with grand aspirations in orbit/solar system will have to go through Musk and Spacex until a competitor does appear. RE space colonies, I believe the natural sequence of events for space tourism is: sub orbital, oribital, long term orbital (a small space &#34;hotel&#34;) culminating in orbital habitat ala O&#39;Neil Cylinders. Cheap kg to orbit enables all of that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Starship is intended to be able to transport a million tonnes of cargo to the surface of Mars in just ten launch windows.So at 100tons per starship sent to Mars that&#39;s 10,000 trips or 1000 per launch window. But the current plans call for something like 16 starship launches just for refuelling the one starship for the lunar mission. Suppose we can do the Mars trip with the same number of flights that&#39;s 170,000 launches  to transport that 100million tons?
And this guy is mad that nasa is not assuming that this is achievable?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting collision of the idea with the covid era. During an outbreak you’d want students to have a private airspace to go to and the possibility of ventilation.Update: from another comment, Munger designed a similar building in Michigan. It has great reviews!But, one of the top ones was “great until pandemic”. Adding this to clarify that, contra other comments, I don’t necessarily think Munger was mistaken. But events have made the idea unfortunate.https://www.veryapt.com/ApartmentReview-a7222-munger-graduat..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"People are discussing this design as if it is an actual design worthy of discussion. What it is is the product of a bum amateur &#34;architect&#34; wanting to feed his narcissism and legacy who just happens to be a billionaire. That and universities that have become slaves to money and fundraising. Charles Munger is apparently one of Buffet&#39;s cronies at Berkshire Hathaway.It&#39;s telling that the committee was basically not involved at all and the complaints and resignation of one of the senior architects on said committee was basically dismissed without a second thought. Why even have the committee at all?This building is an abomination about everything that is known about architecture and living spaces and flies in the face of increasing rates of student mental health issues and disorders. It&#39;s nauseating that the answer to &#34;you&#39;re not happy inside?&#34; is just &#34;go outside&#34;.Here&#39;s an except from another article I found:&gt; &#34;Everybody loves light and everybody prefers natural light. But it’s a game of tradeoffs,” Munger said in an interview. “If you build a big square building, everything is conveniently near to everybody in the building. If you maximize the light, you get fewer people in the building.”Munger is off his rocker and seems to follow a principle of maximal packing in his &#34;designs&#34;."</p>

&#34;...the corrosion on the glass also forms millions of tiny pits. The authors think those pits could serve as tiny reaction chambers...&#34;In other words, the experimental conditions, as intended, were almost &#34;too perfect.&#34;  The simulation of reality requires some amount of unspecified noise with respect to CONDITIONS, in this case, corroded glass.How many experiments, on the terminal or the bench, are run with noise in the underlying test conditions?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Taken from the Ars comments:Article Quote:
When Miller showed his results to Urey, the latter suggested a paper should be published as soon as possible. (Urey was senior but generously declined to be listed as co-author, lest this lead to Miller getting little to no credit for the work.)As if Urey doesn&#39;t deserve enough respect, the story is better than described:Sub-article Quote:
After Miller showed the impressive results to Urey, they decided to submit them to Science. Urey
declined Miller’s offer to coauthor the report because otherwise Miller would receive little or no credit. Knowing that a graduate student could have a difficult time getting a paper like this published, Urey contacted the Science editorial office to explain the importance of the work and ask that the paper be published as soon as possible. Urey kept mentioning the results in his lectures, drawing considerable attention from the news media.The manuscript was sent to Science in early February of 1953. Several weeks went by with no news. Growing impatient, Urey wrote to Howard Meyerhoff, chairman of AAAS’s Editorial Board, on 27 February to complain about the lack of progress. Then, on 8 March 1953, the New York Times reported in a short article entitled, “Looking Back Two Billion Years” that W. M. MacNevin and his associates at Ohio State University had performed several experiments simulating the primitive Earth—including a discharge experiment with methane wherein “resinous solids too complex for analysis” were produced. The next day, Miller sent Urey a copy of the clipping with a note saying “I am not sure what should be done now, since their work is, in essence, my thesis. As of today, I have not received the proof from Science, and in the letter that was sent to you, Meyerhoff said that he had sent my note for review.”Infuriated by this news, Urey had Miller withdraw the paper and submit it to the Journal of the American Chemical Society. Ironically, at the same time (11 March), Meyerhoff, evidently frustrated by Urey’s actions, wrote to Miller that he wanted to publish the manuscript as a lead article and that he wanted Miller—not Urey—to make the final decision about the manuscript. Miller immediately accepted Meyerhoff’s offer, the paper was withdrawn from the Journal of the American Chemical Society and returned to Science, and was published on 15 May 1953.https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Prebiotic-Soup--Revisi..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Glad to hear about this. I sued Facebook in a California small-claims court to rescind my purchase of the Quest 1 (and all accessories and game purchases) after I declined the change in ToS adding the FB account requirement. It took a while (negotiated with their customer support, then sued, then finally months later got an intelligent response), but we settled for what I asked for. I can&#39;t be the only one who got my money back. I liked the product except for the added account requirement, and I would now consider buying again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It begs the question: if they host the social media account and VR account and can reliably identify / link them on their end, and the laws and terms allow them to do so, does it really matter if they’re different accounts?It&#39;s still a win if you don&#39;t have a facebook account.  For everyone else: I would assume that they will identify your accounts reliably."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Mark&#39;s statement was worded carefully in that he stated access would not longer require your _personal_ Facebook account. I interpreted this to mean you&#39;ll still need a Facebook account, but it would be through a Facebook for Work account (although I&#39;m not sure if today these are distinct entities)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have measured (on a Skylake core) the hash from Daniel Lemire, Owen Kaser, &#34;Faster 64-bit universal hashing using carry-less multiplications, Journal of Cryptographic Engineering (to appear)&#34; at t_cycles = (0.00741 +- 0.00098 cycles/byte) * bytes + (37.43  +- 0.48) which is roughly 135 B/cycle (675 GB/s at 5 GHz) or over 2x faster than the claim here.  Admittedly, that 37 cycle fixed cost is probably quite a bit higher, and I don&#39;t know how well the bit mixing compares.Parenthetically, a time equation (like t_cycles = coef * bytes + fixedCost) is a more convenient way to summarize performance of this kind of thing than the constant short string/long string mumble-mumble.  Yes, loop unrolling/etc. can create step-ish functions and a linear regression is pretty approximate (but my stderrs are pretty small above), but even so..much less tripping over words."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very grateful that my employer has committed to remaining flexible with remote work. Full time in the office, hybrid, or full time remote. It’s up to the individual. Full time remote has done wonders for my health - instead of a 2 hour commute I get to exercise. Instead of coming home stressed, annoyed, and sitting in front of the TV, I go outside for a solid hour+ after I close my laptop. I travel more liberally now that I don’t have to take time off to do so. My quality of life has never been better, and my gratefulness translates into feelings of loyalty towards my employer. Why would I quit if I’m treated well and have a nice work life balance? Why would I risk this situation by slacking off when I am on the clock?Prior to the remote shift, I was unhappy and I didn’t even realize. No exercise, no passion outside of work. All my energy went into my 10+ hour day (when you consider the commute).Since then I’ve lost 30lbs, become enamored with new sports and hobbies, and my social life outside of work exists again. I feel more “alive” than I have in a decade.I’ll never work for a company that doesn’t allow me that flexibility for the rest of my career, as long as I can help it. Companies that want access to good talent would be wise to follow this example."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; ... There is a more intriguing possibility, however. Work that is largely done remotely may be more efficient compared with an office-first model.I don&#39;t think in-person real-time communication is always effective. No, I personally think it&#39;s one of the least method of communication that can happen in an office environment when the topic gets slightly complex (that is, if the topic is complex enough for you to write a memo about it).For those topics, I love to communicate with some &#34;written&#34; form, such as in an email, posts etc. Because doing the &#34;writing&#34; part allow me to conduct some research and analyses on the topic (usually took 10 minutes), which will in turn increase the quality of my reply.If you standing right in front of me and asked a question that require a complex answer, then my reply will probably make me look like an idiot, because I might not able to discover all the information that I need to process and output within 30 seconds. Not very effective in my opinion."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Blender is such an amazing tool. I have a side business where I create 3d printed jewelry with my customer&#39;s fingerprints on it in gold and silver (https://lulimjewelry.com) and I use Blender on the backend for all of the jewelry creation.I run blender headless in a docker container on google cloud run. When needed I invoke it with an image and have a blender script &#34;engrave&#34; that image on the jewelry and output an STL file.It is incredibly flexible to script in python, although its not very &#34;pythonic&#34;. The UI is quite stateful (edit mode, object mode, which items are selected, etc) and you have to keep track of that state in your program. But once you get around those issues you can do quite a lot, and its all a free program!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love Blender, but have been stuck on version 2.7 due to what I can only describe as some sort of icon dyslexia.For 2.8, all the Blender icons were replaced with monochromatic ones. This is a very popular trend and a lot of programs are replacing their icons in this way, so it&#39;s obviously fine for most people, and I realize this is probably a niche accessibility need I have.But, to use the new icons, I find I have to check each one every time to find the one I want. Instant recognition is no longer possible. For me, this extra cognitive load makes it difficult to use Blender for more than a few minutes at a time.Blender is a fantastic product and one of the best examples of what open-source can be, but I for one will be appreciating it from afar, and remaining on 2.7 until there is a way to get more usable icons."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The general guideline will be to keep Blender functionally compatible with 2.8x and later. Existing workflows or usability habits shouldn’t be broken without good reasons – with general agreement and clearly communicated in advance.Oh boy. How I wish so much that other software developers would follow this principle... It seems nearly every software I use and rely on has to change its appearance and interface every 6-12 months, breaking familiarity for no objective reason, and simply because &#34;it looks better&#34; to look at (and not necessarily to use!) to the subjective eyes of someone."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; * The POSIX-blessed way of finding an executable program is command -v, which is consequently built into most shells. Given the standard alternative, Adams said, &#34;surely no one competent would choose to have a package depend on `which` when a standard POSIX utility can do a better job&#34;.*This feels a little tone-deaf to me.  I&#39;ve been using the *nix command-line and writing (and reading) shell scripts for 20+ years, and I&#39;d never heard of &#34;command -v&#34; until now.  Now that I know about it, I&#39;ll probably start trying to retrain my muscle memory to use it (though it requires 2x the number of keystrokes).Despite its lack of true standardization, &#34;which&#34; (along with &#34;type -p&#34;) has been the de-facto &#34;standard&#34; I&#39;ve seen in shell scripts for figuring out if a command exists.  It was a surprise to me to learn that &#34;which&#34; isn&#39;t a part of POSIX, even."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Regardless of whether &#39;command -v&#39; is a better alternative, &#39;which&#39; is ensconced as standard practice in many shell scripts, and I would go so far as to say I think the majority of them that actually have to choose between the two use &#39;which&#39;.Given that, having it print out a deprecation warning without considering what that means to all the people that use it is irresponsible.  I help manage a few hundred servers.  We send root email to a list and actually review it all every day.  We make sure to sanitize anything run from cron so that we only get email output on error (STDERR).  Given that some of those cron jobs run quite often, this would have been thousands of emails to sift through if we used Debian.There were many possible solutions, as the maintainer notes.  Unfortunately in trying to remove themself from the decision, they forced a non-solution on everyone that is disruptive.  I can&#39;t think of any way this is a good choice for this particular set of facts (I can see a deprecation warning being warranted for some other things, but this case has little to do factually with those theoretical situations)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Assange was a non-U.S. citizen working outside the U.S. - I don&#39;t get what gives the U.S. jurisdiction to try him in the first place. If China tried to extradite a U.S. citizen acting within the U.S. who published leaked information allegedly in violation of Chinese law, we&#39;d laugh them out of the courtroom, and rightly so.Adding insult to injury, publishing leaked military secrets is not even illegal in the U.S. due to the first amendment right to a free press. When the New York Times publishes leaked classified information, there&#39;s no trial or extradition. In the U.S., those who will have legitimate access to classified information first sign legally binding agreements not to disseminate it, and those who violate that agreement can be prosecuted.And in this case, that already happened: Manning served 7 years in jail for leaking the very information that Assange is being extradited over. With the leaker found and prosecuted, convicted, and sentence served, the U.S. Department of Justice should congratulate itself on a job well-done and move on to other things. It&#39;s absurd that they continue to pursue the publisher of the information almost a decade later."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s very little mention of this in the news. This is the most important fight for Press Freedom in our time. If we allow this precedent to be set, then nobody will be able to report on the security state at all. We cannot allow the so-called &#34;espionage laws&#34; erode democracy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It is so plainly obvious that this &#34;prosecution&#34; of Assange is so political that he should not be extradited. Yet, it&#39;s the fact that US prisons are so inhumane that is keeping Assange out of the US. What a national embarrassment."</p>

Ubuntu / Arch / Fedora were about 11% faster overall than Windows 11 Pro on this system. Meanwhile, Clear Linux was about 18% faster than Windows 11 and enjoyed about 5% better performance overall than the other Linux distributions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wonder how much of these results were actually due to compiler/benchmark implementation rather than operating system mechanisms.I expect file system related (not I/O) benchmarks would differ significantly in Linux&#39; favor as we&#39;d observed with WSL1 vs WSL2; but the rest? Are we to believe that DirectX 12, the API that’s supported by hardware vendors themselves, optimized to no end for first-class gaming, is actually slower than whatever&#39;s on Linux? (Not downplaying the significant achievements of Linux in graphics, but meagerly pointing out the fact that Windows is way ahead in graphics performance because of politics)For example, Windows 11 loses in all Java benchmarks. Coincidentally, Oracle has great investment in Linux as a platform. Is this really a fair operating system comparison?Similarly, GCC is optimized primarily for Linux. Windows is a second-class citizen there. It could be the same case with clang as well, I don&#39;t know. How are we supposed to be sure that compilers treat two OS&#39;s the same? Do benchmark apps get compiled with MSVC on Windows?I think OS performance can only be compared fairly with benchmarks specifically designed to measure OS performance, not performance of a specific application per se, simply because the developers have varying priorities for optimizing their apps for a platform.An OS benchmark could measure context switch latency, I/O latency, raw I/O throughput, certain responsiveness metrics etc, compiled with the preferred compiler of the platform."</p>

It&#39;s like a bad sci-fi pulp story.Given their investment and research, I wonder if they should open it all up (even if contradictory to short-term gains in ad revenue) so it has a chance to grow? Federate it a bit more than they are comfortable with, to at least give it a chance. I could see this flubbing out hard otherwise.I&#39;m personally keen on the AR/VR space (surrounded by headsets here), but the early adopters are so polarized about Facebook/Oculus&#39;s involvement.

I loved starting with a blank sheet of paper and applying various photographic methods to bring the image to life.&gt;I found that building websites was similarly satisfying. For example, click the &#34;Reveal Image&#34; button to watch an image fade in to the blank canvas!I think a lot about why I went into computer science and this is the same conclusion I came to. There&#39;s something really cool about starting with a blank page and coding in elements that appear one by one and adapting the code to be what you want. Maybe there&#39;s other ways to do it but programming seemed to be the most powerful.Just to be clear, it was video games, not photography that kinda nudged me into programming, but same idea with a blank canvas and having control of it."</p>

So many articles (and tweet chains I guess) have been written about supply chain issues, yet every one of them seems to ignore the elephant in the room which is demand for goods vs services. Over the course of the pandemic there was a staggering re-balancing of consumer spending [0] from services to goods, to which supply chains have not caught up.If the spending doesn&#39;t re-balance again as restrictions are lifted this is not a temporary supply chain issue caused by just-in-time methodology, it&#39;s just the new normal.[0] https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?ReqID=19&amp;step=2#reqid...EDIT: That link is broken, should have been this https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?reqid=19&amp;step=3&amp;isuri..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked at a company who made products on contract, but the contract stipulated the vendor we had to use to get the raw materials. The raw materials were just aluminum castings, but they were a custom shape specifically for this customer of ours. They could only be used for this one product.I noticed that the inventory levels of our vendor were dropping, but we weren&#39;t buying. Meaning our customer was ordering the same product from a competitor.I proposed that we spend the money to buy the rest of the material at the vendor. Basically denying our competitor the materials and forcing either them to come to us or the customer dropping the order and reordering through us. This would have been a risk because that&#39;s about a year supply of proprietary castings that we can&#39;t use for anything else, but I really thought it was a worthwhile opportunity. But it went against lean principles so we didn&#39;t do it.Fast forward 6 months and our competitor basically did the same thing to us."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I believe the claim is completely defensible and ultimately correct.A) This was a multi-factoral event certainly but all of these other factor are &#34;immediate causes&#34; which can themselves be traced to absolute maximum return on equity as a more final cause.B) No doubt &#34;hard to restart&#34; process are were involved. But the world relies on single-source, hard to restart, large scale production of many things today because these produce the highest returns for those who invest in them and the lowest prices for those who buy from them. And both kinds of actors have been willing to just stop producing rather than doing something that might be costly to keep production going (and they decided they didn&#39;t want backup before this for the same reason).C) Supply lines that stretch around world exist as a combination of economies of scale and &#34;labor market arbitrage&#34; and both these are driven by return, even though &#34;labor market arbitrage&#34; doesn&#39;t increase efficiency or robustness.D) Chip manufactures put money into &#34;up-date&#34; chip processes, notably leaving the sorts of chips actually used in cars woah fully under-invested and generally many sorts of lack of robustness can be traced down to money flowing only to the normally profitable. Shutting down production isn&#39;t necessarily that bad for a company - they don&#39;t wages and they can start back up once things stabilize. It&#39;s much less disastrous than making a bunch of stuff and not being able to sell it. Clearly, that thinking is guiding a lot of decisions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been testing one for a couple weeks, and a quick rundown on it: it has a quad-core A53, same CPU/SoC core as the Pi 3, with 512 MB of RAM.This means it can run 64-bit Pi OS, but it is memory-limited and even some of the benchmarks I ran needed extra swap space to complete. But for anything that does run in the 512 MB of LPDDR2 RAM, it is at least twice as fast as the Zero/Zero W, and sometimes 3-8x faster, depending on how things handle threading (4 cores is better than 1!).My biggest concern is overheating—even at the base 1 GHz clock, it will start to throttle after a few minutes in a case with no airflow or heat sink. You can overclock to 1.2, 1.4, or even in some cases 1.5 GHz, but it starts throttling a lot more quickly unless you have really good cooling."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Original RPi0 supposedly can idle at 0.4W, where-as the 3 (whose cpu this is based on) idles at &gt;1.5W. It&#39;s cool to have this great small package, but this is a very different offering than the first RPi0W.It&#39;s felt really weird seeing so little progress in available low power ARM over the years. Atmel/Microships SAMA5D3 / SAMA5D2 with it&#39;s 600 MHz Cortex A5 (2009) still seems like- half a decade latter- one of a rare few genuinely low power Linux running SoC available for purchase/use. I&#39;m forgetting what&#39;s available in the Cortex A7 line, which is a little higher power but which still has some very low power chips available for it, &amp; at significantly higher performance ranges. A7 has a lot of chips you can&#39;t buy, only available in some tablets &amp; or hard to get wearable chips, but I think there are some good offerings about too. ST has the ~$20 STM32MP1, to name one.Yet I just see so much non-materialization, non-availability. It feels like the rule. 2015&#39;s Cortex A35, 2016&#39;s Cortex A32, 2019&#39;s Cortex-A34... none of these chips seem to have really materialized in any genuinely available form. There are some off-brand tablets with A35 chips but generally that&#39;s about it. The low power segment has been rather ignored."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been running one of these for a few months too and was excited when I saw an ARMv7 CPU. In the open source and container world, many projects have stopped supporting the Zero and RPi1 due to its lack of RAM and slow CPU speed. Even running &#34;go build&#34; can take multiple seconds on a simple program. Starting Node.js was also fairly slow.The RPi zero shines for Python scripts that access hardware - for sensors and camera projects that are low power and cheap to make. It was actually perfect for the GrowLab project that we did over the summer with 20 others from the community https://growlab.dev - sensor data and camera images were aggregated to a more powerful RPi3/4 and then either uploaded to a static GitHub Pages site, fed into InfluxDB to create beautiful charts with Grafana.The new Zero 2 means that I can start to run ARMv7 or even ARM64 containers on the zero again, but with the limit of 512GB of RAM. The launch blog post explains why this couldn&#39;t be made higher.The first thing I tried out was not K3s, which I knew already suffers on a Raspberry Pi 3, but faasd. Faasd is OpenFaaS but built for pure containerd, no multi-node networking and no Kubernetes. It works fairly well for a few functions, even with NATS and Prometheus being deployed as part of the stack.So whilst you&#39;re not going to be building K3s clusters with these, they can run containers - with Docker, containerd, nerdctl and even as a full application stack with faasd.Where this gets more interesting for me, is hosting small applications, integrations or APIs. Perhaps with Ingress via a tunnel that can penetrate NAT/firewalls like Inlets, Argo or Ngrok.I&#39;ve ordered one of the release models to see how it performs. Look out for a blog post from me soon."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Many good points. I&#39;d like to add a common open secret that I believe is wrong: 1 upvote = 1 karma point.This might be true internally and initially, before any ant-spam, anti-upvote-ring detection takes place. Effectively, from a user point of view it is not - at least for me.When I look at the points one of my submissions get and compare my increase in overall karma it is very roughly 50% most of the time.   Needless to say that I never participated in things that would be considered unethically (voting-ring etc.). Also not a complaint at all, just an observation that goes against what is often written in &#34;about HN&#34; type posts (but not OP).EDIT:1. My observation is from more than a year ago, so things might well have changed.2. As lordnacho points out below this seems to be true only for stories. Regardless why it happens, awarding stories with less points than comments makes a lot of sense to me. After all posting a suitable story is much less effort than writing a decent comment."</p>

I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s strictly endemic to web or frontend, but I feel like we&#39;re solving the same problems over and over again, using the same low levels of abstraction.There&#39;s no reason for lists to scroll slowly after so many years of scrolling lists. There should just be one way to do a scrolling list, implemented natively and left alone. Yet, in web development, there&#39;s always a new and different way to do a thing, with either new, or pretty much the same ways for things to be broken.Grumble grumble"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/containThe contain CSS property allows an author to indicate that an element and its contents are, as much as possible, independent of the rest of the document tree. This allows the browser to recalculate layout, style, paint, size, or any combination of them for a limited area of the DOM and not the entire page, leading to obvious performance benefits.I wonder how much of this is browser specific because isn&#39;t this is all about implementation?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is great news!  This is a wonderful project, and the fact that it wasn&#39;t accessible from Germany made me profoundly sad and angry.I hope the responsible copyright lawyers have a hard time sleeping because of this and consider changing their line of work.  If you are blocking people from reading books in the public domain, it is a good indication that you are one of the bad guys.Even worse, they only blocked people from Germany that didn&#39;t know how to use a VPN.  German courts really don&#39;t get how the internet works."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I want state here on fact, the &#34;copyright&#34; is an rather new  anglon-saxon invention and was only later imported to Germany[1]. Interestingly, the era of the &#34;land of poets and thinkers&#34; and the economic rise of Germany was boosted by the fact - that there were no copyrights laws which hindered. Authors had to publish good and more work.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright#BackgroundQuote from WikipediaPrinting brought profound social changes. The rise in literacy across Europe led to a dramatic increase in the demand for reading matter. Prices of reprints were low, so publications could be bought by poorer people, creating a mass audience. In German language markets before the advent of copyright, technical materials, like popular fiction, were inexpensive and widely available; it has been suggested this contributed to Germany&#39;s industrial and economic success. After copyright law became established (in 1710 in England and Scotland, and in the 1840s in German-speaking areas) the low-price mass market vanished, and fewer, more expensive editions were published; distribution of scientific and technical information was greatly reduced.And from the history arctileHeinrich Heine, in a 1854 letter to his publisher, complains: &#34;Due to the tremendously high prices you have established, I will hardly see a second edition of the book anytime soon. But you must set lower prices, dear Campe, for otherwise I really don&#39;t see why I was so lenient with my material interests.&#34;It is not okay to claim other works as yours, publish private material or just don&#39;t give you a fair share upon your work. Probably we should have opted for another approach than &#34;copyright&#34; or &#34;patents&#34;. Luckily the US at least got &#34;Fair Use&#34; and maybe the idea of a &#34;Culture Flatrate&#34; from Germany is also a good idea."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m curious as to what changed PGLAF&#39;s mind. Blocking those specific works was all that the court ordered 3 years ago. Blocking everything was PGLAF&#39;s own decision based on perceived risk of further lawsuits about other works. Nothing has really changed to decrease that risk. The plaintiffs may have agreed that those are the only works they own that were in violation, and won&#39;t sue about anything else, but any other German who hold the copyright to works are still valid there but not the US still could."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; There was a rule in the Port of Los Angeles saying you could only stack shipping containers two containers high.This is incorrect.
There was a zoning rule which affected truck yards in Long Beach and Los Angeles. Truck yards. Not the port itself.As stated in the linked tweets actually.But if you don&#39;t believe that you can just google an image of the Port of Los Angeles from let&#39;s say 2019 and count how high the container piles go. Here is a randomly selected image from 2019 where 5 high piles can be clearly counted: https://www.joc.com/sites/default/files/field_feature_image/...Accuracy is important. I&#39;m not an expert on logistics, or zoning laws. But how could I trust the article&#39;s author when they clearly unable to parse their own sources?&gt; Normally one would settle this by changing prices, but for various reasons we won’t get into price mechanisms aren’t working properly to fix supply shortages.It&#39;s nice that the article is not going into that. Instead it hammers on that politicians regulate where and how many containers can you plop down. That is not the real issue.If you are moving containers into an area, and you are not moving an equal amount out then you are going to run out of space to store the containers. It is that simple. You can tweak rules to make a bit more space, for example by stacking them higher in the truck yards. But the real question is: why are the people who own these containers incentivised to move them back to where they want them to be filled?  If you solve that the problem solves itself. If you can&#39;t solve that piles of containers will fill up what little more space you won by tweaking. So the very point the article decides to &#34;not go into&#34; is the only one worth going into."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Someone correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but my understanding is that the &#39;stacking rule&#39; meant that people with more empties than they could stack 2 high on their property were &#34;storing&#34; empties on trailer chassis that carry one container.As I understood it, by letting them stack empties higher, it freed up trailers to be used by trucks to go get containers out of the port. When that happens the port then wants empties to put back on the ship (or full if they are going somewhere) and then the ship can continue on.So the &#34;win&#34; here was that more trailers would be available to take full containers from ships and that would move things along."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a big fan of this form factor, specifically just big enough to fit a motherboard/CPU/RAM plus a real-size GPU. These all use SFX PSUs and typically just an M2 SSD on the motherboard. They also have only 2 RAM slots.The days of needing a tower are over for most people. I&#39;m all about space-saving while still having a full-power PC.It&#39;s a niche, boutique market but there are some really interesting cases. My personal favourite is the Louqe Ghost S1 [1]. I&#39;ve built one PC with this (the Mk II). I bought a Mk III case but couldn&#39;t source a GPU so ended up just buying a CyberpowerPC prebuilt (which is actually a pretty nice PC, to be fair).They&#39;re not cheap and they&#39;re kind of annoying to buy. Louqe in particular has had huge distribution problems in the US (through Amazon&#39;s logistics service).Another popular one is the Dan A4 [2]. It&#39;s smaller. I personally prefer the Ghost for having better airflow, being more modular and being able to expand the case with &#34;top hats&#34;. This allows you to add a 240mm AIO and bottom fans for some pretty darn good cooling and airflow.Anyway, I&#39;m always excited to see entrants in this market.[1]: https://www.louqe.com/ghost-s1/[2]: https://www.dan-cases.com/dana4.php"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love &#39;no frills&#39; PC cases, but to me, this case has frills. The bright orange, the rounded corners and all the cutouts. This PC case is a &#39;wow! what is that weird PC case!?&#39; type of case. I like cases that you dont even notice: Sliger designs [1]1: https://www.sliger.com/products/cases/cerberus/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A lot of comments seem focused on the incentives to apple and what&#39;s motivating the change. All fair questions. To me, though, it feels like just a radically different approach this year.2016 macbook felt like leadership got in a room and said &#34;okay, let&#39;s make a list of all the sexy things we can think of that would make the macbook unique&#34;. This netted things like thin-beyond-practicality, touchbar, removing all the ports, etc.2021 macbook feels like leadership got in a room and said &#34;okay, let&#39;s make a list of all the top things everybody is complaining about most.&#34; And they just fixed everything (well, most things) on that list one-by-one."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"AFAIK, replacing the battery on the previous generation meant replacing the top part of the body, to which the battery was glued. That included replacing the keyboard and the touchpad (not 100% sure if the old keyboard and touchpad could have been kept; maybe they were replaced just because of the damage done to them by the expanding batteries). At the same time, the previous generation had battery problems and keyboard problems (as pointed out in sub-comments), which meant many were replaced for free even out of warranty (as it happened to me due to faulty battery).I suspect someone at Apple realized how much would have been saved if only the battery was not glued to the case.Edit: mentioned the keyboard problem, which would result in replacing the battery too it seems."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I still remember when you didn&#39;t even have to open up the &#34;MBP&#34; and could replace the battery directly from the bottom.  Even had green led indicator to show how much charge it had directly on the battery case."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’ve never understood the value proposition for Copilot.In terms of difficulty, writing code is maybe on average a two out of ten.On average, maintaining code you wrote recently is probably a three out of ten in terms of difficulty, and maintaining code somebody else wrote or code from a long time ago probably rises to around a five out of ten.Debugging misbehaving code is probably a seven out of ten or higher.GitHub Copilot is optimising the part of the process that was already the easiest, and makes the other parts harder because it moves you from the “I wrote this” path to the “somebody else wrote this” path.Even during the initial write, it changes the writing process from programming (which is easy) to understanding somebody else’s code to ensure that it’s right before accepting the suggestion (which is much less easy).  I just don’t understand how this is a net time/energy savings?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Copilot is crazy. The other day, I was writing a Python function that would call a Wikipedia API. I pulled from the internet an example of a GET request, and pasted it as a comment in my code.  # sample call: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&amp;format=json&amp;list=geosearch&amp;gscoord=37.7891838%7C-122.4033522&amp;gsradius=10000&amp;gslimit=100

Then I defined a variable,  base_url = &#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?&#34;

Then, like magic, Copilot suggested all the remaining keys that would go in the query params. It even knew which params were to be kept as-is, and which ones would come from my previous code:  action = &#34;query&#34;  # action=query
  format = &#34;json&#34;  # or xml
  lat = str(latitude.value)  # 37.7891838
  lon = str(longitude.value)  # -122.4033522
  gscoord = lat + &#34;%7C&#34; + lon
  ...
  api_path = base_url + &#34;action=&#34; + action + &#34;&amp;format=&#34; + format + ... + &#34;&amp;gscoord=&#34; + gscoord

As a guy who gets easily distracted while programming, Copilot saves me a lot of time and keeps me engaged with my work. I can only imagine what it&#39;ll look like 10 years from now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve been using this for weeks and it blooooows my mind. It comes up with crazy recommendations, just yesterday I wrote this big ass logic to do something, then I wanted to move that code to a function so I wrote the function name and I kid you not copilot suggested a one-liner that worked…  the thing is so useful and I’m not writing simple code (writing cryptographic code). And when it’s not doing that at the very least it provides auto-completion to lists where a counter has to increase and things like that. It’s just baffling, I don’t think I’m that directly impacted by AI, or at least this is the first time where I’m like “wow, AI really is changing the world RIGHT NOW”. Half-joking: can’t wait for it to just write my code.Also if this feature would be paid tomorrow, I think I would pay for it. It’s really noticeable when I don’t have copilot enabled now.Oh and, autocompletion doesn’t work with markdown files because of markdown plugins I think? But this is another level of insanity: when I’m writing english it figures a lot of the sentences I want to write. Makes me question if I’m just a deterministic individual with no choice."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Many anecdotal guesses are validated by this data. Doctors and agricultural workers are the obvious standouts, but I see a few more too.Us programmers stick together. Quite a high rate of marrying within the community. Lawyers show a similarly high number.A criticism of the study, is that it does not normalize by how many of these professions are in the general population. So, it appears as though software analysts don&#39;t like intermarrying. However, the truth is that there simply aren&#39;t enough of them around, they are simply more likely to run into software engineers, so that&#39;s whom they marry most.IE. This study captures P(running into a profession) x P(preference for that profession). I would love to them model P(running into a profession), so that we could get the much juicer preferences of each group for various professions."</p>

Before the war, 2-4% of female elephants were tuskless. Now 32% of newly born ones are.So it&#39;s a significant change, but it&#39;s not like this property was coming out of nowhere. It started off about as common as humans having green eyes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is this actually evolution or just selective breeding?By killing elephants with tusks the poachers are favoring elephants with the no-tusk gene.This isn&#39;t a lot different than killing a dog that bites sheep, which is how we bred herding dogs.  Or a wolf that eats your baby, which is how we domesticated dogs.This trait already existed so it certainly wasn&#39;t &#34;engineered due to mass poaching for ivory&#34; as claimed."</p>

So that your not unintentionally one over the other due to differences in viewing angle and vision ability.- Make all the fonts equal in height regardless of font point. Knee jerk reaction will be to go with the font that is closest to a persons normal preference.- Hide Font names and size/points.- Light theme and other color options.- Other programming language options.- jiI1l0O test. I like to see those characters that can often be too similar in shape shown together.- Controversial, throw in some non mono-spaced fonts."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting. Usually my critique for products like this is something along the lines of &#34;great, but how are you going to access your data from the internet?&#34; Typically the answer to that is you need some sort of tunneling service like ngrok to get around port forwarding, CGNAT, firewalls, etc. I maintain a list of solutions here[0]. The problem with most of these services is that they&#39;re targeted at developers and aren&#39;t something the average user should have to mess with.In this case, the PiBox is being offered by KubeSail[1], a company which specializes in services like tunneling (they&#39;re already on the list mentioned above). It will be very interesting to see if they can bundle it in such a way that people don&#39;t have to worry about how the tunneling works. Extra points if they make it easy for users to buy/use their own domains.[0]: https://github.com/anderspitman/awesome-tunneling[1]: https://kubesail.com/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m looking for something like this, but cheaper and for 3.5&#34; drives. USD$250, plus shipping to Australia puts that just too high for what it offers.I own Synology NASs, but adding an expander for that is expensive. (AUD$800)The ODroid-HC4 looks promising, but their &#39;toaster&#39; case design for it is awful, leaving the drives exposed and unable to put two atop each other.Ideally what I&#39;d like is:- 1-2x 3.5&#34; SATA drives- Gbit NIC- Enough grunt to run some kind of clustered filesystem (gluster, ceph, whatever)The idea being that I could start a cluster with say 3x of these devices, and then as my storage needs grow - add more.They don&#39;t need to have stellar IO, but enough to keep up with plex."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recently did something like this myself with an RPi 4 and an external drive over USB to replace Google Photos (with PhotoPrism). For tunneling (and custom domain) I used cloudflared which works surprisingly well: https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared. I wrote about it here: https://domh.dev/blog/replacing-google-photos-with-photopris...That being said, I love that someone is working on making this stuff easier to do, it was finicky to get it setup myself. I would be backing it if I hadn&#39;t just done it already.I wish Kubesail all the best and I hope they succeed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As others have said, there are more cost effective options than just getting your attorney to do a patent search for you. There are definitely plenty of companies that will do it for you for far less. But the quality is... variable, to say the least.As a point of shameless self-promotion, I&#39;m the founder of a company seeking to improve the patent system, starting with prior art search [1][2]. We&#39;re not one of those companies that will do it for you for less. Instead, we empower you to do it yourself, then have your attorney go deeper if needed. The idea being that you don&#39;t need to be a patent expert or lawyer to do it; anyone with knowledge of their technical area can search effectively.  Plus we&#39;ve got some collaboration features so when you&#39;re ready to hand off to your $500/hr attorney, you can. And not just hand off -- collaborate.If a patent troll is shaking you down, reach out to us and we&#39;ll do you a generous deal, no strings attached. We very much do not like patent trolls.[1] https://www.amplified.ai/[2] https://www.amplified.ai/en/blog/22062020/introducing-amplif..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hooray for him.Patent trolls have a business model, which he&#39;s disrupted:1) buy a patent, the broader and better-tested the better2) start threatening the easy marks; the ones who roll over and write you a check right away.  Their trick is to ask for a settlement small enough to say &#34;hey, it&#39;ll cost you more than that for attorney&#39;s fees!&#34;

3) use that money to threaten the harder targets: the ones who will fight back. Those people get asked for much larger sums.4) maybe actually go to trial with a very big target, one that&#39;ll get dinged for a 9-figure judgment if the troll wins. In the Eastern District of Texas, juries tend to do that.Researching the validity of a patent does not require $400/hour attorneys. Anyone with a basic knowledge of patent law and computer science can do it. (And no, I&#39;m not advertising for myself. I&#39;m retired.) Do you think those expensive attorneys do it themselves? It is to laugh -- they assign it to a junior who knows technology."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Every time a company settles it just funds the trolls to wreak more havoc. This is especially true for companies larger than $100 million in revenue. I’m looking at you Texas Instruments, VIA Technologies, Renesas, ASUS, Caterpillar, Nuvision International, and Netgear, just to name a few of the companies that have dealt with Jason Nguyen’s Altair Logix. When you roll over and pay the trolls it hurts smaller companies terribly.I wonder if those companies consider this a &#34;feature&#34;?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Worldcoin issues tokens to people for scanning their retinas. Their magical orb device sends a biometric hash to their network.Here&#39;s my take on it: You can possibly replace their biometric device with a random hash generator.* If it works, it means the currency is not fairly distributed, but anyone sending valid hashes to their network is issued tokens, irrespective of whether the eyeballs described by those hashes exist. This is called a Sybil attack.* If it doesn&#39;t work, it means there is some secret or centralized check that the network performs, which means the currency is not open.This is why we still use proof-of-work in spite of its energy expense: it is simple to understand, it can not be faked, and it can be openly verified.So, do not support this biometric-gathering enterprise."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;20% of all Worldcoin tokens will be set aside for the development team. In crypto, this used to be known as a “premine” and ranks among the biggest red flags that a project is intended to enrich insiders.&#34; https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/10/25/why-everyone-is-mad..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As I understand it, the distribution mechanism of Worldcoin is not part of the protocol. The protocol does not know anything about eyes.So the distribution seems completely centralized. A central authority distributes the coins however they wish.Today they might use a process involving eye scans. Or maybe not. There is no way to check. Tomorrow they might change their approach however they like. And we would have no way of knowing.The issue that seems to be overlooked is that there is no way to look at a hash and decide if it was created via scanning an eye. The hash is signed via some key that - according to the makers of WC - sits in an eye scanning device which behaves a certain way. But we have no way of checking that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; It’s also worth noting that end-to-end encryption is necessarily broken as messages to (and from) WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram pass across the bridge(s). The bridge(s) operates in Element’s trusted EMS environment, with no content scanning or datamining, but currently bridged conversations are not stored end-to-end encrypted in Matrix (they will be in the future).As a Signal user, I kind of don&#39;t want this to take off. I like knowing that when I message someone on Signal, it&#39;s for their eyes only. It feels like this service starts fragmenting some of the privacy guarantees of the bridged providers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Back in the day before the rise of Facebook, there was an open source service that combined all the popular messaging protocols - MSN, AoL, IRC, etc.It was called Pidgin[0], and it never got particularly big.I see the same thing here. While it&#39;s interesting, I&#39;m failing to see what the use case is. What&#39;s the niche that needs this solved in a big way?[0] https://www.pidgin.im/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is nicely timed.Brief history: when Hangouts was going away and Google Chat coming in, I pitched Matrix to my friends as a better alternative that didn&#39;t require unique phone numbers, awkward desktop limitations, and a better federated future. We stuck with Google Chat because inertia and networks suck that way.I revisited the instance I had setup and got the mautrix-googlechat bridge working. It&#39;s pretty nice but one friend lamented that he did not have the technical skills to self-host such a thing. And here comes this announcement! Sadly, there is a major hurdle: neither Google Chat nor SMS/GVoice are listed here and those are the major protocols that my social group uses.At the same time, my social group is conservative in adopting new core technologies and wary of cloud lock-in for critical roles (Google being both an unfortunate anchor and precipitator of that). I&#39;m not sure adding those protocols would tip the balance."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I just upgraded to Monterey on my Macbook Pro 2018 15-inch and after rebooting, all of the USB-C ports stopped working, including the power adapter. I spent some time on the phone with Apple Support trying to figure out how to fix it. After about an hour and a half there was about 18% battery left before I started to panic and figure out how I was going to back everything up.After panicking, the 3rd Apple Support Representative and I endeavoured to try and reset the System Management Controller (SMC) [1] once again. At this point I had realised that the first few times that I tried this with a previous support representative would not have worked, as I was holding shift on the left-hand side of the keyboard (the previous support representative did not specify) and not the right-hand side as outlined in the support article for Macs with the T2 chip.Good luck!1. https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT201295"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I haven’t seen this anywhere when I’ve looked, so I’ll ask here on the slim chance maybe they really added something I badly want and somebody knows…Is there any application forced sandboxing feature yet?Something users can control to forcibly stop bad behavior from certain “must have” apps. Chrome, for example, has been caught doing entire drive scans on Windows, and I’m not sure I entirely trust Zoom either. So I’d like to lock down what they can access in terms of files, paths, devices and so on and be fully confident that even if my employer demands I run some software installer provided by their “partners” that it hasn’t installed some creepy daemon and configured launchd to keep it running after I kill the app or even kill -9 the process.Yes we can use VMs for this, but Mac laptops aren’t generally beefy machines, so that’s not an optimal solution.There used to be sandbox_exec, but I’ve heard they removed it entirely from this version. We’re now supposed to get things from the (cr)App Store, which guarantees the app will only have entitlements that Apple approves. But vendors are abandoning the App Store in droves for many good reasons, and after recent events I don’t totally trust Apple to prevent malicious use piggybacking on top of a legit entitlement."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"SharePlay to Mac (I tested audio) is utterly broken. Shockingly so. I just tried it again, and my music isn&#39;t paused, yet is stuck at 0:02. Pausing and unpausing it, and the song starts ticking, 0:03, 0:04, and so on, but you can&#39;t hear any audio. Pause it again. It goes back to 0:02. Now try this with AirPods connected to your Mac. Connect your iPhone&#39;s Apple Music to AirPlay to Mac. The YouTube video you had playing on your Mac gets paused, for no reason. But at least you hear your iPhone&#39;s audio on your Mac. Now pickup your iPhone. Your AirPods have now switched to your iPhone, that&#39;s still AirPlaying to Mac. You can&#39;t hear your music anymore. You reconnect the AirPods to your Mac. You can hear your iPhone music for a few minutes. Suddenly you can&#39;t hear anything. Pick up your phone, the volume slider in the Music app went all the way to the left. You can&#39;t move the volume slider to the right, like it&#39;s frozen; but the song is still playing. You go to Control Center, and finally manage to increase the volume. A minute later, the volume goes to zero again. If you were hoping to compensate for Spotify Connect not being on Apple Music, you&#39;ll be disappointed.Also, Safari has a bug that ignores your setting to not reopen non-private windows, and reopens them anyway, so if that&#39;s important to you, you may want to temporarily switch to another browser.And yes, it still has the &#34;occasionally laggy trackpad cursor&#34; bug on M1 for me.But other than that, it seems quite a bit faster than Big Sur, and so far (past 2 weeks), very stable on the core stuff."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The big innovation here seems to be https://swc.rs/If it works as advertised this is going to be great for a ton of JS/TS projects. Particularly having a 20x typescript compiler boost when running large test suites would be great. Maintaining 5-8 different babel related projects in packages.json is also annoying and often buggy.Looking forward to see where else this gets adopted and it&#39;s stability."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If Next.js + Vercel is the leader of the production-ready frontend-as-a-service space, why hasn&#39;t a similar leader emerged in the backend-as-a-service space?I would love a clean Vercel-like abstraction on top of standard cloud primitives (functions, queues, events, workflows, etc.) with everything wired up nicely and focused on developer experience. It just seems like AWS is so configuration heavy that it is ripe for a Vercel-for-backend to emerge.Does anyone know of an existing open source framework + hosted cloud platform that is a one-stop-shop for writing a production-ready backend in the vein of Next.js + Vercel?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The best agrument is that privacy is power.[0] It is the power to influence you, show you adverts and predict your behaviour. Our personal data is being used as knowledge against us - as power against us. It is used to make us do things we otherwise would not do: to buy a certain product or to vote a certain way.As companies share more information with governments, they are able to learn more and more about their citizens. Take Facebook, a company that Laura Poitras described as &#39;a gift to intelligence agencies&#39;[1]. Facebook allows governments to arrest people planning to participate in protests before they have even begun. This is just the tip of the iceberg.Our privacy is eroding. As a society, we are beginning to accept this lack of privacy as normal: and this is extremely dangerous. Privacy provides a place for us to be ourselves, to express ourselves in new ways without fear of being watched by preying eyes. If we lose privacy then we lose this ability to experiment, and, more importantly, we lose our power.[0]https://aeon.co/essays/privacy-matters-because-it-empowers-u...[1]https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2014/10/23..."</p>

If people have no privacy, any organizations, or enterprizes they form have no privacy either.Privacy is one of the very foundations of social and economic organization. It is deeply connected with ownership and agency. Holding on to a private piece of the information universe is what underpins also all civic and commercial activity.It is not clear why we still just talk about privacy instead of actually doing something meaningful about it [0]. This is maybe the most glaring example of how modern society has degenerated / cannot solve any of its self-inflicted diseases.[0] That&#39;s obviously not a critisism of the tor project :-), these early pioneers are the saving grace of our society."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So glad to see PouchDB included. We use it and have generally had a great experience! We use it with CouchDB on the backend, and Couch seems like a fantastic way to go for use cases involving syncing data between devices with an offline mode and syncing between clients. It was built from the ground up with replication in mind.Biggest bummer of CouchDB? If you’re not hosting it yourself, there’s only one major player in the market that I know of: IBM Cloudant. They contribute much to Apache CouchDB though, and hosting it yourself doesn’t seem too difficult, especially for small, simple use cases.Anyone else using CouchDB?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Last write wins is not a strategy for conflict resolution, it&#39;s a surrender.So I&#39;m glad to hear something else apart from Pouch actually handles it. Anyone familiar with rxdb and can chime in on how they do it?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not directly related to the post (which is focused on which database to host for your app), but I&#39;m writing desktop apps (think DAWs) in C++ and Rust (not JS), and want to synchronize settings through a Dropbox or Google Drive (so I don&#39;t have to host my own cloud sync servers). What&#39;s a good library or schema to achieve this?Personally I usually don&#39;t have multiple instances of the same app open on multiple machines, but other people might open the same or different files on their desktop and laptop.- Not all settings should be synchronized (don&#39;t include machine-specific &#34;recent files&#34; paths).- How should settings be stored locally (if I may have multiple instances of my app open on a single machine)? Registry (Windows-only)? INI with atomic saving (requires care and locking to prevent multiple instances from trampling or racing with each other)? SQLite?IMO Stylus is a pretty good implementation of offline-first cloud settings sync over Dropbox/etc. It&#39;s currently based around one JSON file per CSS file (Dropbox/Apps/Stylus - Userstyles Manager/docs/uuid.json), and what appears to be a transaction log (Dropbox/Apps/Stylus - Userstyles Manager/changes/number.json). Cloud sync has been 100% reliable in my experience, though I do notice temporary file lock errors when switching between different machines in my dual-boot setup (but sync seems to be eventually consistent nonetheless).uBlock Origin is worse. Instead of merging settings, it expects the user to upload and download the entire settings blob at once (and pulling an old blob can erase changes you&#39;ve made locally). And in the past it&#39;s entirely failed to sync because the blob was too big to upload to Mozilla&#39;s servers. (Right now it &#34;works&#34; but takes several minutes for one computer to see a config uploaded from another computer.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Essentially the government has built a surveillance state by outsourcing it to private enterprise.I think it would be interesting to know how people really feel about this. I would love to see a survey that actually truly explained the trade-offs and see how people felt about it, eg avoiding the “ should government be able to subpoena records from private business” but actually ask questions like “is it OK with you that with a subpoena that the government can get a list every website that you have visited?” And then present the trade offs and abuse cases.  I really think that we’ve allowed the surveillance state to form without actually having a meaningful public debate about it."</p>

Our responses comply with the law.” The document also mentions that law enforcement can request records related to wearable devices from AT&amp;T.&#34;do you know what this “cloud storage internet/web browsing” data looks like?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not a Constitutional scholar, but I would bet SCOTUS rules this kind of warrant illegal. Google certainly has the resources to take the case that far.AFAIK a warrant usually is tied to a specific person or a specific crime. In other words, if an explosion killed Harry McHarryface, then it would be constitutional to ask for names of people who searched for Harry.Or if the fertilizer used in the bomb was shown to have been purchased on March 10, then maybe a search for &#34;fertilizer&#34; in the weeks before March 10 would be allowed.But not a generic search.Just my opinion that&#39;s not legal advice."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My experience is, # of engineers is directly related to # of product people, which is in turn related to quantity (not quality) of ideas that the founders/leaders are desperate to try out.Higher quantity of ideas == More engineers. Higher quality of ideas == Fewer engineers.WhatsApp success is not about what WhatsApp did, it&#39;s about everything they didn&#39;t do. No desktop, no browser (until after reaaaaaaallly long), no account creation (your phone number is enough, thanks), no hidden ad engine, no hundreds of stupid features that product people stuff down in the name of experimentation.There are some leaders who want anything and everything: Throw 100 darts in the wall. Leave what sticks (don&#39;t touch or nurture it). Go back to throwing 100 more. The other guy does that? We want that too. Mobile? Yes. Desktop? Yes. Browser? Yes. Different affiliate channels? Yes. Custom features for B2B partners? Yes. Merchandizing? Yes. Build a mini Ad engine? Yes. Multi user profile management systems? Yes. Yes, yes, yes, every requirement is a go.The crucial difference is: What happens when you have a restricted pool of people, but insist on doing 100s of things? Some leaders simply treat this as an &#34;org structure&#34; problem, not a problem of focus. They slice and dice the org until the 30 people become split into teams of 2-3 with a manager for each, running into coordination hell on each step – just so that more quantity of features can be seen on paper. This is how most startups are, except for those rare few which don&#39;t &#34;talk&#34; about focusing, but actually focus."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m honestly not that surprised about the size. In my experience, efficiency and the number of engineers have not necessarily correlated.For example, I used to work for a company with about 500 employees (relatively large by German standards) and now work for a competing company in the same industry with less than 150 employees. The core engineering team only consists of a dozen engineers.The output is noticeably larger. The number of new features and especially the stability is significantly better. It is noticeable that due to the small team, each project has one or two &#34;heroes&#34;. They are responsible for most of the commits and know the system inside out.These &#34;heroes&#34; have been working on the same or similar systems for over 30 years in some cases and have experienced a lot in their careers. As such, they can bring experience and advice that is just out of reach for others.Given the choice, I would always prefer a small team over a large team."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I looked at it this way. The thing most engineers, hero&#39;s or not, want to work on is new projects and to build products customers enjoy. The last thing they want to work on is maintenance. In my last personally owned company, small as we were, the engineering team and I documented how things worked as part of what we did every day. We found that by having the inner workings documented so that anyone in the team could effect a repair or update a piece of code freed us to work on new products and services. Just having the system continually documented freed our minds and kept us mostly happy (everyone has a challenge from time to time) and productive.The documentation, not that it really matters, was done in a MoinMoin wiki. It was written by engineers, for engineers. We didn&#39;t stop marketing or sales or anyone else from reading it, but the target audience was the engineering and operation staff thus no one had to over-explain the vocabulary of our architecture."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Author here. I&#39;m surprised to see my hobby project on Hacker News.I know this kind of stuff spark the ``it&#39;s meaningless to rewrite everything (especially Linux) in Rust&#39;&#39; debate. I agree 100% that rewriting Linux in Rust (or your favorite language) is just a waste of time and such a project won&#39;t live long.That said, what I&#39;d say here is that it&#39;s fun. Really fun. Implementing ABI compatibility requires you to understand under the hood of the kernel. You can learn how printf(3) works. You can learn what happens before main().Especially, in Rust, it&#39;s inspiring to explore ways to write a kernel safely and expressively. One of my favorite part is the implementation of read system call [1].Lastly, You can try this OS on SSH. Hope you enjoy :)    ssh root@kerla-demo.seiya.me

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Rewriting the Linux kernel in rust would be a rehash of why we ended up with Linux in the first place: rewriting an older OS from scratch.I would love to see a solid implementation of a real micro kernel based OS based on a message passing core in Rust to become a viable alternative to the now 50 year old Unix architecture. This would give us a possibility of some real progress on the security and process scheduling front, both of which are severely lacking in the Unix model."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For C++ many standard library functions can&#39;t be implemented in standard C++. And it not only shows some very obvious compiler built-ins in the library, but the library can depend on behavior guaranteed by the compiler which is otherwise undefined by the standard. Therefore it&#39;s not always wise to learn techniques from the standard library, as it can depend on implementation defined behavior, and this dependence can be subtle too.Not too long ago it was impossible to implement std::vector in standard C++, as constructing objects next to each other formally did not create an array. Therefore pointer arithmetic on the resulting pointers were undefined behavior, as pointer arithmetic is only defined within an array.This was fixed by the array being implicitly created in certain circumstances."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My advice would be: to learn a new language, simply start writing some non-trivial projects in it (a few thousand lines of code or so). In some languages (like Python), the standard library is the actually important feature, in other languages (like C), it&#39;s better to mostly ignore the stdlib. Example: I started learning Zig by writing a Pacman clone (https://github.com/floooh/pacman.zig) and a home computer emulator (https://github.com/floooh/kc85.zig), the Pacman clone doesn&#39;t use any Zig stdlib features at all, and the emulator only minimally for memory allocation, parsing command line args and loading data from files.Zig&#39;s stdlib is much more useful than C&#39;s, but it&#39;s still entirely possible to write useful programs without it and instead focus on learning Zig&#39;s language features first.But on the other extreme, the whole reason why I learned Python was its &#34;batteries included&#34; standard library."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; To learn a new language, read its standard libraryTo learn a new language, read its standard libraryYes, but also no.The standard library is often more complex and uses more advanced features then you often need for most projects. I.e. collections in std are supper general purpose, but if you need to write a collection it&#39;s normally specific to the purpose you need it for.I.e. std is the &#34;most&#34; general purpose library you normally find so even if it&#39;s written with &#34;KISS&#34; in mind it&#39;s still often not so simple.Then it sometimes uses unstable language features you normally can&#39;t use (as it&#39;s often made &#34;in sync&#34; with the language) and/or optimizations which in most other cases would count as &#34;pre-mature&#34; optimizations.Through without a question you can learn a lot there, you just should be aware of the points above."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was at Lambda when they announced the switch from 9 to 6 months and the elimination of paid team leaders. The feedback was universally negative. In a channel for open student discussion, Austen Allred deleted a poll from Slack because of how lopsided the reaction was. He explained the deletion by saying the poll was &#34;misleading.&#34;Students then got a survey &#34;explaining&#34; why the change was actually a good thing by asking questions such as &#34;Do you understand why companies value mentoring experience?&#34; Not just failing to reveal the truth (these were cost-cutting measures), but not even taking the effort to come up with a convincing lie.It was destabilizing: Austen&#39;s twitter account would read ambitious, hyperoptimistic; meanwhile, drastic changes would be made within the program with vague rationales (&#34;after speaking with hiring managers, we&#39;ve made these changes...&#34;), and probing further simply got deflections or gaslighting surveys.There were a ton of good people in the program, and I learned a lot there. But fundamentally there needs to be trust between institution and student when you&#39;re asking people to make this level of time and financial commitment. And at no point did I feel like Lambda at its top level prioritized student wellbeing over PR, costs, or metrics to be sold to investors."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It isn&#39;t just Lambda School. I mentor for [insert large coding bootcamp here] and I will say things have been going badly across the board for more than 50% of students. They recently had to cut a lot of staff, and completion rates seem to hover around only 50-60% when you take into account all the students they remove from this calculation when they withdraw for &#34;personal reasons&#34;. The employment numbers I don&#39;t have as much insight into but I have definitely had students who I don&#39;t think will get hired easily, and students reach out via LinkedIn 6th months later still looking for a job and wondering if they can work for me.That said, two of our best junior devs (at Arist YC S20) are Lambda School and Ironclad grads respectively, and neither of them had any background in programming and went right from bootcamp into their current positions. So it definitely works for some people.One thing I&#39;ve tried to emphasize with my mentees is the need to go beyond the curriculum (because it simply doesn&#39;t cover enough) and do personal projects. I always tell them the narrative about how back in the early 00s, the only resources available were things like w3schools.com, documentation, and the occasional dubiously accurate blog entry. I was able to learn almost everything I learned not for the sake of learning it but because I wanted to build X or Y. Bootcamps will teach you a vertical slice of some skills that are relevant in [current year], but they do not do a very good job of getting you started on a lifelong process of self-learning and side projects, which is the only way you get anywhere in this industry. Plus the only way to stand out when you went to a bootcamp anyway is having a very exceptional github profile with open source contributions that demonstrates you actually have an interest and do things beyond what is required by the bootcamp."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really wish we had less kneejerk cliche-recycling (eg &#34;don&#39;t be evil&#34; comments) commenters here just looking for confirmation bias because this is a difficult issue.First, kids use sites and apps when they&#39;re below the ToS age (usually 18 or sometimes 13, at least in the US). How are you meant to know that as a service provider? Don&#39;t get me wrong: it doesn&#39;t excuse you from doing due diligence. There&#39;s such a thing as wanton disregard for the truth. But we all know under 18s use IG, Snapchat, Tinder, etc. I&#39;m not sure fining a company billions of dollars and putting executives in jail is the outcome anyone really wants if a 17 year old uses Tinder.Second, what is personal information, exactly? It&#39;s not as obvious as you might think to the point where lawyers who work for these companies can&#39;t agree among themselves. There are obvious things (eg IP addresses, dates of birth, SSNs, addresses, names). But what about media? Photos, videos and sound files may all contain PII, technically.Third, some will say &#34;well don&#39;t store anything&#34;. Well, if a photo contains PII (which it can) then you can&#39;t operate a photo-sharing service at all for risk of storing PII of children. Also, this ignores legal obligations. If the Feds show up with a warrant about a particular user&#39;s actions then the argument &#34;we log/store nothing&#34; won&#39;t get you as far as you think.So I&#39;m not saying Google didn&#39;t do wrong here but knowing the complexities I am sympathetic to the idea of resisting broad legislative overreach as you can end up with bad laws that do just that.And if we&#39;re going to start singling out tech giants for lobbying Congress, my question is why them in particular? We currently have a Senate that is essentially beholden to the personal interests of one unelected rich guy: Charles Koch. Koch lobbies against health care, taxes on the rich and infrastructure in the Senate. Around the country, he has been instrumental in defeating public transit and many other initiatives in many cities."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; A week before the meeting, the Federal Trade Commission announced that it was considering making changes to its interpretation of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, which prohibits companies from collecting information about kids under the age of 13 without parental permission.How would that work in practice? A lot of us here operate websites. Your website gets a request. How are you supposed to tell the age of the person that request came from? Maybe Google / Facebook have enough data to identify the person and their age, but ironically, they would have to collect information about them to determine that it&#39;s a person they shouldn&#39;t collect information about.Certainly no child in the history of the Internet has ever lied to a website when asked their age."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;We have been successful in slowing down and delaying the [ePrivacy Regulation] process and have been working behind the scenes hand in hand with the other companies,&#34; the complaint quoted Google executives as saying in a memo ahead of the meeting. The August meeting could &#34;find areas of alignment and narrow gaps in our positions and priorities on child privacy and safety.&#34;This sounds like a starting point for further investigation.Perhaps the litigation will reveal more about what is going on inside Big Tech."</p>

That is, over 99% of the bugs reported by Linux gamers also affected players in other platforms. Moreover (quoting from the OP):&gt; The report quality [from Linux users] is stellar. I mean we have all seen bug reports like: “it crashes for me after a few hours”. Do you know what a developer can do with such a report? Feel sorry at best. You can’t really fix any bug unless you can replicate it, see it with your own eyes, peek inside and finally see that it’s fixed. And with bug reports from Linux players is just something else. You get all the software/os versions, all the logs, you get core dumps and you get replication steps. Sometimes I got with the player over discord and we quickly iterated a few versions with progressive fixes to isolate the problem. You just don’t get that kind of engagement from anyone else."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yep we find a variant of this with our python open source data science users who normal businesses would hate:- Across all Python envs (Jupyter, streamlit/plotly, flask/Django, ...), they report way more bugs, and often from our free tiers, which sounds low ROI.. but our community caught all but ~2 significant bugs we fixed this year that our internal automated testing missed and would have otherwise gone to our Enterprise and gov users . They are happy to exchange a tiny bit of GPU or viz burps for new features faster, as long as we are responsive to their reports! That also pushed us to a better dev cadence which wouldn&#39;t have worked for our Enterprise users. More subtle, we have more confidence for deploying wider features/APIs which would otherwise be too underused + risky for the same reason.- they are often doing innovative new things with our stack, which originally meant feature requests for non-repeatable sales.. but ended up stretching our flexibility into wider applicability, and they can clearly tell us areas to advance the visual, analytic, etc sides of our R&amp;D and package it up for the rest of their internal analysts. Almost like a multiplier for conversations with our more operationally focused no-code/low-code users, and helps us see around the corner for them in the AI+API+customization sides!- most of our technical partnership discussions now go through our OSS client repos. Rather than PowerPoints with BD people that don&#39;t have staff to do things, a product dev or sales engineer/architect or devrel blogger will think, &#34;oh our customers would benefit from better interactive visuals on our data, let me whip something up quick with that package&#34; and we help them take it from there- open source data users like PyData developers and data scientists, compared to say the # of SMBs out there or general enterprise employees, is small and almost by definition doesn&#39;t pay for most software... but they end up being attached to projects that do, and influence much of their organization that definitely does!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great article, though he&#39;s benefitting from a specific slice of Linux users that are great to work with.On the other end of the spectrum, try releasing a php plugin for Wordpress, OpenCart, Magento, etc.  I released a mildly popular, open-source, free add on in this space.  The Linux users there are decidedly less technical, but still doing it themselves.What I got for &#34;bug reports&#34; was mostly terrible, few details/logs/etc.  And a weird entitlement thing where people had really high support expectations over something that was open source and free. Even a few expletive-laden emails.  I did receive a few really helpful reports, pull-requests, and thank you emails...but they were very much the exception."</p>

Google throttles the load time of non-AMP ads by giving them artificial one-second delays in order to give Google AMP a “nice comparative boost.” Throttling non-AMP ads slows down header bidding, which Google then uses to denigrate header bidding for being too slow. “Header Bidding can often increase latency of web pages and create security flaws when executed incorrectly,” Google falsely claimed. Internally, Google employees grappled with “how to [publicly] justify [Google] making something slower.”I’d be seriously ashamed at this point if I was a Google employee assigned to AMP."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"What a read. Almost every single paragraph in the document leaves me speechless. For example, quoting from the document:&#34;Google likes to claim that it will “never sell your personal information to anyone,” with Google CEO Sundar Pichai deceptively claiming that such a policy is “unequivocal.” But Google leverages  intimate  user  data  and  personal  information  to  broker  billions  of  daily  online  ad  impressions between publishers and advertisers that target individual users based almost entirely on  their  personal  information. Internal documents  confirm  that  Google  knows  its  users  are  deceived by its misrepresentations, even as it reaps billions from ads that use personal data to target those  users.  In  Orwellian  terms,  it’s  a  beautiful  thing  for  Google,  the  destruction  of  words  like “sell” and “personal.”&#34;Or:&#34;Google presents a public image of caring about privacy, but behind the scenes Google coordinates  closely  with  the  Big  Tech  companies  to  lobby  the  government  to  delay  or  destroy  measures that would actually protect users’ privacy. Of course, effective competition is concerned with both price and quality, and the fact that Google coordinates with its competitors on the   quality metric of privacy—one might call it privacy fixing—underscores Google’s selective promotion of privacy concerns only when doing so facilitates its efforts to exclude competition.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is my favorite quote:&gt; First, Google started to leverage its ownership of the largest web  browser,  Chrome,  to  track  and  target  publishers’  audiences  in  order  to  sell  Google’s advertising inventory. To make this happen, Google first introduced the ability for users to log into the Chrome browser. Then, Google began to steer users into doing this by using deceptive and coercive tactics. For example, Google started to automatically log users into Chrome if they logged into any Google service (e.g., Gmail or YouTube). In this way, Google took the users that choose not  to log into Chrome and  logged  them  in anyways.  If  a  user  tried  to  log out of Chrome  in response, Google punished them by kicking them out of a Google product they were in the process of using (e.g., Gmail or YouTube). On top this, through another deceptive pattern, Google got these users to give the Chrome browser permission to track them across the open web and on independent publisher sites like The Dallas Morning News. These users also had to give Google permission to use this new Chrome tracking data to sell Google’s own ad space, permitting Google to use Chrome to circumvent reliance on cookie-tracking technology."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The article mentions Process Explorer. Since Sysinternals were bought by Microsoft many years ago and the tools are distributed directly via Microsoft, such tools are unlikely to have an issue being signed.A brief history of the process for those not following it. Originally for kernel-mode drivers, you needed a code signing certificate cross signed by Microsoft&#39;s root. This means that the certificate follows a chain up to a standard CA _and also_ one Microsoft use to approve that CA to issue kernel-mode certificates. It was not sufficient to have a certificate capable of signing code, even with MS&#39; OIDs for that.Then, around Windows 10 I think, Microsoft announced that one would need to acquire an EV certificate. You would then be required to submit the driver package via sysdev.microsoft.com and after spending time in Ballmer&#39;s Brewery, it would come out signed by Microsoft.It was technically possible to use the old mechanism at this stage too, provided the end user did not have UEFI secure boot enabled. IF secure boot were enabled, the kernel would: a) if the driver was signed pre-Win10, accept it, b) if it was signed post win-10 RTM date and by Microsoft, accept otherwise reject.Thus the only mechanism to realistically get your driver working on all Windows out of the box is to submit via sysdev. You can&#39;t realistically ask users to disable secure boot, even if this is entirely possible on all x86 motherboards.Finally, the cross signed roots expire soon and I think some already have. Microsoft have decided that this mechanism will now be retired, and all drivers must be signed via sysdev from now on. You still require an EV certificate as well, to sign the package.This is a bit of a mixed bag. On the one hand, Microsoft have repeatedly signed the shim maintained by redhat in order to allow Linux distributions to boot directly on secure boot-enabled hardware (UEFI binaries also go through this process and always have). Microsoft have their keys in the default keychain because they bothered to be involved in the process, unlike linux companies like Redhat. So on the one hand, they&#39;re being quite friendly to open source.On the other hand, the push to EV certs rules out individual developers like myself[1]. I could register a company but... that entails effort and expense for a hobby project. And now hobbyist projects like this run the risk of being rejected by MS.I mostly believe this is an attempt to reduce the number of code signing cert leaks that result in people writing malware, and lock down the Windows kernel a bit more, but still. It is a shame.[1] This is because most CAs won&#39;t issue EV certificates to individuals, even if those individuals happen to have detailed knowledge of cryptography and all the pkcs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"An immensly powerful and useful tool. Can&#39;t live without it. Hopefully the situation resolves soon.What is it with MS these past few months? It&#39;s like they&#39;re trying to throw away the little community goodwill they managed to build up over the years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Keep in mind this has happened because people agreed that they can&#39;t (normally) run code not singed by someone else (Microsoft) on their own system for “security” reasons. Well, it was not security, it actually was a way to keep keys to themselves, and hold the user system as a hostage. And it has been explained many times by many people.If you care about software freedoms, even just a tiny bit, you wouldn&#39;t touch “Microsoft open source”, and you wouldn&#39;t be happy about your friends using any of it, like you wouldn&#39;t be happy about seeing them with a heroin syringe. That is going to explode spectacularly one day."</p>

Especially that today there is such a race if you want to find a good and affordable appartment. It’s just too bad the author wasn’t able to create something simple for this. At the end of the day, you have to try 10 ideas to get one off the ground. But you also have to give them a serious shot, which doesn’t seem to have been the case here.

In Google’s words, the Jedi program &#39;generates suboptimal yields for publishers and serious risks of negative media coverage if exposed externally.&#39;&#34;...&#34;For example, Google and Facebook have integrated their software development kits (SDKs) so that Google can pass Facebook data for user ID cookie matching,&#34; the amended complaint says. &#34;They also coordinated with each other to harm publishers through the adoption of Unified Pricing rules…&#34;"</p>

If you aren&#39;t profitable you should ask yourself, &#34;Why don&#39;t other people find value in what I&#39;m producing?&#34; Additionally, we view profitability as a mechanism for allowing us to keep working on the ambitious ideas that we care about.In part because of the people who are attracted to his companies, and his particularly strong influence on company culture compared to most founders, I think his companies have a pretty healthy (thought not perfect) perspective on profitability in the grand scheme of things."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am a big fan of RSS one of the reasons (alluded to by this article) is the type of content that tends to get exposed via RSS.Frequently the type of content that gets syndicated via RSS is long form and non-commercial.It turns out that these two properties produce a pretty good signal to noise ratio which filters out precisely the kind of trash that has ruined the web over the last decade or two (long form content at least has the possibility of teaching you something or presenting an idea with some kind of rigor; and since RSS isn&#39;t great at monetization, the worst offenders in media tend to deprioritize it).Of course RSS is a very imprecise filter, but it&#39;s basically the antithesis of a Twitter or Facebook feed, where everything is short form and you tend to see whatever serves the platform&#39;s commercial interests (i.e. their definition of engagement).This matters to me because at a certain point I realized -- I have basically never read anything short form on social media which enriched me in a meaningful way.I have learned a lot from studies, reference works, long form analysis, and books -- basically all the quality knowledge I possess has come from one of these sources.At best social media has given me occasional links to these things (scattered among an ocean of junk information).It&#39;s mostly because of how RSS originated with blogs I guess, and who was involved in designing it. But for whatever reason it has been far more valuable to me than any other form of content syndication online."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Remember when every Facebook page and profile had an RSS feed?  And FB messenger was XMPP compatible so you could use it with bitlbee and your favourite IRC client.  And you could email people @facebook.com and it would show up in their messages.Google gets all the “credit” for killing RSS, but there’s plenty of dismay to be spread around!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a regular downloader of BBC Radio podcasts, RSS has been a godsend since they redesigned their site around the godawful &#34;BBC Sounds&#34; mobile style. After the initial pain of tracking down each programme&#39;s own site (which contains a link to its RSS feed) and sticking them in Thunderbird, I can now easily download all the podcasts I want even quicker than before the Sounds redesign."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am a member of ILWU 13. A couple thoughts after reading the comments:The zoning change is for TEU storage outside the port. The port itself was not subject to that rule.The Port of Los Angeles is a landlord and is not directly involved in operations.Private companies, such as APM, EverPort, and others, rent piers/berths and are responsible for the actual operations and logistics.Some speculation: recently I’ve heard of some ships not even waiting to load empty TEU’s as they normally would and instead they are immediately leaving for China, literally empty. I suspect this behavior is what turned the congestion we had before into the quasi deadlock we have now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Everyone&#39;s focused on Ryan&#39;s comments about stacking, and the subsequent win there. Amazing job, Ryan, and thank you Robert Garcia for being a man to take one on the chin (for this solution not coming from your team) and for then doing the right thing. I am seriously impressed by not seeing any NIH (not invented here) behavior here.But why stop there? Ryan suggested 5 courses of actions, and made it clear that we need to act on all of them at the same time. So far only the first of those 5 steps have been acted on. The rest of the steps are likely either bad or the people needed to act on them are doing that NIH bullshit (which I can understand to some extent given how much negativity is being directed at Robert Garcia). But negativity or not, if those are good suggestions, we need to act on them. Would love to hear any thoughts on how to mobilize support for quickly validating/invalidating those suggestions, and then acting accordingly.If it&#39;s possible to cancel brands and individuals, it should be possible to do the same with politicians as well. I hope it doesn&#39;t turn out that we care more about certain individuals&#39; views than the prevention of a nationwide and potentially even global crisis [1].[1] From Ryan&#39;s tweet:&gt; I can&#39;t stress enough how bad it is for the world economy if the ports don&#39;t work. Every company selling physical goods bought or sold internationally will fail. The circulatory system our globalized economy depends has collapsed. And thanks to the negative feedback loops involved, it&#39;s getting worse not better every day that goes by.."</p>

For example your likelihood of being personally identified is 14%). This obviously needs a body of research to come up with these metrics and methods to verify them. Governments can fund that research.Yet right now all I&#39;ve seen from EU and California regulations have been friction upon friction both for the end user and the service provider:Every website I visit I need to go adjust cookie settings (enable essential and telemetry and remove targeting).So I&#39;d vote for repealing all these useless laws"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I joined in 2010 and left in 2019. The company I joined was very different than the one I left. Every single one of Google&#39;s problems can be traced back to scale. Loss of trust, distance to top leadership, tone-deafness, repeated failures, escalating surveillance dystopia, perf management overhead, leaks...all of them are fundamentally due to scale. And scale is simply because greed. Gotta make that 23% YoY revenue growth. That is Google&#39;s true mission. Eat the world. It&#39;s now $180 billion in revenue. In five years, that will need to be $400 billion. And five years after that, it will need to be pulling close to a trillion."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"“Quite a few activists and researchers were fired for asking Google to be a bit more ethical”In the examples the author cited, those activists and researchers were fired for reasons going beyond “asking Google to be a bit more ethical. And frankly it doesn’t seem ethical for activists, researchers, and the author to deliberately misconstrue facts whenever they believe they’re on the right side of an ethical (and sometimes just political) issue."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think it’s interesting that the good things about working there had nothing to do with the employer and the bad things had everything to do with the employer.Indeed, this line is the takeaway, in my opinion: “…is because we&#39;ve been at least a little brainwashed into thinking a job at Google is the pinnacle of employment.”I haven’t worked for one so this take might be quite hot, but I get the sense that big tech companies do a great job selling you on the idea that they’re elite and therefore you must be elite too if you get the job. But then you’re really just another fungible developer in a pool of tens of thousands. There’s exceptions of course."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m generally weary of MS having too much influence over open source with Github and VSCode, particularly due to their history.My creep alarm went off a bit when I recently started a project to test the waters with TypeScript.  I was asking on a forum how to deal with native JS dependencies without types, and he answer I got was &#34;Are you using VSCode?  It will just find the community maintained type packages for you&#34;.It seems to me that VSCode&#39;s &#34;just click the button to solve my problem&#34; style of UX makes it very easy for developers to become reliant on proprietary workflows without even realizing it.  If one were to pursue an EEE strategy, this would not be a bad way to start."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think Microsofts&#39; long-term plan is to get most developers to use cloud-based coding environments, which is not unlikely given that software stacks become more complex to the point where setting up a local development environment is really hard. Once they achieve that they&#39;re in a very good position to sell their own cloud services by making the integration into the development workflow really smooth.So their acquisition of Github and the large effort invested in VSCode as well as privileging their own software stack over competing solutions makes perfect sense, business wise. It probably won&#39;t be good for free software though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Microsoft promising `dotnet watch` for a while and then dropping that certainly doesn&#39;t help with the already pretty damaged view of Microsoft not caring about open source developers. Here is the gist of the situation from Microsoft&#39;s point of view:&gt; Throughout the last year we’ve been working to enable the best possible Hot Reload experience in Visual Studio 2022 and .NET 6. Part of our goal was to also explore making this feature available to customers through a variety of mechanisms such as bringing the full power of Hot Reload to as many .NET and C++ developers as possible when running through Visual Studio 2022 debugger, supporting Hot Reload when running .NET 6 apps without the debugger, and the very basic Hot Reload support we added to the .NET SDK tools through dotnet watch.&gt; As we reflect on what was accomplished, and what is still in front of us, the backlog continues to grow. This includes many high value scenarios that will benefit the broadest number of developers, including focus areas such as .NET MAUI, Blazor, adding support more types of edits, more optimized experience when working with XAML apps, and much more.&gt; With these considerations, we’ve decided that starting with the upcoming .NET 6 GA release, we will enable Hot Reload functionality only through Visual Studio 2022 so we can focus on providing the best experiences to the most users. We’ll also continue to pursue adding Hot Reload to Visual Studio for Mac in a future release.So, first they wanted &#34;bringing the full power of Hot Reload to as many .NET and C++ developers as possible&#34; but now they shifted to &#34;focus on providing the best experiences to the most users&#34;.Best part of this whole thing is the pull request which was opened (https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/22217) but &#34; locked and limited conversation to collaborators&#34; straight after opening it as Microsoft anticipated the backlash but still went ahead with the change.Seems they still have a lot to learn before they can indeed be trusted."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a common technique in embedded products, but I should point out that it&#39;s not useful for general purpose Raspberry Pi work.The author disables several important kernel features to boot faster, including network support and USB support. Obviously, if you plan to use network or USB then it&#39;s not an option to disable those. You can disable some of the other debugging features and little extras for a slight boost, but it&#39;s going to be negligible (&lt;1s, in my experience).The biggest change comes from removing the init system entirely and replacing it with the user-facing app. This is the fastest way to get your app started, but now you&#39;re responsible for doing everything that was previously handled by the init system. The author can do this because they don&#39;t have any network, timekeeping, or other system functions normally handled by the init system. They only needs to mount filesystems, which is easy to replicate inside of the app.Anyone planning to ship a Raspberry Pi based product should read this article carefully as a great starting point. Anyone who wants to use their Raspberry Pi for general purpose use or even with network connectivity or USB devices will be disappointed if they try these techniques. Great article, but it&#39;s a narrow use case."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great job! I am building a CNC router in my spare time and I ended up using a raspberry pi 3 since I want to cram in a ton of features and esp32s and stm32s are simply not cutting it. And cutting the boot time is something I spend stupid amounts of time on. The best I was able to achieve was just under 8 seconds. I&#39;ll have to dig into this and see if there is something more I could do."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; allowing for a randomly discovered shrink wrapped headset twenty years from now to be able to update to the final software version, long after over-the-air update servers have been shut down.This resonates so much with me. Each time I setup a new device that requires an Internet connection, I think about how we can enjoy booting 30 years old retro computers and how the next generation will not be able to do the same because of locked down hardware."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Massive props to John Carmack! We also need laws to protect consumers when they don’t have an enlightened champion on their side.Part of the reason I buy Apple devices is because Apple is unlikely to get acquired or go out of business for the foreseeable future. I wish there were viable alternatives. Android devices are not an option for me, as they are more likely to be abandoned and/or contain Google/manufacturer/carrier malware, and I need to use banking and work apps.In that same vein, I have a preorder for a Framework Laptop because, at least for actual computers, I have the option of not splurging on a non-upgradeable, non-customizable Apple device.We really shouldn’t have to wait for Librarian of Congress-granted exemptions, which can be rescinded at any time and are meaningless with locked-down devices anyway."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is tangential, but I really wish that their would be legislation, valid retroactively, to enable old unsupported devices to still be utilized. I think this goes somewhat beyond right to repair?Take for example digital backs for medium format cameras - these things are built in low numbers, with high end FPGAs and camera sensors, with JTAG interfaces ready to go and everything - but then forgotten about a few years later. Why not enforce the creation of some document on how one would build their own OS for it? Or how the bus from the sensor ADCs works? This all existed at one point internally, but now is lost, and most of this backs will slowly die and go to waste, even though they could easily be repurposed or repaired."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Magit is such an unbelievably good piece of software. If you haven&#39;t used it, please at least take a look. It seems like &#34;just a GUI for git&#34;, but that&#39;s missing the point — many operations suddenly become frictionless, so your entire workflow changes.I regularly do things like &#34;stash some of my changes, switch branch, cherry pick a commit, switch branch, do an interactive rebase reordering commits and dropping one, pop one of my stashes&#34;, and they become routine, so working with code becomes a fluent experience, rather than fighting with your tools.I would say that Magit and structural editing using Paredit are the two most important technologies that make programming great."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Magit is an exceptionally well made interface to Git. Yes, it’s built on top of Emacs, and that might stop many from even looking into it. - I am glad I made a deep dive into Emacs last year, and although I stopped using it as an IDE (VS Code is just too good), I still come back to it because of Magit (and macros, general text editing and org-mode). Yes, I have an interface for Git in VS Code as well, but it‘s very rudimentary compared to Magit, and it’s limited to the narrow left bar. And to give an example: Making „micro commits“ by staging various lines of changes is super easy in Magit, but I still haven‘t found out how to select several disconnected lines for staging in VS Code."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Magit is insanely ergonomic. Like how easy is it to selectively stage portions of files in the git CLI? In magit it is usually just a few keystrokes.I wish magit-forge [0] had more features though - like I cannot create new labels from it.Please consider donating [1] to the developer if it has made your life any easier.[0] https://github.com/magit/forge[1] https://magit.vc/donate/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This happened to me. The police wanted my password and refused my right to silence, wouldn&#39;t let me call a lawyer. I wouldn&#39;t talk. Then they threatened my wife and I gave up my password to stop them from hurting her.The password was suppressed by the court, but they let the police use it anyway because one of the officers (with no formal computer qualifications) testified he could have broken 2048-bit AES encryption without the password. And worse case he said he would unsolder the chips off the circuit board and put them onto another board and that would fix it. The judge allowed the testimony and believed it.Make sure you always use a password on your devices though. Biometrics are not protected by the 5th Amendment in the USA as the police can legally force your finger onto a touchpad or hold your face in front of a camera."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; this case turns on one of the most fundamental protections in our constitutional system: an accused person’s ability to exercise his Fifth Amendment rights without having his silence used against him.A very interesting tidbit I learned here on HN a couple years back — the Supreme Court ruled in 1992 that you have to declare out loud an intent to invoke your Fifth Amendment rights, if you haven’t been formally arrested yet. Literal “silence” may be acceptable after being Mirandized, but not necessarily before.https://harronlaw.com/blog/miranda-rights-texas/https://www.oyez.org/cases/2012/12-246“Question: Does the Fifth Amendment&#39;s Self-Incrimination Clause protects a defendant&#39;s refusal to answer questions asked by law enforcement before he has been arrested or read his Miranda rights?”No, by 5-4 vote."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sortof off topic question.  I&#39;ve never owned a smart phone but might get one soon assuming I can find a decent one that will run grapheneOS.Is there an app that can be given permission to intercept the unlock code and upon receiving the panic/under duress code, discretely put the phone into a &#34;parental controls&#34; configuration that sandboxes all your data and only presents the storage you want the law enforcement children to see?  Some cops use a USB device that pulls all the data from the phone.  Is there a way to sandbox that data so they only get the data from approved apps and the forensics USB device does not know any better?  i.e. not denied data, but rather can only see what you want it to see.  Or should this be a feature request to the alternate phone operating systems developers?Maybe this duress code should also activate a timer.  If the all-clear code is not entered in a user-defined period of time, the phone wipes all user data in the background resetting it to a brand new phone.  Or maybe wipe the data for specified applications to not appear to destroy evidence?  Maybe also send network notifications(s) to specific in case of mission compromise destinations?[Edit] Feature request update.  This duress system should also log all the data that was added or planted after the duress code was entered, to log people planting evidence.  Upload encrypted manifest,timestamps and checksums to remote site in  the event law enforcement tamper with evidence."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The world wide web is only 28 years old.We&#39;ve had computers for 76 years at this point.We&#39;re discussing this topic in modern English, but if you look back 500 years William Shakespeare wouldn&#39;t be born for another couple of generations: vocabulary and grammar have changed a lot since then, and if you look back a further 500 years (to 1021AD) the &#34;English&#34; spoken in those days was a lot closer to Frisian than anything we&#39;d understand.To get the big picture of what 500 years means ... the oldest surviving writing is roughly 5500 years old. We&#39;ve had agriculture for roughly 11,000 years. And you&#39;re asking for a personal legacy to be legible and usable after surviving a span of time 10% as vast as the existence of writing itself?Think archival grade materials and ink, then add translations into Mandarin, Arabic, and Spanish -- there&#39;s a much better chance of it being readable if you have more than one language. Then maybe add a dictionary, just in case words have fallen out of use. Make multiple copies and distribute them around the world, including tectonically stable desiccated regions that are currently lightly- or un-inhabited and likely to remain so: the criteria for deep disposal nuclear waste repositories are applicable (minus the &#34;deep&#34;) bit, so Yucca Flats would do, or the Atacama Desert or the McMurdo dry valleys in Antarctica."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Other comments have given ways to physically archive the webpage. Continually hosting it is a much trickier endeavor. Beyond just keeping the servers up, technologies will shift such that eventually html webpages, servers that talk using tcp/ip, datacenters that connect via fiber cables, etc will all be deprecated.That said, if we have a very liberal definition of the word &#34;website&#34; to include any successor technologies where a device can be used to request a document, given an identifier, that looks recognizably like your webpage, this is doable. What you really need is an institution that you can trust to keep existing and to keep the necessary upkeep of your website as part of its mission.The main institutions I can think of that have lasted for 500 years unbroken are churches and elite universities.  If you were able to convince the Pope to decree that the church should keep hosting your webpage in perpetuity, that would likely work, but persuading him of that sounds very challenging.  That said, universities are used to accepting gifts with sometimes eccentric strings attached.  The gift will probably need to be large; but I imagine a $1B donation to Harvard under a condition that they continue to host and update the page as needed would likely work. Getting that sort of money is quite hard, but tbh probably easier than coming with a way of guaranteeing that your direct descendents keep the webpage up."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"  I met a traveller from an antique land,
  Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
  Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,
  Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
  And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
  Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
  Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
  The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;
  And on the pedestal, these words appear:
  My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;
  Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!
  Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
  Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare
  The lone and level sands stretch far away.”

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;“We used a special cable device which I built in Moscow before going to Cuba. We planned to fly the camera between two big buildings in a major street. Because of security and insurance problems we used it in a little street. We used two cables and a small cart with eight wheels and a fork underneath where the camera was placed at the [end] of a handheld move. The secret of how we attached the camera to the cart was a magnet, part of which was in the cart and part of which was built on the camera. From the window the camera moved out about 100 feet.&#34;[1]The camera was an Éclair CM3 Camiflex, which is a beautiful little camera first built in 1945. There are still some for sale.[2][1] https://ascmag.com/articles/flashback-soy-cuba[2] http://www.visualproducts.com/storeProductDetail02.asp?produ..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Soy Cuba contains lush and gorgeous B&amp;W cinematography. The film opens up with the camera flying over the waters of Cuba; the reflection of the water is glistening in a way unlike other films. I believe they used an X-ray film strip to achieve this shot.Mikhail Kalatozov has included another impressive shot at the end of his previous work, &#34;The Cranes Are Flying.&#34; (Palme d&#39;Or at Cannes 1958) The camera follows the protagonist, then gets seamlessly lifted up by a crane to depict the entire street parading.While Soviet-era films does not have much exposure in the English-speaking world, there are so many gems, critically and technically. The filmmakers were acutely aware of great filming techniques.Also check out:Walking the Streets of Moscow (1964)
- B-roll scenery contains another lush reflection of the Moscow watersIvan the Terrible (1944/1958)
- Eisenstein is an ardent practitioner of the montage, and prefers to static camera shots. However, his compositions are very imaginative, and there is no shot you want to miss. His film also briefly experiments with color, and he exploits colored lighting to emphasize the characters&#39; psyche.Anything by Andrei Tarkovsky
- Tarkovsky is indisputably a master of Russian cinema after Eisenstein. He often shoots in nature, but no director shoots with such rich texture of the mud. His long shots emphasizes the bleakness inherent in the Russian psyche.The Ascent (1977)
- Set in WWII, the film shows the resistance escaping the Nazis covered in snow and panting in the cold. Great snow photography.Hard to Be a God (2013)
- A sci-fi story on the immigration of humans to a different planet, the colonizers inhabit the inhospitable environment. Like Tarkovsky, the slow dragging in the mud conveys the dreary lives.These are recommendations I came up off the top of my head relating to cinematography, but there are definitely many more to appreciate."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Personal anecdote: This was the first film I ever projected in 35mm. Our university theater obtained a print from the national film archive of Venezuela; it was a copy of the 1995 restoration. Incredibly striking, lush visuals, and partially responsible for my continued personal and professional interest in screening archival film. Six years later, I still remember the joy of projecting this exact sequence. I&#39;m glad the film survives."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This has the same kind of relaxing vibe as Stardew Valley. A very rare instant purchase for me once it is released.For me personally these games stand out in a huge way in the sea of generic AAA micro-transaction &#34;games&#34;. If anyone wants to drop some more SV-like game recommendations I&#39;d love to hear them.I am in continued awe ConcernedApe was able to accomplish all this largely on his own.And beyond this that he continues that approach with his new game even though he could surely afford to just bring on as many developers/designers as he needed. He could even churn out a new game on a yearly basis and &#34;milk&#34; it all to maximize profit. The fact he is doing none of this speaks volumes (at least to me).Eric if you somehow happen to stumble upon this comment know you&#39;ve brought one couple many many happy hours together. We wish you all the best, and much love!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have been amazed of what Eric has created single-handedly already, and am so pleased he&#39;s doing something new! Stardew Valley is a prime example of what I want in modern games and so often find lacking. No microtransactions, single-player-friendly, not graphic-intensive. Not every game needs to or should be Stardew Valley, of course, but there&#39;s not enough Stardew Valleys out there.Few of us are as talented as Eric is, but I wish more of us tried a little harder to create what we wish existed, and not fall into the trap of what&#39;s popular. To bastardize legend, &#34;If I were not [me], I wish I were [ConcernedApe].&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Biggest advice I can give is you probably don&#39;t need search if you&#39;re indexable by search bots.No really. Look over people&#39;s shoulders sometime.They&#39;ll just go to Google and type in their search followed by terms such as Wikipedia, imdb, Stackoverflow, YouTube, Bandcamp, Amazon, eBay, Yelp... all sites that spent a lot of time on their search and have done quite a decent job. Oh well.So unless you really need it for some critical reason where you know your users aren&#39;t going to do their regular patterns of going through one of the general engines, close the ticket as out of scope and go home early.Don&#39;t bother implementing hard to do and expensive to maintain features that nobody will use. It&#39;ll become more headache than fun real quick."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A problem close to my heart. Good search is certainly still too difficult to pull off for small teams, and this was one of my motivations for building and open sourcing Typesense[1].Most people think of search and immediately think of large data sets, but the problems that plague smaller datasets are equally interesting. It&#39;s less about performance and more about relevance. For e.g. searching across multiple fields for a compound query like &#34;taylor swift style&#34;, requires breaking the query into segments (taylor swift | style) before searching for the appropriate fields. There are also a class of problems that traditional search engines that rely on BM25 or TF-IDF for ranking cannot reliably solve (e.g. searching on small texts like titles) where you have to consider distance between matching words (which TF-IDF and BM25 miss). Lastly, there is also personalization which is almost always left as an exercise to the reader :)[1]: https://github.com/typesense/typesense"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The simplest advice to engineers would be to not think elastic search as some black box that will solve all of your search problems. In fact, if you&#39;ve never implemented search before it&#39;s the last tool you need. Postgres full text search is all you need. The most important thing in search is to surface relevant results and no one can quantify relevancy. It&#39;s as unquantifiable as it gets in technology. You need to understand what results are relevant for your users and find a metric that would work to rank accordingly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So does this functional SQL just get &#34;transpiled&#34; into analytical SQL? If so, where does &#34;transpilation&#34; occur, in the client, intercepted before hitting the query engine, etc? Or has the query engine itself been modified to handle functional SQL?If the query engine itself has been modified, are there any performance gains or losses?This is a pretty interesting and compelling idea. I do wonder if the functional SQL approach might entice developers to write very bad/expensive/ineffective queries. Then again, nothing is stopping developers from doing the same with analytical SQL."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is immediately useful. The number of awkwardly nested subqueries that I write because I don&#39;t have this kind of functionality in BigQuery is a huge bummer.I am curious, how many Haskell programmers do you all have? And more seriously, do you have any plans to help provide this functionality to non-Postgres SQLs, or at least help those trying to take inspiration from it?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Database researcher here.This is really cool! I wonder what was the initial drive for this new feature?Is this meant to be a &#34;short-cut&#34; to express complicated SQL queries, or is this meant to adding new semantics beyond SQL? While I like the idea of custom data types with dataflow-like syntax, implementing a whole new query processing engine for the new data type seems like a lot of engineering work. Also you now have to handle many edge cases such as very very large time series -- I wonder if you have efficient lookup mechanisms on timevectors yet, and various timestamp and value types. If all these new syntax can actually be expressed using SQL, however complex, I think a &#34;lazier&#34; approach is to write a &#34;translator&#34; that rewrites the new syntax into good old SQLs or add a translator at planning stage. This way you can take advantage of Postgres&#39; optimizer and let it do the rest of heavy lifting.Kusto has a similar data type &#34;series&#34; that is also created from aggregating over some columns (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/q...)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"An especially novel aspect of this lawsuit, quoting the press release:&gt; This approach makes it the first legal case that focuses on the rights of individual consumers as third-party beneficiaries of the GPL.&gt; “That’s what makes this litigation unique and historic in terms of defending consumer rights,” says Karen M. Sandler, the organization’s executive director.In the past, GPL enforcement has been a cause of action brought by the copyright holder. This suit is on behalf of users, as beneficiaries of the GPL. If this suit is successful, it&#39;ll no longer be necessary to prove sufficient standing as a copyright holder of GPLed code in order to enforce the license; it&#39;ll suffice to show that you&#39;re a user who wishes to make use of the rights provided under the license."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This looks to be a major change in the legal strategy behind GPL. In the past the focus has been on copyright claims by copyright holders, but as recent cases has shown in Germany and France, those has faced some rather strange setbacks. Germany don&#39;t seem to want to recognize copyright holders that only contributed a part of a larger work, which is basically all copyright holders for larger FOSS projects. In France they seems to define GPL as being under contract law and not under copyright law.In this new case, the SFC is arguing a case in the context of third-party beneficiary which is under contract law and not copyright law. It seems like a bit of an long-shot, but if won it could mean a major change in interpreting GPL as a contract rather than a copyright license. I would guess that it also would change their strategy in other countries if won."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Long time lurker here, first time poster. I got pulled into the rabbit hole of building guitars at home during the covid lockdowns. My first build used traditional &#34;tonewoods&#34; (mahogany, ebony, rosewood etc.) and while purchasing materials for my second build, I stumbled upon bamboo boards on a German wood retailed shop.Compared the properties to the wood I wanted to use for parts of it (mainly the core/neck and fretboard) and decided to go for it.So the second build [1] is 40ish % bamboo with purpleheart veneers in between layers of bamboo and purpleheart/olive for the body. Next build will be around 80% bamboo. Trying to source some strand woven bamboo boards to try them out as fretboards as well, but for a part time builder like me, getting such small quantities of bamboo boards is rather hard.But yeah, fascinating material even outside of construction use. The boards I used for the guitar builds were nice to work with, easy to sand and finish (using wipe on poly).[1] https://i.imgur.com/fUyxd7n.jpg"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This was interesting in light of an interview I was just listening to yesterday, a CBC podcast [1] talking about the benefits of mass timber (glued wood) for large highrise building construction.There were two guests on, both sounded like environmentalists, with the first one (Michael Green) saying that mass timber was&#34;currently the best tool we have to address climate impact and in the building materials for a large building&#34;while the second guest (John Talberth) was arguing:&#34;The idea that we can cut down our forests and turn them into two by fours and build our way to a stable climate is absurd, and it&#39;s just another one of these false narratives of big timber corporations are using to get us to buy more of their product and continue to subsidise their record profits&#34;,and Talberth advocated Bamboo, mentioning it multiple times as an alternative.  It kind of went back and forth a bit with Mr Green saying&#34;Bamboo, for instance, is not structurally a material that can actually satisfy the demand of three billion people that need a new home because it doesn&#39;t build large buildings&#34;and Mr Talberth saying&#34;Believe it or not, bamboo can actually be put together in the structurally with high structural integrity beams to make taller buildings&#34;It kind of left me wondering who was right... though Mr Green (an architect) sounded like someone with actual experience making buildings, where as the Mr Talberth (an economist) sounded like he might have been doing a bit of ill-informed wishful thinking about Bamboo.Seeing the process here gave me a bit more perspective on the discussion.   Given the labour involved and the fact that you are working with 20mm x 5mm cross-sections of bamboo, I can see how it would be extremely expensive to build a large building out of bamboo, and the $300 euro price tag on a sheet of plywood at the bottom of the page added more confirmation that it&#39;s not going to be a practical replacement for large-scale building.[1] https://www.cbc.ca/radio/thecurrent/the-current-for-oct-20-2..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Really neat article, love things like this on HN. I thought this was really interesting:&gt; A bamboo stem reaches its maximum height in just a few months and shall not grow taller or thicker over time. In the following 4 years the fibers will &#34;lignify&#34; and get their extraordinary mechanical properties in terms of hardness, strength, density.That seems pretty fascinating to me. Are there any other plants/trees that grow like that? I mean, from my naive knowledge, trees go wider with a new ring every year."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This has happened to me frequently at my current company. I get pulled into a meeting about something that I have no context on because it touches my area of expertise, and the discussions have apparently been stalling out.I brace myself to be the idiot. I&#39;m going to waste everyone&#39;s time asking questions that everyone knows the answer to, and I just got looped in, so everyone&#39;s going to feel like they need to walk through all the super-obvious stuff to satisfy the one guy who didn&#39;t do his homework.So I start asking questions, and slowly begin to realize that nobody in the room has any idea what they are talking about. That there are fundamental misunderstandings and misconceptions about existing systems. And, naturally, it turns out that the questions I have are questions that other people have.This has happened to me so often now that you would think the sinking feeling I get before I brace myself to look stupid would go away, but it never does."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I was younger, I often met people who seemed kind of dim to me, at first, and later found the majority of them to be orders of magnitude brighter than me.
It was not hard to connect the dots, the reason they were so much brighter was (in part) exactly because of what made them initially seem dim.. They asked questions, honestly. Not the showoff kind of question you ask to show how much you know, but real, honest questions that not only showed how little they knew, but importantly, allowed them to actually learn and understand, rather than just nod and not get it.My intuition has changed from this, I find it that most times, when someone shows genuine interest and asks honest, revealing questions about some new topic, they often excel at many other things (and will likely on the new topic as well).I&#39;m adapting this myself, being honest, asking honestly, and sometimes looking really stupid (because, in that context, I am!), and I appreciate greatly both the wealth of information that allows me to access, and that almost anybody worth their salt recognizes this trait as well.Failing an interview due to looking stupid is probably a blessing in disguise, you don&#39;t want to be hired by people who can&#39;t see this, and you don&#39;t want to work next to people who&#39;s just pretending to understand, not learning because they can&#39;t afford to look stupid when they are (and thus stay stupid, and be much more inclined to try to pass blame to someone else, like you, who look stupid)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One way to prove that he truly doesn&#39;t mind looking stupid would be to list times when he risked looking stupid... and it turns out he actually was.It&#39;s happened to all of us though we dont like to admit it.I&#39;m sure it&#39;s happened to him too  and I looked but I didn&#39;t see any of those examples listed.Giving only examples of when people thought he was dumb and it turned out he wasn&#39;t... that&#39;s kind of just a roundabout way of humblebragging that you&#39;re an unrecognized genius.Sadly I think this undermines the point of the article which otherwise makes a good point."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The thing that burns out web developer is web development. The constant shift of technologies (just for the sake of it) and the nerfed (to oblivion) environment is hell. As a web developer, after you learn the basics (~5 years)  there is no feeling of where the &#34;up&#34; direction is. Everything feels like sidesteps. There is no feeling of permanence to your knowledge, unlike a lawyer or a doctor. The knowledge feels like water pouring into a full container - as much of it goes out, as it goes in.Switched to embedded systems 7 years ago to avoid the burnout. It is better, in my opinion. Funny enough, there is a natural barrier to entry that keeps most programmers away - You have to understand how computers work, how operating systems work and you have to be able to code in C/assembly. I have a lot of fun and actually picked up electronics as a hobby, which will help me better myself professionally. I think there is enough here to keep me entertained until I retire."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; 64. DRY (don’t repeat yourself) is a luxury for when you have a coherent theory in your mind of the app’s code.&gt; It’s for when you have that theory contained in a worldview in your mind that helps you quickly test out decisions and plans against that theory.&gt; Until then, you should repeat yourself. Seeing your code repeat itself – when rhyming phrases start to pop up throughout – is a vital tool for building a theory about your app.Wow, this is the best explanation of how to apply DRY that I&#39;ve ever heard."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice read. I&#39;ve been doing web dev for 15 years. What has got me burnt out now:-Spend most of my time dealing with tooling issues.-Increasingly complex demands. Even the simplest problems now seems to be multi layered with dozens of edge cases to be accounted for. It&#39;s seemingly impossible to get anything right. You can spend hours testing a responsive design on every browser, every viewport - send it to the client and you&#39;ll get after 5 minutes a list of 50 issues, half of them totally asinine.-Lack of respect/authority/autonomy. After 15 years I&#39;m considered a subordinate to a PM with 6 months experience and zero technical knowledge. This one can be improved a little by working remotely I think. But it just comes down to how management view or value different roles. We are a liability to them, something to be managed, coerced and controlled.-Oversaturated market, learntocode, let&#39;s be honest and say for 95% of companies, web devs are a commodity. I don&#39;t have an issue with people who are excited and want to learn coding, but the reality is the job market is over stuffed.-Leetcode interviews. I just don&#39;t have the energy, desire and sometimes specific knowledge to deal with these interviews. Its a straight no from me now, if i get contacted by a recruiter requesting I do one of these.I can see clearly that other people in non technical fields are getting paid better or the same as me and dealing with far far less work and far less stress.It&#39;s like there are two type of work category: &#34;reviewers&#34; and &#34;implementers&#34;. Reviewers are the stakeholders, they make all the demands and do none (or very little/superficial) of the actual work. Implementers, well we are the ones who do the heavy lifting and deal with all the real problems."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I feel pg’s point is similar to musicians. As an example, Glenn Gould was a classical pianist and renowned Bach interpreter. He had awesome technical ability at the piano, and a fantastic memory. But lots of incredible pianists have these abilities. Go to any university or observe any competition and you’ll plainly see awesome talent. These qualities are analogous to “being smart”.However, what set Gould apart from his colleagues was his innovative and iconoclastic interpretations of well-known works with “standard” prescriptions. He had fundamentally different, but wholly consistent, ideas about musical interpretation, recording technology, presentation of music to audiences, and so on. He’s remembered as a pianist not because his fingers were quick and sensitive, but instead because he pushed boundaries in completely original ways.Leonard Bernstein—a noted conductor and pianist—quips about this when he conducted the Brahms Concerto in D minor, with Gould at the piano [1]. I recommend listening but I’ll copy his words (from [2]) for posterity.&gt; Don&#39;t be frightened. Mr. Gould is here. He will appear in a moment. I&#39;m not, um, as you know, in the habit of speaking on any concert except the Thursday night previews, but a curious situation has arisen, which merits, I think, a word or two. You are about to hear a rather, shall we say, unorthodox performance of the Brahms D Minor Concerto, a performance distinctly different from any I&#39;ve ever heard, or even dreamt of for that matter, in its remarkably broad tempi and its frequent departures from Brahms&#39; dynamic indications. I cannot say I am in total agreement with Mr. Gould&#39;s conception and this raises the interesting question: &#34;What am I doing conducting it?&#34; I&#39;m conducting it because Mr. Gould is so valid and serious an artist that I must take seriously anything he conceives in good faith and his conception is interesting enough so that I feel you should hear it, too.&gt; But the age old question still remains: &#34;In a concerto, who is the boss; the soloist or the conductor?&#34; The answer is, of course, sometimes one, sometimes the other, depending on the people involved. But almost always, the two manage to get together by persuasion or charm or even threats to achieve a unified performance. I have only once before in my life had to submit to a soloist&#39;s wholly new and incompatible concept and that was the last time I accompanied Mr. Gould. (The audience roared with laughter at this.) But, but this time the discrepancies between our views are so great that I feel I must make this small disclaimer. Then why, to repeat the question, am I conducting it? Why do I not make a minor scandal — get a substitute soloist, or let an assistant conduct? Because I am fascinated, glad to have the chance for a new look at this much-played work; Because, what&#39;s more, there are moments in Mr. Gould&#39;s performance that emerge with astonishing freshness and conviction. Thirdly, because we can all learn something from this extraordinary artist, who is a thinking performer, and finally because there is in music what Dimitri Mitropoulos used to call &#34;the sportive element&#34;, that factor of curiosity, adventure, experiment, and I can assure you that it has been an adventure this week collaborating with Mr. Gould on this Brahms concerto and it&#39;s in this spirit of adventure that we now present it to you.Because some took this as an attack on Gould, Bernstein followed up with the remark:&gt; Any discovery of Glenn&#39;s was welcomed by me because I worshiped the way he played: I admired his intellectual approach, his &#34;guts&#34; approach, his complete dedication to whatever he was doing.Anyway, it’s an interesting parallel in the arts world. Jacob Collier is a musician of today that has similar qualities of “being smart with good ideas”.[1] https://youtu.be/SvWPM783TOE[2] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Philharmonic_concer..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another way to frame this topic: intelligence doesn&#39;t always lead to impact, and impact is what matters.Example: I met a ton of trivia &#34;nerds&#34; through a friend a few years ago. They had all met at an Ivy League college, they were clearly &#34;smart&#34; in that they knew a lot of information and could follow a logical argument but somehow none of them were able to use their smarts for anything practical. They had jobs you didn&#39;t need to be that smart for, and their personal lives were sort of messy. I didn&#39;t really know what to make it them at the time, now I think they had the &#34;smarts&#34; but they didn&#39;t have the &#34;drive&#34; so their brains sort of did them no good.Another example: Plenty of people are constantly frustrated that they are misunderstood. &#34;I am so smart but I can&#39;t get anything done around here because everyone&#39;s an idiot.&#34; Some people go through their whole life believing this. Luckily I had a job that disabused me of this and taught me to communicate my ideas clearly and persuasively to others. But without that, without the ability to persuade people of your ideas, you might as well not have them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hamming (of Hamming codes) has a famous Bell Labs talk &#34;You and Your Research&#34;, describing how to have a large impact. It covers a lot of the same ground, but in more detail:https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.htmlA few points from it:You&#39;ve got to work on important problems.How about having lots of `brains?&#39; It sounds good. But great work is something else than mere brains.The people who do great work with less ability but who are committed to it, get more done that those who have great skill and dabble in it.The prepared mind sooner or later finds something important and does it. So yes, it is luck. The particular thing you do is luck, but that you do something is not.One of the characteristics you see, and many people have it including great scientists, is that usually when they were young they had independent thoughts and had the courage to pursue them."</p>

Now that I&#39;ve moved to Germany, I know what it feels like not to have to file every year (I still have to for the US but it&#39;s trivial now due to FIEC).There&#39;s nobody hounding you here, no stress regarding your taxes unless you&#39;re filing for a return or have extenuating circumstances, and even then there&#39;s a government-provided online portal for direct communication with the Finanzamt (finance department).Every American should be upset with Intuit."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Going to paraphrase a quote from a podcast that stuck with me.&gt; What (the left) needs to do is clear out rents. Not just housing rents, but rent seekers. The economy is riddled through with people who do nothing, but get paid because structurally that’s who gets paid.Intuit is one of those companies. They produce a few real products, QuickBooks for businesses and Mint, but overwhelmingly their money comes from the fact that they charge rent on filling your taxes. They’re a parasite on our society.Fortunately the podcaster wasn’t talking about the US; their country was worse off than America in this area by far. But unfortunately it seems like we’re on the same glide slope if we don’t do something about it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hate wasting at least a day if not more of my life every year filing. As time goes on and i have more assets the time to file goes up as well and gathering all the required documents with every bank having different timelines is a nightmare.But what can I do about it? I would imagine if it went to a vote overwhelmingly people would say no I don’t want to file like this every year. But here we are and honestly I don’t have much energy left these days to be mad about anything as it’s wearing on my health."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I served in the Georgia legislature during a portion of a similar story. Without a doubt, the calculations throughout the story were political not technical.In the Georgia version, the technical details of the exposed information in the Secretary of State&#39;s office were facepalmingly simple (misconfigured apache directives) yet the story dragged on politically for years.Quickly, a hired security researcher for a corporate client found all registered voters info and instructional pdfs with credentials for the elections system publicly indexed by google. They responsibly disclosed. The apache configuration was updated to &#34;use encryption&#34; (moved from http to https) but still left the info indexed by google over https vs. http.    Eventually, this information became public.The state attempted to prosecute the security researcher but found no state statutes they could use. They then used this incident as a base to create a bill to criminalize the security researcher&#39;s actions.As a state rep, I worked very hard to push back on a bad bill spawned by the incident that would&#39;ve criminalized responsible disclosure.Only due to bi-partisan efforts from technically versed people were we able to get the Governor at the time to veto the bill.https://www.snopes.com/ap/2017/06/15/researcher-finds-georgi...https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/comp..."</p>

Comes off as unnecessarily inflammatory to me I suppose.Having said that, this situation in particular really tests my willingness to assume good faith on the part of the governor and his body of advisors. Is he legitimately without a single person close to him that could inform him of how misguided this line of aggression is, and how fortunate it was that the individual who identified the security problem acted in such a helpful manner? On top of that he assigned the Missouri State Highway Patrol to investigate, because given his perceived severity of the situation that&#39;s the best agency at his disposal? It all just seems bananas.I try not to assume that totally inane actions from elected officials are exclusively the result of political calculus, and I suppose I don&#39;t have any evidence to assume that&#39;s the case here either. But I&#39;m at a loss as to how this situation could blossom into something so ridiculous."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is pretty good overview. One fun tricks we would regularly do was move all the background audio off the disk and into GPU ram. We&#39;d stream just enough that we wouldn&#39;t saturate the bus but could get back 20-30mb of system memory.There was also that time we ran out of open file handles ahead of key demo at one of the tradeshows. I remember rewriting the whole audio streaming subsystem to piggyback on the seekfree texture loading system so that we could use the that single big file as a source for both streaming texture and audio data. Did that in 24 hours less than 2 days ahead of the show, fun times.[Edit]Another fun thing from that era was that almost no one other than the in-house Sony Studios used the SPUs well. X360 came out just ahead and had tooling that was miles ahead(PIX!) so everyone started from the X360. None of the workloads we&#39;re vectorized so it was absolutely brutal to get them to fit into the SPUs. For a long time a good chunk of that silicon was just idle. If you did start from the PS3 though because of the vectorized workloads you had insane cache coeheranch and usually ran better on the X360/PC as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s worth saying that the whole site is an absolute gold mine of fantastic information about console architectures over the ages, and I particularly like the way he always highlights how the DRM has been broken. It&#39;s really fascinating to see the convergent and occasionally divergent evolution that goes on in these machines, speaking to, but slightly independent from, the technological trends of their time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Millions of lives and $Ts in health damage has been done and continues to be done by lead[0].  And it was largely avoidable because the dangers were known.99 years ago the League of Nations signed a treaty banning indoor leaded paint.  The US, of course, declined to join and it took another 50 years before it took action.  Concerns were raised about leaded gasoline, industry steamrolled the science.And it was just a couple of months ago that the final country (Algeria) stopped producing leaded consumer road fuel.For a good history seehttps://www.thenation.com/article/archive/secret-history-lea...[0] An Update on Childhood Lead Poisoning https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5645046/As many as 500,000 US children (2.5%) under 6 years have BLLs ≥5 µg/dL. Each lead-exposed child costs an estimated $5600 in medical and special educational services.7 Lead exposure-related cognitive impairments cost an estimated $50.9 billion annually in lost US economic productivity.6"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m eagerly awaiting the Cargo feature &#34;named profiles&#34;[1]. It&#39;s already merged, but not yet announced to be planned for any specific Cargo version. It will allow users to create custom profiles with different build parameters from the standard ones, so you can e.g. create a &#34;profiling&#34; profile which is based on the &#34;release&#34; profile, so that it has all the nice optimizations, but with debug information included, so that it works well with cargo-flamegraph:  [profile.profiling]
  inherits = &#34;release&#34;
  debug = true

[1]: &lt;https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9943&gt;And then there&#39;s the less fireworky, but still appreciated, Iterator::map_while[2], which is going to be in Rust 1.57.[2]: &lt;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/89086&gt;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love the concept of editions.  I haven&#39;t anything like it in other languages.  Having the ability to have one project made up of crates of many different editions is brilliant. It makes breaking language changes that would otherwise be a nonstarter become minor and easy to manage.  Love it"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m so excited to finally have disjoint captures in closures; many papercuts on that one when I worked heavily with Amethyst a while back as there were a few closure-based APIs.Thanks to all the contributors for getting us to the 2021 edition!"</p>
