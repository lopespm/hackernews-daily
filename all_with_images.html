								<p class="story__comment_others">"Suppose I go off and make a search engine, with my own algorithm for ranking search results.  At first it works great.  And then five years later, I find that, by a quirk in my algorithm, I find that a new site has risen to the top of all my results.  This new site was created as a prank, and it contains authoritative-sounding but incorrect answers to common questions.  The results returned are still relevant to my users, but they are now factually incorrect.Should I simply accept that this site is the correct top result for my users&#39; queries, since it has been ranked by my unbiased algorithm?  Or should I decide to put my finger on the scale, and redesign my algorithm (possibly by simply reweighting results from this particular site) to change the rankings?Does the answer change if the site is not a prank site, but is propoganda?  Or an earnest-but-incorrect flat earther?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Thank you to this community for all the support through the years! We&#39;re spending a lot of our time on basic research and sensing, and we have a few small updates planned for f.lux, too. The main challenge as we learn more about the biology is to keep things simple enough--it&#39;s easy to make things complicated, and it&#39;s pretty hard (for me) to distill them to something that makes sense to most people.Also, if you care about how your eyes and circadian system work, don&#39;t forget about all the light from outside your screen too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While it’s not strictly necessary anymore, because most OS’s have at least a basic feature that mimics flux built in now, I feel like we owe the devs a huge debt for forcing the conversation about the toll our ultra high brightness screens have on our sleep patterns and quality and our eyes.Plus, it’s a great example of a really high quality piece of software developed with a lot of care and a huge long term commitment."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It is important to recognize that Stripe is largely selling well-made shovels for the gold rush here. They have a history of diving more deeply into this market [1] and withdrawing from it before [2], so this is just Take 2. This time around, they are not themselves buying Cube Thingies or similar and don&#39;t have any exposure to the volatile world of ETH or other coins.I think there will be decent transfer of money from venture-funded NFT startups to Stripe for the next few years, followed by a dip in the market when the startups discover that selling digital art is less of a viable market than they realize.I am personally skeptical about the end market, but Stripe seem well-insulated from the risks. I&#39;m curious what people who are bullish on this think though – what might I be missing about the digital art market? I think paying 12 million pounds for a Renoir is bananas too, but people certainly do it [3]. I just expect digital stuff to be more volatile because it&#39;s hard to communicate that combination of artisanship and rarity.On the topic of well-made shovels, I highly recommend the Voile Telepro in HN Orange [4] as a portable snow shovel to keep in your car if you live in a snowy climate. They will probably be on sale in spring and summer.----------------------------------------[1] https://web.archive.org/web/20150516061807/https://stripe.co...[2] https://stripe.com/blog/ending-bitcoin-support[3] https://www.christies.com/en/lot/lot-pierre-auguste-renoir-1...[4] https://snowmetrics.com/shop/voile-shovel/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I feel like they missed the primary point which is that E2E encryption is the primary thing protecting everyone from hackers/criminals/other-governments. Without it the criminals WILL have access to your systems and data and then you can basically say goodbye to anything being valuable at all.Locking your door at night is a poor metaphor. A criminal can literally infiltrate and search through every unsecured computer connected to the internet in a matter of minutes and using almost no resources and with little risk. This drastically diverges from physical assets.Making encryption illegal will ensure that only criminals use it, thus making only criminals safe online."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have said this before: this is a losing battle for individuals striving to protect the freedom, if we just try to do it individually. People bringing this get paid to do this during office time (and maybe after office time too by lobbyists) so they will keep at this; my protests require me to do it by taking time out of the limited time I have left after office.Fight fire with fire, fund EFF so that we have our own well stocked army. To be clear, I&#39;m not trivialising or belittling the impact of individual effort, just that it takes too much to be sustainable. And yes, individual and organized efforts are not mutually exclusive."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Yet as today’s letter points out, subsequent investigations by The Wall Street Journal, Reuters, and The Markup revealed that not only did Amazon employees working on private-label items have access to third-party data, but they routinely used it, even discussing it openly in meetings. “Amazon employees regularly violated the policy—and senior officials knew it.”That&#39;s pretty incredible. I&#39;m curious what kind of data this is; knowing the nature of the data would help us understand how platform operators can abuse their position."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Somewhat related: any time a business/person has access to data about a customer or their business, they&#39;re in a position of power and are able to use that data against the customer.When you apply to rent a house, you&#39;re required to provide pay stubs and salary information.  The landlord can (does?) use this to know how much they can jack up your rent next lease term (my landlord raised our rent $800/month in January).Same with insurance salespeople, car salespeople, etc.  Everyone who gets access to your financial data can use it against you.There should be a 3rd party involved -- they take your documentation and then report to the landlord/salesperson/etc. a simple &#34;is the person qualified?&#34; Yes or No.  And then permanently destroy said documentation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"For anyone who hasn&#39;t read it, Endurance: Shackleton&#39;s Incredible Voyage, by Alfred Lansing is a well-written account of the expedition story."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember watching a TV documentary about the Endurance expedition 10 years ago and being flabbergasted.First, the Endurance is trapped by ice for half a year. Then she is crushed by the ice, and the crew camps on the ice. Then they start a 500 km march, over the ice, carrying the lifeboats, to reach an island. After over half a year (!), they finally decide to start a 160 km journey across the open sea in the three lifeboats. The crew of 27 manages to reach Elephant Island after 5 days on the open sea in wet clothes at temperatures below -20 degrees. The island is completely uninhabited and there is little hope to ever be rescued from there, so they build a new boat out of the three lifeboats, and Shackleton and five other men set out for a 1,300 km journey to South Georgia, which they know has a small whaling station. Here is an image of the boat [0]. This journey itself has is its own Wikipedia article [1] and is considered one of the greatest boat journeys ever accomplished. The rest of the crew is left behind on Elephant Island. Against all odds, they actually reach South Georgia after 17 days in extremely bad conditions. However, they are on the wrong side of the island. So Shackleton decides to cross the island by foot, with 2 others. It&#39;s a 40 km journey across a mountain range nearly 3,000 meters high [2]. They have no map and improvise their route. In what was actually the first confirmed crossing of South Georgia, they reach the whaling station after walking, without stop, day and night, for nearly 2 days. Just imagine being placed at that whaling station, at the end of the world, and suddenly seeing these 3 half-dead men come out of the mountains. They pick up the remaining crew on the other end of the island by boat. Then, Shackleton immediately tries to rescue the rest of his crew which is still 1,300 km back on Elephant Island (he has no idea whether they are still alive). This takes another 3 months and multiple ships. Only the fourth attempt is successful. But in September 1916, over 1.5 years after the Endurance was trapped in ice, Shackleton has saved his entire crew. Everybody survived.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyage_of_the_James_Caird#/med...[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyage_of_the_James_Caird[2] https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/Panorama..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This stuff has been a nightmare for us for a long time. We have to scan pdf417 barcodes from physical identification as part of our offering.Recently, we stumbled upon some cheap USB keyboard emulator 2d scanners that can pick these up very reliably. For our product/customers, this is a viable path. We have tested probably 30 different webcams by this point.  The only 2 that are as reliable as the handheld CCD scanner are the iPad and my Canon DSLR tethered to my PC in automatic mode with a macro lens.Resolution is a factor, but so is frame rate and environment. You have to consider the full UX stack. Someone is required to physically position the barcode in a particular way with certain lighting constraints, etc. With a handheld CCD scanner, you get a laser guide for precisely what distance to go for, and an ergonomic experience that is much more conducive to successful scans. Most offer on board illumination, so even in a pitch black room you will get a successful scan."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I like this announcement, because it means that there&#39;s a manufacturing line for proper HiDPI [1] displays running in some LG factory somewhere that third party manufactures like LG/Dell/Iiyama can hopefully use to give us some fresh good-looking 27&#34; 5K desktop monitors. It boggles my mind how little attention very high pixel density displays have been getting from PC display manufacturers. I would also be first in line for a PC monitor that uses the M1 iMac display, but I suppose nobody sees a market for higher end 24&#34; monitors anymore.[1]: HiDPI displays that work correctly with macOS&#39; and Linux desktop&#39;s naive HiDPI implementation, that requires 2x scaling for good results.Nobody in 2022 will sell you a monitor that does that, except for Apple&#39;s expensive stuff that is hard to use with regular PCs and one over the top Dell display. I wish everyone did what ChromeOS or modern Windows apps do. I need that extremely crisp font rendering in my life."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Awesome to see them finally putting out almost consumer friendly pricing displays. Few things I&#39;m disappointed about though:- 60hz. For this price point I&#39;d expect higher.- Thunderbolt 3. Interesting that they didn&#39;t bump to 4, given the Mac Studio is Thunderbolt 4. This means you wont be able to daisy chain the displays.- Lack of size options. Would love to see more variety here. After moving to an ultrawide format, I can&#39;t see myself moving back to standard format monitors from a productivity standpoint.Overall though excited for this and keen to see how it&#39;ll evolve. It&#39;ll be a miss for me this cycle but keen to see their future releases of their monitor line."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s kind of ridiculous how slow the progress in screen resolutions has been. It&#39;s disappointing that Apple is only going for 5k, not 8k; they&#39;re well positioned to fix the ecosystem and bring high-resolution large displays to everyone, if only they tried.I&#39;m finally sitting in front of an 8k 65&#34; screen. This gives me a nice combination of decent picel density in the center and lots of peripheral vision in which to put secondary windows, plus I can sit across the room and watch a movie on it. But every component of the ecosystem introduced problems and friction.I have an M1 Macbook Pro on the same desk. The Macbook can&#39;t drive the 8k TV. I have a separate desktop running Windows with an nVidia GPU for that. Every component of the video ecosystem has given me friction in getting to 8k. I had to swap my $1k nVidia GPU for a different $1k nVidia GPU that wasn&#39;t any faster, to get HDMI 2.1 support. Had to use special HDMI cables, because cables that aren&#39;t specially marked as HDMI2.1 compatible don&#39;t have enough bandwidth. And then the display itself has a ridiculous postprocessing bug (I wrote about it at https://www.rtings.com/tv/discussions/IyO2wLLsNnJCMT-_/firmw...) which makes me think the firmware engineers didn&#39;t have a working 8k source to test with."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wow, I have so many questions. First, I really respect people acting on conviction. Anyway, I have lots of questions (all completely uninformed) so feel free to ignore any of them, haha.1) Where are you in the development process? Have your scaffolds been used to successfully grow a piece of edible meat?2) When do you think the value of cultivated meat will grow to a point to make the industry self-sustaining? Or even just for it to become a viable option for restaurants/consumers?3) How is flavour added in the process? Since diet has so much impact on flavour, how can you experiment with flavour while growing it in lab? I understand this is specific to another step in the process, so if you can&#39;t answer, no worries.4) When you say scaffolding, my mind immediately goes to a very visual/physically defined place. I&#39;m picturing like a Ribeye Exoskeleton. What level of control over the sculpting of the end product do you have, or does the scaffolding function on a very general growth support level that results in the development of an end product that is then sculpted by the meat-maker?5) Anne-Sophie, have you tried any lab grown meat?6) How far away are we from seeing &#34;at-home&#34; kits for meat growing? I&#39;m picturing a world where a restaurant has their meat-printer going all the time, experimenting with different flavours and textures for the next menu!7) Does this have any non-edible use cases? Can this process be applied to growing functional muscle/tissue, not just edible muscle/tissue?Thanks! Again, feel free to pick and choose."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just wanted to say this is probably the best launch HN description I’ve ever seen, and I’ve been here for the better part of the decade. Thank you for going into the real meat (ahem) of it and not being scared of writing at length.Your cause, if successful, will hopefully indirectly result in orders of magnitude reduction in total animal suffering, so best of luck and godspeed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From an environmental and cost perspective, how do you see this compete with plant-based meat in the short-term and long-term?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I own the house I currently live in because of a script I wrote.We had been looking for a new build for some time and had settled on a development and specific house we wanted to buy, but it was still months away from being released. We were told they released houses in person first, then listed them online later that day, but I was bored and wanted to see when new houses were listed, so I wrote a scraper to alert me whenever a new house became available.One day, we got a call from the property developer telling us the house we were interested in would be available in person from 10am the next day. Because we wanted to be certain to get it, we appeared at 8am, only to find that 3 other people were already waiting. Houses are released in batches of 2 or 3, so whilst we weren&#39;t hopeful, we joined the queue and waited.At 9am, while waiting in line, I got an alert telling me that the house had been released online, so I open their website on my phone and paid the deposit.At 10am, when the sales office opened, all hell broke loose as the person first in line (waiting since 5am...) discovered the house they wanted had already been reserved online. I&#39;d effectively stolen his house. It was awkward to say the least as all of us were crammed into a tiny portacabin while this unfolded.In truth, I felt awful for depriving him of the house he and his family wanted, but relieved that we had reserved the house we wanted after a 5 month wait. A few weeks later the developer got in touch to say that they had changed their policy nationwide and would only be releasing houses online in the future because of &#34;the incident&#34;...Whilst I wasn&#39;t willing to give up our reservation, I worked with the person who had wanted our house so that they were alerted whenever a similar house in the same development became available. He got one, there&#39;s no hard feelings, and him and his family are now my next door neighbours."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wrote a TI-83 program (TI Basic) for a geometry course in high school. About a month prior to the feared final exam, I combed through all of our coursework to catalogue all of the calculations needed then wrote a program that would solve for any query (length of side, angles, etc.) based on the shape and input data.I read the operators guide to the device cover-to-cover and found a way to store the program such that the teacher&#39;s method of &#34;clearing&#34; the device would not remove my program.On the day of the test I realized I had accidentally taught myself geometry, as I didn&#39;t need the calculator at all and could do the calculations in my head. I did, however, use the TI-83 to verify my answers before handing in the test. According to my teacher I not only had a perfect score but did so in record time, and suspiciously so did my two best friends.Nothing ever came of it, but I enjoy the fact that I accidentally learned a course to such proficiency by trying to cheat."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One I did when I was much younger was after a trip to a Cracker Barrel restaurant.  They have these golf tee peg games (triangle shaped board with holes and golf tees inserted).  There are rules for doing jumps and removing pegs, with the goal of getting down to 1 peg remaining.So I went home, fired up basica on my PCjr, and wrote a brute-force solver for it.  Turns out there something like tens of thousands of possible solutions.Then it became a challenge, to filter out duplicates (each solution appears 3 times if you apply it to the board with each 120 degree rotation, plus you have mirrors of these, etc).  Was an amazing feeling for a youngster getting into computers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I worked at AT&amp;T in the late 1990s on an early music sales (not streaming) service called a2b Music. It sounds ridiculous now (why would AT&amp;T think they could succeed in consumer-facing music sales!) but at the time they were a co-owner of the AAC patents and wanted to commercialize them. They also had lots of bandwidth and thought this made sense.Being &#34;responsible&#34; folks (and also having no choice in the matter) AT&amp;T bent over backward to accommodate the labels. Half the product was proprietary DRM that made everything constantly unusable. Despite this, the labels still strangled us by limiting what we could sell. Apple quite correctly ignored all of this and solved the problem by first launching the iPod, waiting until it had critical mass (much of which involved tons of unpaid MP3 downloading) and then launching the iTunes Store in 2003 when they had an installed base full of piracy - and the major labels had no choice but to join on their terms. (Obviously I pity the small labels who got screwed in the dynamic.)I think about this a lot when people complain about cryptocurrency or Uber/Lyft evading regulations or destroying legacy businesses. Often this kind of behavior is bad, often the little guy gets crushed. But at the end of the day, legacy businesses really are poison and much of the awfulness could be avoided if they weren&#39;t trying to hold on to things so tightly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was also once dissed by Steve Jobs at a keynote!Back when widgets first came out for OS X I was in college and was beginning to learn programming. I was sill very bad, but these widgets interested me because they were essentially just little HTML/CSS/JS webpages. I looked around and saw there was no widget for CNN news.CNN had RSS feeds of their news, I found some other widget that displayed an RSS feed and basically just plugged this new data source in and it worked! Next I just restyled it to look like it the CNN website which at the time was light blue and pretty ugly, but I made this widget to match.I released it, and it got some downloads! Months later at the WWDC keynote, I was watching live and I saw Steve sit down at the demo computer and show off some widgets on the big screen. The CNN widget I made was there on screen at the keynote! I didn&#39;t believe it at first, I was in shock. Next though, when he showed my widget his only comment was that &#34;it&#39;s not as nice looking as [some other news widget] but it gets the job done.&#34;Ouch! Not only was Steve Jobs personally aware of a piece of software I (kind of) wrote but he demoed it at WWDC! But he also said it looked pretty bad... And he was right, it did.Shortly after this I restyled the widget to look nice on its own, regardless of what the CNN website actually looked like. While this stung, it was a good design lesson to learn. Thanks Steve!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I flew home that night, posted my meeting notes on my website, emailed all of my clients to announce the news, and went to sleep.&gt;When I woke, I had furious emails and voicemails from my contact at Apple.&gt;“What the hell are you doing? That meeting was confidential! Take those notes off your site immediately! Our legal department is furious!”Wait, who the hell posts meeting notes on their website (and also emails all their clients without a written confirmation at the said meeting)? I would assume any meeting you&#39;d have with a client/potential would be assumed to be confidential. I felt this particular move was very unprofessional on the OP&#39;s part."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"You all joke that this doesn’t happen in practice, but something like this literally just bit me and it took me a few too many minutes to figure out what was going on.I use a bash script as my BROWSER which calls another bash script to launch or communicate with my browser that I run inside a container. The script that my BROWSER script calls has some debug output that it prints to stderr.I use mutt as my email client and urlscan [0] to open URLs inside emails. Urlscan looks at my BROWSER environment variable and thus calls my script to open whatever URL I target. Some time recently, the urlscan author decided to improve the UX by hiding stderr so that it wouldn’t pollute the view, and so attempted to pipe it to `/dev/null`. I guess their original code to do this wasn’t quite correct and it ended up closing the child processes’ stderr.*I generally use `set -e` (errexit) because I want my scripts to fail if any command fails (I consider that after an unhandled failure the script’s behavior is undefined, some other people disagree and say you should never use `set -e` outside of development, but I digress). My BROWSER scripts are no exception.While my scripts handle non-zero returns for most things that can go wrong, I never considered that writing log messages to stdout or stderr might fail. But it did, which caused the script to die before it was able to launch my browser. For a few weeks I wasn’t able to use urlscan to open links. I was too lazy to figure out what was wrong, and when I did it took me a while because I looked into every possibility except this one.Luckily this wasn’t a production app. But I know now it could just as feasibly happen in production, too.I opened an issue[1] and it was fixed very quickly. I love open source!*No disrespect to urlscan, it’s an awesome tool and bugs happen to all of us![0]: https://github.com/firecat53/urlscan[1]: https://github.com/firecat53/urlscan/issues/122"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m disappointed. I expected some obscure edgecase (like “Main is usually a function…” [1]) but instead that’s about scope handling, contract design and responsibility shift.“Hello world” method simply calls an API to a text interface. It uses simple call, to a simple interface that is expected to be ever present. I don’t find any bug there. It won’t work if such interface isn’t available, is blocked or doesn’t exist. It won’t work on my coffee grinder nor on my screwdriver. It won’t work on my Arduino because there is no text interface neither.Of course, one could argue that user might expect you to handle that error. That’s all about contracts and expectation. How should I deal with that? Is the “Hello world” message such important that the highest escalated scenario should be painted on the sky? I can imagine an awkward social game where we throw each other obscure challenges and call it a bug.It’s nitpicking that even such simple code might fail and I get it. It will also fail on OOM, faulty hardware or if number of the processes on the machine hit the limit. Maybe some joker replaced bindings and it went straight to 3D printer which is out of material? _My expectations_ were higher based on the title.Now allow me to excuse myself, I need to write an e-mail to my keyboard manufacturer because it seems like it has a bug which prevents it from working when slightly covered in liquid coffee.[1]: http://jroweboy.github.io/c/asm/2015/01/26/when-is-main-not-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Enjoyable read for sure, but i think the question whether ot not this constitutes a bug or not is open for interpretation.IMHO, it doesn&#39;t.hello.c is written in a way that makes it very clear that the program doesn&#39;t care about error conditions in any way shape or form; the return value of printf is ignored, the output isn&#39;t flushed, the return of flushing isn&#39;t checked, noone looks at errno; ...so anything happening that could go wrong will go unreported, unless its something the OS can see (segfault, permission, etc.)If I expect a program to do something (eg. handle IO errors) that its code says very clearly that it doesn&#39;t, that&#39;s not the programs fault."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Blender is shaping up to be the best open source project I&#39;ve seen in my 20 years of tech, and I&#39;m comparing this with many other large ones I&#39;ve used, like Linux kernel or various distros, FreeBSD, Kubernetes and so on. They do everything so well, even the releases, I think it beats the paid competition now or will soon do in feature parity and ease of use. As of Blender 2.8 the UI is fantastic.This update comes with many geometry node improvements which continue the trend of making Blender the premium non-destructive modelling solution. I&#39;m in particular interested in seeing how 6900 XT and regular M1 (in Mac mini form) will perform under Metal with 3.1 and macOs 12.3. I was a long time Radeon VII user on Mac but before 3.0 the stability and performance was just not there so I&#39;ve moved my Blender experiments to Windows and Nvidia which works spectacularly but I&#39;m not fussed about booting win just for Blender. Sadly I don&#39;t think AMD is bringing HIP for their older, pre-6000 GPUs https://code.blender.org/2021/11/next-level-support-for-amd-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I genuinely think Blender is my single favorite piece of software I&#39;ve ever used, especially the latest few versions. While it&#39;s always been a powerful piece of software, the past 3 or 4 major releases (really everything since 2.8 actually) have just been nonstop UX improvement on top of ridiculous amounts of thoughtfully implemented new features."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The more awesome Blender gets, the more jealous I am that it&#39;s not designed for CAD.I keep wondering if FreeCAD will eventually make these kinds of strides, or if it&#39;s better to try getting Blender to do CAD-likes stuff.  I know there is a bit of CAM-like stuff floating around for Blender.  But I&#39;m always afraid that this will come up short in the long run, due to Blender&#39;s fundamentally mesh-based nature."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Had the same issue with my first startup. 50:50 split, no agreement in place for the eventuality of a founder disagreement or one founder leaving the company. We were able to negotiate an acceptable solution but emotionally it was quite draining and it tarnished a good relationship/friendship. Also, in the end the company was not worth much, so in retrospect much quibble and stress about nothing.I think the problem is that in the eyes of a founder their company is always worth a lot, as they tend to see the potential instead of the status quo. That said trying to leave a company that isn&#39;t profitable while keeping a 50 % stake and offloading the job of getting to profitability to your co-founder is pretty toxic. Asking to retain a small stake depending on the duration of your tenure seems reasonable though. For a bootstrapped company I think a 4-6 year vesting schedule is reasonable, though it highly depends on the situation of the company. Some businesses are still nowhere near profitable or stable after 4 years, so they won&#39;t survive one founder leaving with 50 % of the shares as it will make future investment highly unlikely (most VCs would never touch a company with a 50 % shareholder that has already left) and will destroy the morale of the remaining founders (as they will often think that half of their work will go towards someone who no longer contributes in a meaningful way to the company)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s funny. I read the article and do not arrive at the same obvious/apparent conclusion the auther theirself does about Cassidy&#39;s position being reasonable, merely legal.To me the reasonable thing to do is if you want to get out then get out, sell back your stake. If you want to stay in then stay in, work on the project full time or work out some new plan where all stakeholders agree to switch to day jobs and put this into hobby mode.But if you just want to maintain a stake to collect rent, and demand cash that doesn&#39;t even exist, seriously F that guy. The only reason he&#39;s in the legal right to be this douchy is because they failed to write their &#39;pre-nup&#39; properly, not because he&#39;s actually in the right and his position and expectations are reasonable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"ElementaryOS is leaving a lot of money on the table.The reason is that they have an established user base, and there is an app store, which is very curated.People would be more than willing to pay for apps on that app store.Not so many developers are willing, though. The thing is, to publish on the app store, the source code must be publicly available on for instance, github.If they allowed app developers to sell truly commercial software, ElementaryOS could be a self growing machine, and they could give away the OS for &#34;free&#34; and keep the OS open source.Maybe it&#39;s not as &#34;pure&#34; as what they are doing now, but on the other hand they could reach so many more people if they had more monetary resources."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are plenty of Russians on Youtube commenting under pleas posted by Ukrainians asking them to help stop the war. And there are plenty of videos taken by people on the ground in Ukraine that show what&#39;s going on.Lots of Russians actually believe that the strikes are precision and only aimed at the military targets. There&#39;s a video recorded by a woman in Mykolaiv walking among the rubble and cursing at her Russian relatives for not believing her while her city is literally under shelling.But due to the way Youtube works, the Russian users are not very likely to come across those videos. Ukrainian Youtube users are trying to interact with them by replying with links to the videos.If somebody from Youtube is reading this, I understand that you need to curb spammers who post a lot. But if you could somehow help with this effort, it might actually help change the public opinion in Russia. Maybe figure out a way to let the Ukrainians interact with the Russian commenters without getting shadowbanned?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been thinking about how to get through to more Russian people, and its something I&#39;ve had a lot of success doing with many people that live in an alternate reality, where we cannot even agree on perception.Censorship and speech restrictions aside, many Russians really think this is a peacekeeping mission that has no bloodshed. Adding to frustration of Ukrainian residents calling their own family members in Russia about whats going on, and still get denial in response.One thing I&#39;ve been thinking about doing is... agreeing with them? Call it a &#34;special military operation&#34;, and then tell them it&#39;s not working. The world is reacting to the special military operation. The timing of the special military operation is not in Russia&#39;s favor and its causing more harm than benefit, in both Russia and in Ukraine.The semantics are designed to derail the conversation at the beginning. &#34;Ah we&#39;re being bombed indiscriminately in this war of russian aggression&#34;, the Russian&#39;s immediate reaction is &#34;wait, no that&#39;s CGI, that&#39;s the Ukrainians bombing themselves, its exactly why you need help&#34;, instead just play along! &#34;Everything&#39;s A-OK but you still need ...... to dismantle your leadership for failing to get more allies in this operation or putting it off until more support was achieved.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Linked from Tufte’s article, I found this interesting comment from someone’s experience at Microsoft: [1]&gt; Attempting to have slides serve both as projected visuals and as stand-alone handouts makes for bad visuals and bad documentation. Yet, this is a typical, acceptable approach. PowerPoint (or Keynote) is a tool for displaying visual information, information that helps you tell your story, make your case, or prove your point. PowerPoint is a terrible tool for making written documents, that&#39;s what word processors are for.I think that’s on point for many companies. A lot of the terrible slides you see in meetings are actually intended as documentation after the fact, and few people recognize (or care) that this makes for a terrible presentation.Ironically, I think Powerpoint isn’t such a bad tool for creating handouts. If the intended reader reads the document on their screen instead of printing it, a nice PDF with screen-shaped pages might actually be close to optimal.You just have to be 100% clear whether you’re creating a document or a presentation.[1] http://mamamusings.net/archives/2005/11/19/the_culture_of_th..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another NASA screw-up that they&#39;re trying to pin on the vendor engineers, just like Challenger.The title is not reassuring. Conservatism in engineering is essentially about creating safety margins through conservative estimation. The title is saying we need to be careful because a tile was likely penetrated. Hell, if I remember correctly they were reporting that there was known tile damage on the news before reentry, but that they didn&#39;t know the extent.&#34;NASA felt the engineers didn’t know what would happen but that all data pointed to there not being enough damage to put the lives of the crew in danger.&#34;If you thought they didn&#39;t know, then ask them what they do know! It&#39;s right on the slide that flight conditions are outside of test parameters and that the mass of the projectile was much higher. How the F do you work at NASA and not understand the basic principles of mass, velocity, and energy well enough for that to stand out enough to ask questions or run your own calculations...The reason the slide is laid out the way it is, is because it&#39;s describing the thought process and creates a deductive argument for how they got to their concern. This is a presentation for a briefing for other engineers, not a conference or sales pitch. It&#39;s supposed to be formal and contain the synopsis of technical points. Using projectors for technical briefings predates the use of PowerPoint. I see nothing wrong with the layout in that context.Edit: why downvote without a reply? NASA has a history of blaming vendors when they screw up. This looks like another example to me. The presentation format does not have any issues given the setting and target audience."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The title presumed that the crew could have been rescued if NASA had recognized that reentry was impossible. But that&#39;s far from clear. This article goes into fascinating detail about how difficult it would have been to prepare a rescue mission on time: https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/02/the-audacious-rescue...One huge issue, beyond whether a rescue mission would&#39;ve been possible, is whether it would&#39;ve be ethical. If NASA knew that Columbia was stranded in orbit, then it would be knowingly sending a second crew up on a vehicle with the exact same potential problem, with no time to mitigate it. I&#39;m sure a rescue crew would&#39;ve volunteered despite the risks, but anyway the point is that &#34;the slide that killed seven people&#34; is erasing all of these questions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think the GPU claims are interesting. According to the graph&#39;s footer, the M1 Ultra was compared to an RTX 3090. If the performance/wattage claims are correct, I&#39;m wondering if the Mac Studio could become an &#34;affordable&#34; personal machine learning workstation (which also won&#39;t make the electricity bill skyrocket).If Pytorch becomes stable and easy to use on Apple Silicon [0][1], it could be an appealing choice.[0]: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/47702#issuecomment...

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is insane. They claim that its GPU performance tops the RTX 3090, while using 200W less power. I happen to have this GPU on my PC and not only it costs over $3000, but its also very power-hungry and loud.Currently, you need this kind of GPU performance for high resolution VR gaming at 90 fps, but its just barely enough. This means that the GPU will run very loudly and heat up the room, and running games like HL Alyx on max settings is still not possible.It seems that Apple might be the only company who can deliver a proper VR experience. I can&#39;t wait to see what they&#39;ve been cooking up."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"First of all, I&#39;m sorry to learn the author got cancer; I wish her all the best and continued strength.Many contributors have already made good suggestions how to reduce the risk of getting cancer, or how to deal with it; but I found most posts quite _technical_.Speaking in general terms, cancer is not a disease like a common cold. The human body sooner or later is bound to decay, which pretty much starts once one is fully grown, and mutations get less often corrected by the wonderful repair processes our bodies are equipped with. Occasionally, mutations lead to uncontrolled growth of malign tissue, some incidents of which are bound to lead to death, others not.And while it is absolutely a good idea to life healthily and to take care of one&#39;s physical and emotional well-being, one should also never deny that we are all mortals, and cancer as well as traditional diseases can and eventually will wipe any individual out. I am at peace with that, for we need to make space for the next generation (only adding people to planet earth would not be sustainable, as resources are scarce - imagine nobody would ever die). Being on this planet for a limited time period makes it more important to make the right choices, because we have only one life.Because it is a statistical process, we can forecast how many are affected, but not which individual, and everyone can try to minimize one&#39;s chances to be affected, but this does not mean they will live forever. And it&#39;s not just cancer, there are many ways one may pick the unlucky straw: it is not widely known, but the number of people who die from a heath attack in their 20s is significant. Make the best of every minute you have, and live it as if it were your last."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is one of the things where it matters more how healthy/unpolluted your environment is.I&#39;d dare to say that a not-so-phisically-active moderate-smoker living in a less polluted environment has way lower cancer risk than a bio-vegan athlete buddhist monk living in a polluted industrial hellhole.I&#39;d wish we lived in a world where we could actually address chemical, air-particulate +/- microplastics pollution seriously, and stuff like PFOAs that are still used round, without having it be totally overshadowed and drowned in noise by the &#34;fight climate change&#34; crowd or the &#34;extinction rebellion&#34; nutcases....like in, I&#39;d rather have a petrol/gas plant to replace a local COAL power plant FAST, than a nuclear alternative that would take 20 years to get funding and have the delayed-as-usual building process finalized. And I&#39;d rather have all the hydro and windpower we can built asap, and we can figure out later if we really care about the western-golden-lyre-bird or whatever going extinct because of dams or windmills. In the end, tbh, I&#39;ve come to terms with a +5/7 C deg global warming (100y timeframe) happening, but not with me or loved ones dying 20 years earlier of cancer because of chemical and particulate air pollution or god-knows-what from the latest untested and unidentified pan or sportswear coating!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Individually, a person can reduce their cancer risk with a few things like not smoking, and avoiding sunburns, etc.  but that does not eliminate the risk of cancer. It&#39;s not a disease that primarily comes from unhealthy living.That said, there is a toooon of cancer that we can prevent as a society though better public health messaging and better environmental laws, such as creating housing and cities that ban cars, so that we are not continually exposed to pm25 risks."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I tried being a Twitter user for a bit last year, mostly because a lot of engineers I admire use it to communicate about interesting topics and also their work. But after a while, I realized even they will pollute my feed with politically divisive topics, whether it be from them retweeting something, or liking a tweet, or even entering into the fray themselves -- Twitter will find a way to get me to see it. For a while, I resolved &#34;OK, if anyone retweets this stuff, I will simply unfollow them&#34; but eventually this felt self-defeating.I know a lot of folks in my field side by the stance that everything is political, even code. Call me irresponsible, but I&#39;ve honestly led a much happier and stress-free life living in the fantasy world where that is not the case, and I can enjoy my hobby in open-source without Github issues becoming a shouting match that spans 200 comments from people who aren&#39;t even invested in the codebase.EDIT: typos"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article or ones like it are, IMHO, long overdue.  There is a bias online for people who are always online.  It sounds obvious but &#34;tech&#34; companies and people online ignore or have a blind spot for people who remain offline.  &#34;Tech&#34; companies and avid internet users generally see the world through their computers. If something is not represented online, then it is unlikely to register with them as being relevant.  For example, as alluded to this by this Axios article, the opinions of people who do not express their opinions online.It is rare to find someone online advising readers to ditch their pocket computers and disconnect their laptops.  It would be like a newspaper pre-internet advising readers to stop buying newspapers.  Therefore, everything read online must be weighed against this self-serving bias.  Web traffic is the lifeblood of Google, Facebook and their ilk.  If people go offline, the losses would be substantial.  The civilised world can survive offline, as it did when many of us were born, and for centuries before, but Big Tech and their wannabes cannot.  This is because, generally, they are only internediaries (middlemen).   They sit on a computer network, observe and manipulate traffic of the people who use it.  These companies want people online 24/7.  As the article states only a minority of people have complied.  Contrary to the title, this offline majority is neither new nor silent."</p>

Are they laying the groundwork for when the M2 comes out all of these variants will be ready at the same time? Or a gradual upgrade but the same series (Normal, Pro, Max, and then Ultra) for each."</p>

For Black children nationwide, one in four residing in pre-1950 housing and one in six living in poverty presented with an EBLL ≥5 µg/dL. In conclusion, significant nationwide racial disparity in blood Pb outcomes persist for predominantly African-American Black children even after correcting for risk factors and other variables.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7084658/"</p>

Despite the fact that babies will obviously touch the bottle (and the paint) and then put their hands in their mouth.

Use them only when other solutions won&#39;t do.If your data will fit in a set of text files or a cluster of relational databases, use those. Even if you plan on storing a gazillion TB of data, it&#39;s faster to iterate app logic on nimble storage solutions first, before entertaining something bigger.Where the large scale storage clusters shine is when the sheer scale of data won&#39;t fit in anything else, i.e. there&#39;s no other (sane) choice."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;overseas oil, even after shipping costs, is often cheaper than domestically-produced crude&#34;This is all you need to know.If we had an oil export tariff, then we would very quickly become oil independent.  Buyers in other countries are in competition with Americans for this oil, so if you really want to keep the price low in America, we should have such a tariff.  Why should we give away our natural resources like this?Additionally: in these emergency times, a reasonable argument could be made for price controls."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;overseas oil, even after shipping costs, is often cheaper than domestically-produced crude + domestic shipping cost&#34; (emphasis mine).One reason that domestic shipping cost is so high is that 1920 Jones Act[0] prohibits shipping between US ports with non-US ships. This drastically reduces competition and increases prices. Hawaii are particularly hit by this, with estimate $1800 per year per family in extra cost [1].[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jones_Act_(sailor_rights)

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Oil&#34; isn&#39;t one product. It differs widely in chemical and physical properties (viscosity, how much sulfur and arsenic is present, etc.) depending on how/where it was produced. Different refineries are setup to refine different grades of oil and the oil is often blended before shipment to meet the specs the refineries expect. It is often cheaper for the US to import the right grade of oil than it would be to  reconfigure the domestic refineries to process all the domestically produced oil.This is also why there are several oil &#34;prices&#34; that you will see quoted, the most common two being WTI and Brent."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Yup. Calling it. This is the future, may not seem like it to everyone but this is a part of actually new and extremely useful, passively scalable technology. Imagine (good) unkillable zombie databases- so long as the name of a piece of data is known (its hash)..  someone, somewhere, might make it possible for you to answer your query, without even needing to setup a server setup.. that’s _it_! Not to mention it might be faster than the original source.Pretty damn powerful. The next level above this is a search index that lets the user generate their own results, using their own machine learning algorithm or ranking weights of their own preferences, bc they would have direct access to the DB index and features. People could wrote anti-ad plugins. There could be foss upgrades all the time. Nobody would have to spend a particularly crazy amount of money on storage if they could all just cache the bits they’d needed themselves. Quite remarkable imo!! Whatever ends Google search’s reign, will probably be user-owned in a way that seems a lot like this.."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"An example that needs to be in the textbooks. A detailed explanation and a timeline along with the code snippets. It succinctly shows you the complexities involved. Kudos to Max for putting it all into the post.&gt; Blaming the Linux kernel (i.e. somebody else’s code) for data corruption must be the last resort.^^^ I can only image the stress levels at this point."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"10 years ago I found even more outrageous bug in Windows 8.I was working in MSFT back than and I was writing a tool that produced 10 GB of data in TSV format , that I wanted to stream into gzip so that later this file would be sent over the network. When the other side received the file they would gunzip it successfully, but inside there would be mostly correct TSV data with some chunks of random binary garbage. Turned out that pipe operator was somehow causing this.As a responsible citizen I tried to report it to the right team and there I ran into problems. Apparently no one in Windows wants to deal with bugs. IIt was ridiculously hard to report this while being an employee, I can&#39;t imagine anyone being able to report similar bugs from outside. And even though I reported that bug I saw no activity in it when I was leaving the company.However I just tried to quickly reproduce it on Windows 10 and it wouldn&#39;t reproduce. Maybe I forgot some details of that bug or maybe indeed they fixed this by now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another example of a vulnerability that is purposefully obfuscated in the commit log. It is an insane practice that needs to die. The Linux kernel maintainers have been doing this for decades and it&#39;s now a standard practice for upstream.This gives attackers an advantage (they are incentivized to read commits and can easily see the vuln) and defenders a huge disadvantage. Now I have to rush to patch whereas attackers have had this entire time to build their POCs and exploit systems.End this ridiculous practice."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m not opposed to this. I&#39;m opposed to the West imposing its IP regime on the world. I&#39;m supportive of Western copyrights, patents, trademarks, and trade secrets in the US and Western Europe. However, the concept of IP ownership -- let alone specifics of how its structured -- are a cultural and human construct.Other countries should be free to figure out other ways of doing this.Very little of this existed prior to around 1700. It&#39;s a relatively recent construct too (although there are some historical parallels).I&#39;m not at all convinced we&#39;ll make much progress as society if we impose our values on everyone, and expect everyone to behave the same way. There are fundamentals and externalities -- the war on Ukraine is wrong, and we should intervene. However, on something like having IP law, let alone breaking it up into copyrights/patents/trademarks, let alone stating durations and contexts of all of those, this just seems like overreach.I feel like this is one of those places where corporate lobbyists managed to change people&#39;s values in a way which is quite unfortunate. People learn about IP theft in elementary school, it gets integrated into UN human rights documents, and something which is really culturally-dependent is viewed as universal. It wasn&#39;t viewed this way when I was a child.Even little things make a big difference. We&#39;ve gone from &#34;copyright infringement&#34; to words like stealing and theft. They&#39;re fundamentally different concepts which were intentionally mixed up. If I steal from you, you no longer have what I&#39;ve stolen. If I copy your software, you still have it; I might just have deprived you of profits (if I had otherwise bought the software).I&#39;m not arguing against the IP regime in the US/EU, or for breaking IP laws. I&#39;m just arguing we shouldn&#39;t force our IP regime on everyone else."</p>

Both Lunar (https://lunar.fyi) and rcmd (https://lowtechguys.com/rcmd) are now available for free on macOS piracy websites.I made many attempts at discouraging this through anti-piracy measures I learned while working as a malware researcher a few years ago. But if I want my apps to also be available on offline devices, there&#39;s really no way to combat this.The apps are also targetted more toward power users which are more likely to know about cracked apps. This is really hurting indie devs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Devils advocate: if the majority of business software is sold from the US and the US is refusing to sell software to Russia, what choice is there?I’m sure the Russian government are using Microsoft Office, if they can’t legally buy it anymore then they must make the piracy of it legal: or they’re breaking their own laws.Or they retrain on open/libreoffice. But that unfortunately has a poor track record of working.As staunch of a FOSS advocate as I am, this is probably the sensible move for now. :/"</p>

If you need to revise or learn Algebra, then I would do Stroud “engineering math” first which is designed for self-learners with lots of solutions and feedback.At some point, it would be good to get a a copy of Lyx and start to learn to write math in LaTeX - Then you can get feedback on your proofs online at math.stackexchange.com if you don’t know any math people locally.Feel free to get in touch with me if you want to discuss further, happy to help!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I read a Murakami novel in high school, 1Q84. The protagonist is a math teacher who talked about math in a way that I had never seen before. I&#39;d been told I was &#34;good at math&#34; beforehand(for whatever that means, I&#39;m not a fields medalist or anything), but for ~6 months after reading that book, I was _really good_. Like, suddenly I did not have to do any homework in my sr. year calculus class. I loved sitting in class and watching my teacher work through problems, and it seemingly imprinted directly into my brain, because while doing no homework I could still ace the exams while writing with a pen (no erasing and re-do&#39;ing with a pencil). All because of the way this fictional teacher from 1Q84 talked about math.Has anyone else had an experience like that? (With math or other things?)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;Britain last year backed a $546 million funding round at the company to develop the country&#39;s first small modular nuclear reactor (SMR), part of its drive to reach net zero carbon emissions and promote new technology with export potential.&#34;Cool. Although I foresee exporting this technology will be difficult as far as fuel and waste supply chain goes. Having the possibility of multiple new, smaller countries receive nuclear power makes moving fuel and waste across multiple borders more difficult. Also, protecting the technology so it doesn&#39;t fall into the wrong hands becomes more difficult as well (assuming these things can enrich uranium).&#34;Each mini plant can power around one million homes...&#34;.This is where I did a spit take. I was really underestimating the capacity for these &#34;mini&#34; reactors. Being able to power so many homes (and being more centralized than I thought) means these reactors would still require huge infrastructure investment in order to spread the power."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These moves should probably be considered in context of the UK&#39;s collapsed/collapsing ability to produce energy [0]. These stats are a bit laggy, but it looks like they&#39;re being choked out of any sort of industrial relevance to anything.It is hard for me to imagine how that doesn&#39;t translate into a crisis of living standards. Either they&#39;re directly losing the ability to secure people comfortable lives, or they are losing the ability to export valuable products and becoming more vulnerable to foreign pressure. They literally can&#39;t have goods and services without energy.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_in_the_United_Kingdom#O... - the table here is a jaw dropper, looks like they are deindustrialising."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m interested in the &#34;modular&#34; aspect here. It&#39;s not so clear what
this means, but my must hopeful take is:- core technology can be switched (pop in a thorium core when it&#39;s
   available, leaving all the cooling, turbines and electrical as is)- better maintenance, swap out parts with short downtimes- interoperability, add a cooling system from another manufacturer
   like TeraPower or even a Chinese or Russian firm (after this war
   nonsense ends). If we&#39;re going to counter climate change with
   nuclear it must be a global effort.- easier, safer decommissioning. No need to carefully demolish 5 acre
   concrete bunker sites, just tow away old parts for disposal at a
   safe place.Anyone know what &#34;modular&#34; really means in this context?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve investigated network equipment before, my findings were that you shouldn&#39;t trust any of it and use a standard Linux box whenever possible. The worst was consumer-grade modems/routers with low-hanging fruits such as backdoors, &#34;forgotten&#34; telnet servers left enabled, shell command injection in the web UI, etc but even enterprise stuff had its problems (thankfully, at least on enterprise stuff you can disable the web UI and any services you don&#39;t use, considerably shrinking the attack surface to pretty much just the kernel). And don&#39;t get me started on mobile network equipment where untrusted data is parsed at the kernel level and the motto is still security by obscurity (and the impossibility to obtain said equipment for the average Joe).What I think happened is that they breached the control infrastructure which gives them access to an &#34;internal&#34; VLAN that the satellite terminals use to communicate with the mothership for firmware updates, configuration changes, etc, and from there were able to attack these as if they were locally connected (or worse - since that network segment is presumed &#34;internal&#34; and may expose services not normally available - think whatever is the TR-069 equivalent for BGAN terminals), either just pushing an incorrect configuration that prevents the terminal from connecting (essentially bricking it until you can get out-of-band access and reconfigure it properly) or obtaining root (via exploit or pushing a specially-crafted firmware update) and overwriting /dev/mtd* to completely kill the terminal.&#34;Cyberattack on satellite network&#34; sounds so serious but I very much doubt it&#39;s got anything to do with the satellite part of it. They&#39;ve done the equivalent of breaching into the management network at a terrestrial, wired ISP and sent garbage configuration over TR-069 to brick the modems. Attacking the satellite layer would require much more effort for essentially the same gain (and if your objective was to get into the satellite layer, why waste that access on breaking everything in a highly-visible way when you&#39;re better off silently sitting there and using the access to eavesdrop on everything, especially when it&#39;s used for SCADA traffic of critical systems that&#39;s itself unencrypted and vulnerable to tampering?)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Simultaneously, Russian ground forces have had a hell of a time using their encrypted radios, resulting in the logistical and tactical omnishambles observed by many, and fallback transmitting in the clear using civilian ham radios or cell phones.Some have attributed this to difficulty in distributing encryption keys to forward units or just general incompetence, but one fun theory I saw on twitter is that Russia uses SDRs somewhere in their radio net and a similar poison packet bricked them all."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Seems entirely plausible to me that someone pushed a firmware update which corrupted the firmware (even maybe at the fpga/bootcode level) and effectively bricked the devices. Not horribly complicated to do and once you&#39;ve done it it would require physical access to recover each device individually.Is there a plausible explanation for who would do this, besides Russia?Is Viasat/Eutelsat a particularly good target for this for some reason (seems more like Iridium is used in these scenarios)."</p>

In fact, it&#39;s quite worthy even for those who speak Russian and have other news sources.https://meduza.io/en/podcasts/the-naked-pravda or https://meduza.global.ssl.fastly.net/en/podcasts/the-naked-p...Also perhaps https://meduza.io/en and https://meduza.global.ssl.fastly.net/en for text—though that has much less material than in Russian, and I can&#39;t personally vouch for it.As a gentle reminder: after being declared a ‘foreign agent’ and losing risk-averse advertisers, Meduza lives on direct contributions from readers. Given both the devaluation of the ruble and the financial sanctions (as Meduza is not incorporated in Russia), these contributions will likely shrink, and we might lose one of the last outlets with actual good journalism."</p>

Oh and once I tried to use Quora. It asked me to log in before I even knew what kind of a website it is. Now I hate Quora with a passion even though I&#39;m not even sure what kind of a website it is exactly. I can only imagine it&#39;s full of modals, infinite scroll and other features that makes my skin go green and pants purple.So I only end up getting addicted to websites that are simple and old fashioned enough like HN and wikipedia (as long as I don&#39;t click a cursed en.m.wikipedia link by accident). Btw, on youtube each time I click subscriptions it defaults back to the grid view. I want a list. Monkey wants list! YOUTUBE AAAAAAARHGFHGHGHFFG-"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m still young so maybe my mind hasn&#39;t matured enough to where I can combat this well. So I went heavy-handed - I have a button on my desk that when I press it, my server&#39;s DNS server (through which all my devices and router resolve) begins rejecting requests to reddit, instagram, twitter, hackernews, news.google.com, etc.For the next two hours, there is nothing I can do outside of SSH&#39;ing through my mobile device (purposefully don&#39;t have an app for it) and resetting the countdown on the DNS server and restarting the server, to allow these DNS requests. It denies all SSH connections from my home network, and doesn&#39;t even resolve its own subdomain (dns.my-domain.com for the DNS dashboard) for me to reset it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m curious what the generational divide is for this. I’m 57, love tech and enjoy the positive side of the internet in limited doses. But I find most social media boring.There is incredible and AMAZING art, accidental moments, serious discussion and fascinating analysis of the world to be found online. But without grounding myself in genuine experience in the stinky, cruel real world of human interaction, nature, and emotions it’s hollow. It only has meaning with this grounding reality.Infinite scroll has never captured my attention beyond a few seconds. I can’t determine if I’m an anomaly? Normal for my age group?I’m distressed about how much time my 24 year-old daughter spends on instagram. She lives at home, works as a dance instructor, and spends most of her time staring at her phone screen.As a child I loved television. The six million dollar man was a highlight of the week (unless  a spaghetti western was on). But it quickly became stultifying garbage when I spent more than a couple hours on the screen.Am I just not normal? I love the grittiness and dangerous unpredictability of the real world. Yet love movies. I’m not sure what to think"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hey, sorry for all the name changes of Microsoft Defender. I work at MSec (Microsoft&#39;s security org).We ended up absorbing and acquiring a few companies to provide a better offering and a lot of re-branding happened. For example Security Center&#39;s old portal for active threat protection, automatic remediation, incident investigation etc is all now absorbed into (the better) security.microsoft.com which is (to my understanding, just an engineer) the current and last (for the foreseeable future) rebrand. The team I work at started as one person working on the frontend for MDE (Microsoft Defender for Endpoint) and now has hundreds of people working on the security portal across India, Israel and the US (as well as a few other smaller sites contributing).Also, as an engineer I have to say the offering is good. The anti-virus and the telemetry is worked on by some really smart people. Client information is sacred, logging into production takes multiple audits and PII is scrubbed (heavily) any time logs are needed. We still have a lot of room to improve but I am confident in Microsoft both delivering a good product and acting in good faith (and there is a clear business incentive in the enterprise security space to do so rather than benevolence)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I responded to multiple major compromises during the Hafnium Exchange hacks.https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319934/microsoft-hafnium...In quite a few cases, we identified that ultimately a server has been popped using this unknown zero day, but never before seen webshells and Cobalt strike droppers all ended up dropped on servers and then deleted by Windows Defender. We recommended rebuilds regardless but the product clearly provided more security than people give it credit for.Then we identified a number of places it didn&#39;t appear to work. Why? The answer was people following &#34;best practices&#34; of adding AV exclusions for the whole web root folder, and for some reason the whole user profile folder.That big Kaseya hack? Every Kaseya user was told by Kaseya to add exclusions for every folder used by the product.One of the understated issues with modern EDR products is people simply following vendor advise and making it useless. I&#39;ve got a software product that handles payment details that randomly drops EICAR test files in random folders all of the user PC while it&#39;s running just so it can shut itself down if it detects Defender in use &#34;for support reasons&#34;.All the top EDR products in the world and all the hardening advice you can find can go down the toilet pretty quickly if you let vendors tell you how to run these products - ignoring them is a highly rated hardening tip."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My firm belief is the that hardware vendors do end users a disservice by preloading 3rd party anti-virus software that expires ans requires payment after a period of time for virus signature updates.   Typically this 3rd party software disables Defender, so once the pre-installed AV trial runs out, the user is exposed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;But we should keep in mind that the virologists publishing papers downplaying the possibility of a lab leak are not disinterested parties in this. The political context is a debate about regulating virus labs, and it’s hardly shocking that a large segment of the virus lab community doesn’t like that idea.&#34;This, I think, is the crux of our problem.  Almost anyone who knows enough about the field to have an informed opinion, is involved enough to have an incentive to convince the world that it was not their profession, that unleashed this.  Scientists are human, not demons but also not angels.  It would be hard to convince yourself, that your profession was responsible for this.  We should listen to what they have to say, but not expect them to be dispassionate and unbiased investigators of the question."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why is this being discussed now? Matt Yglesias has publicly admitted that this piece is flawed. This is critically important context that is being missed by everyone in this discussion:‘…SIGNIFICANT factual error in my newsletter.’‘…we knew specifically that RaTG13 samples had been brought to the Wuhan Institute of Virology and studied there.That is not the case for this Laos virus.To me that discovery really does meaningfully detract from the plausibility of the lab leak story and I apologize — I simply missed this when it came out and failed to update my views.‘https://mobile.twitter.com/mattyglesias/status/1499467534202..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just couldn&#39;t take the &#34;research&#34; seriously when I read this:&gt; They said they found no support for an alternate theory that the coronavirus escaped from a laboratory in Wuhan.No support? Really? Not just &#34;weak&#34; support, but not a single shred of support whatsoever? So it&#39;s just a hoax?There&#39;s a long article going into what would be otherwise some very strange and implausible coincidences [1] surrounding the issue for those curious. Surely unbiased research into the topic would deem these to be worthy of at least some cursory mentions (and ideally, some debunking)?Moreover, this might be an interesting read:In January 2018, the U.S. Embassy in Beijing took the unusual step of repeatedly sending U.S. science diplomats to the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV), which had in 2015 become China’s first laboratory to achieve the highest level of international bioresearch safety (known as BSL-4). WIV issued a news release in English about the last of these visits, which occurred on March 27, 2018. The U.S. delegation was led by Jamison Fouss, the consul general in Wuhan, and Rick Switzer, the embassy’s counselor of environment, science, technology and health. Last week, WIV erased that statement from its website, though it remains archived on the Internet. [...] During interactions with scientists at the WIV laboratory, they noted the new lab has a serious shortage of appropriately trained technicians and investigators needed to safely operate this high-containment laboratory.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have a similar freakish ability, but mine has to do with writing. I can basically ~see~ approximately three pages of prose in my mind&#39;s eye while writing. It only works under certain conditions, but it feels just like I&#39;m transcribing something rather then doing any kind of deliberate thinking. People are shocked what comes out of me, and even more so when they see how quickly it happens. You would need to see me in person to experience the full effect, but my body does not match my words. Imagine the biggest lumberjack you&#39;ve ever seen describing the petals of a flower with such high precision that it takes your breath away. That&#39;s me. I&#39;ve started to slowly nurture this talent, because it finally occurred to me that it might be special."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I caution against looking at numbers in any single way. The more different ways you can visualize math concepts, the better. Practice seeing them in different ways.Sometimes numbers are for quantifying a pile of things, and 255 and 256 are basically the same.Sometimes numbers are for cryptographically signing things, and 255 is extremely secure while 256 is completely vulnerable.Sometimes numbers are for arranging tournaments, and 256 is a tremendously useful number while 255 is super annoying and you should look for another.Sometimes numbers are stored in a single byte, and 256 (=0) is the friendliest number you will ever know, while 255&#39;s words are BACKED BY NUCLEAR WEAPONS.Sometimes infinity is a useful number, sometimes it&#39;s not. Sometimes 1/2 is a useful number (pies), sometimes it&#39;s not (babies).  Sometimes sqrt(-1) is a useful number, sometimes it&#39;s not. Sometimes the sum of all positive integers equals -1/12; sometimes that&#39;s stupid.All of these situations may call for visualizing numbers differently."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Holy moly. Wow.I am a successful software developer and I’m terrible at math. To me, 6+3 is not an interaction between two different anything, rather, it’s a key in a hash table where I’ve stored “9” as the value. All arithmetic is rote memory recall for me. I work with complex numbers by just breaking them down into multiple steps.Now I’m wondering if I should challenge my brain to do this differently."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Like many people may have, my first though was why would you buy a smart oven. He explains in a follow up that it was the only one offered by his home builder. And this is an important and overlooked point.A lot of garbage that no reasonable person would ever buy ends up being weaseled in to new home sales because of deals the companies cut with the builders, knowing nobody buys a house based on whether they could have a user-scamming smart appliance as the default. This kind of thing is insidious- I have no idea what the solution is.Though as a afterthought, it reminds me a bit of the microsoft antitrust stuff from 20+ years ago where they bundled IE as part of destroying Netscape (im sure there is more subtlety than that, that&#39;s the gist of what I remember)"</p>

What a waste.[0] https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41085118-unauthorized-br...On a side note, I&#39;m convinced Doctorow is the greatest cyberpunk writer there is, but I&#39;m also sure the reason for this is because earlier writers had to imagine a dystopian future. Doctorow, like the rest of us, is living that future (which is much more boring that fiction made out) and he&#39;s simply documenting what he sees."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From my perspective, the really exciting thing about this that it works equally well in mobile web browsers as well as desktop web - clicking on a link on Mobile Safari should Do The Right Thing without having to install anything.Moreover, because it&#39;s built on Matrix, MSC3401 (https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/matthew/group-...) means that we&#39;ll finally have decentralised cascading video/voice conferences once the SFU (selective forwarding unit) component is added into the mix.  So, for instance, users on the same homeserver will get their video feeds relayed locally with minimal latency... and then users on another remote homeserver will also get mixed locally with minimal latency, trunking the two together.  If the link dies or one homeserver dies, the conference will keep going - i.e. precisely the same semantics as normal Matrix."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; And, the big one drum roll, please... we will be integrating this into Element so you can have voice and video rooms, and hold group video calls inside the Element app natively over Matrix.I&#39;d love to replace my teamspeak server with this. Discord is tempting, but I&#39;d rather host it myself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is really cool. I really feel like this ecosystem is hitting its stride.The list of upcoming features is long and sometimes I don&#39;t understand how they can have so many things going on at once.Features tend to take a few years to mature, but that is not a bad thing.I will be setting up my own server shortly, something that I have been thinking about for a while and maybe try to develop something.Congrats to the team.Question:The OpenID part, would it not be cool if Matrx would offer something like a federated SSO experience? So that on other webpages you could use your matrix login instead of Github/Google and co. Hosting that server yourself would be fantastic.There are of course some issues with Attribute retrieval if user can host these servers themselves."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hello! Original author (original tweeter?) here.This particular design is from the iPhone 7 (or, more precisely, my guess is that it&#39;s from the iPhone 7 due to both the date of the patent [1] and due to the elements matching up with marketing images of the iPhone 7), which is 6 years old now, but I think it&#39;s broadly still representative of modern smartphone lenses. In the past 5 years or so, advancements in phone cameras have come mostly in better sensors, far better image processing, and adding more cameras, but the basic principles of the compact ultra-aspherical lens design seem to still be in place.As an example, here [2] is an exploded view of the iPhone 6&#39;s lens setup, and here [3] is an exploded view of the more recent iPhone 12&#39;s lens setup. The iPhone 12 gained an extra element, but they both use similarly weird ripply elements and you can see the clear lineage between the two phones.Also, as mentioned in the tweet thread and elsewhere in the comments here, Kats Ikeda has an excellent, incredibly detailed and thorough explainer on mobile phone lens design [4]. I don&#39;t actually know a whole lot about the optics field; I&#39;m just dabbling as a hobbyist from a computer graphics perspective. Kats Ikeda&#39;s site is a much better resource than my Twitter posts for learning about this stuff.[1] https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/7e/4e/3f/4e88d65...[2] https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FMyGm6IVkAY77eY?format=jpg&amp;name=...[3] https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FMyIbszVQAQhMQ_?format=jpg&amp;name=...[4] https://www.pencilofrays.com/lens-design-forms/#mobile"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Complicated, but simply an incremental evolution of a very old solution.  These complicated lens arrangements to counteract chromatic aberration got started in the 18th century.  The game is all about getting three distinct wavelengths to focus despite each reacting differently at each lens.  The lens in the iPhone looks complex but it isn&#39;t any more complicated than others.  The most complex I&#39;ve ever read about was for a satellite which had to maintain focus despite temperature changes.  Iirc that employed a stack of over a dozen lenses.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achromatic_lenshttps://www.dpreview.com/forums/post/61074908

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I managed to escape the country yesterday, had to flight to Egypt of all places, because ALL (even business) tickets were sold out.
The recent news is that starting March 6 all international flights are suspended, the trap has closed.The disheartening thing is that even if you never supported Putin, other countries treat you as enemy.I am at Georgia now and banks refuse to open bank accounts to Russians, and I need one to continue working as a remote dev for US companies. Older generation (who are pro-Russian) suggested being careful around young people as they may be hostile to Russians, even those who are running away from Putin.A lot of my IT friends have fled the country, almost everyone who could. My heart is bleeding thinking of friends who wanted to leave on March 9, not sure what they can do now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"No one thinks that a regular Ivan from some russian city (on his own) is responsible for the war and should suffer. And I see how you could (and probably should, at some level) feel sorry for russians fleeing the country.But this is the only way to tell them that they -- collective Ivans, Russian society as a whole -- should stand up and act: they should articulate their content, they should protest against putin&#39;s policy, and they should stop the war (an alternative would be to accept Ukraine to NATO and finish this war is a day, but that won&#39;t happen).While they&#39;re suffering economically, the suffering of Ukrainians is just on another level -- it&#39;s not about restrictions (e.g. no ikea or facebook or apple products) or money (inflation), it&#39;s about flattened cities and destroyed lives.I woke up as I heard bombs falling on my city, and I definitely haven&#39;t felt any sympathy for russians since then.If they feel they don&#39;t support their country&#39;s aggression towards Ukraine, they should go protest and stop it -- even at risk of being fined or imprisoned. Otherwise they should just embrace all sanctions and become North Korea imho."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find it strange that so many people in these threads keep saying things like &#34;go home and fight putin.&#34; Imagine if this had been the western response to the German physicists to whom we offered refuge before/during World War II. When the intellectual capital of your enemy is trying to come over to your side, turning them away out of spite isn&#39;t &#34;being tough&#34; or &#34;holding people accountable&#34; - it&#39;s just counterproductive."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I left Apple after years of lack of any flexibility on the remote work process. They wouldn&#39;t allow transferring to any alternative office for most teams. From what I understood, VPs could protect a small minority of some of their employees if a senior leader made a case to them.Unfortunately, this just seemed to lead to the most politically connected folks going remote and directors friends and favorite hires getting the perk.At three trillion market cap, I guess they just realized it doesn&#39;t really matter if attrition shoots up and they&#39;ll always have enough people to fill the trenches. Lots and lots of people left around the same time.Having left, I forgot what it was like to be able to focus on something other than Apple. Incredibly toxic atmosphere on the inside. I work at a fast-paced startup and still work on average 10/hours a week less than at Apple."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Maybe it&#39;s me, but I have yet to experience &#39;innovation&#39; result from a conversation held over coffee or a chance encounter. I&#39;ve had better luck creating connections with other parts of the business and exchanging ideas over the infrequent cocktail party where it&#39;s a mission of the night. Say all you want about open floorplans and irrelevant quiet encounters.Having said that, every situation is unique."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I suspect we are going to see some turmoil in the tech hiring space with stock prices taking a beating in recent months. Large companies have gotten away with paying under market price for talent because employees have seen massive gains from stock appreciation over the last decade. If total comp starts going down year over year, suddenly the more traditional, no-frills system at places like Apple, Microsoft and Amazon isn&#39;t going to look nearly as attractive, especially compared to companies one tier below that are already offering higher comp and more flexible work options."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I can only really judge a font when its loaded in my system, running in my setup. I wish font makers targeting developers would release trial fonts (with some essential chars missing or similar), so that we could test them properly before paying.I am always looking for a better font, and this one looks like it may be an improvement over my current one."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Looks nice in principle, but being suitable for the actual daily use (for coding) will depend on how it renders in a specific IDE at a specific size on a specific OS. There&#39;s LOTS of mono fonts that look great in larger sizes or on Macs, but that all but unbearable to look at in smaller sizes on Windows.There&#39;s no mention of this font having a manually hinted TTF version, which is pretty much required for rendering under these conditions. This gives me a very big pause. As others have said - at $75 a pop this font absolutely needs a downloadable, installable and usable trial. How it looks in PDF and rendered to a bitmap may showcase its design well, but not its real-world usage. That&#39;s assuming that the author means to position it also as a coding font (which seems to be the case judging by the samples)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What is the best type of radio, or best type of radios, to have in the event of a protracted, possibly nuclear conflict?Ready.gov suggests a hand crank or NOAA weather radio. Specifically, I suppose some good goals would be:1. Receive instructions from any functioning local or state government. This would require that the local government know which type of radio the populace is likely to be listening on, which gives an advantage to FM or weather radios.2. Communicate with other regional survivors.3. Global news, for which shortwave would be indispensable.Maybe multiple radios that can receive on different frequencies would be best? I really know very little about this topic other than basic physical signal characteristics.Edit: I don&#39;t &#34;prep,&#34; but I occasionally browse this website when doomscrolling, which has a few suggestions: https://theprepared.com/gear/reviews/emergency-radio/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I posted this comment on a less popular thread a few days ago:I had the luck of seeing this plane on approach to IAH airport while driving in Houston.For the first few minutes, it looked like a normal size plane, but felt too low and too slow. Then for the next few minutes, it kept getting bigger and bigger. Then I saw it had 6 engines. And a tail wing that seemed as large as a normal plane’s wingspan. I was lucky that it crossed right in front of me as I was near the airport (about 2.5 miles from the runway). It looked so low, so slow, and just massive. I went home and figured out what it was by googling it. That time it was transporting part of an oil rig.
I tried to find it to go see again ever since, but I could never get a clear schedule and it didn’t line up with where I was in the world. I was telling my wife the other week that this was something I’d like to seek out. It’s something that anyone on this site, aviation enthusiast or not, would have appreciated seeing."</p>

It&#39;s especially easier given the lack of threat to the mainland that can be manufactured.But what about against a neighboring oligarchy like Russia?

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Protracted wars (i.e. long slow wars via hit-and-run and guerilla warfare) have been very successful in past to topal the mighty powers by far weaker forces. However, in recent times, I feel they are becoming much less effective. The electronic surveylence and automated targetting makes such warfare much difficult. This is especially the case because, (1) the ruling power will eventually control all communication and remove any free speech, (2) they will constantly find and kill leaders through electronic means which are now amazingly effective.A much better defensive route is probably mandatory militery training of all able citizens. Eventually, most professional armies are in the size of million at most and only 100,000 or so get deployed. If you have a million citizens with militery training, you are way harder to beat."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A bit off-topic, but the fact that criminals asked for help mining, instead of money or crypto-money, just gave me an epiphany:The whole internet is showing the first signs of a digital Resource Curse [1] brought by crypto mining. Crypto mining changed the economics of the digital world in such a drastic way that it is poisoning all kinds of internet interactions. It is not just about disrupting how money used to work, it is disrupting every kind of interaction, even those that had nothing to do with money. Things that were completely economically neutral before, so people did them just for fun, can now be exploited to extract value, so naturally some people do it and the previous innocent/neutral status quo is lost. For example: most free unix shell providers, a fun tradition from nerds from the 90s, had to shut down because now there is such a big economic incentive to abuse such free service.And while writing above I realized that crypto is probably the second internet curse, with Google&#39;s algorithm being the first. When Google became the near-monopoly in the early 2000s, linking to a website ceased to be an economic neutral activity, people realized they could extract value from linking, so link spam became a big problem and forever changed the web.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_curse"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; So, NVIDIA, the choice is yours! Either: Officially make current and all future drivers for all cards open source, while keeping the Verilog and chipset trade secrets... well, secret OR Not make the drivers open source, making us release the entire silicon chip files so that everyone not only knows your driver&#39;s secrets, but also your most closely-guarded trade secrets for graphics and computer chipsets too!Interesting. Someone got really fed up with them. I don&#39;t think their binary blob ever made them any friends."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are two scenarios where carrying out their threat plausibly helps the open source community:1) A source drop demonstrates that Nvidia incorporated GPLed code into their drivers. This is, honestly, unlikely - Nvidia has sufficiently competent lawyers to ensure that everyone they employ is extremely aware of what the consequences of that would be2) The source drop includes the private keys used to sign Nvidia GPU firmware blobs. Nouveau is currently entirely hamstrung on the last few generations of Nvidia cards because they run extremely slowly unless appropriate signed firmware is loaded, and Nvidia refuse permission to distribute that firmware. I&#39;m not aware of any case law around whether private keys are copyrightable (I&#39;d assume not, given that they&#39;re supposed to be randomly generated), and whether it&#39;s a DMCA violation to make use of leaked keys if you don&#39;t violate any other technical protection mechanisms. This would potentially (given a lot of work) allow Nouveau to implement equivalent firmware and sign it, but this would presumably still just result in Nvidia switching to different keys for the next architecture.Obviously the calculation differs if Nvidia choose under duress to release the drivers under an open source license, but that doesn&#39;t seem likely - this still very much reads as an attempt to extort Nvidia into removing restrictions on crypto mining rather than an earnest attempt to improve open source support for their hardware."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The UK is leading the charge for legislation [0] to force platforms to impose certain types of censorship. Youtube and the others are just getting ahead of curve. They have known what&#39;s coming since they were invited into No. 10 to discuss these issues with Theresa May and Amber Rudd in 2017.The legislation is based on the principle that everyone has the right to say what they want to say, but they have no right to be heard by others. This phraseology was used by several during the recent committee hearings, including by Facebook employees for example. So it will effectively enshrine in law: shadow banning, delisting from Google search etc.Also enshrined in the legislation is the principle of banning content which is &#39;legal but harmful to adults&#39;. &#39;Harmful&#39;, amongst many other terms, is not defined.Also enshrined in law will be the principle that certain types of &#39;journalistic&#39; content will be protected from this censorship if it meets criteria to be decided upon by the new regulator, Ofcom.This will be an enabling act. It is full, from front to back, of opportunity for scope creep through secondary legislation.As I said, the UK is leading the charge with this, but the EU has been keeping pace [1]. I haven&#39;t seen similar in the US as of yet.[0] - https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/draft-online-safe...

Any kind of active moderation of perfectly legal speech through &#39;terms of service&#39;/&#39;community standards&#39; will remove any common-carrier liability shield.Actions like this have turned this into political red meat for some. These companies really need to learn how to read the room. Ratcheting downward the ability of people to freely use these platforms just feeds into whatever persecution complex they have, and justifies it. You don&#39;t get rid of bad ideas by allowing them not be spoken no matter how well meaning you are."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m in the business of building an online word processor - https://www.zoho.com/writerIt&#39;s interesting how the documents industry is moving from print oriented legacy softwares (Google Docs, Word) to block based, app-ish, smart canvases (Notion, Coda, etc).Also both Microsoft &amp; Google have adopted completely different strategies to compete in this market. Microsoft launched Loop as an entirely new app while Google is incorporating these blocks as smart chips in Google Docs itself. Both strategies have their own pros and cons.My bet is on Google Docs style, because this means a group that&#39;s already invested in traditional document making skills (legal professionals, academic professionals, etc) will be able to incrementally step up their game without their workflow being completely destroyed. Sure, this will slow down the pace with which Google Docs can innovate and evolve - but overall it helps the older generation to smoothly transition over to the new age document editing, which is great."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A &#34;pageless document that lives online&#34; is also known as... a web page.Instead of creating web pages in html, css, and js, people will now create them using familiar &#34;word processing&#34; and &#34;spreadsheet&#34; apps on Google Drive.And these web pages come with nice fine-grained access controls -- authors can specify who is able to view, comment on, and edit their documents with a few clicks.Makes perfect sense."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; If your document contains elements like footnotes, headers and footers, or watermarks, and it is converted to pageless, those elements will not be visible.Headers and footers are print-oriented, but losing footnotes is not ok.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have been building a Canvas diagramming library since 2010 (https://gojs.net), if anyone has any questions about 2D Canvas use in the real-world I&#39;d be happy to answer them.roundRect is great. Though you don&#39;t need 4 arcTo in order to make a rounded rect, you can use bezier instead (we do). Their example is also 1% amusing because they set the `fillStyle` but then call `stroke` (and not `fill`). I&#39;ll have to do some performance comparisons, since that&#39;s the operative thing for my use case (and any library author).text modifiers are very welcome. It&#39;s crazy how annoying measuring still is, especially if you want thinks to look perfectly consistent across browsers. Though the chrome dominance is making things easier in one way, I guess.context.reset is kinda funny. Most high-performance canvas apps will never want to use it. For that matter you want to set all properties as little as possible, especially setting things like context.font, which are slow even if you&#39;re setting it to the same value. (Or it was, I haven&#39;t tested that in several years).I&#39;m sure most users know this by now, but generally for performance the fewer calls you make to the canvas and the context, the beter. This is even true of transforms: It&#39;s faster to make your own Matrix class, do all your own matrix translation, rotation, multiplication, etc, and then make a single call to `context.setTransform`, than it is to call the other context methods.One of the greatest things to happen to 2D canvas in all these years was hardware acceleration. It used to be significantly slower. (You could switch to WebGL canvas, but at a cost of complexity and all kinds of annoyances rendering text, and if you had a lot of text it often wasn&#39;t worth it.) Thinking back, I&#39;m also a little disappointed that after the death of Flash, it felt like Canvas never really took its place. The playful web that came before it in some ways simply closed up."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Rounded rectangles: the cornerstone of the internet, of computing, nigh, of civilization.That isn&#39;t wildly exaggerated if this story is true:https://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?story=Round_Rects_Are_..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ll add some of my thoughts about this article&#39;s take on latest Canvas2D developments.1. ctx.roundRect() - is a nice addition to the 2D stable of shapes, fitting alongside other recent additions like ctx.ellipse(). I was a little disappointed that the example of how to achieve this using existing functionality relied on a set of .moveTo, .lineTo and .arcTo instructions; the article misses a trick by not mentioning that we can also use an SVG path.d string to define a Path2D object and use that to fill/stroke the shape. Note: I can&#39;t find mention of .roundRect() in the MDN documentation.2. Canvas Conic gradients have been supported in both Firefox and Safari for a while now. Good to see it arriving in Chrome. To complete the set of gradients, it would also be nice to see support for ports of the CSS repeating-linear-gradient() and repeating-radial-gradient() into the Canvas API.3. Text modifiers - text has always been an over-simplistic mess in the Canvas2D API. In theory a user should be able to use ctx.font to load a valid CSS font string (including all the supported font size lengths, etc) and have the text rendered as expected; sadly the implementations between various browsers are all over the place. In my dreams I hope that one day we will be able to set a width/justification and have the text string broken into lines while respecting those requirements. Browsers do it already for DOM/CSS layout and rendering - I wonder how difficult it would be to tap into that functionality rather than having to reinvent it for 2D canvases?4. context.reset() - nice!5. Filters - SVG filters are massively powerful, yet also difficult to master. We can already build some really complex filters in SVG and reference them in the Canvas2D context; I also like the way we can add CSS filter strings to the context (eg for a nice, easy-to-understand and performant blur effect). The article mentions a `ctx.filter = new CanvasFilter([])` construction, but I can&#39;t find CanvasFilter in the MDN documentation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I feel like this post was intended to inflame or shock the reader with the writers stance on password policy. But anyone who has been in security for more than 1 month knows that regular password rotation has not been a recommendation for over 5 years. Both NIST, and MS have been trying to get the world to move to long, never rotated password, so long as those passwords are dictionary checked.Every company (all 3 of them) I have worked at within the last 10 years, the IAM team has already implimented, or was working on implimenting a system that removed regular rotation, special chars and number requirements, and relied on three things: Length, a dictionary check at the time of pass creation, and routine dictionary attacks against the credential store. This started 10 years ago, for someone to make the same claims now, is not a shock.Please note that if you are unable to impliment such an IAM system, especially the inability to dictionary check the credentials against known lists (seclists&#39; github is great for this), then length plus regular rotation is still the recommendation"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One missed point, the advice is even slightly better than they argue, since they only argue that it&#39;s not necessary to change it, which is just an argument of convenience.But updating a password is itself an attack surface. More so than merely using it to log in.It&#39;s one of the times where an attacker may be tricking you into giving it to them, either by a fake page or app dialog, or in concert with maybe they have a way to receive the verification email or text.Also it&#39;s a less frequent operation, meaning it&#39;s easier to fake. You are more likely to notice any tiny discrepency and detect a fake in the way your normal login screen looks than some account management screen.Basically updating a password is a riskier action than the normal daily use of the same password.And that alone is it&#39;s own even stronger argument for avoiding doing it unnecessarily."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In the USA, the latest government guidance from Jan 2022 is that &#34;Password policies MUST NOT require use of special characters or regular rotation&#34;. [1] This is a strong upgrade from earlier softer language like &#34;don&#39;t have to/should not&#34;.In practice, this new rule contradicts almost every InfoSec stance out there, but all government agencies must comply with this new rule by the end of the year, so expect lots of conversations and changes.[1] https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/M-22-0...

He’s been in business for almost 51 years and he’s one of the largest bike dealers by volume in the country.  He has nearly a hundred employees and a bookkeeper.  Despite having a proverbial dozen balls in the air at any time and despite having people on the payroll to do bookkeeping, he sits down at his computer every night at home, logs into the ERP system, and reviews sales and receipts.  He catches all kinds of crazy things.  Credit card fraud (before the chargeback even comes), internal theft, mis-priced items, mistakes, you name it.  He has great employees but even the best make mistakes and he’s learned this habit over the decades the hard way.  I remember sitting next to him as a kid, watching him pour over cash register journal tapes that were yards long, looking for problems.My point: if you let this kind of fuck-up go undetected for over three months, you have to at least assume some of the blame and acknowledge that you probably could have caught it if you scrutinized transactions.

1. Immediately acknowledge the issue and raise it to a Specialist.
2. Give you a work-around, so that you don&#39;t need to be blocked.
3. Engage the lead PM, to speak to you, to address your concerns.
4. Fix the documentation first, so others know how to fix this and understand the cases.
5. Take feedback that they need to improve the API.
6. Find which customers had an issue and pro-actively reach out to them. (Isn&#39;t this what you wanted in the 1st place?)Things that didn&#39;t go well:
1. Long periods of silence between mails.
2. Lack of a bug bounty, sounds like a pretty big miss on their part and a bug bounty would be nice."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I also had issues with stripe&#39;s automatic tax. We use stripe&#39;s subscriptions with free trials but don&#39;t collect credit card details up front, preferring to make sign up simple and low friction. Automatic tax is charged at 0.5% of each transaction, and apparently a trial ending is considered a transaction even if the user has no payment method, so we were hit with automatic tax fees for every trial end even if we received no money for them.Overall my experience with stripe has been pretty negative and the large gap between my perception of the quality of their products, and the reality I discovered in actually using them has made me realize how much effort they put in to marketing to developers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So, aside from the obvious nature of messing around with Nuclear generating station being an idiotic move.  From a tactical move for Russia - clearly they want the generating station offline to cause further chaos in Ukraine and that it supplies 1/6 of the power I believe(?).  Was the generating station fighting to say online / not surrender or did Russia just show up guns blazing?It&#39;s clearly a tactically important source of energy for Ukraine.Also - wouldn&#39;t it just be easier for Russia to destroy the substations nearby?  I assume there would be some problems with all that excess power being generating if the substations were blown.  The whole thing is pretty nuts.I can&#39;t imagine being the ISO trying to balance the grid or ISO equivalent of the grid over there right now (amongst other impossible jobs/positions people are in Ukraine right now)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This has been a real reckoning for me, as somebody who has historically been very pro-nuclear.Quite simply, humanity is too good at screwing things up to harness such a fundamentally powerful and dangerous source of power. It requires a commitment to long lasting peace and stability that we&#39;re just not capable of."</p>

It will isolate them enough to allow the government to push an anti-western agenda.They need to see the misery of the war they are inflicting and the only way is via an open internet. Yes they will push their own propaganda to the west but we can deal with that.Fire-walling them off will result in the people not knowing what is going on. Just look how China is able to hide what happened at Tienanmen square.We can not allow Russia to run the narrative by cutting of the internet.

A couple of notes of people who are confused by it:1) The &#39;ns&#39; next to the box is a graph legend not a data label (normally that would be in a box labeled legend to distinguish it from graph data)2) The weird box and rectangle thing on the top is a slider, I didn&#39;t notice that until I was looking at the code and said &#34;what slider?&#34;3) The only changes from 2005 to present are storage and networking speeds.What item #3 tells you is that any performance gains in the last decade and a half you&#39;ve experienced have been driven by multi-core, not faster processors.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The article is close, but doesn&#39;t quite get there. The problem is not the image itself or how it&#39;s taken, but rather how it&#39;s displayed. When you look at the world through your eyeballs, your brain recreates the scene so that it wraps around an imaginary point in mental space, so to speak. Things that are to your right &#34;appear to your right&#34; in your mind. When you&#39;re looking at a photograph, regardless of how much field of view it was taken with, it&#39;s displayed in a very small portion of your entire field of vision, even if you&#39;re looking at it on a computer monitor; it&#39;s even worse if you&#39;re looking at it on a phone. You&#39;re basically always looking at it zoomed out. It would be possible to recreate the scene exactly as it would have appeared if your eye was where the camera was when the photo was taken, but you&#39;d need to blow it up on a huge screen, like a movie theater screen, and stand fairly close to it. Then you&#39;d be able to see that actually most lenses other than fisheyes have fairly narrow field of views."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Perspective is a huge challenge in photography, in some respects a central challenge.Here&#39;s [1] an image, made with a rectilinear lens, which manages to convey oodles of depth and structure.  It is difficult to overstate how challenging it can be to express that level of depth in a flat image.When people talk about how a focal-length &#34;compresses&#34; or &#34;exaggerates&#34; an image, what they&#39;re really talking about is perspective. Each field of view carries with it its own perspective.Variable focal-length (&#34;zoom&#34;) lenses encourage us to select our subject and composition first, then choose a perspective to match. Frequently, it is more important to begin with our desired subject and the perspective with which we wish the viewer to see it (focal-length), then figure out how to build a composition to match.   A 24-70 mm lens isn&#39;t really a lens, it is at least six lenses with significantly-different perspectives: 24, 28, 35, 40, 50, and 70mm, each of which can take a lifetime to master.One can deliver the perception that Hertzmann is after with a rectilinear lens, but it isn&#39;t easy.  Composition, lighting, and dodging/burning are all tools to that end.Think about your memory of the Tank Man in Tiananmen Square, now look at the image [2].  I bet he&#39;s a much smaller part of the frame than you recall, yet he utterly dominates your perception of the image, even when you look at the actual rectilinear image.[1] https://www.phillips.com/detail/HENRI-CARTIER-BRESSON/NY0405...[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank_Man"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I ended up reading one of the referenced articles too since it captured my interest https://www.gamedeveloper.com/disciplines/fovo-a-new-3d-rend... all of this looks interesting. I would love to add these correction and similar to my game engine to experiment with it, but fovotec seems to have to be paid/contacted for. I might try and replicate what the author of the main article showed at the end. Does anyone know of any more references to the 3d rendering side of this topic?Edit: Added words for clarity."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s why some countries have weird regulations about maps. South Korea does not allow exporting vector maps, so Google Maps rendering is vector based everywhere except in a region surrounding South Korea [1]. China applies a (not so) secret pseudorandom offset to all geographic coordinates in online maps, frequently resulting in mismatches between systems that apply corrections and those that don&#39;t. It seems silly during peacetime but when there&#39;s an actual war, you can see why people might want that kind of thing.And militaries all over the globe do use Google Maps extensively, if not by policy then just by soldiers doing their own thing. Wrong borders in Google Maps have nearly led to international incidents when soldiers ended up on the wrong side of a border. And then there are the disputed borders that Google is forced to display differently in different countries. There is no globally accepted map and as a result the map Google shows you changes depending on where you&#39;re located.[1] Actually I am out of date, it looks like the South Korea maps are vector based now. Maybe the law changed. It definitely used to be the case."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Super cool project and write up.What&#39;s the state of EEG these days?Last I interacted with one of these systems it seemed more like confimation bias from noise.Had a buddy who bought a &#34;high end&#34; headset, shaved his head to &#34;improve the signal&#34;, and it appeared for all intents and purposes that it was mostly only reading concusive activity.  He would &#34;show me it&#39;s working&#34; by tapping on the exterior of the sensors to get it to display a spike.Conceptually these systems &#34;make sense&#34; to me, ie. the brain uses electromagnetism to function so one should be able to sense/manipulate those vectors, but an FMRI is MASSIVE and requires a 1-3 Tesla electromagnet to get its fidelity, and even then is only measuring blood flow and correlating that to brain activity.So what&#39;s the hope that a tiny sensor resting on your skin will actually correspond to anything happening inside the brain?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I learned a similar lesson in a simpler form when waiting tables.Some people will run you ragged, asking for more napkins, then when you return with them, more ketchup, then when you return with that, there’s an issue with the food, then so on and so on.If you don’t check yourself, you will actually leave your other tables without any of their basics, or their food will get cold waiting in the window, because you’ve developed tunnel vision to please this one needy table.Sometimes things really do stack up, but there are strategies to avoid or deal with that. These strategies will fail with the Truly Needy table. And then they won’t tip well, or at all.I learned it’s better to deprioritize that table and pay the normal amount of attention to everyone else. Better for those all to tip at a standard rate and give them a good experience than to let one group drag down the whole floor.That super needy table didn’t need half the things they asked for anyways. Those napkins are sitting there unused when they leave. The glass of water they asked you to fill at halfway is still almost full. Life goes on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I find scary is that if you work in a sufficiently toxic environment/culture for long enough, that very behavior that you try to fight against and change begins to seep into your everyday actions. I&#39;ve seen myself go from &#34;positive and helpful&#34; to &#34;apathetic and helpful&#34; to &#34;not caring at all&#34; to &#34;chippy, negative and unhelpful&#34; before. You hope that this is something you can pickup on, but when the culture of a work environment is like that, there isn&#39;t really anyone to give you feedback and catch you from sliding down this slope. Then when you do notice, the climb back up just feels so much more overwhelming."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I totally know that feeling. This is why I really cherish my current, by now 3 years old, job because sort of the opposite exists here. In fact, if I forget sometimes or make a mistake, my coworkers are more likely to fix it for me in the wiki or docs than they are to use it to complain or stop me from doing something. Working in a helpful and collaborative environment has had an enormous quality of life improvement for me. It is also the most productive teams I&#39;ve ever worked on. I&#39;m not writing this to gloat or anything but offer up something I didn&#39;t know before working here: Don&#39;t just hire for talent; do not hire jerks no matter how good they are as individuals. Software engineering is an inherently collaborative venture. When building an engineering team, really do build a team instead of a collection of individuals. It&#39;s fine for engineers to be critical but don&#39;t just stop there. Find fault but also offer up a solution to help the project move forward. I can&#39;t work in the type of environment the author described anymore. Now that I know functional, collaborative teams exist I will always want to be on one."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a wonderful little game. The concept and execution is extremely concise but the thing that really sealed the deal for me was noticing the escalating difficulty by making the paddles shrink."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Let me use this thread to tell this somewhat related story of mine.When I was still at university we had a C class and were doing it in a computer lab with partners (back then very few students could afford a laptop). I was always partnering up with the same friend. Since we were a bit bored with the class we started building our own pong in C.
Rendering was done in ASCII in the command line, with paddles being 3 pipes, the ball a capital 0 and the walls &#34;#&#34;. We would spend some time at the beginning of the class building/improving it and at the end playing it. We used keys like &#34;W&#34; and &#34;S&#34; for the left player and &#34;O&#34; and &#34;L&#34; for the right player. Since the initial setup with rendering and &#34;physics&#34; of the game went quite fast, we thought about how to improve it and make it more fun.What made it incredibly fun (at least for us) in the end, was the addition of bonus squares. So, between the two paddles, if the ball that you just touched hit a bonus square, it would activate an effect for you or for the game depending on the bonus. We had:
- &#34;wall&#34;, would create a 3 squares wall at the location of the bonus
- &#34;turn of the lights&#34;, would hide everything but the ball (even the paddles)
- &#34;gun&#34;, would allow you to shoot and destroy walls and bonuses
- &#34;bigger/smaller paddle&#34;, self explanatory
- &#34;net&#34;, would temporarily put a net behind you preventing you from missing the ball
- and some more, like speed up the ball, add an extra ball, etc.It&#39;s been my one and only experience building a game but I think it was the most fun I&#39;ve had programming…
If anybody is up for re-building a pong with bonuses I&#39;d be definitely up for that ;)Back on the topic: love the implementation OP, pretty addictive. And, as can be read above, it brought back some nice memories."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Another advantage to plain text files: source control. You can check your writing into git and get a history of all your edits.It’s something programmers take for granted, but it would be amazing if this got more widely adopted outside of tech. The number of files with names like “Report Final Final draft v3.docx” is truly staggering.“Git for everything“ would be a multi-billion dollar startup easily."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is one of the main strengths of Obsidian, which I have been using lately and I’m extremely happy with: everything is just Markdown files in some folder on disk. Zero danger of lock in.You can have a disk hierarchy if you desire, or trust that search will find you what you are looking for. For me search works fairly well and if I need something extra I can just grep/sed/awk.Plus it has the features that a simple text editor will not have: displaying images, live preview, relationships between topics, etc. It even has a Vim mode!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Plain text adoption often implies markdown for a richer experience, but we also have the wonderful https://orgmode.org markup.There is no shortage of markdown-based tools on all platforms. Our org markup options, on the other hand, are very few outside of Emacs. Org markup itself is super versatile and can power lots of use-cases.I built two org-powered apps for iOS myself:https://plainorg.comhttps://flathabits.comThere are other great ones out there:https://beorg.apphttps://logseq.comhttps://organice.200ok.chhttps://orgro.orghttp://orgzly.comLastly, a shoutout to Karl Voit who&#39;s been driving org markup awareness outside of Emacs with Orgdown https://gitlab.com/publicvoit/orgdown. He&#39;s also discussed org markup&#39;s strengths at https://karl-voit.at/2017/09/23/orgmode-as-markup-only"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think anyone who&#39;s claiming that remote work has been &#34;proven&#34; to be better or worse is wrong. There are some studies but they use estimations and proxies, carrying the same flaws as doing performance reviews based on lines of code.We&#39;ve proven that the big tech companies can go fully remote and not completely crash and burn, that&#39;s about it. Some people love the lack of commute and less semi-forced hanging out, some people hate onboarding on a new company as a remote person and so on and so on.I personally prefer a company where everyone&#39;s on site. I want to be able to quickly resolve any issues in person, not over voice call or slack, and I think that an environment where someone can tap me on the shoulder when they need help leads to overall higher productivity, even if individual productivity suffers temporarily."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have been fully remote my entire career (several decades), in fact in 30+ years have never been on site anywhere for more than 2 weeks total. Wouldn&#39;t have it any other way.But as a counter-point, seeing a whole bunch of people who were never remote before, how little work they are actually doing, it is no surprise to me that a lot of employers are going to start forcing - to the extent possible - employees back into the office.I think a small percentage of people are self-motivated, and more productively at home, but watching this all play out for the last 2 years makes me realize that an awful lot of people are going to try to get away with absolutely anything they can - including working as little as possible - when allowed to be on their own. I have had coworkers literally disappear for days at a time, miss meetings for weeks at a time, constantly miss deadlines etc - and as a manager, that is very hard to manage underperformers with a remote work force.Remote work isn&#39;t for everyone, and unfortunately there is a non-trivial percentage of the workforce that actual does need someone watching over them to make sure they do what they are supposed to be doing each day.Let&#39;s hope they don&#39;t ruin it for the rest of us."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve worked at a startup where everyone being there was essential in how we worked. (We were all pair programming.) It was great. It beats code reviews any day. I learned a lot.But when I was at Google, we would schedule VC meetings with people in a different part of campus just to avoid the walk. Also, I worked on teams that had people worked out in many offices, mostly not Mountain View. I was surrounded by Googlers in an open-plan office, but it was often lonely. I ate alone sometimes. It was often not worth the commute.I think Google having a company-wide policy on this is nuts. Teams vary a lot. They should probably be left to make their own decisions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This feels like a major blow, as someone who just semi recently (probably around pandemic start) started getting into purchasing flac music from indie artists, Bandcamp was a great source of music. I understand nothing will change in the short term, but long term I am very concerned. Especially as streaming becomes more dominant and companies are less willing to provide flac based music and physical discs (where I can rip my own) continue to disappear.This feels like a potential last step of true music ownership and that makes me incredibly sad.That being said if anyone knows of any place to buy flacs of music with great selection would love to know (especially for Japanese music which I generally have to import, thankfully they love CDs)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is absurdly sad to me. I like to own my media (in the most practical sense that current IP laws let me do so). I run a Plex server and use PlexAmp as my primary way of listening to music, and my criteria are always this:* FLAC or similar, I want this to be a lossless preservation of what was on the best-available source.* No DRM. No mandated player. Just let me download a dang file.* &#34;Real&#34; flac: this is technically already covered under the first bullet, but I call it out because I&#39;ve seen it happen before: if I can open the flac in audacity and see it&#39;s obviously just a re-encode of a lossy format that clips the upper and lower frequency ranges off, that&#39;s a smell and I don&#39;t like it. (I know, most people can&#39;t tell etc, but this is less for listening purposes and more for archival purposes).* Supports the artist!Now, I&#39;ll admit, when push comes to shove, I drop the last bullet point first. So previously, my source for music was:1. CD&#39;s (and I would follow What&#39;s guide for making Perfect Flacs)2. WhatBut then what shut down and I lost my main music discovery mechanism. Enter bandcamp! Now I&#39;ve been very happy with:1. Bandcamp (I buy CDs because I like the artwork and they&#39;re cool).2. CD&#39;s (+ Perfect Flac ripping guide still)Now I&#39;m not sure what to do. Epic has really soured me on their brand already, and I already boycott their launcher and any EGS exclusives. I guess I have to find some other way to get stuff now."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s been so frustrating watch this play out over the past decade.I keep seeing projects that could have been written as a traditional multi-page application pick an SPA architecture instead, with the result that they take 2-5 times longer to build and produce an end-result that&#39;s far slower to load and much more prone to bugs.Inevitably none of these projects end up taking advantage of the supposed benefits of SPAs: there are no snazzy animations between states, and the &#34;interactivity&#34; mainly consists of form submissions that don&#39;t trigger a full page - which could have been done for a fraction of the cost (in development time and performance) using a 2009-era jQuery plugin!And most of them don&#39;t spend the time to implement HTML5 history properly, so they break the URLs - which means you can&#39;t bookmark or deep link into them and they break the back/forward buttons.I started out thinking &#34;surely there are benefits to this approach that I&#39;ve not understood yet - there&#39;s no way the entire industry would swing in this direction if it didn&#39;t have good reasons to do so&#34;.I&#39;ve run out of patience now. Not only do we not seem to be learning from our mistakes, but we&#39;ve now trained up an entire new generation of web developers who don&#39;t even know HOW to build interactive web products without going the SPA route!My recommendation remains the same: default to not writing an SPA, unless your project has specific, well understood requirements (e.g. you&#39;re building Figma) that make the SPA route a better fit.Don&#39;t default to building an SPA."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think one of the unsolved problems of client-side interactivity on websites is how difficult it is to add it just a little bit of extra client-side functionality to a traditional server rendered website. For example, recently I had to deal with photo uploads on a Rails app, which works fine out of the box at first, until you want to show progress bars and uploaded previews etc. Then you add a couple of client-side Stimulus controllers, maybe a Turbo frame here and there and it works, but then you get to browser navigation and you&#39;re screwed, because none of this works if somebody were to submit the form, then navigate back. Now you have to implement lifecycle handling to account for navigation and once you&#39;re done, you&#39;ve basically implemented a SPA, except it&#39;s broken into a mix of tightly-coupled Javascript, Ruby and ERB templates."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"SPAs are a pattern that&#39;s been applied too broadly IMO, but it&#39;s going a bit far to call them a mistake. The aims of an SPA are pretty noble - the idea of essentially removing the network round trip when a user clicks on something is not a bad one. It means things are faster, they work if your connection is flaky, they can do things like offline support. Those are good features.They might not be actual requirements for a blog or a brochure site but it&#39;s not totally unreasonable for someone to want their website to work that way. The question is not whether or not an SPA is a good or a bad thing, but whether or not the cost (more code, more complexity, potentially a series of background requests after the initial page load) is worth paying in order to get the benefits.When either an SPA or a multi-page site is done well most users can&#39;t tell which sort of site they&#39;re looking at. That should be the goal. Make stuff where the user forgets about the tech. Make a website that just works, that&#39;s fast enough for users not to think &#39;this is a bit slow&#39;, and that&#39;s coded in a way you can maintain and work on for a long time. If you get those things right then no one can reasonably criticise what you&#39;ve made no matter how you&#39;ve made it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s discrimination any way you slice it. You can&#39;t lower the bar for one person without raising it for another so long as the class sizes remain the same. If elite universities are about providing education (a valid point of critical contention), then systematically barring Asians from entry is the same class of injustice litigated in Brown v. Board of Education. It&#39;s not enough to say you can learn calculus just as well at the University of Massachusetts.&#34;Here we find our first indication of the strength of preferences for underrepresented minority students. African-American students have nearly an 80 percent better chance of being admitted than their white counterparts, while the Hispanic advantage is reflected in almost 50 percent higher odds compared to whites. By contrast, Asian applicants and those from other races face lower odds of admission on the order of 17 or 18 percent—in relation to comparable whites.&#34;https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/tje/files/..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a confused by the equity claim to justify discriminatory behavior with what seems like heavy emphasis on race. It seems difficult to achieve equity without transparent, and standardized methods emphasizing a holistic assessment covering visible and invisible, immutable and mutable characteristics--each of which impact individual outcomes.I understand that tackling overrepresentation and underrepresentation is important; but, when emphasizing race to the degree that these academic institutions are, isn&#39;t this leading to representation disparities within the racial categories themselves? The racial categories are a very American centric and limited term, and arguably rooted largely as social constructs that loosely define the ethnic populations they cover. For example, and I don&#39;t mean any offense or to call any group out specifically, Koreans are overrepresented compared to Cambodians at the academic institutions listed in the article per their population proportion. This doesn&#39;t seem to be captured and accounted for under the current system. The same underlying disparity potentiality applies to whites, Blacks, Hispanics, Native Americans, etc...The interpretation being, that it&#39;s a sort of half-committed approach to equity that isn&#39;t really leading to equitable outcomes if that makes sense, and may even be exacerbating ethnic marginalization within the racial categories.Another question is, if this isn&#39;t leading to genuine equity of outcomes and instead passing discriminatory behavior onto smaller, marginalized ethnic groups, what do you do then? Do you revisit implementing an improved meritocracy system, or implement an equity based system with greater accuracy and precision to prevent this?This doesn&#39;t even begin to tackle the issues current racial categorization creates with multiracial people and the essence of &#34;purism.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Oh no! This breaks my heart. :(David and Ron Crane hired me for my first job in California right around 2000.  I had no clue who they both were we just met at a trade show and I said I was looking for a job, we had this crazy interview where we just talked about anything and everything, and voila I was working in silicon valley. I think we spent about 2 hours talking about how we could float a balloon beside an AM radio station and how light up a light bulb...Anyways, who fresh out of school doesn&#39;t work for the inventor of ethernet/fast ethernet/a core founder of 3com, etc? I only spent 2 years working with them, and I&#39;ve always been looking to work with similar talent/kindness/etc.  How they put up with a fresh grad I will never know.I remember David and I working on an SDSL project, and we were just having the worst time ever.  We couldn&#39;t get it train and finish setting up the link, it did almost everything but then just failed at the end.  It was meant to be easy....but we just couldn&#39;t figure it out.  We spent a crazy amount of time on it, maybe a month.  Finally Ron got fed up, and asked &#34;have you tried reversing the pairs?&#34; and it worked!  Turns out we had plugged the cable in backwards, and trying to streamline/debug the code had removed the final bits of cleanup code that checked if the pair was reversed.  Ah well.They were amazing mentors and friends.  David invited me over to his home for wine tastings, to meet his cats (Palo and Alto), etc. I unfortunately lost touch with him over the years as I moved, he moved, etc.Thank you David, you welcomed me to California and you&#39;ll be missed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I ran across him years ago at a shooting event (he had a very cool Steyr AUG). He was humble, down to Earth, and just a really neat guy. Amazing to think how his work impacted us all.His one conceit to vanity? The personalized plate on his older Mercedes SL coupe was something like ETHERNT, which is why I initially approached him."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"First commercial Ethernet media (1980) also was a RG-8X coaxial cable using the circa-1940 RF connector called “N” (as opposed to the F or the unthreaded RCA phono connector).You could then do “simple” vampire tap into such Ethernet RF cable to expand your network.Because the then-10Base-5 signal is a guided RF-based wire, it was originally made to allow communication in one-direction only … at a time (half-duplex). Each end of the wire had to wait their turn (just like telegraph operators did by beaconing their intent to send info by pre-sending some well-known code).Both IBM and Xerox Parc diverged into Token Bus and Star network configuration to deal with this “half-duplex” issues using the same collision backoff algorithm.I think David unknowingly cemented the IEEE 802.3 standard as a winner when he prototyped the N-backoff algorithm for upcoming 802.3 for the 802 IEEE Working Group.This half-duplex constraint of 802.3 (and 10Base-5) technology was losing out to the IBM token bus (IEEE 802.5) methodology in maximum bandwidth utilization.Of course, without this N-Backoff algorithm, 802.3 wouldn’t have made the next step of leveraging a twisted pair (precursor to 802.3 10Base-T) possible to achieve this full-duplex and modern Ethernet we know to this day. Token bus and token ring both had effectively lost out in the Ethernet “Duplex War”.While Bob Metcalf may have made it possible the 10Base-5 communications, he also got a lot of hardware help so David Bogg actually did the thinking of backoff algorithm … at hardware level. And the PARC performance team refined the backoff algorithm to near perfection.Any error are mine and mine alone.  I was close enough to that circle, others may be closer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I experienced this in the extreme recently. I&#39;m a very experienced dev in a very in-demand field. Money is not a huge priority for me in my career. Flexibility is. I have a proven track record of success in part-time roles after converting to part time at my previous company (after 2 years of full-time, of course). I spent 3+ months trying to get part-time engagements, and was willing to consider both consulting and W-2 arrangements. I got interviewed and then ghosted by two companies, was offered a laughably low rate by a third, and a fourth showed interest but then basically told me that I&#39;d need to work a 40-hour week. I know that a vocal minority has success in part-time consulting, but it&#39;s quite difficult to accomplish if you live outside of a tech hub (I&#39;m based in Central Oregon) and don&#39;t have SV connections.Contrast that with when I gave up and decided to make myself available for full-time (remote) work. In the span of about 5 weeks, I got over 200 recruiter emails, interviewed at 10 companies, and received 10 offers, mostly in the upper end of the $200k-400k range.I firmly believe that this is a cultural block, rather than one that&#39;s rooted in rational/pragmatic concerns. Tech companies want to feel like they&#39;re getting your full intellectual output, even if that&#39;s demonstrably false in the status quo. There&#39;s also this issue that gets brought up of &#34;if Bob is gone half the time, isn&#39;t that going to breed resentment with his full-time coworkers?&#34; (answer: only if you have a shitty &#34;butts in seats&#34; management culture).I honestly don&#39;t think we&#39;re going to see meaningful change in this area for a while. The 40-hour work week is something that&#39;s heavily ingrained in tech culture, to the point where certain companies&#39; &#34;perks&#34; are heavily tuned towards incentivizing you to stay at the office longer and frequently turn that 40 hours into 60. I think it will take an external disruptive event on the scale of COVID-19 in order to change this aspect of tech culture."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m working hourly on a contract where I advised the company I could only work 15-20 hours a week.  It can be a win-win I believe, but with tradeoffs for both sides.I&#39;m able to make the 3-4 hours of work a day be extremely productive.  I always deliver in fewer hours than were budgeted for the work.  As a contractor, there are no extraneous meetings to slow me down.  But I&#39;m still involved in client meetings as needed, understand their needs, and take ownership of the codebase to my immense satisfaction.It&#39;s not very different than working &#34;full time&#34; from home where you might take a walk, run an errand, cook your lunch, etc., but I can flex the schedule even further without any guilt.  The change in mindset from &#34;taking a break from full-time work&#34; for an errand versus &#34;I&#39;m not billing this hour, I&#39;ll do whatever I want&#34; is empowering.The negatives: less pay in total for me (but hourly rate can be negotiated), and features might (but won&#39;t necessarily) get done more slowly in terms of calendar days.BTW a typical day might be:- daycare drop-off 9:30, exercise- 10:30 shower, chores, life tasks- 11:45 cook and eat lunch- 12:30-4:30 work with a break for walking or playing pianoI do some &#34;down time&#34; thinking about problems as I fall asleep at night or on walks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Two big reasons off the top of my head:1. Two people working a 20h week does not mean the same costs as a single person working a 40h week (think payroll, software licensing, pension admin, healthcare, etc).So costs rise as a result.2. A job generally has a base load of admin and toil (communication, on-call, interviewing, PR reviews, etc) and you can&#39;t reduce or distribute the base load well enough to yield productive output from the remaining work time with part-time workers and some of this adds more toil when distributed across more people (i.e. on-call requires more handovers during the week and takes more communication).So productivity is reduced.*For companies to consider doing this they&#39;d need to perform an trial to satisfy themselves that the above can be overcome. But even doing that may not be possible with existing employees and risks instilling discontent amongst those not in the trial. It&#39;s high risk to try.* Unless the entire company is 100% part-time and somehow base load is fundamentally reworked, in which case #1 still applies."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"You might want to check stuff like virtual office service, incorporation in an EU country, they start really cheap, as well as getting a VPS to bounce from. And stuff like Electronic Money Institutes for at least some really basic banking.Fair warning though, some of these things look rather shady so use some common sense and be careful with your local legislation (See MrDisposables response)edit: To elaborate on the last part see what happened in Kazakhstan recently. Their outage lasted luckily only shortly but you might not have to think about only western sanction but also Russias distaste for VPNs as well as the possibility for having your internet cut. Sure Kazakhstan is a lot smaller in terms of internet infrastructure, but there didnt seem to have been a way around their shutdown. You are then only left with satellite as well as maybe coverage from the neighboring countries. Both getting really expensive with a devaluing currency and at high threat of sanctions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article hits on something I&#39;ve felt for a long time. The idea that &#34;hooks are superior&#34; to me is ridiculous. If a linter is required to tell me when I&#39;m writing a bug that is not immediately obvious, that is a failing in the framework to round those edges. Lints are not rounded edges!Solid is nice and _seems_ to fix the issues with hooks, but as another comment mentioned, the challenge is with building at scale. It&#39;s unclear to me how this scales and where the sharp edges are.React IMO trades off performance in exchange for ergonomics. These ergonomics bear fruit early on, but you start dealing with this debt very quickly. As &#34;nice&#34; as Redux is, I shouldn&#39;t need it so early. React is designed in a way that results in pretty terrible performance. I once wrote a React app, and discovered perf issues 2 weeks in. Any UI framework I used in the past would have scaled beyond this point without having to have the data layer rewritten. Frameworks of the past also had what seemed like way less &#34;magic&#34;.I totally accept that it&#39;s seriously nice to write, but how many trees has React alone burnt?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"New JS frameworks always make for compelling hello world examples.Can you branch on state or use loops over data in Solid.js? The reason _why_ React has a virtual DOM is to enable more interesting relationships between your data and your presentation. Anyone can make a framework that makes the source code for an incrementing number look pretty!As an example of this point, check out the &#34;Simple Todos&#34; example for Solid.js[1].In React, we render lists by using regular JavaScript idioms like loops, arrays, and array methods like map. However in Solid.js, much like traditional templating languages, we get a construct like &lt;For&gt; that reinvents a concept that&#39;s already in the language.I&#39;ve been writing React and React-alike code for a long time. I think that fine-grained updates avoiding reconciliation are a good idea, especially for performance. At one point, I built a React-like library for Roblox and Lua whose most novel feature ended up being &#34;Bindings&#34;[2], which look sorta like Solid.js state containers. They create little hot-path data dependencies, but the bulk of your components still use normal React-like rendering.  [1]: https://www.solidjs.com/examples/todos
  [2]: https://roblox.github.io/roact/advanced/bindings-and-refs/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve used React for ~3 years, primarily with function components and hooks. I think that hooks were a wonderful addition and I think the framework has made smart choices with checking object equality to decided if components re-render.That said, I think that easily the most difficult aspects of react revolve around how re-renders are triggered. Maintaining referential equality to stop unnecessary renders gets tricky when you are passing functions or objects. Suddenly you need to be using `useMemo` and `useCallback` and passing dependency lists that all have to be primitive values unless you want to memoize them as well. It can become such a headache that the official line around it mostly seems to be &#34;make the render fast, don&#39;t worry about unnecessary re-renders&#34; – good advice, until you hit a use-case where you need to worry.Solid takes these problems and just vanishes them. UI state knows what its dependencies are automatically and only updates when they change – even in a sub-component level!To be fair, I&#39;ve never used Solid in anger, and moving to it would be a big ask when there is such a good ecosystem built up around react. That said it is easily one of the most exciting projects on my radar, and the developer Ryan Carniato seems extremely knowledgeable in the area."</p>

I was assured that my experience was unique and not widespread. I am both sad and happy to see this, sad because it exists, happy because it is getting some attention here at HN.I would like to take this opportunity to point out that everyone of us needs to be vigilant about this type of racism. One thing I recommend to my hiring managers is to not allow people from frictioned backgrounds to manage and interview people from the other side. Example problematic pairs for candidates/interviewers (not including the cast situation) include: Indians and Pakistanis, Serbians and Bosnians, Greeks and Turks, Chinese and Japanese.One way I solve this is by introducing an independent observer/participant when situations like this emerge. This is costly but it has really worked to not only address this problem but also created an amazing diversity in my teams because it takes care of some of the implicit bias we all have to some degree."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; A pat on the shoulder might be a friendly greeting—or a search for a sacred thread that some dominant-caste Hindu men wear beneath their shirtsI&#39;m a non-dalit Indian working in silicon valley. I know that caste based discrimination is still prevalent in India and not surprised that it continues in here in silicon valley as well amongst Indian community but I&#39;m surprised to read this part in the article. I have never heard of someone doing a scan for sacred thread. Also, it&#39;s worth noting that most non-dalit people also do not wear this sacred thread so whoever is doing this scan isn&#39;t familiar with India or probably this part is made up in the article.That said, I know that it&#39;s much harder for a dalit person to progress in India as the society still tries to pull them behind. Indian govt has reservations in colleges and jobs for dalit community, which I believe has helped the community a lot in last 50 years or so, helping many to bring their families out of poverty. But, still there&#39;s a long way to go. Also, a long way to go for non-dalit community to abolish this discrimination.My heart goes with our dalit brothers &amp; sisters and glad to hear that their issues are being discussed in silicon valley as well now."</p>

The checkbox hack is decent in a few places (though I’d say &lt;details&gt; is normally a better choice now, and the checkbox hack should be accompanied by certain ARIA properties and augmented with some JavaScript to twiddle properties as it’s used), but dark mode is not one of them. The checkbox hack is only suitable for transient state that you actively don’t want to persist over page loads. Probably the most popular historical application of it is hamburger menus (but &lt;details&gt; or `:hover, :focus-within` are better for that now). I think a more reasonable solution for dark mode is the media query (prefers-color-scheme: dark), following the browser preference by default and augmented by JavaScript to allow overriding that. https://chrismorgan.info/blog/dark-theme-implementation/ describes my own implementation, which is the most comprehensive and efficient client-side-only implementation that I know of, as perfect as it’s possible to be while being client-side-only and without getting into service workers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"2 (Sidebar) is not usable on mobile, because there is no good hover event. Since mobile-first is almost a necessity, it won&#39;t work this way.Accordions make most sense as a table of contents, although they are often used in FAQs. But in FAQs, you can&#39;t use the browser&#39;s search on page to find collapsed words. So you trade better scrollability for searching on the page. Not sure how many people use &#34;search on page&#34; on mobile devices though.1 + 3 are great though."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"F-droid gets many things right (e.g. verifiable builds), but it&#39;s just not usable in practice.Installing applications is a rare event, updating them is frequent, and needs to disrupt the user as little as possible. Android used to not allow alternative app stores to update apps without user interaction, but now supports this through UPDATE_PACKAGES_WITHOUT_USER_ACTION, which doesn&#39;t seem to be supported by F-droid. So it&#39;s manual clicking for each update.F-droid also somehow gets the regular update flow wrong and often (always?) shows an error when you try to install the update from the notification. That has remained unfixed for years. So you have to manually open it, initiate the update, then click through the dialogs.Additionally, the official repos update so slowly that they&#39;re useless for fast-moving stuff like NewPipe.Together with Android bugs like https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/204233247 (resetting all &#34;open with&#34; URIs on update), this makes using packages installed through F-Droid a nightmare."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"App developer&#39;s perspective.  I have a few apps on all major places, including F-Droid.  The &#39;no user accounts&#39; thing makes developing and distributing on F-Droid a freeing experience, as compared to the G/A &#39;jails&#39;.  There is no pressure to meet arbitrary undocumented restrictions, you are not subject to the whims of dehumanizing AI routines, there are no ratings and reviews (the feedback is direct). The build and deployment process is not really my problem, as part of their Reproducible Builds, even that aspect is taken care of. https://f-droid.org/en/docs/Reproducible_Builds/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I tried something like this once and it worked surprisingly well, even for a UGC site.Years back we were doing something that included users documenting TV shows. We had a big meeting where people put every feature they wanted on index cards. We laid the cards out a founder&#39;s dining room table. The host got their change jar and each person got a certain number of pennies to mark features they thought were vital for first launch.After the first round of token-voting, the &#34;user accounts&#34; card had no votes. At first it seemed impossible. But after some discussion, we realized that viewing users didn&#39;t need accounts for launch. For people who wanted to edit, we let them type in a name to take credit for their contributions if they wanted, but with no verification. At worst, we figured we could add something more robust if the need were stronger.It turned out fine. The launch got out earlier and we got to test a number of key product hypotheses without having to build any sort of user account system. Months later it did eventually become the highest priority. But not having accounts worked way longer than I expected."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The real reason RISC-V is succeeding, relative to ARM:If you make your own CPU- With ARM, You have to pay ARM for ISA license (after a several months long negotiation), and you cannot license your CPU design to anyone, as ARM has the exclusive right to do that with their designs.- With RISC-V, you get a free ISA license, and you can license your CPU design to others.If you do not make your own CPU- With ARM, you can (after a several months long negotiation) license one of the few designs ARM has available. There&#39;s no other vendors that can offer you ARM CPU designs.- With RISC-V, right now, you can license any among hundreds of options available, from tens of vendors. The licensing process is usually very short and straightforward. Alternatively, there are some open hardware designs. You can get commercial support for some of them.Frankly, unless ARM does radically change their business model, I do not expect them to survive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I follow some of the writings of Nassim Taleb. I came to the conclusion that RISC-V will &#34;succeed&#34; because there&#39;s no way for it to fail. It&#39;s like Linux.I don&#39;t think licensing fees to ARM are a problem per se, it&#39;s the &#34;frictional costs&#34; that it introduces. My understanding is that the Raspberry Pi developed their RP2040 because ARM had a reasonable package available for its low-end Cortex-M processors, which doesn&#39;t apply to their higher-end Cortex ones.RISC-V doesn&#39;t even have these restrictions. Even extremely small outfits can play around with RISC-V designs. Most of them won&#39;t go very far, but with enough lottery tickets, one of them is bound to draw the winning numbers.Sure there are considerable obstacles. I toy with microcontrollers. For hobbyists like me, ARM processors are still the most sensible choice. I&#39;m not expecting any shift from that for at least five years. But who knows after that? Anything can happen."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I work with RISC-V these days.many AI chips are using RISC-V.A non-technical perspective about RISC-V: China is leading to some extent in RISC-V land(Sifive works with Hifive in China, Alibaba released its RISC-V,etc). China could not license x86, could not acquire MIPS, tried to get part of ARM now(the China ARM company is fighting with ARM), but the big land needs to &#34;own&#34; a CPU core at will desperately, RISC-V fits perfectly well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Long ago, I, like many Unix fans, thought that fork(2) and the fork-exec process spawning model were the greatest thing, and the Windows sucked for only having exec() and _spawn(), the last being a Windows-ism.I appreciate this quite a bit. Vocal Unix proponents tend to believe that anything Unix does is automatically better than Windows, sometimes without even knowing what the Windows analogue is. Programming in both is necessary to have an informed opinion on this subject.The one thing I miss most on Unix: the unified model of HANDLEs that enables you to WaitOnMultipleObjects() with almost any system primitive you could want, such as an event with a socket (blocking I/O + a shutdown notification) in one call. On Unix, a flavor of select() tends to be the base primitive for waiting on things to happen, which means you end up writing adapter code for file descriptors to other resources, or need something like eventfd.Things I don&#39;t miss from Windows at all: wchar_t everywhere. :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Good, this should be standard.I don&#39;t  understand how you can have a labor market where only one side has information on what the salaries are for an industry through a team that does market research. It depresses wages, mostly for internal employees who aren&#39;t paying attention bc they&#39;re content with their jobs.Price transparency leads to more efficient markets, no reason the labor market is any different. A company hiring an employee under market rate, because the employee doesn&#39;t know what market rate is, is a failure.EDIT: Wanted to add that this hits closer to home for me b/c I&#39;ve personally experienced this.Went out and jumped companies and got a 300% raise b/c I was underpaid at the prev, only know that thanks to levels.fyi. New hires at my level were making almost double what I was.When other engineers at my current company talk about salary, or total comp more generally, they vastly underestimate the state of the market."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a candidate, I hate applying to jobs only to get a lowball offer at the end. So I appreciate bills like this.As a hiring manager, I see that this is actually not so simple. You give someone a range, say $100-150k. I ASSURE you that they are thinking they are closer to 150k than 100. So good luck giving an offer for $100k, even though that might be what that particular candidate is worth to you.It&#39;s never gonna happen, but what i&#39;d rather see is an option to instead give current median total comp on the team i&#39;m interviewing for, plus maybe the 25-75 percentile range. That gives me a sense of what I should expect, plus what the salary growth path might be."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"this is one of those ostensibly good ideas that has some downsides which are often not discussed - the main one of which, is salary depression.Forcing employers to publish salaries on job ads will inevitably lead to wide salary bands (lets see how absurd they get) with a low ceiling on the upper tier. Employers know that if they publish a high number, job candidates are naturally going to want to shoot for it, and would be disappointed if they got significantly less than the maximum advertised, compromising offer acceptance rates. Hence employers will set a lower &#39;maximum&#39; salary than they might actually pay if the salary was hidden.See UK public sector for evidence of this; salaries must be published, maximum is always significantly lower than equivalent job in private sector."</p>
