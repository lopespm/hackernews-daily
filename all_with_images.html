								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One nice thing I recognized is that the generated RSS feed contains full html text. I wish more blogging platforms are like this; save a lot of effort for feed readers.I&#39;d also recommend to add open graph meta for the blog posts. Presumably people will want to share the posts somewhere; a nice set of open graph metas goes a long way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Content in mataroa blogs is unfiltered and unmonitored. Users are free to publish any combination of words and pixels. However, content of animosity or disparagement of an individual or a group on account of a group characteristic such as race, colour, national origin, sex, disability, religion, or sexual orientation will be taken down immediately.&gt;If one notices something along those lines in a mataroa blog please let us know at admin@mataroa.blog.There should probably be something explicit in there about what kinds of pornography is allowed on the site. Also, the first part of the paragraph seems contradicted by the second: I would say users aren&#39;t really free to publish any combination of words given the sentence that follows.P.S. it looks like a great service"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was using and loved mataroa. It was the fairest, most painless option I had found for blogging (as of 2020.) I eventually switched away from it because the default font was small and I couldn’t change it. I wonder if this has been updated since. (At the moment, I’m hosting my blog as a static site with NFS. I go back and forth about wanting comments/email sign-up.)The developers were nice though, and I used their source code to learn Django. Really grateful."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My time to shine! I work in music distribution.The Apple Music style guide is a great and accessible place to look if you&#39;re interested in music metadata: https://help.apple.com/itc/musicstyleguide/en.lproj/static.h...DDEX is the set of metadata standards used across the music industry: https://ddex.net/Also worth knowing that not all content on streaming services is music! Some of it is spoken word, ASMR, non-music field recordings, etc. The difference between sound and music is subjective of course though.On an artistic note, music can of course be presented in an infinite amount of ways. Not all these can be represented (i.e., re-presented) on streaming platforms. Installations and generative music for example. That&#39;s ok! To be able to represent all this music (and non-music) requires restrictions, otherwise we wouldn&#39;t be able to create programs for it in the first place.Sometimes restrictions on sound content are to make the streaming services friendlier to use, like the formatting of featured artists in titles. Royalty laws put restrictions on the handling of different roles, like songwriters and composers.BUT nothing is stopping you from building your own way of representing music digitally, so long as you follow relevant laws."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a reason why MusicBrainz SQL schema looks like what it looks like, after years of careful simplification to achieve an optimum approximation of reality.https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Database/Schema10+ years ago at Zvooq, during the golden age of music metadata and recsys startups, we tried to really solve entity resolution in the domain. I&#39;ve never seen another streaming service make an honest attempt at this, even at Spotify with their 2014 acquihire of the Echo Nest. You still get Utada and Hikaru Utada as ~completely separate entities"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I understand &#34;horrible&#34; in this case in a somewhat lighthearted sense. But it points to a tendency to simplify cultural complexity in the interest of &#34;legibility&#34; from the system perspective. The same diversity of cases need to be accommodated in much design done for, say, a diverse country like India where though urban populace me be English savvy, rural populace aren&#39;t necessarily so ... And even in urban areas local language and culture dominates.A place this diversity crops up most commonly is the so called &#34;standard&#34; firstname middlename lastname fields. This just doesn&#39;t work in India where people may have even 7 components to their names ... and who are you, dear system developer, to dictate what their name should be like.The name structure diversity I understand is a problem for Europe too with hyphenated names. This brilliant sketch by Fry and Laurie says it all - https://youtu.be/1LopIroSjsU"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been using Windows for about two years. Just this morning, when I booted into Windows, the boot loader (or whatever you call the part before Windows is fully loaded) prompted me saying I need to finish setting up. The only options were &#34;accept&#34; or &#34;remind me in 3 days&#34;, so I accepted. Then it asked me to change my default browser to Edge. Apparently &#34;finish setting up&#34; means &#34;we don&#39;t like that you are using Firefox&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On the one hand, WSL has made Windows truly viable as a developer platform. But on the other hand, this sort of aggressive marketing bullshit makes it such an unfriendly place to be. I want my computer to treat me as an adult. Since it increasingly doesn&#39;t, I did the adult thing and walked away. If a relationship turns abusive, one must leave.I would love to be able to pay for &#34;Windows Professional&#34; or something to get rid of this bullshit. But I guess my eyeballs are more valuable than my dollars. In that case, MS will get neither.I moved back to Linux two months ago because of shit like this. Good riddance. Thankfully wine acts as the WSL for Linux, and makes the migration possible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google started doing this with their search. And still does, regardless of how many times I say &#34;I&#39;m not interested&#34;. And as someone else mentioned here, Safari does the same.And Microsoft follows suit.Irritating as all hell, but complaints hit HN front page only when it comes to Microsoft.I do wish, though, that Microsoft would take the moral high ground."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Howdy. My name is Dave Martin. I&#39;m the CEO of WordPress.com.VM (Sorry, I don&#39;t know your full name) thank you for sharing your concerns. Comments aren&#39;t open on your blog, so I&#39;ll weigh in with a few thoughts below. I&#39;m happy to chat more about any of this in the comments below, or you can reach out to me directly via email dave.martin (at) automattic.com.You&#39;re right to call us out. I did a poor job of sharing context around why we are making change, so I can see how they could come as a shock. I&#39;m sorry! That&#39;s on me.Yes, as of this week we&#39;ve gone from 5 plans down to just 2. That said, we&#39;re not done making changes. This was the first of a couple of phases of changes.Those 5 older plans that you mentioned were the culmination of like 10 years worth of plans and features sort of haphazardly being added to WordPress.com with no real strategy. With those older plans, it was really hard for customers to see at-a-glance why they should choose one plan over another.Let me address a couple of the things you mentioned in your post:- No older sites/blogs have been affected by these new price changes. If your site is on an older plan, there should have been no changes to your billing.- As you pointed out, we have historically adjusted our subscription plan prices in a number of regional areas to ensure that WordPress.com stays affordable for folks in those areas. We will continue to do so. Looks like we forgot to do this for the new Pro plan. Thanks for calling this to our attention! We will get this updated ASAP.- Traffic limits will only be enforced on the honor system. If you consistently go over the cap month after month, we will let you know and ask you to pay a tiny bit more to cover the cost, but we will NEVER shut off access to your site, nor will we ever auto-increase the amount you&#39;re paying.- Our mission still remains to democratize publishing. We have no intention of ever removing older sites from WordPress.com. Even if you had a custom domain that expired, your site will always have a default WordPress.com sub-domain and your content isn&#39;t going anywhere.- The Pro plan you see now (at $15/mo) is essentially the the exact same plan as the old Business plan (which used to cost $25/mo). The only difference being the default storage that is available and a cost savings to customers of $10/mo.- We will be announcing affordable add-ons for both the free plan and the Pro plan to extend both your traffic and your storage as needed. In fact, we plan to also add a handful of affordable add-ons to the free plan to make it easy for customers to pick and choose which additional functionality they want, without needing to upgrade to the Pro plan.Again, thank you for sharing. I&#39;m sorry that I did a poor job of publicly sharing context around these changes, prior to making them. Please let me know if you have any additional questions or concerns."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the features WordPress.com doesn&#39;t offer on a free plan is a proper backup that can be restored to another WordPress instance. Posts/Pages/Comments and Media can be exported, separately, but for a proper backup you need to fork over $180.I have an old site on their $13/yr custom domain plan that I&#39;m probably going to let die this year because I don&#39;t wish to keep paying for it and it&#39;s not worth that hassle to restore to its original state on my own server."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Forgive me for this digression and for sounding selfish, but as a junior, I’ve really struggled for the last 2+ years to fully adapt to remote / hybrid working.I’m wondering if anyone has advice on how I can continue to grow and become a top-class engineer within a remote environment?Based on my experience so far, it’s very difficult to both onboard and mentor a junior from a remote setting. It’s not impossible, however, a lot of employers / teams still have not setup effective means for including and training the less experienced members of the team. I realise that much of this learning is of my own responsibility but I really, really miss spending time with my team and learning from those more experienced than I. I feel as though I have stagnated an awful lot over the last two years and there’s only so far self-learning can take you when software engineering is such a collaborative process."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Same. Half the people we hired during work from home are remote (that was never allowed before). Now all meetings are on zoom and all conversations are on slack. Being in an office is beyond pointless. It wastes time, gas, etc. the main take away from the past 2 years is working in an office is beyond stupid (at least for certain careers like developers). I drive to work, communicate with no one except on the computer, then drive home. So so so stupid."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is the most frustrating part of being forced back to the Bay Area. Even before the pandemic, we always had distributed meetings, with people calling in from various buildings, conference rooms, phone booths, etc.So nothing changes between last month and this month, except that managers get peace-of-mind knowing I’m calling in from somewhere on the premises, and I’m back living in a place where I can’t afford a house.(I did have previous jobs where we worked on hard technical problems, and spending face-to-face time with a couple colleagues hashing out solutions at a whiteboard was invaluable. But that is not my FAANG job, where the whiteboards are rarely used for anything other than interview questions.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I remember many years ago coming across a reimplementation of the server side for a popular MMORPG of the time, reverse-engineered from the client (which was Flash) by what was likely a teenager --- it was over 100k lines in a single file, written in Visual Basic. Global variables everywhere, short names, and not even indentation. All the account data was stored in flat files, there was no actual DB. No &#34;best practices&#34; at all. Yet, not surprisingly, it worked pretty well and was actually not difficult to modify --- Ctrl+F would easily get you to the right place in the code.I guess the moral is, never underestimate what determination and creativity can do, and always be skeptical when someone says there&#39;s only one best way to do something."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Back in the days at Zynga, there was this ritual that new members of the STG (Shared Tech Group, which developed the game engine stack) had to try to refactor the road logic code.Suffice it to say, it&#39;s a 28k LOC file that was so bad, it could even hold up in court as evidence that a South American company stole the code of Zynga&#39;s -ville games. We could reproduce each and every single bug and its effects 1:1 in their games, with all the crashing scenarios that were easy to reproduce, hard to debug, and almost impossible to fix.Once you dig into the hole of depth sorting and being smart by &#34;just slicing&#34; everything into squared ground tiles on the fly, there&#39;s no way out of that spaghetti code anymore.Fun times, was always a joy seeing people give up to a single code file. The first step to enlightenment was always resignation :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So afraid to write bad, spaghetti code, I ended up writing no code at all.This thread made me realize that it&#39;s better to have a working profitable project with bad code, than a perfect unfinished  project, with meticulously chosen design patterns.Afraid   of being judged for bad code, I could not start until I had the right architecture.I&#39;m glad I read this.This is developers therapy."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This reminds me of the story one of my university teachers used to introduce himself. He was the most brilliant educator I&#39;ve had, really passionate about making sure people could actually follow and so humble. The course was called &#34;Digital and Computer Technology&#34; and it was a first year course teaching you to build a CPU starting from logic gates and then program it with assembly.He said that when he had recently graduated and just moved from Norway to Sweden his first job here was as a technician for the local railway. One of his first assignments was a call where the computer controlling all the track switches had stopped working. Luckily there was a backup, but they needed him to fix it immediately.He arrived, took a look at the computer and its backup running next to it. He started out by measuring voltages on both, comparing to see what the difference was. After a while some men in suits came in and asked how things were going. He said it was all good, they said it wasn&#39;t because now all trains had stopped. Apparently, he had short circuited the backup.&#34;And that&#39;s when I decided to go for a theoretical career!&#34; My teacher happily concluded. The classroom was left in a stunned silence."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While having algorithms and computers dictating every aspect of train movements, crew scheduling, resource allocation is efficient and in a sense optimal, I think there&#39;s something compelling to be said about having a system that can survive with human-rememberable patterns when such an optimizer fails.   That it can fall back on (or have at the core) simple patterns that people can still operate without algorithmic intervention.  I.e. the algorithmic tuning enhances at the edges, and isn&#39;t at its core some tangled non-interpretable system that someone can&#39;t operate without computer assistance.  The idea of a protected set of core routes and staffing patterns that operates without having to be computer-determined?I used to be so impressed at European train stations that they had a single sheet that would give the entire day&#39;s arrivals and departures, down to which track.   I assume that behind that were schedules that weren&#39;t so far from being hand-calculated with equivalent sheets that told people and equipment where to be at what times.I think we lose something when we jump so far forward that you cannot fall back gracefully without a system completely breaking down."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reminds me of when the entire Swiss train network shut down in 2005[0]This was, however, not due to a computer glitch, but problems in SBB&#39;s electrical grid, which lead to overload of some of the lines and then to a complete shutdown of the entire grid.Warnings were displayed on control consoles, but were drowned in 1000s of other meaningless warnings (there&#39;s a lesson for an UI designer here).I was in the ICE from Basel to Zurich at the time and after fuming for a few minutes I figured: &#34;What can you do?&#34; and moved to the bar wagon. There we had something of an impromptu party until there was no more power for the cash register and they stopped sales.In the end it was a (relatively) funny adventure for most and a huge embarrassment for SBB. I don&#39;t think they like to be reminded of that faithful day.[0] https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-train-network-shuts-down/..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m not sure a lot people know that Albini ended up washing his hands of his work with Nirvana. After the recordings were wrapped and the mixes were done, Kurt was really unhappy with some of the sounds. If memory serves it was the vocals and the bass. They ended up doing some overdubs and sharpening things up in the low end in mastering. The very thing Albini specifically said he didn&#39;t want them to do. I personally think the results speak for themselves. In Utero is a FANTASTIC rock record. I can&#39;t help but wonder what the original would have sounded like though..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a great letter. My favorite piece of writing from Albini is &#34;The Problem with Music&#34; [https://thebaffler.com/salvos/the-problem-with-music] in which he explains how record companies were screwing artists in vivid detail, numbers included. The first two paragraphs alone are worth reading."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Other than a few technical details, most of it seems to me like DIY punk cliches and goes on much too long. But I guess they know the business better than I do, hired Albini, and made a hit record, if that&#39;s what they wanted.I though the sound on In Utero was too glossy. Listen to live Nirvana, including their official live album. Nothing in a studio, by anyone, can compare and with the live material available it has no reason to exist.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhYNe6yu0JMhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGc8jL4dzaoAdmit it - you were sleeping. Was it for years? Now you&#39;re awake again."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is pretty common actuallyAt Facebook too there was no staging environment. Engineers had their dev VM and then after PR review things just went into prodThat said features and bug fixes were often times gated by feature flags and rolled out slowly to understand the product/perf impact betterThis is how we do it at my current team too…for all the same reasons that OP states"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article has some very weird trade-offs.They can&#39;t spin up test environments quickly, so they have windows when they cannot merge code due to release timing. They can&#39;t maintain parity of their staging environments with prod, so they forswear staging environments. These seem like infrastructure problems that aren&#39;t addressing the same problem as the staging environment eo ipso.They&#39;re not arguing that testing or staging environments are bad, they&#39;re just saying their organization couldn&#39;t manage to get them working. If they didn&#39;t hit those roadblocks in managing their staging environments, presumably they would be using them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This works for services that are growing slowly in features or have few other services integrating with it. I’m not sure how this scales when there are multiple services across multiple teams with dependencies on one another where services are being rapidly developed with new features. At work, we have staging/pre-prod environments across most teams that my team works with so new features can be tested in staging and other teams can test integrating with it. This is also possible to do with just a production environment but requires some engineering effort to add feature flags and special headers indicating a request is from a team looking to try a new API."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Having been an interviewer at a FAANG for many years, I can explain some of the logic behind it. I&#39;m not saying this logic is valid, but it&#39;s how we got here, imho.First: we no longer trust the hiring manager alone, because probably they aren&#39;t a strong developer. We instead trust strong developers that are well trained at evaluating good devs. At the same time, we don&#39;t want to thrust a dev onto a hiring manager, so they also need to interview you too and have a say.Second: Is it really fair to have just one or two developers evaluate you? When I first was an interviewer, I liked everybody! I would have hired them all. So getting multiple data points matters. Best to have at least a couple dev interviews.Then there&#39;s the whole problem of needing to evaluate you on multiple dimensions. Can one interview really tell if you&#39;re good problem solving, coding, algorithms/data structures, and any specialization the role has? What about the soft skills aspect? We&#39;re going to need to have at least 3 or 4 interviews to cover all these aspects. These roles pay a huge sum of money, so there&#39;s a lot of worry that someone will be hired who doesn&#39;t really meet the bar, you know?But now we have a bigger problem: if we&#39;re going to invest 4+ people to spend an hour of time with you each, we&#39;d better have some data points that you&#39;re worth that investment. So maybe we need one or two initial interviews ahead of time to weed out any obviously unlikely candidates.After that, it&#39;s every other company going &#34;Oh shit, Amazon does 6 interviews? We should do that too!&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Tech is very cargo cultish, which comes from having a young average age, and a strong survivorship bias in the media. Remember the Google brainteasers? Fizzbuzz? &#34;Culture fit&#34;?Tech companies have the lowest infrastructure costs of any industry, and so they have no place to hang their risk aversive paranoia except on personnel (the safer you are, the more trivial the things you fear).There&#39;s nothing logical about it, but since they have to fear something, it&#39;ll be whatever some douchebag with a following puts in their next &#34;XYZ considered harmful&#34; blog post."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hiring manager here. IMO the current tech hiring norms are gross and not sustainable. It feels like a weird hazing ritual and with the current market, is the single biggest reason you can&#39;t hire. Why on earth would someone burn a weekend on a take-home test for your startup when they have 15 other irons in the fire? At my current employer we got rid of all that ridiculousness. No take home test. No live coding. We&#39;ve gotten the whole process down to a few hours over a few days. I&#39;d like to think it&#39;s a mutually respectful process.I think it&#39;s time we accept that the person we are talking to is who they say they are on their resume. You don&#39;t see accountants balancing books before they get hired. Why should this be any different? If you aren&#39;t who you say you are, its either blatantly obvious in the interview or we&#39;ll find out when you join and we&#39;ll try to correct or part ways. This is like pretty much any other job out there."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s crazy that me jailbreaking a device voids its warranty, but companies can make these kinds of updates without any real consequence.Customers should have the right to return a device any time if they don&#39;t like a particular update to the product. I know it&#39;s drastic, but if companies can turn what should be a basic device into an amorphous system that starts serving ads without the end-users consent after purchase, that should constitute a material change to the end product that was not appropriately advertised.This is the exact kind of thing that consumer protection laws should be able to cover."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sadly it&#39;s a logical and inevitable consequence of giving up control over our technology.I think the answer has to be, simply never buy a TV that you wouldn&#39;t be completely satisfied with as a dumb HDMI display. Cos even if it&#39;s not abuse like this, eventually the built in functionality will break, or become too insecure to keep active on your network.In fact it goes for just about any appliance these days: whether it&#39;s your fridge, microwave, dryer, doorbell or anything else, if it doesn&#39;t have a &#34;dumb&#34; offline mode where you are still completely happy with what it does, don&#39;t buy it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’m bothered by the description of the history of “junk” dna. Going by this article dna, researchers labeled it junk just because they couldn’t analyze it well and prioritized the easier 92% and thus didn’t understand it. Calling it junk just seems like trying to compensate for not understanding it like “I don’t understand it but that’s fine because it’s junk anyway”And the scientist quote seems so wrong. if missing almost 10% of something when that ~10% is not like the other 90% then it seems like a very bad assumption to assume that it doesn’t show a lot of important features.The quote: “ You would think that, with 92 percent of the genome completed long ago, another eight percent wouldn’t contribute much“"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Now on to the more important challenge. Making our understanding of the human genome more diverse and less specific to certain geographic areas. This is already having an impact in studies, drug development, etc based on genomics.Investing in organizations such as H3Africa will be important."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"“As it is assumed that there is an even distribution of bugs through all software, it is safe to consider any piece of software to be bug free once a certain number of bugs have been found”Lol genius. Anyone else ever do that thing where you write some good code and it works the first time you test it, but somehow that makes you feel less confident. Other times you write some crap code and it has several immediately found bugs but weirdly you emotionally feel more confident in that code because you “fixed” the bugs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Blockchain can help with this. We can record all defects on the blockchain and have tamper proof evidence of those who consistently fail to adhere to this RFC. It will encourage developers to write bug proof code everywhere. Employers can further encourage developers to stop writing bugs by docking the gas fees from their paycheck. This works doubly so on devs who are blockchain &#34;non-believers&#34; because they desperately will not want to contribute to the heat death of our planet. (Those people clearly don&#39;t get the bigger picture. The colossal waste of energy will obviously be offset by the fact that code throughout the world will no longer have bugs and people will be more efficient.)This seems like it could be the one of the best thing to ever happen to the software industry in decades and has no possible chance of unintended consequences."</p>

We all know that it was some mistake by some AI. Even the author knows that.But we also know that the only way to get customer support from YouTube is to get some social media outrage.It&#39;s so common, Google should put on their website: &#34;If you need customer support, please try to create some outrage on social media. We do not provide other channels of customer support.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A video of myself and my kids singing a &gt;100 year old shanty was flagged on YouTube for DMCA.A modern folk art drawing I made of a squid was blocked on Instagram for a content violation. I joked that the AI must be afraid of tentacles. The only explanation that made sense was that it looked vaguely phallic in the way that any of nature&#39;s &#34;bulbed cylinders&#34; do, but even that seemed like a stretch -- I should think they would have flagged an earlier painting of mushrooms.The lesson is to make everything look like a butt in a thong. None of the content moderation anywhere seems to have a problem with butts in thongs. Bulbed cylinders: bad. Smooshed jiggle orbs: good. Just no nipples."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not saying this is what&#39;s happening here, but here&#39;s a playbook I could see behind it:1. Automatic/ML/AI/buzzword filtering that is, in blunt terms, kinda crappy2. Preemptively and diligently correct for any such crappy decisions that would result in PR nightmares or credible lawsuits3. Apply some portion of your effort to reviewing some portion of the cases that appeal. Hope (nudge nudge, wink wink) that those cases that you couldn&#39;t review, because you simply don&#39;t have the resources to review everything in depth, are those of your &#34;enemies.&#34; You&#39;re not suppressing them; you just didn&#39;t have the resources to help them.Result: The system punishes your enemies by design and you and your enemies can just blame the AI and your front line support, which everyone already loves to do. People who are suspicious can be painted as nutjobs, because it&#39;s obviously just the unfortunate but classic case of the little guy against the giant indifferent bureaucracy.Thus any sufficiently influential entity can wield Hanlon&#39;s Razor as a weapon. You don&#39;t event need to plan for this; it is bound to happen. Parts 1. and 2. happening are foregone conclusions. When the opportunity for part 3. arises, I think people in all levels of the organization would quickly and tacitly realize that uneven review is in their best interest, if they don&#39;t just do it automatically out of laziness or tribal thinking."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think it&#39;s interesting how different people view status, like the &#34;Harvard Professor or Homeless guy?&#34; quiz that used to get passed around.I grew up in one of the last WASP strongholds in the US and the more money you had, the smaller the house you lived in (up to a point).  People could afford insanely expensive cars, but would buy tasteful ones instead (excepting kids).Most people wouldn&#39;t be caught dead in a Ralph Lauren polo, but would happily wear a bleach-stained, rumpled Brooks Brothers shirt.  Outside of special occasions, people didn&#39;t dress nice at all - they dressed like they just came back from sailing.Engineering, medicine, and law were not considered high-status.  Well, if you wanted to work a job, I guess they were - but they were considered ordinary.  It was better to own something (but not work), run a non-profit, or have a PhD (in the classics, or whatever).  Most parents told their children &#34;I don&#39;t care what you do - but do something interesting!&#34;.  Being an artist was considered good, too.Fame, and appearing in the media, were about the worst things you could achieve.The biggest status indicator was how well read you were.  It is so deeply ingrained in me, that I still find myself more impressed by well read people than almost anything else, and I haven&#39;t lived there in over a decade.There are a couple of these strongholds remaining, where even the wealthiest people are not allowed to move to because they don&#39;t have the right last name, or can&#39;t trace their lineage to the Mayflower.If you removed these people and put them anywhere else, you&#39;d think of them as low status and strange."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Choose money and you’ll end up working all the time. Choose beauty and you’ll always want to look better. Choose fame and you’ll constantly be seeking attention.This is straight-up paraphrasing David Foster Wallace in This Is Water, just that DFW was talking about these things as de-facto personal religions that we&#39;re usually unconscious of. So the &#34;choose&#34; part isn&#39;t nearly that explicit in his view.The bit in This Is Water:&gt; If you worship money and things, if they are where you tap real meaning in life, then you will never have enough, never feel you have enough. It’s the truth. Worship your body and beauty and sexual allure and you will always feel ugly. And when time and age start showing, you will die a million deaths before they finally plant you... Worship power, you will end up feeling weak and afraid, and you will need ever more power over others to numb you to your own fear. Worship your intellect, being seen as smart, you will end up feeling stupid, a fraud, always on the verge of being found out. But the insidious thing about these forms of worship is not that they’re evil or sinful, it’s that they’re unconscious. They are default settings."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not sure how this will sit with the HN crowd, but a couple of years back I got into menswear, and I derive some pleasure from being the &#34;best dressed guy&#34; at the office.Beyond personal opinions on that particular hobby, I can confirm first hand that living at the intersection of two or more personas (e.g. a programmer that dresses well) brings a peculiar sense of joy. I might no have much status in either of those categories, but bringing both together makes you stand out more."</p>

What the judge has done is send a clear message, that he won&#39;t sentence you on the merits of the case but will sentence you to serve his own agenda. The only message this sends is that justice has failed. It&#39;s always completely transparent who exactly gets made an example of, and who gets off with a slap on the wrist. We&#39;ll spend months hunting down every rioter in the London riots throwing the book at them and putting up massive billboards in city centres trying to identify them, but when a prominent tory steal millions from the tax payer in dodgy PPE contracts?

Things much worse than this are tweeted every day and this is the one that gets prosecuted. It’s blatantly politically motivated (‘national hero’, British soldier etc) and in terms of awful things people tweet…it’s not actually that bad. Suddenly I find myself agreeing with the people arguing these restrictions are a slippery slope."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; There is no way for changes in the outside world—such as a new version of a dependency being published—to automatically affect a Go build.&gt; Unlike most other package managers files, Go modules don’t have a separate list of constraints and a lock file pinning specific versions. The version of every dependency contributing to any Go build is fully determined by the go.mod file of the main module.I don&#39;t know if this was intentional on the author&#39;s part, but this reads to me like it&#39;s implying that with package managers that do use lockfiles a new version of a dependency can automatically affect a build.The purpose of a lockfile is to make that false. If you have a valid lockfile, then fetching dependencies is 100% deterministic across machines and the existence of new versions of a package will not affect the build.It is true that most package managers will automatically update a lockfile if it&#39;s incomplete instead of failing with an error. That&#39;s a different behavior from Go where it fails if the go.mod is incomplete. I suspect in practice this UX choice doesn&#39;t make much of a difference. If you&#39;re running CI with an incomplete lockfile, you&#39;ve already gotten yourself into a weird state. It implies you have committed a dependency change without actually testing it, or that you tested it locally and then went out of your way to discard the lockfile changes.Either way, I don&#39;t see what this has to do with lockfiles as a concept. Unless I&#39;m missing something, go.mod files are lockfiles."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Most package managers have lockfiles. Yes, npm&#39;s decision to have both &#34;npm install&#34; and &#34;npm ci&#34;, just so you can confuse and mislead developers, is a bit silly.But Ruby&#39;s Bundler, for example, has been refusing to run your code if your lockfile is inconsistent for as long as I remember.Locking dependencies is, generally, a solved problem across most ecosystems (despite node botching its UX). Go doesn&#39;t get to claim that it&#39;s superior here.But of course, supply chain attacks are still possible with lock files. Because somebody is going to update your dependencies at some point (often for security reasons). And at that point you might be pulling in a malicious dependency which you haven&#39;t carefully vetted (because nobody has time to vet all their dependencies thoroughly nowadays).That&#39;s still an unsolved problem, as far as I know. I don&#39;t think that Go has solved it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The elephant in the room here is NPM, and I think the obvious problem there is the culture. I have a tiny app I&#39;ve been playing with using create-react-app. There are over 800 directories in node_modules. That absolutely dwarfs the number of any other language I&#39;ve used. Even in a medium sized rails app, you likely have some awareness of what every dependency is. It&#39;s just impossible with npm.One thought I&#39;ve had to &#34;reboot&#34; the npm culture is to somehow curate packages that are proven to have minimal and safe dependencies, and projects can shift to using those. I imagine there has to be some sort of manual review to make that happen."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The thing I don&#39;t understand in conversations around affordable housing is why does it have to be new construction?Of course new construction is going to be expensive and full of bureaucracy. Many US cities have large stocks of older housing in moderate condition -- sure, it&#39;d take some money to get them up to snuff, but nothing near what new construction would cost."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The assumption here is that housing can&#39;t be affordable by nature, but has to be made affordable by government intervention.  Is that the case?  Would it be possible to build an apartment building that simply will be affordable, without the government giving the developer a pile of other people&#39;s money?I also wonder about the incentive that&#39;s created when artificially affordable housing is provided in an area that&#39;s expensive because of high demand: doesn&#39;t that prevent a shortage of low-skill labor that would otherwise be a limiting factor in that demand?  That is, if it&#39;s too expensive for many people who might work low-paying service and manual jobs to live nearby, the rising cost of that sort of labor might begin to lessen other people&#39;s desire to live there and businesses&#39; desire to locate there, mitigating the housing problem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a difference between affordable housing and &#34;affordable housing&#34;(tm) qualifying for a LIHTC.Affordable housing is simply developing new housing that serves the market you intend to serve. It might be more humble, etc., to make it affordable for that market.Part of the equation is realizing that there are also poor people who simply don&#39;t have enough to pay the rent on any place at all that is built according to building codes. Developers can&#39;t solve that problem, even with some kind of tax credit bible and tax consultants."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I would also add that one fundamental aspect of linear algebra (that no one ever taught me in a class) is that non-linear problems are almost never analytically solvable (e.g. e^x= y is easily solved through logarithms, but even solving xe^x=y requires Lambert’s W function iirc). Almost all interesting real world problems are non-linear to some extent, therefore, linear algebra is really the only tool we have to make progress on many difficult problems (e.g. through linear approximation and then applying techniques of linear algebra to solve the linear problem)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In high school, my friends and I managed to resuscitate a 914 that had been stowed away in a garage for over a decade. We towed it to the top of a hill with a pickup truck and attempted a clutch start after we&#39;d picked up some speed. None of us (especially me in the driver&#39;s seat) expected this to work, but amazingly it fired right up. One of my friends managed to jog alongside and jump into the car as I tried to keep it puttering along, and we ripped a few laps around the neighborhood. Soonafter, we stopped the engine and were never able to get it started again. Thanks for bringing up this memory. Cool article."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is one of my favorite styles of writing. I have absolutely no clue what this person is talking about and have no interest in cars, yet I read every single word.I love when people have such a deep knowledge of something that they can write an essay as unique and thoughtful as this. It reminds me of Kitchen Confidential, Surely You&#39;re Joking Mr Feynman!, or any rant about British politics by David Mitchell."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This story reminded me of the time I was trying to exploit a web app as part of a bounty programme.Unfortunately the application was so unstable that any attempts to SQLI, or really send any kind of malformed request would simply crash the entire site for hours, presumably until an admin came and restarted the server. DoS wasn&#39;t included in the programme so I never won a bounty. I&#39;m sure it could have been exploited, but it was simply so rickety and shoddy that I couldn&#39;t figure out how.Security through instability?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A single successful effort of unionization at an Amazon facility is more than symbolic: It will encourage -- and serve as a blueprint for -- employees at other Amazon facilities to do the same. Moreover, it will motivate employees at other large companies to try. This has been brewing for a while.It&#39;s possible we&#39;ll see a generational wave of unionization."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Freakonomics ran a recent episode on unions [1]. A pair of interesting stats were presented near the start: the approval rating for unions stands at 70% in the US (even higher among the young) at the same time that union membership stands at 10%. Both numbers are at multi-decade extremes.I don&#39;t think it&#39;s any coincidence that this success at Amazon comes right now. After the GFC all regulatory efforts turned to keeping financial markets solvent. That has meant unwavering support for policies that favor those with assets over those who don&#39;t.The pandemic happened in early 2020 just as the wheels were flying off the US economy yet again. So what would have played out got masked by many other factors, including direct government transfers.Those stimmie checks of yore are long gone, and it will be a very steep uphill battle to bring anything remotely like that back given the rip-roaring yr/yr increase in CPI and PPI now underway. Those checks are being blamed for the ongoing inflation that more than just the lunatic fringe now thinks is the start of Weimar-style hyperinflation.So with the 2/10 year yield curve now inverted [2], it&#39;s just a matter of time before the economic chickens come home to roost once more. Will it be different this time? Will unions step in to fill the gap that government can not?[1] https://freakonomics.com/podcast/do-unions-still-work/[2] https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/01/us-bonds-treasury-yields-inv..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When this has happened at individual Walmart stores in the past, the company would immediately shut down the store and everyone would lose their jobs. A couple years later they would build a new store within 20 or so miles of the old store, free of the union. This was obviously financially painful for Walmart, but it served as such a strong signal to employees to not even try to unionize that it must have paid for itself many times over given Walmart&#39;s thousands of stores. I wonder if Amazon has been taking notes from them on this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; One of the unfortunate facts about open source operating systems like Linux is that specialized hardware support sometimes lags behind commercial operating systems like Windows and MacOS.Well that&#39;s just because the manufacturer just doesn&#39;t write one, not because of some intrinsic factor of FOSS. That&#39;s an odd point to make when it&#39;s the manufacturers&#39; fault."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Cool! I always assumed the Linux driver was maintained as a best effort side project by Wacom engineer(s), not as an official endeavor.Overall, Wacom tablets work fairly well under Linux and have for quite some time. There are some caveats with what events the devices report vs what apps expect, but I think that’s smoothed out in the modern world of XI2, the wayland tablet api, and libinput.I’m not a passionate user of graphics tablets, but in my experience, Wacom tablets work better on Linux than Windows (and similarly good to macOS) partly because on Windows, they predate Windows having an input stack that can support pressure-sensitive graphics tablet pens. That arrived in Windows 8. Wacom had instead implemented a sort of defacto standard called Wintab, which they seemingly standardized with a company called LCS/Telegraphics in the Win 3.x days. In the modern invocation of this, the tablet kernel driver appears to act as a relay for hardware events, but those events get pumped back to a usermode service, and then wintab32 clients get them pumped into their event loops. Modern Windows has WM_POINTER* events, but it seems this usermode service is needed even for those events to work, probably so that wintab and WM_POINTER events can remain consistent, sync with control panel, and not fire over eachother. Still, it’s a shame.In the modern world, if you happen to have a USB tablet that speaks the HID digitizer API, Linux should be able to give you fairly good support straight out of the box, usually only lacking support for rebinding keys easily, controlling LEDs, etc. More tablet manufacturers have been choosing hardware that can support the HID digitizer class as it’s probably the only way to get graphics tablet support for Android devices. I found this to be the case with an XP-Pen device that I bought with intent to try writing a driver, only to find it spoke perfectly good standard USB, produced events in evdev, and plumbed through to Krita absolutely fine. To be sure, not all XP-Pen tablets will work this way, but some will. I’d guess ones that advertise Android support are likely to."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A well-written design system is a godsend for end-user consistency, especially for people who use assistive technologies and are easily forgotten about by inexperienced teams. It also means that teams can focus in on the problem they’re actually trying to solve, and stop obsessing over the common components.I was only around for the first six months or so of this project, but I’ve taken so much of what I’ve learnt into my current design system, and I continue to reference GDS’s continuing work as the gold standard for researched user interface patterns."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve enjoyed reading their thoughtful guidelines for common forms and pages. On the whole, it all seems like good advice that can be applied to any website. They also talk about the pain points and potential research areas. Here&#39;s one example https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/gender-or-sex/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been building prototypes with this. It is everything good web design should be– UI with good contrast, legible type and accessibility patterns.My only gripe is perhaps if their teams made example pages from their own use cases– sub-nav from the components page, charts/references from their Covid dashboards.Great work overall!"</p>

But why reinvent the wheel when the org-mode format is well established and does everything you want, and more?There are an increasing number of tools using org-mode as a plain-text data store, so you are more likely to be able to participate in a tool ecosystem. In addition to my own https://braintool.org see the list below. BrainTool (mainly a bookmark manager) has an elemental to-do system, I&#39;d love to have my users be able to use your tool for todos.NB see also Karl Voit&#39;s push for org markup awareness outside of Emacs via Orgdown: https://gitlab.com/publicvoit/orgdown.------

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am conflicted on this.The spec is nice. I love the recognition that dates may be imprecise (e.g., 2022-05 --  although I would count that as the last day of the period, 23:59:59 on 2022-05-31, rather than the first day of the next period, 2022-06-01). I like the thought that went into it and the nice presentation.On the other hand, I do not think this is necessary or even all that helpful in the real world. You don&#39;t need a standardized format if you are writing to do items manually in a text editor. You just write them. In the vast majority of cases no one is going to see them but you. Time spent conforming to a spec is time wasted.A formal spec also doesn&#39;t help much for apps to use this format. There is not a huge need for portability between to do apps, and for most users to do items are ephemeral and not something that needs to be archived and revisited. Even if an app adopted this, being tied to a plain text format would likely hinder feature development, including the ability to sync across multiple devices. Beyond that, different to do apps use different systems of categorization and tagging, so really in practice I doubt this will become any kind of standardized format.So, all told, it is a beautiful effort, nicely presented, but  I think it is unnecessary."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This thread has (at least at the moment) serious Bob Martin Sudoku Solver energy to it. Tailscale has solved an infamously complicated problem using, for the most part, simple tools. They&#39;re not just successful; they&#39;re remarkably successful, spookily successful, upsettingly successful.Consider whether the secret sauce here might not be au courant database choices, but rather something much harder for random teams to pick up and run with: just straight up good design and programming.This is a thing that happens in other fields, too; some of the hardest dishes to cook seem extremely simple and have few ingredients. They&#39;re hard because there&#39;s no place to hide: your technique has to be flawless or they don&#39;t work. A famous entrance exam for new cooks at fine dining restaurants is &#34;make an omelet&#34;. Tailscale is, thankfully (and, to me, irritatingly), more like an omelet than a truffled hash."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I loved this article, despite the negativity.A discussion that keeps recurring on HN is how you can get a lot done with simple, boring solutions. This is a perfect example of that in practice. What’s the simplest thing that’ll work? Do that, monitor the solution, and when you start hitting a limitation reevaluate what the next appropriate solution is.There are plenty of comments here deriding this as insanity when we have established best practices, but “best practices for me are not necessarily best practices thee”.People aren’t perfect, not every engineer comes fully-formed grokking the industry’s best solutions and their trade offs.This is what learning looks like. This is what an evolving system looks like. And this is how valuable software gets built every day.Who gives a fuck about scalability on a poc? “Let’s just put in a json file”. I Love it. Personally I start at the “use SQLite” step and go from there because SQLite is such amazing software. Thanks to this post I’m excited to try out Lifestream.You might rightly point out that Tailscale isn’t a side-project/poc anymore. But that’s exactly why they’re changing to SQLite and writing this post; this is their team learning to deal with larger problems and changing needs, and they’re sharing that journey with us.As long as they’re not _ignoring_ serious risks let them experiment. But try not to get too upset if they’re making different risk/effort trade-offs than you would. Even if it’s “objectively” the “wrong” thing.My rubric for technical sanity is:- are you taking (and testing) backups?- is your infra/data secure?- are you monitoring what’s happening?- can you recover from catastrophic failure in a acceptable time frame?- are you meeting your legal obligations?Cover those needs and you can be forgiven a lot suboptimal/experimental implementation details."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not commenting on tailscale, but for the state of databases.Sometimes boring is the right choice.
PostgreSQL has worked for decades now, and seems to have regained much of the performance that MySQL once boasted.If you do this for the money, investing in tried and true (but boring) software should be the default solution.I watched with dread how the MongoDB fiasco played out a decade ago. Meanwhile, I kept using PostgreSQL and had a good ride."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"In terms of evolution through the donation and acceptance of information carrying material, the most bizarre ritual I have witnessed is that of Developa Linuxia:  git format-patch --stdout | mail

  ... | git am

It is recommended that this be seen in the wild. The beasts that exchange material this way are rare and ancient but we are fortunate that it is easy to observe them performing their rites.  They make a point of enacting them publicly, in open clearings know as mailing lists.  You will note that, in comparison to more evolved techniques, what first seems like clumsy fumbling takes on a primal beauty of its own.These creatures are aware of more modern practices and yet they choose to remain in their own evolutionary niche, in part, because they lament the way in which Developa intercourse has been cheapened and corrupted by an unmentionable website named “something”hub.com."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It seems fairly straightforward to me..when it is expensive to procreate due to restricted resources, procreation becomes picky. Birds are mostly monogamous because flying is very energy intensive and the male parent doesn’t want to waste resource on fledglings that isn’t his..obviously, exceptions exist. It is very costly to raise the young. Parental investment is high.It is different for birds that don’t fly. Water fowl especially have a different reproductive system. Because they don’t fly. This is true for all flightless birds. Even for birds like geese that only fly for seasonal migration. They get their food from the water. Ground dwellers have plenty of food and don’t have spend as much energy foraging for food as a bird that flies. Very few of them mate for life.Further: Galus Galus has different design than geese and ducks. Castrated roosters are called ‘capons’(French)…produces a nice soft fat capon for Sunday lunch. It’s genitalia is less developed than say..geese.As a chef, I knew how to sex identify geese/duck. water fowl  genitalia is different than fowl. Most farmers know this as sex determination is key to raising animals for profit. With the exception of Pilgrim/Emden/White Italian and some Chinese geese where the autosexing is straightforward with feather colouring and down colour, most have to be identified while they are still goslings.Goslings can be gender identified as early as the first week and also when they are adults. Male adult penis is invaginated and like a corkscrew. Female organs has genital eminence. The breeding ratio is 1:3 or max 1:5. So it’s important to separate them as early as possible.Mammals are different..example: feline penii is barbed and most copulation results in kittens. A female cat can have a single litter with multiple tomcats. Male cats will kill kittens ..probably those that aren’t their own..because a lactating mother cat won’t go into heat.With insects like bees and mantii, the male often meets his end after sex. It comes down to energy needs and availability of resources.P.S: [..] Birds, she thought at the time, didn’t have penises. In her two years studying them at Cornell University, a world leader in avian research, she’d never once heard her colleagues mention a bird penis.[..] Huh! Really? Cornell university scientists don’t know what a farm child picks up during one farming season? The article is full of red flags for clickbait lies."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some points I found interesting:- Kristian Andersen offered to abuse his power as editor to stealthily edit a preprint. He is the main author of the most notable paper supporting a natural origin, and has been one of the major resources of the natural origins camp. Now his scientific integrity is seriously questioned.- Peter Daszak appears much more focused on finding new sources of grant money than on doing good science: &#34;What was needed, he exhorted his staff, was a “change in culture” as “part of [a] mentaility [sic] to get money,”- The Wuhan Institute of Virology is more of a second zone lab than a top lab: &#34;The WIV was also viewed as subpar, especially when compared with the Harbin Veterinary Research Institute. Harbin was China’s Harvard, said the former DARPA official. The WIV was more like a safety school&#34;- EcoHealth Alliance and Daszak were seen by DARPA as amateurs in virology, not at all the expert frontline organisation that&#39;s been suggested before: &#34;EcoHealth Alliance was viewed as a “ragtag group” and a “middle guy,” a backseat collaborator willing to get on an Air China jet, eat terrible food, and stay in bad hotels&#34; &#34;EcoHealth Alliance had “bolted on” a serious scientist, Ralph Baric&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;The report he finally did submit worried the agency’s grant specialists. It stated that scientists planned to create an infectious clone of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), a novel coronavirus found in dromedaries that had emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and killed 35% of the humans it infected. The report also made clear that the NIH grant had already been used to construct two chimeric coronaviruses similar to the one that caused Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which emerged in 2002 and went on to cause at least 774 deaths worldwide. (A chimeric virus is one that combines fragments of different viruses.) These revelations prompted the NIH’s grant specialists to ask a critical question: Should the work be subject to a federal moratorium on what was called gain-of-function research?Wait what?! Is this new information ? Because this is incredibly troubling"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Article makes fun of how slow i2c is compared to the super high speed pairs next to it on HDMI plug.
Well, please note that there is a bus that is literally a thousand time slower than i2c on that same connector. It&#39;s CEC. Contrary to i2c it only occupies one wire rather than two though.
CEC, which is used mainly to power TV on/off or switch sources has a whopping bandwidth of 400bps. No missing multiplier.Maximum device name is 16B. If you have a TV, a tvbox and a game console, simply asking the name of those devices can take more than a second.
I&#39;m in the process of shortening my product&#39;s CEC name, in order to reduce congestion on the bus.Mainline Linux CEC developer jokes that Voyager 1 which is on the other side of solar system, made 40 years prior to CEC, is faster than CEC.Edit: Sorry for the atrocious original formating"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Uh, oh. The work project I&#39;m working on uses an OLED display that uses an I2C interface. And I happen to have a spare one sitting on my desk. And I&#39;m no electrical engineer, so let&#39;s see how fast I smoke this thing. :-)Should I succeed, TFA author will not have the worst HDMI display ever, as the one we&#39;re using is a two-line display looking something like this (it can do rudimentary graphics, though; we display a company logo at boot):https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Vishay-Dale/O020O002ALP..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I nearly got taken by a scammer because Amazon transferred me to one.  I purchased a set of Reolink cameras on Amazon, (they&#39;ve been great) one of them failed a couple months in.  I contacted Amazon customer support (via my Amazon login and in their interface) and they wanted to troubleshoot with their technical team.  Eventually the (very helpful) Amazon technician suggested contacting Reolink for support and started a 3-way call.  The &#34;Reolink&#34; technician got my phone number and then said they wanted to call me back.They called me back a minute later (now without Amazon recording the conversation) and asked me for my NVR&#39;s serial number so they could connect to my NVR.  I was shocked they had a backdoor into my NVR but I figured I&#39;d let it play out.  A minute later the technician said that he was having trouble connecting because &#34;an internet virus is corrupting my firewall&#34;.  I was extremely confused and thought it must be a translation problem.  Until he kept insisting it was a problem and became belligerent and angry.  He said I needed to pay $300 to have an on-site technician troubleshoot the problem.  I got angry because he was making some weird excuse for their camera not working, and wanting to charge me rather than just ship me a replacement.  I refused and he started mocking me.  I demanded his manager and he ignored me.  Eventually I hung up and called Amazon back.The Amazon technician was helpful and shipped me a replacement.  I contacted Reolink via email to complain about their technician.  They responded that they have no on-site technicians and that it was a scam!I was blown away that Amazon would transfer me to a scammer.  I contacted Amazon again and let them know what had happened.  Hopefully they will figure out how their guy got this scammers phone number and teach him how to find a 3rd party phone number..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s one easy rule that could have avoided all of this - never give out any info on incoming calls. If I get a call or text about fraudulent transactions, I&#39;ll keep them on hold while I log into the bank website. If I get a call about a late payment, I&#39;ll thank them for the info and ask them to stay on while I pay online. If I get an inbound call with a more complex request, I&#39;ll ask them for their employee info and call back the official service number. It annoys the caller sometimes, despite always treating them professionally, but I keep that a hardline rule no matter how real it feels.I heard this from a security guy and was under the impression it was one of the sacred laws of security. If it&#39;s not, it should be - it&#39;s a rule of thumb that would stop 90% of social engineering attacks I hear about."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It gets even weirder when your bank acts like a scammer. A few weeks ago I was trying to help my wife add her USBank credit card to Apple Pay and Apple Pay said I needed to call this number to finish setting up the card. So I call the number and the guy is very friendly and asks me for a bunch of identity verification details, which I provide to him, but then he asks us to send a code back that will be coming over text messaging - yes, I initiated the phone call, but I suddenly realize that the number Apple directed me to was not the same number on my USBank card. Being a bit paranoid I tell the guy “Look, nothing personal but I get nervous when people ask for a verification code to be read back to them, I’m just going to call the regular number and go from there, okay?” Instead of being friendly, this guy suddenly gets in my face and is like “Oh, you’ll give me all this other info but won’t read that code back to me? I’m Fraud Prevention dude, good luck getting this done calling the main number. Oh, and just for this I’m putting a block on your card.” I hung up immediately and called US Bank’s main number and asked to talk to a supervisor - sure as hell, it turns out the guy I had talked to did work in their fraud prevention department and actually had retaliated against me by locking my credit card. It was the most incredibly ugly thing I’ve ever seen from a customer service department."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s so much more to CI/CD than the build definitions (e.g. dashboarding, log viewing/retention, access control, manual interventions, secret management, test reporting, etc.) and while some of your points resonate very strongly with me (e.g. local builds), I can&#39;t help but wonder what the endgame is here?You&#39;ve raised $27m to what? Give away a free tool for engineers to define their builds in? While they continue to use and pay for another service to actually run the builds? I assume you intend to replace the CI service at some point and move up the stack to monetize?Without more transparency its easy to imagine something like...Step 1. Drive uptake of your tool by selling people on the pitfalls of &#34;CI lock-in&#34;
Step 2. Introduce your own CI solution, which people can now easily switch to
Step 3. Lock people in"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m highly jealous of teams that can containerize all their build tools.If you deal with proprietary toolchains that are tens of gigabytes (Windows WDK, Xilinx Vivado/Vitis) it’s just untenable, and that’s before even mentioning licensing. Even Azure doesn’t have a great solution for WDK development. It’s hard to feel like we’re not being left behind.Bind mounting the tools into the container is an option but at that point you’re using the container just because that’s what your CI expects, not because it’s any better or more reproducible than a  raw Jenkins shell script."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;d like to see more attention put into carving out a subset of Mastodon&#39;s functionality that would allow you to host your fediverse node on a static site, à la blog feeds powered by RSS/Atom.The discovery problem can be handled pretty straightforwardly: if you want notifications of replies to your posts, then that&#39;s just another feed that you subscribe to—a separate service.  You don&#39;t exactly need an always-on &#34;instance&#34; providing an inbox endpoint to relay notifications to you.You give up private channels (DMs), but you gain a lot more flexibility.  It&#39;s a shame that there are so few server (and client) implementations for &#34;the fediverse&#34;.  We should have at least half as many options as we have in static site generators themselves.  (In fact, with this approach, your preferred static site generator could become part of your &#34;client&#34;...)Imagine your corner of the fediverse being reachable at $YOURNAME.github.io.Prior art: Fritter &lt;https://github.com/beakerbrowser/fritter&gt;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Discoverability has always been a hot topic on Mastodon. Discoverability makes or breaks a platform, as there is nothing more important to retain a new user than to let them find something interesting to stay for, as soon as possible. In 3.5, we bring a new explore page which features currently popular posts, news stories that people share a lot, trending hashtags and follow recommendations. Furthermore, for the first time, we attempt to bring people content in their own language.An algorithm to rank posts and people? Did we learn nothing from twitter?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great to see new updates!I run a mastodon instance [0] (themed to look like Windows XP). Overall I really enjoy mastodon (and the fediverse in general), it gives the user an opportunity to carve out their own niche through their own instance, while still being able to interact with the overall system.There are still some challenges with setting up your own instance (I couldn&#39;t get the docker image working, the documentation for setting up a dev environment could use some improvement, and email confirmation is difficult without using an external service), but think this will improve over time, and there are managed services you can use to run your own instance.[0] https://lunadon.org/"</p>

We see a steady stream of claims that NP-hard problems are &#34;impossible&#34; or take &#34;billions of years to solve&#34;. We also see blog posts with the latest ML approach &#34;doing the impossible&#34; and providing reasonable (not optimal) solutions to 50-city TSPs. All this while ignoring that with proper maths, we could solve 50-city TSPs to optimality by hand in the fifties, and now Concorde routinely solves 100k-city instances in seconds on an iPhone."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a lawyer, i&#39;ve read this entire filing and it seems like nonsense at a glance.Krebs mentions the person was arrested. Ubiquiti claims first that he doesn&#39;t point out the person he sourced it from what arrested, and that he tries to mislead people by not saying repeatedly that the person is basically felon, and that being arrested makes him an invalid source of evidence, etc.  They also claim he describes him as a current employee.This is all nonsense AFAICT1. Krebs mentions the person was arrested.2. Krebs says &#34;In March, a ubiqitui employee said X&#34;. That was accurate at the time (AFAIK, and ubiquiti cites no real evidence I see that Krebs should have known it was not true).3. Krebs carefully points out the arrested person claims x and y (which is accurate).4. The filing says Sharp made false claims, and spends a paragraph explaining them.5. The filing says Krebs made them too, but ironically, for all of its bluster, doesn&#39;t cite where and when (that I can see), and which exact claims, they are claiming Krebs said that were false.6. The filing cites no evidence that Krebs knew or should have known, in March, that the claims were false.  They get into some weird arguments about their 10-q filing but it&#39;s hard to understand the point they are trying to make. It apperas they are trying to claim that krebs should have known they notified the public but i think that&#39;s kind of a silly argument - krebs is clearly talking about their users, and most users do not read 10-q&#39;s.  Saying you notified the public because you put it in a 10-q is like saying you notified the public because you put it in a classified ad section.  It&#39;s dumb wordplay.7. The December blog post they say he &#34;doubled down on&#34; seems again, carefully written to say what Sharp claims, not what Krebs claims.I could go on.The whole thing is, IMHO, not written very well.  It&#39;s very emotionally written for a pleading, and you will be hard pressed to find a judge who will get themselves worked up over that kind of writing. Instead they mostly roll their eyes and wish that someone gave them a clear and convincing pleading instead.Put another way - if there is a case here, it isn&#39;t visible on this pleading.  This feels like &#34;throw a bunch of emotional stuff at a wall and hope it sticks&#34;, where you really want &#34;here is an open and shut case of why this person defamed us&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Seems pretty close to textbook SLAPP in a jurisdiction - Virginia - that has strong anti-SLAPP laws [correction: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30867948 notes this is federal, and it has not been established if VA SLAPP laws apply] and  and precedent for their use. I am a fan of Ubiquiti gear but I hope they lose, pay Krebs&#39; costs, and pay a multiple of the costs as damages.https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig/status/1509374736903507974 is just an example of how well this is going over."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The lawsuit, it seems like a grey area. Report on something but then further facts come out and your story is literally outright false. You&#39;ve been misled and abused by your source. I guess that&#39;s the job of a journalist to ensure what you are publishing is true.Flipside, there&#39;s a term named &#34;Krebbed&#34; for a reason. https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=krebbedKrebs has a history of poor journalism to say the least. Frankly, it&#39;s best to ignore Krebs. I stopped reading him years ago.https://itwire.com/business-it-news/security/new-york-times-...https://itwire.com/business-it-news/security/infosec-researc...https://itwire.com/business-it-news/security/ex-wp-man-krebs...3 separate instances where Krebs got it wrong. Seems to happen a little too often.Seems clear to me, Ubiquiti got Krebbed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Zulip is fantastic. It mixes the paradigms of IRC and email while providing a clean interface that runs beautifully in a browser. The Rust language developers use it and I couldn&#39;t imagine any better way to keep up with the volume of so many discussions across so many teams.However, the mobile app could use a whole lot of polish. I rarely use chat apps on my phone, but if I did then I wouldn&#39;t have nearly as good an impression of Zulip as I do."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I tried [when is ambulance coming out], and you did correctly understand it was referring to the movie. But the result is strictly worse than the same search on Google (which also knew it was a movie, but actually gave an instant answer to the question rather just a IMDB link, and answered the question correctly for my location unlike the IMDB page). Bing also returned an instant answer, but their answer is even more wrong (the release was pushed back by a couple of months, Bing claims that the movie would be released at the future date of February 2022).Then I tried [will there be a wheat shortage this year?], and the top result was a lunatic fringe prepper blog, from which you extracted a confident answer that there will definitely be a wheat shortage. Google doesn&#39;t try to answer the question (which I&#39;d argue is correct for something this speculative), and only links to reputable news sources all of which look relevant. Bing is the same, but mixes in some more alternative results at the bottom of the page.Then, since you said that this worked best in a conversational manner I asked [is it due to the war?], obviously referring to the previous question. Rather than keep the context of that previous search in mind, you replied with information on the current local weather. (In Fahrenheit, for a location in Europe).At this point, combined with how incredibly slow the searches are, my goodwill would be gone as a real user."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good luck, I hope this works! Here&#39;s my initial feedback.1) The site needs to be much more visually attractive. On my 13&#34; laptop it&#39;s a gray chat box floating in a ton of white space. Not centered, no color, and the logo looks like it&#39;s from 1999. The other icons on the page look like something from an Android demo app. I would never ever land on this site and think this is something new or exciting.2) I asked &#34;Who is in first place in the eastern conference?&#34; and it did correctly infer that this was an NBA question (despite my UK IP address) but the top result it gave me was a mangled table from 6 months ago. The second result was a yahoo sports article which was more helpful.3) I asked &#34;how many covid cases were there in the UK yesterday&#34; and got &#34;the answer is about 16.5 million&#34;. That&#39;s off by about 100x."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just wanted to say after trying out a few searches how blown away I am by this.The level of understanding is indeed not there yet to rival directly with competitors, but you’re doing more than a decent job on a lot of requests which is no small feat looking at the competition.Wishing you luck, and curious to see it evolve!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The &#34;STIR/SHAKEN initiative&#34; was supposed to fix this.[1] There&#39;s now a whole system with signed certificates, much like SSL certs, to sign caller ID info. The info is at least good enough to find out which carrier generated the phony data.You should file a complaint with the FCC that your carrier has not clearly not properly implemented STIR/SHAKEN, since they badly mis-identified the source of a call. While calls from outside the US can be unsigned, the carrier should detect that the number is inconsistent with the source.There are &#34;A&#34;, &#34;B&#34;, and &#34;C&#34; level of verification. &#34;A&#34; calls are probably legit. The others, maybe not.If you&#39;re in California, try making a personal data request to your carrier for the detailed STIR/SHAKEN data for that call.[1] https://commlawgroup.com/2021/stir-shaken-robocall-mitigatio..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Your phone company knows the originator info of your calls and texts (or at least enough hops until they reach some even more untrustworthy than normal phone provider). They simply don&#39;t give you that info and instead show you an unverified caller ID that anyone can basically set to anything by whoever is contacting you.Blame your phone company and the FCC for not solving this (and for not providing you with the data to solve it yourself)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The good news is that Verizon has all these grand plans to intercept your browsing data and use it to target ads, but they can&#39;t even implement the most rudimentary spam protection on SMS, so I don&#39;t have high hopes that they&#39;re going to make any money by spying on everyone.One could argue that since the more messages you receive, they more you pay, they have no incentive to reduce spam; whereas with ad tracking, as long as they find some advertiser willing to pay 100 million dollars for a 1% increase on click throughs on their overpriced toothpaste, they&#39;ll have a financial incentive to do a good job.  So maybe we&#39;re actually really screwed.Sad that a cell phone company can&#39;t be just a cell phone company.  They were pretty good at that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My first leadership lesson looked like this: as a junior engineer I had an abysmal quarter or two. My manager asked me what was going on. After I gave them an assessment of the situation, they said that they believed me and went to bat for me.Because of that manager&#39;s trust and belief in me even in the face of irrefutable evidence that I was doing poorly, I immediately became fiercely loyal to that manager and the organization, and I wanted to work harder for them.I&#39;m no 10x engineer, but any time I get frustrated with someone else&#39;s poor output, I think about this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Overworking makes me think of falling into a hero/rescuer mode of the karpman drama triangle[1].Basically the idea is you can really disempower others if you constantly do the work yourself to rescue them from their own mistakes. And the other person can take the role of victim in the relationship, in need of rescuing instead of being responsible the consequences themselves. Or persecutor - blaming and casting out against others.1 - https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karpman_drama_triangle"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The main character is trying to do their job effectively, but can’t due to the low performance of a peer. They escalate to the appropriate manager to address the issue, but that manager transforms the performance issue into a relationship issue: it’s not that the peer isn’t performing, it’s just that the two of you don’t like each other.It is quite hard to find the line between performance issue and relationship issue. I ran into this myself when I had a new manager who wanted to institute policies that to the tech leads seemed nonsense, and I chose to not do what they asked. They took it as a performance issue to the +1 but the +1 turned it into a relationship issue and this was the right call. The problem is that by that time we were both so set in our view that the other was obstructing the way forward that we couldn’t find a middle, and eventually it came down to a hard choice which I “won” by pushing them out of the company. In hindsight I could have made more of an effort to build a personal rapport and get on good enough terms to find a middle ground."</p>

The developer isn&#39;t being banned for breaking Google&#39;s rules, he&#39;s being banned for having hired someone else who later broke those rules; and then that ban was transitively applied to their personal account as well.This is beyond the pale. Google should not have the power to decide who you are and are not allowed to hire. It both goes against the basic concept of a limited-liability corporation, and harms worker rights."</p>

For the vast majority of people who deal with Google support and don&#39;t have access to Google employees how many of us on HN do, when the hammer strikes: they are completely out of options.I have such little trust in Google&#39;s automation for banning accounts that I don&#39;t even bother commenting on Youtube or uploading videos anymore.

OTC medicines that by current standards would not be made OTC, surgeries that are extremely common but have never had quality  randomized trials, official sounding diagnoses that on inspection are actually defined as &#34;we have no idea&#34;, lack of consensus about how to treat some of the most common conditions in the human population (e.g. back pain), medical device approvals abusing the shortcut of being &#34;substantially similar&#34; to an existing device to evade regulatory scrutiny, the complete lack of enforcement of what goes in supplements...

I had no idea why but I directly observed that it was like it had been replaced with a non-functioning placebo.Only a couple years later did I make the connection that this was right when they passed the law restricting pseudoephedrine.

Krebs was wrong and tricked by the employee. I don&#39;t know if that justifies this legal action, but it&#39;s not the normal going after someone who reported a breach. This one is more complicated.I&#39;m pretty sure Corey is wrong on the facts in this case (and so was Brian).

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"People always struggle or avoid doing pair programming, and people always think it means that the developers&#39; time now costs twice as much, but this is a total lie. When I worked at a place that did 100% pair programming with rotation every day, a new developer could hit the ground flying. Sitting next to someone who knows the system and can answer your question immediately means you get up to speed millions of times faster than screwing around by yourself. Pointed-haired bosses and accountants will never understand this. If you pair and rotate, the inexperienced person becomes experienced quickly, and it&#39;s viral if you also do rotating pairing. A team with one expert and pairing is now a team full of experts."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Relevant to this article is Peter Naur&#39;s paper on Programming as Theory building: https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Naur.pdfHe argues that the biggest determinant on whether maintainers on a system they did not build will succeed is whether they will have access to the original developers: &#34;The conclusion seems inescapable that at least with certain kinds of large programs, the continued adaptation, modification, and correction of errors in them, is essentially dependent on a certain kind of knowledge possessed by a certain group of programmers who are closely and continuously connected with them.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In my experience, the biggest obstacle in understanding the system is that the underlying business process is not properly documented. A technical system is only as good as the business system it&#39;s implementing. Knowing the business process makes it much easier to understand the technical implementation, especially if you&#39;re trying to find bugs in the technical system since you can more easily see the mismatch between business and technical processes.But hey, that&#39;s just me. And it seems clear that most businesses do a poor job, or don&#39;t care at all, when it comes to documenting their processes. So I guess I&#39;m the odd one."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I dig this! Since you&#39;re full-text indexing blogs with an eye towards content discovery, can I tempt you towards building out a reverse link index function to enable me to browse by thread?My use case: often times blogs will respond to other blogs, linking to the original post in the process. The nature of linking means it&#39;s very easy to follow threads backwards in time, but given the original post it&#39;s often hard to discover the responses and ongoing conversation to follow things downstream. I&#39;d like that downstream browsing to be easier.My hope would be that such a tool could unlock higher-quality discourse. As a reader, this would let me hijack my natural tendency to follow comment threads, and redirect that attention towards slower-paced, more nuanced, more focused writing.Edit: hmmm... though looking further, maybe this goes against your MarketRank philosophy."</p>

They are really good at separating employees into two groups.Group 1, which is by far the largest group, really wants to make it easier for people to get their taxes done.Group 2 makes sure that the govt doesn&#39;t make any progress on making it easier for people to do their taxes. Make taxes even more convoluted, so that you need TurboTax (not just personal but also their software for CPAs). Make sure there isn&#39;t any actually free way to easily do your taxes. Get laws passed making sure of it. Act like you have a free version but make it nearly impossible to use it without paying for other stuff.Intuit goes to great lengtsh to make sure that group 1 (which is most of the company), doesn&#39;t know about the existence of group 2. I only knew about group 2 because I knew of it before I worked for Intuit. A lot of people there were very surprised when I shared the truth with them about group 2.I didn&#39;t end up a fit for this garbage and quit after 6 months."</p>

Those dumb enough to ignore it are doomed to repeat the pattern. I&#39;m probably getting some details wrong in this Rube Goldberg scheme, so feel free to correct.1. Citing &#34;Ethereum network congestion,&#34; Axie Infinity announces an ethereum side chain, Ronin.[1]2. Ronin was a centralized server (therefore fast and cheap) authorized to make Ethereum Mainnet transactions. The server was a hot wallet in other words.3. The Ronin team tried to make it look like they were &#34;decentralized&#34; by splitting signing authority among 9 &#34;validator nodes.&#34; (the article)4. An attacker obtained 5 of 9 keys, which is the signing threshold.5. With the required threshold of keys, the attacker signed the transitions moving assets off the Ronin servers.None of this is new. The Bitcoin &#34;block size war&#34; was fought over this very point. Unworkable scaling schemes are going to end in disaster with no fallback, and no recourse for those who lose money. You end up with nothing, and will be sad.And it&#39;s sad that the same lessons keep getting replayed over and over. It&#39;s really simple. Can your &#34;blockchain&#34; be validated with regular hardware? Does it use a secure consensus algorithm? Is there a secure side channel through which low-value transactions can flow?

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have to admit I find this whole situation (and also Krebs article bizarre). The problem seems to be that tech companies approve EDRs without much checking. Then the argument somehow becomes it is essentially impossible for them to check because there could be any of the thousands of police departments in the world requesting the EDR? Why should MS in the US somehow respond to a request from police department in Cuxhafen in Germany?I think the argument being made here is one of those &#34;we can&#39;t make a perfect solution so no solution works&#34;, which is nonsense. Simply don&#39;t answer requests from police departmenents you can&#39;t verify. I bet you if a police department would request some business sensitive information they would not hand it over without going over the subpoena with a fine toothed comb. The issue is just that they don&#39;t value their customers privacy high enough to do a proper check."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wouldn&#39;t it be better if federal government would open a service for handling all EDRs nation-wide, and then forward the legit ones to the IT companies as needed? It would simplify the verification, maybe scare some hackers away because it&#39;d become a federal crime to fake it, and also allow for some stats on how many such request are really urgent, and how many (I presume a lot) are just used to circumvent the law because courts would reject them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Trying to find more information about Emergency Data Requests leads in large part right back to this discussion and the original Brian Krebs post, with a few hits to various private organizations that explain what it takes to use an Emergency Data Request with them.I&#39;m having trouble finding any basis for this in law.  Can anyone help clarify that?  Are EDRs just 100% voluntary compliance on the part of some private organizations who are choosing to divulge customer information without an actual court order?If that&#39;s the case, why are we lamenting the existence of the hackers and not publicly shaming the companies complying with these nonsense EDRs?  Real court orders aren&#39;t that hard to get, and at least there&#39;d be a more blatant crime to prosecute if anyone forges them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The article seems intentionally misleading. It&#39;s implying that if the organization disabled the &#34;Web &amp; App Activity&#34; setting will not carry over to the user. That&#39;s not what the support page says though:&gt; If you disabled Web &amp; App Activity in the Admin console, it is turned off for Google Workspace users. Users can turn it on if they want.So nobody will be tracked on the web who wasn&#39;t previously. The setting that will be turned on is just the one controlling search history within Gmail, Docs, Drive etc.(But it does seem surprising that they didn&#39;t just show a option dialogue on the next load of a Workspace app and ask the user to choose.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Peoples hatred of google is so strong straight up spam is making it to the top lol. The source cited in the article is HN itself and markets its own product as an alternative."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Imagine going into a restaurant and saying &#34;I really don’t enjoy a medium rare steak please make it medium well&#34; and having the chef say &#34;ok fine but medium rare steak is the best way to enjoy it so I made it medium rare despite what you previously explicitly told me enjoy&#34;.Alternative: Imagine people expect the waiter to always know what they want when they walk in the door and say &#34;I want steak with the usual&#34; but the waiter doesn&#39;t know what the usual is. And it&#39;s because you, the customer (or your &#34;dad&#34;, the workspace admin), has told the waiter not to remember you once you leave the restaurant each time. You don&#39;t really know you did this, you just had some friend from the EFF tell you &#34;Waiters should never remember you!&#34; and so you went along with it.People probably expect Google to &#34;just know&#34; what they&#39;re looking for when you search, and search quality goes down when search history can&#39;t be used to refine results. So Google is putting it back in peoples&#39; faces saying &#34;I am pretty sure you want this on, and with Workspaces, we aren&#39;t using it for ads, just to make the product better&#34;.There is my charitable reading of it."</p>

Glad this is finally out, and really looking forward to seeing what features the React team adds in follow-up releases.The Working Group model really helped us in the community give feedback - APIs like `useSyncExternalStore` wouldn&#39;t have happened otherwise, and I really appreciate the responsiveness on that topic.FWIW, React-Redux v8 is in beta right now:- https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/releasesI think it&#39;s basically ready to go, but I haven&#39;t had a chance to really test out the SSR support I added a couple months ago.  I&#39;d love to have some help testing that out.v7 will _run_ with React 18, but v8 has been specifically reworked to behave correctly when used with React&#39;s new &#34;Concurrent Rendering&#34; capabilities.  We&#39;ve also converted React-Redux itself to TS (no more separate types package).Ideally, I&#39;d like to release v8 as final in the next week or two."</p>

Also the synthetic events reactivity system seems a bit outdated.https://www.solidjs.com is quite awesome but lacks the React ecosystem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"React is not only introducing layers and layers of abstractions/ concepts that are hard to grasp for a newcomer, they are also reclaiming well-established terms.&gt; A transition is a new concept in React to distinguish between urgent and non-urgent updates.&gt;  Urgent updates reflect direct interaction, like typing, clicking, pressing, and so on.

I suspect not, but it is an unfortunate accident he was born in and runs his company from Russia, the government of which is a dirtbag, so, correct me if I am wrong, Kaspersky must be a dirtbag by association, but especially for discovering Stuxnet. Believable, but I think the real reasons Kaspersky is persona non grata is due to having discovered Stuxnet, and Kaspersky Lab suspected of uncovering secret US cyberweapons in the future.I am a patriot, but even I don&#39;t appreciate being lied to by my government. It would be good if the next best cyber security firm and software was half as good as Kaspersky&#39;s. But I suspect not."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Kaspersky also maintains that it “doesn’t have any ties with any government, including Russia’sThis take is either naive in the extreme, or disingenuous.For a security company trying to maintain a trusted reputation, neither of those two options is good.While possibly technically accurate, it is a dodge or a flub that overlooks the fact that their autonomy can be usurped by the governments where they are based and where they operate.To be fair, this is true of almost any company I can think of, although I wonder if a DAO could get around it."</p>

Natural gas prices have gone up and as a result the energy price that customers has to pay is swinging up and down based on supply and demand. It the same story as in many other places in the world. Nuclear represent a stable price of energy that doesn&#39;t get impacted by changing fossil fuel prices, and while the initial capital cost is high, stability and freedom from fossil fuels has their benefits. Especially since fossil fuel and wars tend to be associated with each other. It is a bit indicative of the global age we live in that a war between Russia and Ukraine is dictating what a Japanese citizen is paying for electricity."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Title is misleading and I think many commenters are missing the point. This is support for *restarting existing reactors* and not really a support for nuclear in general.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There was a time during the first shut down when my company decided to reduce peoples hours and also reduce their salaries instead of laying off more employees. I end up working 20 hours a week (instead of my normal 35) with a reduced salary (and I was even able to collect partial California unemployment benefits for the remainder of the reduced hours under a special program called Workshare).Honestly it was amazing - made me really want to find a job that was less pay but also that low in hours. Working less than 40 is nice but once you get down to 20 you have whole DAYS where you can do whatever you want. You sometimes start work at noon or end at noon and then have the remainder of your weekday to yourself or in the company of others. It was an odd experience seeing my neighbours and friends going through so much stress and pandemic related BS while I was (temporarily at least) having revelations about how much I wanted to work in life. Fortunately and unfortunately it was very short lived."</p>

That is a surefire way to burn out.Instead, finding ways to “riff” on your job by doing work with longer time horizons of payoff keeps your job fun.It’s all “work”.  Maybe the title ought to be, “Stop obsessing over focused work.”"</p>

I work this way because it pleases me. Doing my tasks diligently and in a timely manner affords me more time to relax, review what I have created, and enjoy it rather than drag myself to the next task.A bit off topic but as of late there is this creeping normalization of intentionally subpar or less optimized results I&#39;m noticing in our industry but also general society.When did we become so not only complacent but also discouraging of any genuine effort? It is as if everyone is so aloof that if you show any effort or appreciation of your craft that you&#39;re societally acknowledging your own serfdom or that you&#39;re serving &#34;the man&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’m a physician. I really appreciate Tom’s enthusiasm, but I think that enthusiasm led him to overestimate the significance of the problem. Moreover he didn’t really understand for whom he was building this product. At first he thought it would be a consumer product. But he realized that consumers would not pay/subscribe and later learned that advertising wouldn’t work. Next he thought doctors would pay because “Doctors have money, right?” Again paying for this or any service is an expense. Its value has to justify the expense. We pay hundreds of dollars a year for UpToDate because it’s valuable. Cochrane is the gold standard for meta-analyses and they’re publishing for topics that are of clinical significance. Ultimately I doubt anyone is going to change their practice based on this product because there isn’t a compelling reason to do so. 
My major observation is that Tom tried to make a healthcare startup with negligible understanding of healthcare: the players, how payments work, how physicians practice, and what patients want/need. By not understanding the environment you’re not going to be able to understand the Problem which means your Solution will probably fail. This is a mistake repeated by most of the engineer founded health startups I’ve read about.
Finally for anyone wondering I usually recommend ibuprofen 800mg every 8 hours and Tylenol 1000mg every 8 hours. This isn’t medical advice, just something you may find from a quick search."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This was a fun read, but I think it came to the wrong conclusion. The real issue imo was &#34;I had practically only weeks of runway&#34;. You just don&#39;t have time to make it happen.As a fellow start up founder, I see most of my job being just buying time for the business. Buying time to make, to talk, and to think.It wasn&#39;t like the tool had no value to Susan, maybe with a booth at her go-to annual expo, mentioning a few past lawsuits the tool could avoid, and an affinity partnership with her industry association, the tool would have become a fact of life for her.It&#39;s a lot of work, I&#39;m not denying that. Yet, this is the sort of thing YC&#39;s idealized startup stories often fail to say. If &#34;instant Product Market Fit&#34; is so good, then how come practically every new high flying SV startup is using loads of VC money to &#34;bend the market to the product&#34;?Exciting Startups have to venture far, it&#39;s not about &#34;we let you buy your potatoes online&#34; anymore. Chances are you won&#39;t get deals by talking to people once. I wouldn&#39;t say that means your idea is bad."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In all honesty, I don’t think the author correctly identified his error. And I think that’s a shame. It’s right here:&gt; Here I was, living the Silicon Valley dream: making the world a better place through technology.I don’t know how this has become a thing people believe, however widely it might be believed. But if it’s representative of SV or tech innovation at all, it’s either wildly distorted through a wealthy person’s pet futurism project—or held in the imagination of someone aspiring to that stature. SV is about making money, that’s it, that’s the whole story.The totally overlapping error here was assuming those things—making the world better, and making money—aren’t inherently in conflict. And overlapping that: assuming that a profit driven health care system has altruistic goals as such, rather than in concert with its profit-driving priorities.This project could have been successful (and could still do if the author or anyone else wants to pursue it). And it could have been a valuable contribution to society.The author would probably have realized this error if he’d considered entering a global market where health care has different economic incentives. Programs like this which help people are funded by government contracts and grants, not by payment from arbitrary people acting on their arbitrary interests."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a data scientist, perhaps this is a case of a hammer looking for a nail, but  personal finance made a lot more sense when I started treating “money” as: 1) a collection of arbitrary rules invented by humans, 2) probability distributions over the ability to exchange certain assets at different points in time, 3) a giant optimization program.So, the terms “U.S. dollar”, “fixed rate mortgage”, “401k”, “capital gains”, etc. don’t really have any inherent meaning beyond the set of rules that govern their interactions. This rule system itself can change over time depending on politics and human emotions, so you have to try to model the dynamics of this meta-system as well, even though that’s pretty difficult.Once you’ve gathered all the different rules into some programmatic representation, then you decide what it is you want out of life and at what points in your life, then you start optimizing. For example, would you rather have a 10% chance of having $1,000 on some future date, or a 1% chance of having $10,000? The expected return is the same in both cases, so your optimization should really consist of targeting a specific shape for the entire distribution of outcomes rather than a single number (or specific assets).Not surprisingly, the average person (including me) does not have the right combination of 1) detailed knowledge of the global financial system and its rules, 2) how all these rules are likely to change, or 3) the technical background to implement the advanced mathematics required to optimize all of this in an accurate way that actually makes valid predictions.So most people instead just guess and base their financial plans on their hunches about how “money” works, and large organizations that have the time to do all of this modeling in a more rigorous way come out much further ahead.I still think simplifying the “rules” of finance would be one of the best things we could do to reduce wealth inequality, as inequality seems to largely be hidden in the highly volatile landscape of the cost function for the optimization problem I described."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s an indie game called Deep Sixed that felt this way for me. The plot is that you&#39;re a prisoner and your cell is a spaceship that gets moved around for various reasons, and to stay alive you have to constantly fix your spaceship while also battling incoming baddies. It sounded like fun but when I played it I had a genuine stress response. It felt a lot like fixing broken servers while being screamed at on Twitter.

It pushes up the price of that work and is the strongest-possible declaration that something is wrong.Source: Have quit from a field that I love deeply because the environment became intolerable.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have basically the opposite opinion of this article. I often hold up Rocket League as an example of a great free-to-play game. 1) You 100% can unlock a lot of cosmetic items through free play. 2) The items that you buy have absolutely no impact on gameplay and are just visuals.For the same reason that people wear nice clothes in real life, why are you surprised that some people want to look cool in a video game? Are you surprised that people don’t just wear monochrome black shirts in real life? Likewise, you can resell RL items, there’s a market for that. Are you surprised when you can’t resell a shirt you wore for a year at the same price as when you bought it?That’s not to say that games where progression is locked behind time gates where you need to buy 1000 Realm Warp Crystals or whatever just to actually play the game aren’t a toxic hell. But that doesn’t seem to be what the article is pushing against."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A few years ago, Nintendo made a wonderful game called Super Mario Run. It was simple - Mario automatically runs and you tap to jump - but surprisingly deep. The timing of the jumps and the height of jump was paramount, and there was a ton of replayability in trying to get out-of-reach coins and finding shortcuts. It also captured the aesthetic of the Mario World games with modern graphics. I was VERY skeptical of a mobile Mario game, but was won over by the quality of game design and the clear level of polish.Nintendo charged $9.99 for this game. The response was absolute evisceration in the ratings. Mobile game players EXPECTED a F2P experience that would waste their time with energy charge ups, loot boxes, etc. and were upset when Nintendo didn&#39;t do that.
In response, Nintendo switched to this type of experience for their next release, Fire Emblem, which performed much better.The Wikipedia article for Super Mario Run explains in detail.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Run#CommercialA select quote - &#39;[Nintendo President] Kimishima said that &#34;we honestly prefer the Super Mario Run model&#34;, though in a June 2017 investor question-and-answer session, he said &#34;in the future we will consider not only a single set price, but other methods that incorporate a wider variety of elements that allow as many consumers as possible to play&#34;&#39;"</p>

And sometimes psychologists doing evil mindtricks and supporting gambling addictions need to eat too...

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Having used several Google OSS projects I would NEVER consider using an OS from Google.The documentation structure is often atrocious, the are always dozens of recognized but unresolved bugs, those bugs often remain for years, the documentation often is not updated to reflect the state of open bugs so code samples and tutorials are often broken, the bugs are resolved slowly, non-Google pull requests are often left to die on the vine[0], no road maps, the Google employees use an internal build system and the external packages are often broken, and these three words: &#34;Not. A. Priority.&#34; If your bug is not an internal Google priority you are basically out of luck.

These safeguards included:  * Only serving the iframe at specific times, presumably when they knew an intended target would be visiting the site.
  * In some email campaigns the targets received links with unique IDs. This was potentially used to enforcea one-time-click policy for each link and allow the exploit kit to only be served once.
  * The exploit kit would AES encrypt each stage, including the clients’ responses with a session-specific key.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I feel like walkie talkies are something all network engineers need to play with. Furthermore, remember that real world telephone and radio networks were in fact... Networks. (Called &#39;nets&#39; in the radio world)Ethernet, and 802.11, are both based on the concept of a singular channel shared by many individuals. When Alice talks, she says &#39;I&#39;m Alice calling Bob, can you hear me Over&#39;.Alice is the source address. Bob is the destination address. Over is the stop code/stop bit signifying the end of frame. The payload is &#39;can you hear me&#39;.-------This is everything up to layer 3. But if you wanted to send a radio/telegram across the country, you need one more layer, IP4 or the ARRL protocol (American Radio Relay League meets on the air at predestinated times to pass messages to each other on Ham radio frequencies. It&#39;s a human network)I&#39;m Alice, calling the Eastern Operators. I&#39;d like you to relay a message to Bob for me. The message is &#39;Can you Hear me&#39;, Over.This is a radio frame like all others, but an additional layer has been added. The radio operator has its own protocol built on top of the Frames.------Dave may overhear all of this chatter, but Dave knows to stay off the channel (otherwise he will cause interference). Only if Dave is addressed specifically would Dave respond (Ex: This is Alice, calling Dave. How are you doing? Over)We can see that the operator is itself just another person on the network. The operator may have a message from the rest of the world.This is the Eastern Operator calling Alice. I&#39;m relaying a message from Bob. The message is &#39;I got your message Alice!&#39;.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;Seeing Like a State&#34; by James C. ScottI started my career in international development, and the book above provides a dozen case studies on states using scientific management, stats, etc. to try and control their growth/populations/economies and failing miserably.It is a beautiful book in that it illustrates how difficult it is to actually manage a country and economy well, especially if you are trying to completely change it (i.e., &#34;develop&#34; it, solve poverty, etc.). It humbled me as a 22 year old &#34;professional&#34; wanting to fix the world.&#34;The Death and Life of Great American Cities&#34; by Jane Jacobs is a close second to this theme of economic, technocratic development.EDIT: I notice 22 upvotes. WOW! If you are a fan of this book or curious to hear more, please comment. Happy to elaborate. If you want a third book, The Evolution of Civilizations[1] is another fun one here. It tries to apply scientific principles and hypothesis testing to historical analysis![1] https://10millionsteps.com/review-evolution-of-civilizations"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Finally, a question on HN I am &#34;qualified&#34; to answer. During my university education I came across Structures[1] by J.E. Gordon who, unlike me, was an aeronautical engineer but his take on structures really made so much sense to me, as a student of engineering, in a way that the fustian delivery of the  professors at college did not. Some books stay with you for life - this one did for me.[1]  Structures: Or Why Things Don&#39;t Fall Down by J.E. Gordon. Goodreads link: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/245344.Structures"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"PiHKAL by Alexander and Ann Shulgin is on its face a book about love and chemistry. Taken together it becomes more of a treatise on how psychopharmacology is a method of personal and sociological analysis. Drug use becomes a psychological tool to manifest the phenomena of the mind that are normally hidden, and novel synthesis becomes a tool to then access the areas of the mind unexplored throughout history. Aside of all this, the Shulgin&#39;s story is one of absolute dedication to science in the face of its many impediments: internal psychology, interpersonal relations, social stigma, technical innovation, and authoritarian censorship."</p>

There have been a lot of things which have disappeared over the years – such as apps bundled with Windows 3.x which have disappeared in newer versions (for example, Reversi or Cardfile) – but which were never sold as independent products, do they count? And what about stuff which is discontinued but has an upwardly compatible replacement – Visual C++ is the successor to the Microsoft C/C++ line going back to the 1980s, in a somewhat similar way VB.NET is successor to the Microsoft BASIC line going back to the 1970s. Microsoft Mail was replaced by Exchange/Outlook, etc. Xenix, OS/2 and LAN Manager were effectively replaced by Windows NT, the POSIX/Interix/SFU/SUA subsystem was effectively replaced by WSL. There are also products Microsoft sold on behalf of third companies, whether rebranded or under their original names (I mentioned muLISP; muMATH and R:Base are other examples)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like seeing the list of services, but I wish it was called &#34;Microsoft Graveyard&#34; instead of &#34;Killed by Microsoft&#34;.  Some of those wouldn&#39;t be around today regardless of the controlling organization, such as Silverlight and Encarta.  To me, &#34;Killed by Microsoft&#34; makes it sound like Microsoft chose to discontinue a product that otherwise would still be &#34;alive&#34; today."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m one of the creators of YourDigitalRights.org, a service which automates the process of sending data requests (it&#39;s free, open source and were a registered charity). What is described in this article is, unfortunately, a common case with some big tech companies.I&#39;ve recently started an experiment to send data deletion requests to 600 data brokers and document what happens. It&#39;s dark patterns all the way down.The solution is to escalate your request to the local data protection agency (attorney general in case of California). I believe that if enough of us do this it will make a difference, even in the case of Amazon.Following this realization we&#39;ve recently added an optional features which will follow up with you some time after a request is made, and depending on the outcome, offer to automate the escalation process."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had to click through more than 100 links to download all the data, how can this be acceptable? Specially coming from Amazon. How hard is it for them to create an archive with all the data? This is ridiculous, I can&#39;t imagine how was the meeting when they decided to produce purposefully such garbage UX."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I run a part of the data request process at our company. This article is an example where people expect anything technology related to be magic.We have to go through EVERY tech stack we own and look for that person&#39;s data. It&#39;s amazingly manual and tedious and takes about 6 people about an hour per request.We&#39;re working to automate it, but needless to say we try not to broadcast it too broadly.I hate that everyone jumps on any bad experience as a &#34;dark pattern&#34; when there&#39;s plenty of incompetence to share the blame."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I loved Photon. Proton added a lot of nice touches, but I never understood why would you want to turn the tabs into buttons. Tabs is a great metaphor from the real world, and they take less space. I don&#39;t see a single advantage of styling them as buttons. The whole point is that they&#39;re visually connected to the currently visible page.Thankfully however I don&#39;t care too much because I can still completely hide the tab-bar with my userChrome.css, and use &#34;Tab Center Reborn&#34; to have my tabs on the side instead."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve always found the UI after IE6 / FF2 to look &#34;off&#34;, and that&#39;s likely because they started using non-native controls, drawing their own instead of relying on the platform UI.Firefox’s Redesigned Preferences Feel More like the WebThat expresses exactly what&#39;s wrong --- the native UI controls are predictable and accessible and styled with the rest of the OS, and as the cascade of dialogs above it (I&#39;m not sure how that&#39;s even possible --- getting to &#34;Offline Data&#34; From &#34;Exceptions - Saved Passwords&#34;?) shows, you can actually see that you&#39;re controlling the browser and not merely a page inside it (related article: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30697329).Another important change is the introduction of a skeleton screen to make the start feel fastI&#39;ve never heard that term before, but whenever I see things like that, I&#39;m reminded of fancy progress bars and such --- the real problem is that you need one in the first place, and instead of fixing the underlying problem of why it&#39;s taking so long, you try to hide it..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For me Firefox’s UI design started going off the rails with Australis and Photon, where its UI began to be a major component of Firefox as a brand. I much preferred v1-v4 where Firefox felt more focused on being a tool that fit well into your desktop instead of trying to stand out.I’m sometimes tempted to try to start a Firefox fork that returns its UI to a “smaller part of a larger desktop” look and feel, but then I remember how impossible it would be to maintain that over time. Wish Gecko was still embeddable so one could just write a new UI and not have to keep patches maintained."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The issue with crypto is that reasonable use cases are early, and don’t attract attention except for niche communities.There’s a few big ones, for example, filecoin right now has created a commodity market for storage that is currently 10,000 cheaper than S3 in some instances. (See file.app for stats)But realistically, the interesting projects are very small and hard to find.However, scams and ponzi schemes, by their nature are very public, easy to find, and have lots of people talking about them (often for financial gain).Everyone building anything sane is so tired of having to explain that their thing isn’t a ponzi, isn’t an nft thing, and isn’t shilling proof of work, that they don’t post to hacker news, and so they exist outside of your bubble.Crypto is like the story of the blind scientists studying an elephant. The first one touches its trunk and says “it’s a snake!”, the next one touches its tusk and says “it’s a spear!”, the next one touches its side and says “it’s a wall!”. None have the correct answer, because no single party has a full view.The crypto skeptics are as irrational as the crypto optimists: firm believers in their own view, based on an incomplete information."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This format is interesting at first but when it starts getting to 5 paragraphs of dissecting each phrase, it gets too much. Reminds me of the someone-is-wrong-on-the-internet, point-by-point-repliers in internet forums circa 2006."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article (or, rather, the commentary in the link above on the article) talks about the fallacious notion of &#34;market cap&#34; in regards to cryptocurrencies. That is to say, e.g., multiplying the number of bitcoins in existence times the current market price is a silly metric because the entire market would never be able to cash-out at that maximum price.What I was wondering was: is there a better number? e.g., is there a way to calculate the amount of USD put into a cryptocurrency across a timeframe? What I&#39;m imagining is a metric like (sum of all bitcoins bought by USD purchase price) - (sum of all bitcoins sold by USD sale price) = amount of USD that has been put &#34;into&#34; bitcoin. That first glance, one might expect this number to equal zero, but it should be greater than zero because of the new coins created by mining."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; The NES is in some sense a composite-only system. While there is an RGB mod, it&#39;s quite invasive[...]This is something that a lot of even very plugged into retrogaming people don&#39;t really get about the NES and RGB mods. I think it&#39;s very counterintuitive for people now that there is no part of the system that operates in actual &#39;color&#39; information. The NES&#39; video output is composite from start to finish[1], with palette entries corresponding to approximate output frequencies for the color subcarrier.So there is no canonical palette for the NES - the colors produced by games varied by region, a little bit by unit, and especially because NTSC had trouble with stable color even by TV.So people imagine that RGB or HDMI mods of the NES are somehow tapping into a missing layer of raw color information, but what it&#39;s actually doing is intercepting communications with the PPU and modelling (on an fpga) an extra PPU that does operate in RGB, and then constructing a new video signal from that.And then you have to pick a palette, because there isn&#39;t just one.I have an RGB modded NES (a US toploader) but I doubt I will ever buy or make another one. At this point I think it&#39;s better to just use an upscaler, which will produce no less authentic a picture. The main benefit imo of the rgb mod is that there&#39;s less interference so the picture is clearer, even if you just output reconstructed composite from it.[1] There is actually a model of NES PPU that outputs RGB, it was used in the PlayChoice arcade machines (which generally used RGB monitors, not composite) and it has a palette that most people agree is ugly as sin."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There were so many things the NES did right.For instance the color palette was designed with aesthetics in mind:  it had 56 colors that you&#39;d want to use,  compared to the 216 colors of the web safe palette that must have been chosen by a physicist because 60% of them make me want to puke.The Atari 400 and 800 had an elaborate system for game-friendly video that couldn&#39;t touch what the NES did with tiles.  They did amazing things with the TI-99/4A (like simulate framebuffer graphics with tiles so long as you didn&#39;t need to cover the whole screen...  a trick you couldn&#39;t do with the character ROM talked about in this article) but it didn&#39;t have the brilliant end-to-end engineering of the NES...... And of course the ability to extend the hardware with the cartridge took advantage of the falling cost of electronics AND fit with the business model that the cheap console is subsidized by expensive games."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Principally the thing it did right, having lived through the era, is bring a real video game home with Super Mario Bros.At the time I had a C64 and an Atari 2600, but would spend every quarter I could dig up at the arcade at the bowling alley next door playing pretty much anything, but especially Super Mario Bros.The Nintendo was the first console to bring the arcade home and it was absolutely revolutionary."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My wife and I were just talking about this yesterday. She is an extremely specialized surgeon and she is horrified by the academic publishing in her area of expertise. It is often utterly wrong and conflicts directly with her experience. I&#39;m not sure she&#39;d agree with the reasons mentioned in this article here as the main issue - although we have personally seen less ethically motivated doctors publishing research to help line their pockets via the industry. In her opinion the main issue is that academic doctors HAVE to publish in order to advance their careers. So you end up with a never ending stream of terrible research, churned out by doctors that are not experts in doing research and that actually spend most of their time doing other things. This happens even at the best centers; at least in her area of expertise. I don&#39;t know what the solution is, but I do know that whenever she has needed treatment for herself she generally ignores most of the research and talks to the most experienced surgeon she can find."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Evidence-based medicine, more than the indeed important issues raised in the article, is mostly impaired by the absolutely abysmal average quality of clinical research papers. The absolutism of higher-ups combined with their unrivalled (in the scientific world) statistical ignorance is hurting science more than anything else. And there&#39;s a reason to that: MDs are not scientists. We&#39;re highly-skilled workers, and more of the blue-collar kind."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"After reading this article I find only one problem with it, and that is the title.The problem the authors have so perfectly characterized has nothing to do with the emphasis on evidence that medicine requires, but on the distortion imposed on the system by large pharmaceutical companies.The reality of the obstacles standing in the way of rigorous testing for drug or therapy effectiveness does not make evidence-based medicine an illusion.In fact, the authors actually make a strong argument in favor of evidence-based medicine, by stating the need to acknowledge these biases. And that the reason for all these biases is greed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My partner sat in the same cube pod as someone who took their life. One day they were just gone and a crying family member came by to take away a box of things. There was no official acknowledgement of what happened, no service or memorializing, only hushed whispers. It was terrible.Thank you for your humane response to Pete&#39;s death, for creating room for the team to grieve and official acknowledgement that it was no longer business as usual. This is one of those moments that leadership really matters. There&#39;s more to being a leader than shipping a volume of features, you are also an important figure in the lives of your team and they need you in a time of crisis."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Pete would ask to work more hours. He claimed he could use the money. He was a contractor rememberAmidst the loss here, this line stood out to me and brings to mind all the terrible ways contractors are taken advantage of, or at least, treated and compensated vastly different than their &#34;staff&#34;/&#34;full-time&#34; peers who are often doing the exact same work. For fun, google the phrase &#34;permatemp&#34;.E.g. I had a past job as a middle manager where my team interfaced heavily with a group of contractor developers overseas.  When the time came to demo new features and place superlatives upon the various teams, I noticed my leadership cadre said nothing about the contractors and did not acknowledge any of the work they had done.I spoke up about it when the floor was given for anyone else to give kudos where they desired, and mentioned the overseas team and thanked their team lead for working with me on delivering. He spoke up and expressed his gratitude in kind.Apparently, this got my CTO into &#34;trouble&#34; with &#34;legal&#34; because I guess merely acknowledging contractors was some kind of a &#34;problem&#34;. As a result, my boss got in trouble. As a result, I got written up. I was out of that company within six months after relationship with my boss and CTO deteriorated immediately after I opened my darn mouth.For expressing gratitude.To contractors."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I interviewed with my current company (where we work mostly-remote) last year. One of my interviewers was a very sharp, experienced, and nice developer. After I learned they were going to make me an offer, I emailed my interviewers, and this developer emailed me back saying he was looking forward to working together.The week before I started, he passed away in a car accident. I was really looking forward to working with him, but I never got the opportunity.As soon as I found out, I again emailed everyone I knew at the company to express my condolences.When on-boarding I said “I know I’m joining at a rough time for the team”. It turned out it was the day after his funeral (which I found out my manager and at least some devs attended). They didn’t seem to be expecting empathy from a brand new hire, but some folks were obviously still mourning. I’m glad I acknowledged their loss. We didn’t dwell on it, but it might have been really awkward if I had just charged like a bull into a China shop saying “I’m so psyched to be joining your team!!!” as if nothing had happened.In my inbox, I also found an email from our CEO to the whole company (about 100 employees) from the week of his passing.There is also an archived Slack channel to memorialize him where different folks who knew him shared their fond memories. The company established an annual teamwork award in his name. And a lot of folks contributed to a GoFundMe for his son’s education.All of these things are strong indicators that I’m at an awesome company. We don’t say we’re “a family” (don’t believe it if your company or prospective company claims that - often it’s an outright lie and otherwise it’s code for a toxic culture with no boundaries), but we do care about each other.No matter your position, if empathy doesn’t come naturally, learn it. It will serve you in so many situations in life."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In my experience docker-slim[0] is the way to go for creating minimal and secure Docker images.I wasted a lot of time in the past trying to ship with Alpine base images and statically compiling complicated software. All the performance, compatibility, package availability headaches this brings is not worth it when docker-slim does a better job of removing OS from your images while letting you use any base image you want.Tradeoff is that you give up image layering to some extent and it might take a while to get dead-file-elimination exactly right if your software loads a lot of files dynamically (you can instruct docker-slim to include certain paths and probe your executable during build).If docker-slim is not your thing, “distroless” base images [1] are also pretty good. You can do your build with the same distro and then in a multi stage docker image copy the artifacts into distroless base images.[0] https://github.com/docker-slim/docker-slim[1] https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This and other common considerations and gotchas are brought up in Shekow&#39;s excellent Docker optimization guide.https://www.augmentedmind.de/2022/02/06/optimize-docker-imag...Was posted here last month: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30406076"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Using `COPY --chmod` is not the correct solution for this. It works, of course, but it isn&#39;t very logical from Dockerfile readability standpoint. The real issue is the incorrect use of multi-stage builds. In multi-stage builds you define additional build stages where you prepare your binaries(eg. compiling them) and copy to the final runtime stage, so your final stage remains clean of temporary files created by your build steps. Based on your comment in your current build stage you run curl, extract etc., but you don&#39;t actually finish preparing the binary by correcting the executable bit. Instead, you copy the half-prepared binary to runtime stage and then try to continue your further modifications there. Eg. similarily if you would skip extracting step, copy the zip instead and extract it in runtime stage and then you would have the zip and the final binary in your exported image.Another red flag is that you run `apt-get` after copying the binary to runtime stage(because you still want to tweak the binary there). That means any time source for binary changes, the `apt` commands need to run again and are not cached. If you just add the executable bit in your build stage you can reorder them, so the `COPY` comes after `RUN`."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"These comments make me feel like I&#39;m getting old, which is weird to me. There are so many proactive comments that remind me of my 18 year old self.Social awkwardness, for me and for a lot of people I know, sort of just vanished with age.
- The same kind of weird, unexplainable, vicious attitude that passes for cool among teenagers and some early adults fades for most people. The people who still adhere to that code go off and form their own cliques and you just don&#39;t see them anymore.
- Real adulthood is simpler socially. With personal stability (job, hobbies, network, etc.) and age you care less and less what people think and put less emphasis on what people think about you.
- At the same time, you judge people less and less because, what does your judgment really matter? And when you judge people less you judge yourself less.
- A lot of awkwardness is a function of trying hard to fit a social shape and failing. When you let go of most social expectations of yourself and others, in my experience mostly because of age and stability, you lose the awkwardness.If you really need help with social anxiety I have heard that there are psychologists who are good at treating it, although I have never used one myself.Take some comfort in knowing that it will probably pass with time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Practice. Practice practice practice. Which sounds daunting, but……now, I realize it’s unfair to map physical appearance to awkwardness, but…let’s take a look at me in 2008 versus 2021. https://imgur.com/7sR0qKt Can you infer I might have been awkward? Because I was awkward. Always had been, and in a lot of ways, I am still am.But I am vastly better than I used to be. And it was practice. Slow, slow, slow practice. I started at the gym. Built a little confidence. Got a job where I was required to be in more meetings. Built a little more confidence. Moved to a new city. Built even more confidence. Joined a sports league. Built yet even more confidence. It’s a slow process of leveling up and being out there and exposed to the world and learning to live in it.And as you get older, I find for me it’s gotten easier. People in their late-20s and 30s are not the back-biting den of snakes they were in high school—everyone begins to realize they have their own faults and foibles, and you begin to accept that other people are always going through things too. And, conversely, you begin to realize you’re never the star of anyone else’s internal story. People are paying far less attention to your awkwardness than you think. So…roll with it, find some hobbies you like that involve other people, and just keep practicing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Throwing myself out there, getting rejected and snubbed otherwise slapped around a lot .. until I slowly started to figure out how to observe &#34;normal, healthy&#34; people and learn from them.Among the things we learn is -- that we are much more &#34;plastic&#34; (and able to change by sheer force of will) than we initially thought.  Things like hygiene, posture, clarity of speech (such that people can at least understand us) and tonal confidence are, for many of us, simply matters of bad habit that can be unlearned and their negative effects reversed, over time.The more we improve ourselves in these basic areas, the better we feel about ourselves... and soon enough people notice, and over time it becomes not only gets easier but starts to feel natural.  Not instantly but... over time.  Until the day comes when you stop thinking (so much) about how &#34;awkward&#34; you are, and instead you&#39;re thinking about your new life, your new friends, your hot new relationship, your awesome new day job (if that matters), etc.That and two other tips:  (1) Taking the plunge, and moving to a totally new geographic area (or even just getting a different, much better place in the city where you live) can do wonders; as does (2) Paradoxically, not giving an F about what other people think.  That is to say, acknowledging that it matters to some degree, on a certain level ... but in the scheme of things, it also just doesn&#39;t matter.   Which helps you relax and feel confident (which does a lot to ameliorate the negative perceptions people have of you)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Unfortunately, this (really nice) PDF isn&#39;t complete.For me an Operating System means processes in userland, sadly it comes short of that.I&#39;m now pushing my own x86 32bit OS in Rust using [0][1]:There is definitely a shortage of information on this stuff (for example writing a USB driver is really hard and I couldn&#39;t find easily available tutorials - you have to resort to raw *HCI and USB specs to get things done).[0] https://wiki.osdev.org/Expanded_Main_Page[1] https://os.phil-opp.com/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the PDF:
&#34;It is true: in our quest to make full use of the CPU, we must abandon all of those helpful routines provided by BIOS. As we will see when we look in more detail at the 32-bit protected mode switch-over, BIOS routines, having been coded to work only in 16-bit real mode, are no longer valid in 32-bit protected mode; indeed, attempting to use them would likely crash the machine.&#34;So what this means is that a 32-bit operating system must provide its own drivers for all hardware of the machine (e.g. the keybaord, screen, disk drives, mouse, etc). Actually, it is possible for a 32-bit protected mode operating system to switch temporarily back into 16-bit mode whereupon it may utilise BIOS, but this teachnique can be more trouble than it is worth, especially in terms of performance.&#34;--In the toy 32-bit OS I am currently writing, having easy disk access and text output was more important to me than performance, so I decided to implement this technique to access the disk and screen via the BIOS instead of writing an ATA disk driver.Although I could not find any minimal yet complete working examples of dropping to 16 bit and later resuming 32 bit mode, I was able to piece it together and write assembly functions called enter_16bit_real and resume_32bit_mode. See https://github.com/ironmeld/builder-hex0/blob/main/builder-h.... Those routines are working well but beware the project is a volatile work in progress and is coded in hex for bootstrapping reasons."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"https://www.udemy.com/course/writing-your-own-operating-syst.... If someone interesting It&#39;s good course for OS kernel development.

It only lacks an ata disk driver for something like minimum complete kernel. https://github.com/JustVic/melisa_kernel. Sorry for the ads."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a feeling that any piece of closed-source software that becomes important enough will inevitably be reverse engineered by highly motivated people. This is doubly so for Vanced: The original team took pains to not release the source, but it merely took a few weeks for someone else to reverse engineer the reverse engineered codebase.I&#39;ve worked on preserving a few games with decompilers long after the original creators have moved on. Anecdotally, the death of Flash all but killed off a couple of assorted communities that didn&#39;t have enough motivation to hack the binaries themselves.My guess is the only software that can perpetually maintain a community is software where the source code is available to be modified."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The NetBSD kernel still has support for a.out.  On BSD, a.out is something simpler than ELF that works without any problems.^1  On Linux, a.out may have caused problems when building shared libraries thus motivating the switch to ELF.^21. ELF is OK, but times have changed since ELF was created.  The same constraints no longer exist.  Personally, I prefer static binaries and can afford the space for them.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I &#39;m an heavy user of diagrams to take notes while learning topics in biology and medicine. I think the most interesting feature of diagrams.net is its extensibility, which is not frequently mentioned. If you run in the javascript console...    var editorUi;
    Draw.loadPlugin(app =&gt; editorUi = app)
    var editor = editorUi.editor
    var graph = editor.graph

... then you can automate changes to the diagram using mxGraph&#39;s api [1] on the `graph&#39; variable from the console.Around this plugin mechanism I wrote some dirty hacks for personal use to make the editor behave more to my likings [2] (some features stopped working with recent versions of the desktop app), and an even dirtier Emacs mode for editing labels and having the js REPL available directly from Emacs when I need to run some code to fix my diagrams programmatically [3] (based on Indium [4] + the fact that electron apps can be launched with --remote-debugging-port=...). It&#39;s not pretty, but works enough for me, and it&#39;s only thanks to the customizability that diagrams.net allows.[1] https://jgraph.github.io/mxgraph/docs/js-api/files/view/mxGr...[2] https://gitlab.com/spellcard199/drawio-plugin-eight-droves-o...[3] https://gitlab.com/spellcard199/emacs-drawio[4] https://github.com/NicolasPetton/Indium"</p>

Not bad but not a new thing either. Starting from 1991 when he joined Softdisk it took him a few months to figure out smooth horizontal scrolling, and in just a bit more than one year, around late 1992 he managed to go from it to a mature ray casting engine, and you can see his evolution from hovertank to wolfenstein. And it took him another year to go from Wolfenstein to shadow caster to Doom. Quake took longer but it was still impressive considering he has to got it before anyone else solved it.I mean this guy learns really fast. It&#39;s not only the rendering engine remind you, he had to do a lot of other parts of the engine too."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Over the past few months we’ve been trying hard to make Appwrite as simple to setup and use as possible. Your candid feedback has been crucial in shaping the project and it would be great if you can share some features you’d like to see in the project going forward.What is Appwrite ? 
In simplest terms, Appwrite is an open source Backend As A Service (aka BaaS). Appwrite is an all in one solution with all the essentials you need like Authentication, User Management, Realtime Databases, Webhooks, Storage, Cloud Functions, SDKs for your favourite language and it’s light weight. Appwrite even runs on a Raspberry Pi. Most importantly, Appwrite is self-hosted which means you own your data and prevent any vendor lock-ins.Talking about Appwrite’s features
- Realtime Databases and events ( Recent benchmarks have showed a single server handling 1M+ concurrent connections )- SDKs for iOS, Android, Flutter, Web ( React, Angular, Vue, Svelte etc.) Python, PHP, Node, Deno, Kotlin and more- Bring your own Database - Use your choice of SQL or MySQL databases ( MariaDB, MySQL, MongoDB and more )- Database permissions for finer tuned access control- Storage API with built in encryption, compression and antivirus- Bring your own Storage - Use your choice of the local filesystem, DigitalOcean Spaces, S3 or an any other storage provider of your choice- Cloud functions with support for over 20 runtimes- Webhooks to connect with 3rd party APIs and services- User Management and Authentication- Multiple authentication methods - email, 25+ OAuth providers, JWT, API Keys- Completely stateless and extensible architecture allowing easy integration with your existing backend- A Dashboard, CLI and VSCode extensions to manage your server and many more..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From my quick research when I was selecting the next backend I was going to use for a project in the past, and today reading some responses on this page:- Appwrite is written in PHP. Just because something is open source, doesn&#39;t mean it is extensible, scalable or otherwise written well. I haven&#39;t seen many popular projects written in PHP recently. The only time I used PHP was in university, where the PHP application was the target machine in a CTF.- AppWrite doesn&#39;t yet have their Cloud version, so they aren&#39;t ready to be a &#34;backend as a service&#34; - it&#39;s a product that isn&#39;t ready &#34;as a service&#34;. That&#39;s why I didn&#39;t use it, and I can see similar sentiment here on HN. I&#39;d be willing to try it out when it&#39;s ready.- It&#39;s not built on Postgres. Their comment about Supabase using postgres did not include any real substance: &#34;I&#39;m trying to be as objective as I can, but building the entire ecosystem around a single product like Postgres ( even though tried and tested ) comes with its own downsides...&#34;. The downsides of what AppWrite might be that they&#39;re rolling their own database... in PHP? They may not be database experts, and there&#39;s lots to think about and fix when building a database, and Postgres has been tested for a long time.- Not much progress is happening on the GraphQL side: https://github.com/appwrite/appwrite/pull/974/files, whereas Supabase has it: https://supabase.com/blog/2021/12/03/pg-graphql.Overall, it seems like the project doesn&#39;t move as fast as its competitor (primarily Supabase) for features I care about, and perhaps this is caused by PHP?Anyway, I&#39;d love to hear your thoughts about my comments, Eldad and team."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Before I even look into it, I&#39;ll tell you this: the headline was enough to grab my attention on its own. I strongly feel this is a badly underserved niche and I&#39;ve had major issues with Firebase&#39;s limitations. You definitely have a winning idea here in this user&#39;s opinion."</p>

It was perfectly-crafted clickbait because I clicked through just to read how insane it was.The whole thing never happened! Complete and total hoax.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Former Microsoftie here.After all the business ethics training videos I had to sit through, I am infuriated by this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was prepared to get my pitchfork out, but after reading I&#39;m struggling to connect the dots. This article is scant on details of what illegal or favorable behavior Microsoft is expecting in exchange for money. The only concrete mention is a previous SEC filing that has nothing to do with this whistleblower. The first example about $40k doesn&#39;t seem to explain what Microsoft was actually thinking it would get for that money, let alone whether that money was illegal. At worst, it seemed to violate corporate policy, which I can understand if that got missed in an initial review. The other examples don&#39;t sound like bribery on Microsoft&#39;s part so much as resellers squeezing as much out of a deal as they can get away with. I call that a problem with the reseller model.I imagine Microsoft looks the other way while resellers make lots of money because, realistically, being in some of the markets mentioned is impossible unless you&#39;re connected with the right person. While not necessarily efficient, I wouldn&#39;t call that illegal or even unethical without a lot more detail than this article provides.But maybe I&#39;m missing something. This article reads as poorly researched, and the whistleblower comes off as disgruntled more than ethical.Edit: It&#39;s worth noting that the whistleblower&#39;s original words are a little more well-written than this article [1]. However, it makes the contrast clearer between what is factual vs what is only insinuated.1: https://www.lioness.co/post/microsoft-is-using-illegal-bribe..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This has been common knowledge for me for a long time, after this case surfaced in the media here in Romania: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_licensing_corruption...Pretty much all of the public system uses windows as OS, and most of the times it&#39;s just to use a browser to access a webapp. But there are actual windows lock-ins (due to people training and existing workflow/infrastructure that has no incentive to change), such as MS Office and Adobe Reader.So there was no reason for Microsoft to bribe decision-making people to use windows, windows was already firmly locked in, they did it just so they can overprice licenses and for them to accept leased licenses instead of a permanent one time pay windows license. Big win for MS and bribe takers, big loss to common decency and public spending availability.A sign of a healthy democratic government can be seen in the decisions to build future public software infrastructure on open source technology, and use Linux as client/server OS (as it&#39;s pretty much the only other alternative offering similar ease of use/maintenance/compatibility with existing software).edit: wrote this to show it&#39;s not necessarily the cost of doing business, in most places, because the software ecosystem is already locked in and can&#39;t be replaced overnight and without considerable spending. It&#39;s just the cost of extracting more public money. And sometimes it&#39;s the cost to keep the business safe from decisions to steer towards Opensource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LiMux"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I would speculate that this is mostly meant to be used for identifying bot rings and ATO (account takeover).  Brand new accounts on a site with open signups are, on average, quite a lot more suspicious than older accounts.  There&#39;s a significant demand for aged accounts to use for various banned activities (mostly spam first and vote manipulation second), and fingerprinting is likely a high value signal in combating it.  Two easy ways to generate aged accounts in bulk - create a whole lot of them and wait (and optionally do some activity on them to make them look real), or take over abandoned or compromised accounts.  Fingerprinting is very good at identifying clusters of the former, and at least helpful for the latter.EFF appears to have rebranded Panopticlick as &#34;Cover Your Tracks&#34;, but it&#39;s usually a fun thing to look at in discussions of this type as an example of what can go into a fingerprint and the informational value of various parts:https://coveryourtracks.eff.org"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"5 of us wrote Microsoft Works for the Macintosh while working at home from 1984 to 1992. Without the internet, we got together as needed to merge code, usually once a month, but sometimes once a week. We talked on the phone. We went to Microsoft once in awhile. It was ideal and worked very well.Maybe it was just our personalities that made it work, but I am astonished that any programmer would rather go into the office. With high speed internet and video conferencing, I assume that some people are just very lonely and need face to face. I see nothing wrong with that. I understand it, but after 1992 I took a job that forced me into an office and I hated it.I can safely say I never wrote any good code while working in an office. There are too many distractions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The coding used by this survey is a joke.  If 40% of an occupation says they work outdoors that&#39;s below 50% so it&#39;s bucketed into the work from home category on that criterion.  I think if even 20% of a job is saying they work outdoors that&#39;s pretty strong evidence you&#39;re missing some information about what the other 80% are doing in their job that prevents it from being a work from home job.  The net result of their setup is obviously a vast overestimate so take the 37% number with a grain of salt."</p>

My company is a f500 company that I would not have thought would remain remote, but we have, and it really helps us hire and retain talent.  It honestly helps us recruit people that would otherwise have sought out trendier employers."</p>

It&#39;s not like I can draw a pikachu, release it to public domain and make a slam dunk legal claim that all other pikachus are henceforth kosher.I think Adam Neely makes a more relevant point in his videos about Dark Horse and Levitating: it doesn&#39;t really matter what any actual infringement claim is because you can typically find relevant prior art from legitimate works of music if you dig deep enough, even without going through the exercise of autogenerating note sequences.As I understand, the legal arguments focus on whether there is a clear and traceable connection between the creative process for a song and the alleged infringed work, and whether there is clear intent to omit credit where it is due. I.e. the argument already starts from the assumption that similarities and inspirations from existing works of art can and do exist."</p>

It has the entertainment value needed to capture the interest of young viewers who may not be otherwise interested in engineering disciplines. There are many, many other channels out there (backyard scientist, action lab, Cody’s lab, stuff made here, etc.) who are very successful on YouTube, but they tend to cater to viewers who are deliberately choosing to watch their videos."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Steve Yegge tells the story[1] of his dad cooking:&gt; When I was a teenager, my dad and my brother Mike decided to make homemade chili. I&#39;d never seen it made before, and I watched with keen interest as they added beef, beans, some veggies and spices, and other ingredients. Dad would taste it, add some more ingredients, wait a bit, taste it again. My dad has some pretty good recipes. So you can imagine my puzzlement when he opened the cupboard, pulled out 2 cans of Hormel chili, opened them and dumped them in. I waited a respectful moment or two before asking him why he was adding canned chili to his chili.Similarly, I think it detracts a bit from building a home-made x-ray machine if one of the ingredients is an x-ray tube from an old x-ray machine.[1] http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/10/egomania-itself.html"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wrote another comment saying I couldn&#39;t reproduce but since this is on the front page, I do have a lot of questions for the authors of this CVE. Under their &#34;prevention&#34; section they say manufacturers should use rolling codes. This implies these FOBs don&#39;t use them, but per my previous understanding, they do.Perhaps there is more to the setup of this CVE than they&#39;re talking about. Is it possible they&#39;re doing a rolljam attack + replay?The CVE is really scant on details, so while I believe they did manage to get this to work, they don&#39;t really say how.If rolling codes are implemented, it should be pretty simple with the right gear to prove it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"2017 and 2018 vehicles. That&#39;s pretty surprisingly recent!I understand that, in general, door locks aren&#39;t considered to be very high-security in vehicles: doors can be opened in other ways. But remote start is a very big deal. Article doesn&#39;t mention whether the car prevents people from driving away after it&#39;s been started. I would have loved to see a portion of the video where they tried to shift into D and move the car."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To be honest, I&#39;m annoyed by the benign protestware messages when they start to get in the way of using the software, particularly on mobile. I was looking at the isomorphic git documentation the other day, and noticed that their &#34;#BlackLivesMatter #DefundThePolice&#34; banner scrolls under the rest of the content, leaving this annoying gap that takes up screen real estate, especially in landscape mode on a phone.[0] What&#39;s the point? Is a single person going to be persuaded to support either cause by seeing this banner on a relatively niche JS library that reduces readability of its documentation? Will anyone find the library any more useful because they support the cause? (I support neither cause, but find the library useful nevertheless.)Recently, I saw a similar pattern with the Svelte REPL adding a pro-Ukraine message.[1] The banner along the bottom is so large that landscape mode becomes unusable, and non-trivial examples are hard to see even in portrait mode. Again, who does this help? (I support Ukraine, so feel like, &#34;yeah, I get it; can I close the banner now?&#34;)The worst part about these patterns is that they can&#39;t be disabled and seem to be deployed haphazardly without regard for the overall design.While these aren&#39;t malware, they are still hostile for the majority of users who aren&#39;t so gung ho in their support for the current thing.[0] https://isomorphic-git.org/docs/en/deleteBranch[1] https://svelte.dev/repl/hello-world?version=3.46.4"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just don&#39;t understand what the node-ipc dev was expecting when he did that.&#34;Hm, maybe if I put malware into a community-trusted module that destroys files of people in a certain geopolitical region, the countless innocent citizens that are affected will realize what they did wrong! Wait, who am I actually targeting again?&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It harms all of technology and by extension anyone who participates in the modern world.  Just like any malware or other antisocial behaviour.It&#39;s a bit too indiscriminate to be a good protest, unless the thing you want to tear down IS the whole modern development process, which is based on the idea that most people are somewhat trustworthy and you can get the risk down to an acceptable level through the usual means.It doesn&#39;t quite work if malware is not only a threat, but a semi-mainstream thing sometimes made by people you would think you could trust.   The normal social process of trust breaks down if malware is included in the scope of normal things people sometimes do, as opposed to purely being something by the more criminal types.I almost wonder if these people don&#39;t actively want to tear down tech itself, or not care, given how many coders dislike the fact that society is tech dependant."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It would be really great to recreate loved ones after they have past in some sort of digital space.As I’ve gotten older, and my parents get older as well, I’ve been thinking more about what my life will be like in old age (and beyond too). I’ve also been thinking what I would want “heaven” to be. Eternal life doesn’t appeal to me much. Imagine living a quadrillion years. Even as a god, that would be miserable. That would be (by my rough estimate) the equivalent of 500 times the cumulative lifespans of all humans who have ever lived.What I would really like is to see my parents and my beloved dog again, decades after they have past (along with any living ones at that time). Being able to see them and speak to them one last time at the end of my life before fading into eternal darkness would be how I would want to go.Anyway, there’s a free startup idea for anyone—recreate loved ones in VR so people can see them again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My prediction/hope is that NeRFs will totally revolutionize how the film/TV industry. I can imagine:- Shooting a movie from a few cameras, creating a movie version of a NeRF using those angles, and then dynamically adding in other shots in post- Using lighting and depth information embedded in NeRFs to assist in lighting/integrating CG elements- Using NeRFs to generate virtual sets on LED walls (like those on The Mandalorian) from just a couple of photos of a location or a couple of renders of a scene (currently, the sets have to be built in a game engine and optimized for real time performance)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"TangentI wonder what happens to most people when they see innovation such as this. Over the years I have seen numerous mind-blowing AI achievement, which essentially feel like miracles. Yet literally after an hour I forget what I even saw. I don&#39;t find these innovations to have a lasting impression on me or on the internet except for the times when these solutions are released to the public for tinkering and they end up failing catastrophically.I remember having the same feeling about chatbots and TTS technology literally ages ago, but at present time, the practical use of these innovation feel very mediocre."</p>
