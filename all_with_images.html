								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi HN!I built this small app in my spare time to aggregate books recommended on Hacker News. I personally find books recommended on HN to be super helpful, so I think this is the way that I can contribute back.This book aggregation idea is not new. A bunch of sites have done similar things [1, 2, 3].Yet one common limitation of those sites is that they have limited recall (i.e. not able to get a comprehensive set of book mentions), and thus don&#39;t paint an accurate picture of what the top books are. They&#39;re all based on insufficient rules, e.g., looking for Amazon Links. As you can see from my app, people often do not include Amazon links when recommending a book.I wondered, why can&#39;t we just match book names? Well, not so easy. Some books have pretty short names, e.g. Meditations [4], or Steve Jobs [5]. Some book name might as well be the name of a movie, e.g. Ready Player One [6]. Simply matching the names of the books would produce a whole lot of irrelevant results.This is where Deep Learning comes into play. Recent advances in large NLP models (transformers and BERT in particular) have made machine language understanding unprecedentedly accurate. It enables me to fine-tune a BERT model on a couple thousand labeled HN comments and predict accurately whether each word in a comment is part of a book or not - a task commonly termed as Named Entity Recognition (NER).As a result, my app is able to present a whole lot more results while maintaining desirable accuracy. For example, NER works pretty well on the tough examples I mentioned ([4, 5, 6]). Compared to prior sites, my app captures 9-50X more mentions and thus presents a much more complete picture of what books are recommended on HN.Furthermore, I&#39;ve made sure that the comments are presented well in the UI because the recommendations are just as useful as the books. I highlighted the mentioned book name, and used a custom NLP-based ranking function to sort the comments. These are non-trivial improvements over prior sites, which I hope you can find useful.Nevertheless, this app is not without limitations: 1) matching book names would fail when two books have the same or similar names; 2) although not often, this approach would wrongly classify some short stop-word names [7] and 3) sometimes NER fails to see that the commenter actually hates the book. These problems can be alleviated with more Deep Learning. For 1), one can use BERT to learn the authors mentioned which can be used as a filtering criteria. 2) and 3) should be fixable with more training data (currently there are only ~4,000 hand-labeled HN comments).Lastly, I&#39;d like to especially thank my gf who helped me label ~1,000 comments, which boosted the model accuracy by 5 percent! I also want to thank the people who create and maintain the HackerNews big query dataset [8]. And of course, thank everyone on HN who recommends books to others.Hope you enjoy this app!  Feedback and suggestions are welcome :)[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15169611[2] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10924741[3] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12365693[4] https://hacker-recommended-books.vercel.app/category/0/all-t...[5] https://hacker-recommended-books.vercel.app/category/1/all-t...[6] https://hacker-recommended-books.vercel.app/category/0/all-t...[7] https://hacker-recommended-books.vercel.app/category/12/past...[8] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19304326P.s. The amazon links are NOT sponsored. This app is free of monetization."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice. The Hacker News archive contains a wealth of great information. I&#39;ve previously performed similar extractions like OP but with grep and SQL. I&#39;ve also looked for people who have accurately predicted the stock market (I did identify one pro investor. He&#39;s now into NFTs). I&#39;ve found so much cool stuff, spending whole nights looking for interesting users and reading their entire post histories and being blown away by many insightful posts. I&#39;ve been considering making a blog consisting entirely of insightful HN posts that I come across."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You mention the Amazon links are not affiliate links. As a default, that&#39;s a nice move, but I believe you are within your rights to add a toggle to enable affiliate links. The money probably isn&#39;t the point but it&#39;s nice to make enough to buy even a single beer or coffee from a side project, and honestly I believe just about everyone would toggle the option if they found the tool useful."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a minor counterpoint: I&#39;ve come to dread blogs and newsletters because so many of them are written by grind culture freaks who only write faux-insightful SEO&#39;d content as a way to build an audience to sell snake oil to. These days the only blogs I trust are the ones I see on the top of HN or lobsters, which is unfortunate because I have interests beyond tech and I find it very, very difficult to find good blogs I can read about those interests.I think that shows there is a problem with blogging that goes beyond just the medium. Consider that blogging is a decentralised ecosystem, so you have no central place for discovery outside of Google specifically and search generally. Being on the top of Google is an attractive proposition because it means many eyeballs and lots of ad revenue. Therefore it is natural that many new blogs exist to game the search engine, hence the term &#34;blogspam&#34;.Some of the same incentives exist with large social media sites as well, but on Twitter and the like if you mute/block enough big people and follow only those you care about, your feed will eventually become clean enough to look at every day. So I think it is much more important to solve the discovery problem with blogs if you want them to get more traction."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yeah blogs are still here, BUT: (like email (sob) and telephone-calling (hooray)) a lot of people that once did blog don&#39;t anymore.Not in the &#34;I had kids so my blog went dark for a few years&#34; sense, but in the sense of &#34;ooh twitter was invented and now I just emit a halfassed one-sentence brainfart or 5-second tiktok cellphone video and get way more dopamine hits&#34;.I&#39;ve been reading blogs and perusing my self-curated NetNewsWire RSS feeds for 20+ years, and blogs never went away, RSS never died, Google Reader getting googled didn&#39;t really matter, etc.And there are probably technically more blogs now than ever before.But still, the blog kinda died, in the sense that it would be a lot more surprising to learn your friend&#39;s 80-year-old grandma has a blog today than it would have been in 2011.It went from an increasingly-mainstream thing to a decreasingly-mainstream thing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well, blogs are still very much there. I began blogging in 2006 and I still continue to write blog posts, mostly to take notes, share my thoughts, etc. I still follow my favourite bloggers via RSS feeds. I don&#39;t think the culture of blogging ever went away. The blogosphere along with its tag clouds are still very much there.I think what has changed in the last two decades or so is that a lot of new users have come on the Internet and this new generation of users spend most of their time in walled gardens thereby making the bloggers look like a small minority."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A more relevant metric to consider - monthly mortgage payment to monthly income ratio.Average interest rates in 2007 were 6.34% vs ~2.80% today. [1]* 6.34% / $2,000 monthly payment / 20% down (~$65k) &gt;&gt; $328,319 price of home* 2.80% / $2,000 monthly payment / 20% down (~$98k) &gt;&gt; $489,794 price of homeHomebuyers will make purchasing decision based on their monthly mortgage payments, instead of the home price.When interest rates fall, the home&#39;s price goes up but the monthly payment can stay the same. Therefore, increases in home (and other asset, since lower bowering costs can drive institutional investment in assets higher and non-linearly) prices can be driven higher without any change in supply / demand dynamics.Some hypotheticals to consider:* as rates approach and touch 0, what will drive up home prices then?* what happens when rates go up?[1] http://www.freddiemac.com/pmms/pmms30.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While it doesn&#39;t directly affect the average person&#39;s purchasing power, the same dramatic increase is happening in other asset values as well. [0] One interesting thing to note is that 2019 EV / EBITDA values were already &#34;high,&#34; before the coronavirus was spreading.I suspect these two phenomena have different causes overall, but low interest rates are a common factor that cause all asset prices to increase.On the housing side, I suspect consumers purchase the house that their cashflow can comfortably support, not necessarily the one where they believe it is correctly valued, because the assumption that house values only increase means purchasing a well constructed house is almost never a &#34;bad deal.&#34;I&#39;m not sure what the &#34;solution,&#34; is, but knowing that voters hate when their home values fall does not give me confidence that prices will decrease in the long term.[0] https://www.statista.com/statistics/953641/sandp-500-ev-to-e..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I live in Austin TX and got one of the mailers last year.  I was wondering how you pulled it off.The handwriting on the outside does make it look personal but, once you open it, it is obviously computer generated due to the consistency of the writing.  If anything, I&#39;d say the writing in inside undermined the message because nobody is going to handwrite a letter to solicit that business.  You should test only doing the signature only and see if impacts your response rate.We also got a couple of &#39;we want to buy your home&#39; mailings.  It does feel like it impacts our open rate but I can&#39;t tell if it is just due to novelty.I think the main reason it &#39;works&#39; as a business proposition is that the City is doing blanket increases and relying on protests to catch their mistakes.  They do this (in part) because they are forbidden from using actual MLS data.  It costs me 3-4 hours to do a protest so outsourcing it makes sense if your time is valuable.  But when it came down to it, I wasn&#39;t willing to let them represent me -- something about it felt off -- and I wound up just accepting the increase.The system doesn&#39;t feel broken -- just wasteful.  How else are you going to do a property tax?  I do wonder if this goes the way of medical billing (overcharge at first because you know you are going to lose some to protests) or it creates a watchdog effect that make the City limit the increases to an amount that is not likely to draw protests."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Really impressive and fun to build I&#39;m sure. I bought an Axidraw last year to play around with making fake signatures of fake people and as well we were getting a ton of Etsy orders and we always write a hand written note, but we couldn&#39;t keep up at Christmas time and my wife&#39;s wrist was breaking, so it saved our bacon when we had to write like 600 notes in 6 weeks.The fact that you have to keep replacing the sheet and realigning is definitely a drag, but we made a system that worked well enough for us. Making the SVG letters is a pain and we are working on designing our own font from my wife&#39;s handwriting, but you can at least SVGize a picture of your writing and then touch it up in an editor.Gives a good excuse to buy lots of different fun pens and paper, but yeah it&#39;s annoying when a pen stops writing half a letter and I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s just an ink thing or a pressure thing.We&#39;ve gotten positive reviews that mention our handwritten notes at least and lots of comments on great service and such, so we think it makes a difference."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While this is honestly very cool from an engineering perspective, it feels highly unnecessary and even disingenuous. the whole point of sending a handwritten letter &#34;in this day and age&#34; is to signal that real effort was put forth for this communication which indirectly shows its importance to the sender.The difficulty and tediousness of the action is precisely what gives it it&#39;s perceived value in the eyes of the receiver.And while it&#39;s arguable that building such an elaborate contraption to mimic handwriting is in itself a signal of the importance of the communication, it still gives off a sense of disingenuousness to me."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; seems to compare the Firefox version number with 65 ... I’ve no idea what the purpose of this isI previously worked on JS infra at Google.  Google uses a lot of shared JS libraries that date back over a decade, and those libraries have accumulated lots of workarounds for browsers that nobody cares about anymore.  (One especially crazy seeming one from today&#39;s perspective is that there&#39;s a separate implementation of event propagation, I believe because because it dates back to browsers that only implemented one half of event bubbling/capture!)It&#39;s very difficult to remove an old workaround because1. it&#39;s hard to be completely sure nobody actually depends on the workaround (especially given the wide variety of apps and environments Google supports -- Firefox aside, Google JS runs on a lot of abandonware TVs), and2. it&#39;s hard to prioritize doing such work, because it&#39;s low value (a few less bytes of JS) and nonzero risk (see point 1) without meaningfully moving any metrics you care about.In all, how to eliminate accumulated cruft like is a fascinating problem to me in that I can&#39;t see how it ever gets done.  And it&#39;s not a Google thing.  Even the newer cooler startup I now work at has similar &#34;work around old Safari bug, not sure if it&#39;s safe to remove&#34; codepaths that I can imagine will stick around forever, for similar reasons."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Technically, color me impressed.Business-wise, I&#39;m skeptical:- Alternative browser engines have always fallen behind, eventually.- Open-source is a huge win for most embedded applications.- Having a big company backing something is a huge win too, since something like Webkit ain&#39;t going away.I think one possible outcome here might be an acquisition. Microsoft was forced to eat crow with Edge adopting Google&#39;s engine. This would be an opportunity for Apple, Microsoft, or Amazon to leapfrog Google. A GPU or multicore-accelerated browser could make the iPhone/Macbook/etc. much more responsive than Chrome.Another might be some open-source strategy, but I don&#39;t quite know what it might be."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"*Closed source browser.Flow is yet another project pulling on open source resources, and the browser market created from open browsers, and trying to privatize it. Imagine if google could just make whatever internal changes to chromium and nobody knew about it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not directly relevant to the article, but it&#39;s probably a public service to have this here:
If you&#39;re in the U.S., do not consent to a search! Ever!If the police ask permission to search you, your car, or your house, say &#34;I do not consent to a search&#34;. Followed by, &#34;Am I being detained?&#34; If the answer is &#34;No, you are not being detained.&#34; then leave immediately (unless at your house, in which case go inside and lock the door).Police are good at making you feel as if you have to consent. They might say, &#34;We&#39;re going to search your car now.&#34; Makes it seem like you don&#39;t have a choice and it&#39;s happening one way or another, yeah? Well it&#39;s not the case. That was your cue to say, &#34;I do not consent to a search&#34;. Saying &#34;I do not consent to a search&#34; might prevent a search or make evidence obtained during that [illegal] search inadmissible. Or it might be found that the police had probable cause or other reason to make the search legal, in which case you lost nothing.Record + immediately upload such an interaction if you can.As an aside, I appreciate like 90% of the work the police do."</p>

I develop mostly via SSH and RDP so I found that any connection was important and total bandwidth wasn&#39;t the highest priority. Also in the US, way better coverage of 4g. Because of that invested fully in 4g and not at all in 5g.* 11 in 1 Panorama External Antenna (LG-IN2447) around $500. 4 internal cradlepoint antennas, see photo below. In retrospect would not have invested so heavily in wifi antennas and bought more 4g. I also added a little antenna lifter to make sure it has line of site of all cell towers, I wanted it to be the highest point on my sprinter van roof.* Cradlepoint IBR1700 1200M-B around $900 on ebay. Runs on 12 volt, a ton of antenna ports has 1 internal modem that supports big US carriers, came with an additional modem that does the same for carrier aggregation. A bunch of different ways to configure the router to aggregate links, mostly I switch back and forth manually, I found that if there was an issue it would be obvious and I could just switch the link. Cradlepoint software wouldn&#39;t handle issues and signal strength that well. Honestly one carrier has been plenty good for me though and between ATT and Verizon, I only have issues in the national parks where there are cell dead zones.* Verizon and ATT 4g cell plans. I added 1 line on my family plan for Verizon and the same with a friends family plan with ATT for $20 a month each. Took some phone calls into support to get it to work but after some escalations in the support chain I have unlimited 4g data. Total bill is around $50 a month.* Still room to add more sim cards and more antennas. It honestly works great though, get 20-150 mbps basically everywhere.Photo of my antenna and cradlepoint router/modem:

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a pretty impressive setup. Recently I lived in an RV for a year and my setup was much more janky than this...Basically consisted of a gl.inet router that I plugged in a old Moto X4. This allowed me to get wifi from whichever campsite we stayed at (always garbage) and then I would pay for 100GB from Cricket and T-Mobile. I would swap sims when I would run out of data about half way through the month.Then I discovered I could get unlimited data on Cricket with a regular phone plan if I changed the TTL on the router. Ended up being the most stable option for the last few months."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I lived and worked remotely from a van in Australia for a year... in 2008. It was pretty different back then. We kitted the van out with a solar panel  and batteries. There was some 3G service available near roads, and something like CDMA a little more widely. But at times we&#39;d end up driving miles of dirt track to try to find high ground to pick up a signal. My gf would hold the 3G receiver up and look for signal. During one of these treks, trying to turn around on a narrow dirt track way outside of Tenant Creek, the side of the road collapsed like a sand dome under one wheel of the van and we began listing to the side. I had to hold it up with my shoulder so the whole van wouldn&#39;t fall over on its side. My gf got out, causing it to tip even more, and started throwing herself against the back of it, while I tried to rock it out of the ditch. It was at this point that I noticed that what I had thought was a tree branch (odd, since there were no trees around), was actually a 4-5 foot long black snake that was moving rather quickly toward us up the road. I guess that gave us the adrenaline burst we needed, because we miraculously heaved the van free and jumped inside just in time. I started it and unceremoniously drove right over the snake.Another funny story... One night camping off a road, not in a campsite, we heard a ruckus outside the van where we had our table and cooking  stuff set up under a tarp. It was pitch black out. We kept a katana under the platform bed for protection. So I opened the rear door and jumped out in my boxers and sandals, holding this sword, and found myself looking at a large kangaroo that was rifling through our cookware. I got back in the van and said, forget it, I&#39;m not fighting that thing... we&#39;ll just have to clean it up in the morning."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I offer phone support for a niche accounting app (https://quailhq.com), and everything in this article rings 112% true to me -- but especially this:&gt; ...all sorts of people call you, and I’ve really learned a lot by talking with users directly on the phone.Sometimes users call me because they want to report a bug, or they&#39;ve forgotten their email address. Sometimes they want business advice (!), or they have a niche feature they want to request.&gt; This may be a virtue of the Japanese, but, basically, everyone who calls is civil and polite.Hahahaha. Haha. Hah. Ahem. The biggest surprise to me when I started offering support (first email, and then later by phone) is how _aggressive_ people can be. My app has two classes of users -- one free, one paid -- and the paying users are almost invariably polite and efficient while the free users can be really quite...hard to help. &#34;YOUR SHITS BROKE FIX ASAP&#34; is my favorite password reset request, etc.All of my users are American (or Australian), which might have something to do with it. Happily, once you break through that aggressive exterior and people realize you&#39;re just a person trying to help them out they almost invariably do a 180 and become helpful and polite, and we get whatever it was straightened out together.It&#39;s almost like there&#39;s something cultural happening in America that&#39;s making everyone assume the worst when interacting with people they don&#39;t know..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I would abstract this topic to: talking to your users is important, and phone is a high-bandwidth medium.In particular, it seems like this developer recognized that phone connects them to their less technically savvy users, who - by being most different from the dev himself - can give him the most valuable outside perspective. Depending on your market, if you&#39;re trying to sell into non-techies this could provide hugely valuable insights.In general, the closer you are to the development side of things, the more you have a very specific (and I guess &#34;correct&#34;) model of how your system works. By default, all of your documentation/support forms/etc implicitly reflect this model. But if your users model the thing in their brain differently, then your help/form aren&#39;t the most helpful in educating them or eliciting their true feedback/problem.One final thing - I have seen &#39;magic&#39; where developers who chafed at tickets coming in from support staff (withdrawn, user error) would all of a sudden get excited about rebuilding something when the user themselves or even the support person, just explained in a higher-bandwidth way why the problem is real. It&#39;s easy to read a ticket and go &#34;oh that&#39;s dumb, they should just do X&#34; but on the phone/in person you go more into like &#34;oh, this is a really reasonable/nice/smart person who&#39;s trying to use my system to do something important, and it&#39;s not letting them.&#34;Gets a totally different type of results."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I ran my own business I had a product in the thousands of dollars price range. Phone support for this product would almost always be an interesting conversation where I learned a lot about customer needs.I also had a $25 PDF tool with a trial version. For that product a lot of the callers had no clue what the product actually did or tried to get a $5 discount or some other nonsense. I quickly stopped taking calls for that product because it was so unpleasant.My lesson was to offer phone support only for high price, low volume items. Phone support for cheap things attracts a lot of unpleasant people."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"That&#39;s excellent advice that many have learned the hard way...Honestly even as a non-manager it&#39;s a very bad idea. When I was a junior one of my colleagues was called to the manager&#39;s office. I assumed it would be for some mundane project scheduling or whatever, so I jokingly said &#34;you&#39;re getting fired&#34; as he was going there. And he was.This is one of these memories that come back to haunt you late at night when you&#39;re trying to sleep..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a more general advice - person in position of power should not joke about causing harm. Whether is is manager joking about firing employee, stronger person joking about beating up weaker one or parent joking about throwing child out of house when they misbehave. This kind of humor works only when it is coming from weaker position and even then only in certain situations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"No one told me this prior to becoming a manager, and I did make this mistake once and immediately regretted it.It seems like obvious advice, but the circumstances where this sort of thing could happen are described very well in the article.I revert to humour in awkward situations, like a lot of people, but I quickly realised that there are some things that you can’t joke about when in this position.Thankfully I don’t think the team member took any offence by it (although how would I know) - we had a good rapport and relationship, but I immediately realised my “joke” could be taken so many different (wrong) ways that I made a conscious decision to be much more careful after that.Like many things in life, it seems blindingly obvious in retrospect but not necessarily when you’re caught up in the moment."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Amazon is filled with cheap junk nowadays. I don&#39;t trust them for anything important. Case in point: I recently purchased an air purifier but was worried that I would get a fake product since they are notorious for co-mingling. I ended up buying one from Target online which also has free two day shipping now. For anyone who is looking for an alternative to Amazon, it seems like the big retailers (Walmart, Target, Best Buy) have finally caught up with their online offerings. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever buy anything important from Amazon again until they fix their trash problem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Amazon used to be awesome and Prime felt so worth it, you could just get stuff sent to you and skip a trip to the store.Now we call it Scamazon and you spend like 30 minutes weeding through crap, scammy duplicate looking listings and fake reviews for any signs that a single item is worth buying before you give up and go to Walmart.It&#39;s so sad that it&#39;s gotten to the point where I think Walmart has better quality and prices than Amazon.We see dollar store stuff on Amazon for like $27 all the time.It&#39;s like they let their brand erode to pure garbage."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the upsetting things about this crackdown is that some of the brands mentioned in the article actually produced good products. I&#39;d have much rathered people purchase products from Ravpower and Aukey than DiHines, AINOPE, Ailun, yootech, SMALLElectric, TT&amp;C, or Amoner, all of which appear on the first page of results for &#34;USB C charger&#34;.Besides the review misconduct, I do think a lot of people&#39;s issues with Amazon stem from purchasing no-name products from unknown sellers, an action that is made horrendously easy by Amazon&#39;s UI. I&#39;ve purchased tens of thousands of dollars worth of items from Amazon, and I have had a perfect experience by following two rules: (1) always buy from Amazon (not a marketplace seller), and (2) always buy a reputable brand.Others have mentioned the issue of co-mingling inventory, and while I believe it&#39;s an issue, I&#39;ve never come across a purchase from Amazon that looked anything less than legitimate."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a systems guy, I find this situation quite interesting in the way in which it exposed interlocks in the car rental pipeline that were previously not visible.What I hadn&#39;t appreciated was that Car Rental companies had constructed a model where they bought new cars, rented them for a couple of years, and then resold them. The car would depreciate of course but as a bulk car buyer they got the cars at a discount on dealer cost because, well they bought more than the average dealer did. So when they depreciated they didn&#39;t lose as much value as you and I might experience if we bought a car, held it for two years, and resold it to a dealer (worst case) or another buyer (best case).So the rental agency simply tracked how much the car would &#34;lose&#34; in value over its working lifetime, plus the cost of needed maintenance (generally relatively low), and offset that with income of renting it out. So the math was something like (making up numbers here) $5,000 of depreciation loss against say 400 rental days at $50/day or $20,000 of rental income. Say $1000 for maintenance during those 2 years and you&#39;ve got $14,000 of &#34;gross income&#34; into the company, per car to pay employees and operating costs etc.Now this makes sense and it is a fine business model, but an interesting quirk is that revenue is directly proportional to the number of &#39;working&#39; cars you have out there bringing in the bucks. More cars, more income. And if you buy the car on credit there is an interest expense sure but you don&#39;t use up working capital to bulk up your fleet and boost your income.As a result, car rental companies were carrying a HUGE amount of debt pre-pandemic which was all in car investments.Then BOOM, the black swan of a pandemic hit and air travel stopped for all intents and purposes and now rental car companies are sitting on fleets of cars where they have to make the monthly payment on the debt but those cars aren&#39;t earning any income. This burns money in a hurry! So they did the only thing they could do, and sold off their fleets for the most part so that they could retire all that debt. Some, like Hertz, were already in Chapter 11 bankruptcy when they did that. Late 2020 was an excellent time to buy a car from one of the rental companies because they were really motivated to get them off their balance sheets.And this then is the fun part. So the pandemic also put a huge blip in the supply chain. And since every single car company had switched to &#34;just in time&#34; manufacturing where they don&#39;t stock parts to make cars, they expect a smooth flow of those parts from the supply chain to feed their assembly lines, had to stop making cars. They had no parts. What is more, the humans in the pipeline like truck drivers, container crane operators, container ship crews, freight forwarding staff, Etc. were quarantining or not working because of the pandemic risk and those are jobs you cannot do &#34;remotely&#34; no matter how much you might want to. So the supply of new cars dried up, and won&#39;t untwist until the entire chain is back up and running at capacity again.So now the pandemic is &#34;less scary&#34; because smart people have vaccinated themselves and they start traveling again. And those people want to rent cars. Which is great for rental car companies, except they cannot rebuild their fleets because there aren&#39;t any cars to buy.And this adds the second fun twist, if you bought a car new in 2019 (as I did), and it is the kind of car rental companies might rent (which mine is), you get letters from the dealer in 2021 offering to buy it back from you for more than you paid for it!What is more, when you see all those cars that are going to be &#39;totalled&#39; by the insurance company because they were under water in the southern part of the US or on the east coast, those cars used to be sold for pennies on the dollar in &#34;salvage sales&#34; in which salvage dealers would recover parts and/or do enough repairs to resell them with a salvage title. The bidding for those cars is much more intense given the demand by rental car companies for stock, any stock, to boost their fleets.It is a remarkable example of a system where the parts are interconnected in non-obvious ways that has a non-intuitive response to shocks to the system. As with most &#34;emergent&#34; systems like this one though, sending a shock through it does two things; it illuminates these previously unseen inter dependencies, and it tends to kill off weak players."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"City-dweller here. I was on the public transport bandwagon. Then summer 2020 came and I realized the buses were at limited capacity, Uber and Lyft drivers were practically non-existent, and the big 3 car rentals were liquidating their inventory. So I bought a used car, just in time too.I still hate car ownership: the parking fees, maintenance, shocking price of gas, insurance, etc. It&#39;s costing me $20/day to sit mostly in a garage. I was saving up for a BEV. But realized air travel is out of commission and a BEV might not be practical for road trip vacations, at least not right now."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; With the app you can play a sound on AirTags and find it easily.I wonder how it does that. Unauthenticated BLE characteristic? This would imply anyone could force an arbitrary AirTag to make a sound. Obvious application: force all AirTags nearby to keep making sounds."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Pretty cool but why does it have to be limited to AirTag or any specific devices? It would be easy to expand it to keep track of any nearby Bluetooth device and a corresponding whitelist. (Or do AirTag devices rotate Bluetooth MACs?)Airtags are just one implementation of a Bluetooth transmitter and a long life battery but anyone could probably build a similar device dedicated to tracking with off the shelf parts."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Our goal is to protect privacy and to find out how many people are opposed to tracking.Asking how many ppl are opposed to tracking is a silly question that won’t get you anywhere — it’s answer in a vacuum doesn’t make sense as it needs to be contextualized. “Are you ok with google seeing your IP so they can sell you ads to give you free YouTube” is an example of context where people see trade offs. Most people won’t understand the full spectrum of what’s going on, and if it all in the end results in just ads, many are fine with that as long as they’re getting free stuff with it.The bigger questions on societal level trade offs shouldn’t be answered by lay people but rather regulation in the name of public interest."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"As another commenter notes, housing is unaffordable because marginal demand is greater than marginal supply. We can either decrease demand, or increase supply.Housing demand is pretty sticky, so that leaves us with one option."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Instead of buying what they sold two decades ago for practically nothing, they should have built more supply.Open Google Maps and check Kreuzberg, a district of Berlin. South of it is Tempelhofer Feld, 355 hectares (a third of Kreuzberg), a discontinued airport next to the city only used for people to bike and do barbecues. It&#39;s an old airport so it looks bland and there are smaller parks right next to it offering the space to do barbecues and play with your dog. It&#39;s been a decade that this airport is not being used yet it&#39;s still in that state.Paris&#39; housing crisis is mostly due to the road surrounding it (le Périph&#39;) but Berlin doest not have that yet housing is getting more expensive extremely fast, faster than in Paris actually."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Loving the inclusion of a image from an Ordinance Survey (OS) map. For those who haven’t heard of them, maybe the younger members on here or anyone from outside the U.K., OS maps were the U.K. standard before GPS and Google Maps et al. We were even taught how to read them as kids at school and youth centres (eg scouts). In the days before ubiquitous GPS, it was considered an important life skill to read maps, understand grid references and all the various different markings on an OS map. To this day I still find OS maps to be the best around for clarity and information density. Though I won’t deny I also have a little nostalgia for their stylings too.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordnance_Survey"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Atmospheric refraction is a thing. From where I live I have a 45 mile view to a city. And a telescope.The view varies a lot, and not just because of haze.When the seeing is clear and the light is good it&#39;s just about possible to make out tall buildings. Some days they&#39;re clearly visible above the horizon. Other days they seem partially obscured. Every once in a while they seem to float above the horizon rather than on it.Clearly there&#39;s some refraction happening. And if there was anything behind the city - there isn&#39;t, for about a hundred miles or so - I might be able to see that too.There have been a few times where I&#39;ve wondered if I can, but at that distance it&#39;s impossible to be sure."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here is an easy way to confirm if it&#39;s truly Ireland: this is a site that I absolutely LOVE: it has a 3D model of the earth&#39;s surface, can simulate the horizon visible from any point on the planet, and can automatically identify the farthest peaks visible: https://www.udeuschle.de/panoramas/makepanoramas.htmHere are the horizons it computed from the author&#39;s location, annotated by myself to align them with the pictures from the blog post: https://imgur.com/a/AlGiDi4 (open that on desktop—imgur serves low-resolution images to mobile browsers)...and unfortunately, what the author believes to be Ireland is actually Anglesey. What he believes to be Anglesey is actually Great Orme. What he believes to be Great Orme is actually Little Orme. Essentially all the peaks he identified are in reality shifted by 1 peak to the north. And the outline of the peaks in his pictures match the outlines of the simulated horizon so there is no doubt: he saw Anglesey (70 miles) and not Ireland (~150 miles).Here are the parameters I used to generate the first rendering (after filling them in, click &#34;Panorama anzeigen&#34;—direct link: https://www.udeuschle.de/panoramas/panqueryfull.aspx?mode=ne... ):Breite (°): 53.63638  Länge (°): -2.53707   (these are the GPS coordinates that correspond to the layby where the author parked and made his binocular observations)Blickrichtung (°): 248 (azimuth, or direction of observation)Blickfeld (°): 7 (field of view)Zoomfaktor: 10 (zoom)And for the second rendering, just change these params (direct link: https://www.udeuschle.de/panoramas/panqueryfull.aspx?mode=ne... ):Blickrichtung (°): 251.5Blickfeld (°): 3Zoomfaktor: 30When I was a teenager I realized one morning I could see what could be Mont Blanc from my town, but very rarely only on specific mornings when the sun would rise right behind it. But I could never confirm because I saw it of my own eyes, without binoculars, and the right meteorological conditions only reoccured twice in my lifetime to see it. About 20 years later, when I found the udeuschle.de panorama site, I checked and was absolutely delighted when the site confirmed the shape of the peak that I remember so well matched exactly the generated horizon :-) It was at a distance of 130 miles...EDIT: in order to see Ireland from the blog post author&#39;s location, you have to raise the camera at an altitude of about 1400m above ground (set the altitude in the Kamerahöhe field): https://www.udeuschle.de/panoramas/panqueryfull.aspx?mode=ne...  (screenshot: https://imgur.com/a/AT0BAnm ) The Irish peak visible is mount Kippure, next to the red mark &#34;Max Dist&#34; which is 159 miles away). It&#39;s a site made for desktop browsers. You can hover the mouse pointer over any peak label and it will show the distance to it. If you click it, Google Maps opens to the given peak, etc. A really neat way to explore the Earth. By the way in the above rendering at altitude 1400m you can still recognize Little Orme and Great Orme (at about one third from the image from left). The high-altitude perspective gives an idea of how much farther Ireland is behind these peaks.EDIT 2: at only about 900m above ground, the author could see Slieve Donard 143 miles away in Ireland (well, Northern Ireland, not the Republic of Ireland): https://www.udeuschle.de/panoramas/panqueryfull.aspx?mode=ne..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am a professional traffic engineer and I build micro-simulation models for most of the projects I am involved with. I can say that compared to software that is used in industry (PTV Vissim, PTV Vistro, and Trafficware Synchro) it looks like A/B is a reasonable toy model that can get pretty close to the real thing. I think it is great that software exists at a level for individuals without huge budgets to be able to build and play around with traffic networks. Automating the intersection setup goes a long way toward this type of tool being accessible to the lay person. All that being said, I think the limitations of any model are important to understand when interpreting the outputs. I can take any model and make traffic flow or decrease the delay per vehicle, that doesn&#39;t mean my results are realistic.Keep up the work, this is an awesome tool and I hope it can get to the point where it can easily help inform people about traffic design and simulation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I got hit with a ~40Gbps DDoS last week. These attacks are on the rise. Some responses to folks above: Success working with upstreams is quite varied.  Some care, some don&#39;t, and it can be difficult to get to folks that can help- even if their networks are impacted as well.  Some carriers immediately turn this into a sales opp. - buy more bandwidth, buy more services.In our case it was based on DNS reflection from a large number of hosts.  I&#39;ve contacted the top sources (ISPs hosting the largest number of attackers) and provided IPs and timestamps. I&#39;ve received zero responses.Geo-based approaches yielded no helpful reduction in source traffic.Also, during this event we discovered an upstream of ours had misconfigured our realtime blackhole capability.  As a result, I&#39;m going to add recurring testing for this capability and burn a couple IPs to make sure upstreams are listening to our rtbh announcements.Very concerned about the recent microtik CVE, as that is going to make for some very large botnets.Personally this all is very disappointing because it creates an incentive to centralize / de-distribute applications to a few extremely large infrastructure providers who can survive an attack of these magnitudes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Since this is HN, it’s 2021 and DDoS’es are still a thing:  why are they still a thing? Is there some fundamental “anonymity” to the Internet that makes it impossible to structurally prevent DDoS attacks? Apart from CloudFlare-like approaches, are there any R&amp;D in the pipeline that may kill this type of attack once and for all?To me it’s incredibly infuriating to see the damage that still happens with these extremely simple techniques. Will it ever end?Edit: to elaborate, I know that there are tons of insecure Internet devices and whatnot. I’m more interested in standards, and core protocol improvements that can fundamentally rid the world of these types of attacks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m very much not a network engineer, but I&#39;d like to understand the magnitude of this issue because my intuition is wrong:250 Gbps seems like it would definitely be a lot for a server or website but it also seem like a drop in the bucket for an ISP providing broadband for many customers.Clearly I&#39;m wrong because it is an issue here. I&#39;d like to understand why I&#39;m wrong, and I hope that here, on HN, that&#39;s taken in the spirit of curiosity intended and not negativism.So, what am I missing? Maybe Belgian broadband is lower capacity than what I&#39;m used to in a US metropolitan area? Maybe this particular ISP served a population too small to have a... um... &#34;fat pipe&#34;? I&#39;d like to understand."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This seems great for language/library knowledge. As an experienced polyglot, the languages are not where I&#39;m hitting the wall these days though. It&#39;s the tooling. I can learn new language basics faster than I can figure out the ecosystem/tooling.For example, my current conundrum is how to deploy an Elixir Phoenix/MQTT app. Writing the app was a fun curve to climb. And I could use techniques like described here to learn from others in the actual programming. But how to build an executable I can wrap in a systemd process running on a different machine? Those are actions people do, not expressed so much in code I can look at. The few blogs I can find on the subject are mired in deep CI toolchains.I want the blog that discusses the secret sauce to learn to acquire the knowledge to work the raft of ever evolving tools we have to work with now days. The &#34;materials&#34; (the languages) are the easy part now days.

The harder the problem, the better you&#39;ll get in the language and as a programmer in general.Second, look at existing open source, well written code that, again, solves a problem you&#39;re interested in. I always emphasize this: Things you&#39;re passionate about. That way you can master any language/framework. By master here, I mean you can code anything you want in the technology efficiently. Your final app will be: Easy to modify/enhance, easy to understand in terms of code. Memory and CPU efficient in terms of runtime."</p>

Few devs have experience developing a product and taking care of it 2 or 3 years later.The difference shows in the type of code they do, the &#34;ownership&#34; and engagement they have: Those with a consulting mind will do something and then have the notion that once its &#34;done&#34; they don&#39;t have to care about it. Those that have been  bitten by their own code from the past have a better notion on how to write maintainable code."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I completely disagree.Consulting is not for everyone and like everything you get out what you put in.Why I went into consulting
- I was working hard as ever, it’s my nature and I love what I do.
- My pay was average
- My projects looked amazing but in reality sucked and were driven by people in ivory towersMy concerns with consulting
- we had a newborn and worried about health insurance. In the US this is highly coupled with your jobThe outcome
- I am still busy as ever and love it.
- I am a seasoned 14 year dev with a lot to offer.
- health insurance because of Obama care is amazing. We pay about $150 more per month but it’s actually better health insurance.
- here is the kicker, last month I made 50k profit. Consulting is extremely lucrative and makes me feel like I was wasting my time as an employee before.Will I go back to working for someone? Oh yeah in a heartbeat. But I must be valued according and can enrich the company as I do now with consulting for my clients.What’s sucks about consulting
- billing / payroll for other devs that help me as 1099 when needed.Take away - consult for the right reasons. You will learn a lot but you can learn a lot as an employee as well. Let it happen naturally. Don’t force yourself to consult. You may be a completely happy employee and don’t let anyone tell you different and anyone worth being a human won’t discriminate against you for it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I spent more than half my career in digital consulting for mid-size (500-5000 people) that did full service product development (strategy, design, tech, marketing). Eventually working my way up to director level that meant doing sales and writing contracts.We did some crazy stuff. Delivered some gigantic ambitious projects with pure chutzpah. Dove into tech we didn&#39;t know anything about. Go sell a project to an airline, read everything about the airline business, then walk in like experts. It felt like fraud at times but we pulled it off so well you just start to feel invincible. It was a meat grinder but also thrilling. The kind of stuff I feel privileged to have been part of but never want to do again."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Seed creator here. For some context, I now code all my websites in HTML, CSS, and targeted JS (ie no frameworks or dependencies). Writing this was a great way to learn the ins and outs of DOM manipulation!Overall, I&#39;m happy with the way the Seed API turned out, but could never get the performance or package size to a good place.That said, I love coding in Rust, and use it all the time for embedded!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Kudos to the author for making this framework.I am using this for my personal project: https://www.biblemaze.com which is a Bible trivia game.Here are some things I like about Seed:1. The Elm architecture seems to flow nicely in Rust.2. The way of defining the elements on the page is more Rust like rather than html like. I initially tried Yew which is another similar framework, but since I am a more backend developer, I found writing in a more Rust style more comfortable than writing in a more html-like dsl. Other with different experiences may be more comfortable with more html-like syntax.3. Very easy to perform REST API calls. I am using Actix for the backend, and I have a shared library that declares the types which both the backend and frontend use. This is one big advantage for using Rust for both backend and frontend, in that you never have to worry about your types getting out of sync.4. In general as to why Rust for the front end, apart for being able to share types, for more complex algorithms, for me, having a compiled language with an emphasis on safety and that tries to ensure correctness as much as compile time (and especially pattern matching) makes writing complex code more enjoyable for me.5. Excellent documentation on the Seed website. There are lots of examples and walkthroughs of basics as well as examples of how to do stuff like integrate with Javascript libraries.Anyway, thanks again to the authors for making and supporting such an awesome library."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My most sincere thanks to the author(s) for “Why Not” section.   This level of self awareness and transparency makes me so happy; it takes so much guess work and unnecessary back and forth out of the discourse.  Again - kudos!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Disclaimer: I&#39;m a founder of Authzed (YC W21), a productized form of ZanzibarI&#39;d like to reiterate that Policy Engines and Zanzibar-like systems are orthogonal and can be used together very successfully. However, the article claims that ABAC cannot be done with ReBAC systems which is false[0] and it claims that Zanzibar systems do not support the concept of &#34;public&#34;, when the system at Google does[1]. The availability of Zanzibar-like systems outside of Google is still relatively new, so the user experience can be greatly improved. For example, the Authzed Schema Language[2] is a vast improvement over Zanzibar&#39;s raw userset rewrites.That being said, I think the Oso UX is quite nice in comparison to many products in the space, but architects should always spend the time to figure out what&#39;s best for their requirements. If you&#39;re just starting to explore AuthZ, this article is a pretty good primer for the problems in the space and why you&#39;re unlikely to design something great on the first go if you build it yourself. It&#39;s really hard to write about this subject in a digestible fashion, so props to the team!I especially liked the quote &#34;[...] authorization is a topic as cool as moving to Kubernetes!&#34;. Considering almost all of our team is ex-CoreOS and has deep ties to Kubernetes, we truly believe authorization is cool enough to stop working on Kubernetes ;)[0]: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-662-43936-4_...[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mstZT431AeQ[2]: https://play.authzed.com"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"We have been enjoying Casbin (ABAC):- technically: embedded in your DB, so not another infra problem  + can stay in-DB for hotpath queries (ex: view all). As db-native RLS etc keeps maturing, my bet is this is where a lot will end up anyways. This is orthogonal to their discussion of service vs monolith - it enables working at the data tier vs app tier.- governance: our app does not depend on an outside companyAt the same time, it was surprisingly slim pickings for such a core thing, so more diversity the better!Edit: For context, we have been thinking a lot about authorization recently and investing here, so a recent post on &#39;The Sharing Paradox&#39; on how we view it as an important way to grow successful team use, esp with modern features like friendly ABAC UIs: https://www.graphistry.com/blog/100x-sharing-paradox"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Maybe lithium-ion batteries in mass-market vehicles aren&#39;t such a good idea. We may need a battery technology that can survive poor maintenance less than perfect battery construction, and low-cost vehicle designs. Tesla had to put a titanium plate under their battery. That&#39;s not a mass-market solution.BYD is converting over to lithium iron phosphate, which is much better behaved when damaged. Toyota is working on solid state batteries, which hopefully don&#39;t catch fire.The NYFD reports over 55 electric bike and scooter fires so far this year.[1] Two deaths, 60 injuries, including 18 firefighters.  Fires destroying electric bike shops are a thing, with one fire expanding to all the batteries around. All we need now is for a cascade auto battery fire in a parking lot. Or, worst case, a garage under a building.Boosted skateboards used to use lithium iron phosphate, but were just too expensive.[1] https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/ny-e-bike-sco..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The automaker told Bolt owners to limit the charge to 90 percent, plug in more frequently and avoid depleting the battery to below about 70 miles of remaining range.Tesla&#39;s approach here would be to issue an OTA update that told your car to treat 90% as 100% and 25% as 0. I can&#39;t decide if I like that better or worse."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s insane. For (probably) a majority of owners it makes the car unusable if you adhere to that restriction.If I had one then I would have nowhere to park it. Certainly not at work. And at home with once car in the driveway and another in front of the house they couldn&#39;t be 50 feet apart. In tightly packed houses even one driveway to the next isn&#39;t 50 feet apart.If you went shopping and we&#39;re lucky enough to manage to find a space 50 feet away, there&#39;s no guarantee someone wouldn&#39;t park closer, though I can&#39;t even think of a place I go where finding such a spot in the first place is at all likely."</p>

It all began with a funnel, a beaker, and some melted tar pitch. Parnell, a professor at the University of Queensland in Australia, was hoping to demonstrate that brittle tar pitch actually behaves as a liquid when kept at room temperature. To prove this, he melted some tar pitch, let it cool for three years, and placed it within the funnel, held over the beaker. The first drop rolled down the funnel eight years later.

Regardless, I think competition in the space is a great thing.GitLab has come a long way and there are certain things I really like about the company. For example, I love how they tend to do everything &#34;in the open&#34; and have most of their development work and business documents public. It&#39;s a great resource for aspiring entrepreneurs. I have been a bit concerned about some of the architecture of GitLab lately, with quite a few security fixes resulting in unusual edge-case bugs. My only other complaint is that they tend have a very wide but shallow pool of products. They have ambitious goals with their platform, but I hope they are able to build real value and add features to the existing core products.Congrats to everyone on the GitLab team. Keep doing good work."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked at MailChimp for a few years. I most recently worked at a company that went through an IPO that I had equity in. When deciding to join my recent company, equity was the largest factor in my move.MC’s benefits are great and at the time were top-tier in Atlanta. They are cash/401k heavy and offer great profit sharing incentives. They also make it abundantly clear that they don’t offer equity and when I negotiated my non-MC offer that I ended up accepting, they were clear that they could not match my equity. They even acknowledged that if I was willing to take a risk with the equity it would likely be the advantageous move to make.Nonetheless, during my time at MC Ben/Dan repeatedly boasted about turning down offers to sell and repeated they were never intending to go that (or the publicly traded) route. This ultimately factored into my decision to leave, as it never appeared I would have a personal stake in the company. I hope other employees interpreted this in a similar manner and I do believe everyone had abundant opportunities to do so.In the end and in hindsight, I’m happy with my decision to leave and it did pay out. Nonetheless, I do still believe MC is a great company and despite the founders somewhat selling an incorrect vision, are still acting in good faith. I don’t believe they “withheld equity” as they made it explicitly clear it was never offered, or was ever going to be, but I do see how the boasting of never selling out could be interpreted poorly now in hindsight."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Honestly it could be worse, I worked at a company that gave equity and years later it came out that the founders never intended to sell or take VC money.  In that case employees “took below market salaries” thinking the stock is worth something but in reality it’s worthless.  At least in this Mailchimp situation if you’re not getting equity I assume you’re happy with your cash comp, I’d you’re not, that doesn’t make sense."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Maximise the video and watch the left hand HUD pane from 0:10 to 0:11.The dotted black line coming from the front of the car (which I am assuming is the intended route) quickly snaps from straight ahead, to a hair pin right, to a normal right turn.Ignoring the fact that the right turn happened to be into a pedestrian crossing with people on it - what was the car even trying to do? The sat-nav shows it should have just continued forwards.I am astounded that software capable of these outputs is allowed on the roads. When could crossing a junction then taking a hairpin right back across it, ever be the correct thing to do?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interestingly, the original creator of the video has since made it private. FSD beta testers are carefully handpicked — a lot of the Tesla “influencers” are given access for some free marketing. I wonder how many FSD bad driving videos are not uploaded to YouTube at all because they don’t want to say anything negative about Tesla and possibly lose influence/ad revenue.This is on top of Tesla classifying FSD as level 2 system (while promoting as “level 5 soon”) so they don’t have to share data with CA DMV. Only reason not to be transparent like the others is if you’re not confident in your system."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is near the infamous monorail where previous versions of FSD would kamikaze into the giant concrete pillars. Presumably in response to the monorail failure Tesla updated their obstacle avoidance to handle unclassified objects.https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1437322712339423237?s=21From the nav you can see the car is trying to go straight but swerves around some invisible obstacle. I wouldn’t be surprised if this was a failure in their new “voxel based” collision avoidance."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Let me share a small fun story (of making an application in an hour, not months).At one large insurance company in my role as an architect I have tried to convince people we need Elasticsearch to speed up free-form queries to our database containing information about hundreds of millions of people and their contracts. That database was Oracle and so not really amenable to completely arbitrary queries.I was immediately shot down that the project will take huge amount of time and effort to complete and so is completely off the table.So I came up with fun plan. I set up an hour-long meeting which was supposed to be my last chance to pitch the project.Rather than present slides and extol virtues of Elasticsearch, I decided to WRITE THE APPLICATION DURING THE MEETING, FROM SCRATCH.And that&#39;s what I did. I came to the meeting, set my laptop, connected projector, put some music on, and I wrote the entire service from scratch and had time to spare to present how it works.I cheated a little bit, of course. That 1h meeting was well rehearsed. I spent entire week preparing, finding better ways to do stuff and retrying entire process dozens of times.I used JHipster to generate 90% of the service and the rest was just tiny bit of well thought glue code.Unfortunately, this did not sit well with couple of people whom I made complete mockery of. I had to leave soon after."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s an excellent talk by Rich Hickey (I believe it&#39;s this one[1]) where he points out an obsession with how quick something is to understand immediately and be productive in—he gives the example of building websites in a single day, and contrasts it to musicians learning and mastering instruments over much longer periods of time.While it&#39;s very intuitive to see the appeal in low barrier to entry, there&#39;s something to be said about tools that optimize for the long-term. Instruments aren&#39;t made for beginners, they&#39;re made for people who know how to play them.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCZ3YgeEUPg"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a UI prototyping tool, and a potentially good one at that. It does not develop what a HN audience would call production ready applications. That being said, &#34;Production Ready&#34; as used by this author is very different than what &#34;production ready&#34; as used by the HN audience means, a look at the end of the linked video where he claims a checklist with drag and drop support and cookie-derived sessions next to is &#34;Production Ready&#34; should sufficiently demonstrate that.And that&#39;s okay! It doesn&#39;t need to have replaced the entire Web Developer career field, it can just be a cool UI prototyping tool. But I might suggest to the author to reduce the scope of their claims a touch, as it would engender more positive discussion."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t understand this social platforms.Covid stuff and fake news aside, I reported maybe 20 times obvious scam videos, or posts with extreme hatred and threats of violence against a group of people and similar stuff where 99.99999% of us would agree that it should be removed without question, and only once they did remove it. All the other times I get a message that they reviewed my complaint, that it does not go against their standards/tos/bla bla, and that I can block the video/post/channel for myself.And taking into account how many random stuff they ban proactively, it just does not compute in my logic board in the brain."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author conflates two things. The right to biohack at home and Youtube&#39;s alleged obligation to let him broadcast his material.The first one is okay, as long as we&#39;re not talking about experiments that may be dangerous to the public. (which he seems to categorically reject for some reason, while home made bioterrorism is a real threat), the second one just doesn&#39;t follow at all.Youtube has no realistic way to tell whether someone producing home-made science on youtube is a phd ex-nasa biohacker who follows best practices or just a complete quack who tries to sell dangerous fake remedies to vulnerable people. In practice the incentive to promote the latter probably far outweighs the former in number given the huge, generic audience on Youtube.77% of the Youtube audience in the US are 17-25 years old, it&#39;s not some niche forum for engineers and the notion that they can read scientific papers and weed out legitimate science created at home from misinformation is absurd. The correct platform for something like this is a separate forum or community where enthusiasts meet with some barrier to entry, not the mass media.I immediately question the motive of someone who promotes individual science or &#39;hacking&#39; and seeks the largest mass media audience. I think the motive is much more straight forward. The author has a company that sells genetic engineering kits to people and by banning him from Youtube that impacts him financially. I personally think Biohacking and eccentric science is cool, but the appropriate audience for the kind of things he did, like treat himself with CRISPR or replace his entire microbiome to treat IBS is probably a community more self-selected than HN, not Youtube, which is mainstream television for young adults."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Democratizing genetic engineering won’t suddenly unleash bioterrorism upon the world.&#34;How sure is he of that, and why? As a comparison, nuclear power has been of great utility for many countries, but I sure would not want to see it &#34;democratized&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"i live in the american south, where everybody owns guns. i own a gun for hunting. but for self defense, i have pepper spray and bear spray instead of guns because i don&#39;t want to kill somebody regardless of their intentions. i&#39;d be curious to see the stats of self-defense/firearms, because it seems like self-defense gun owners are LARPing over imagined intruder situations. they&#39;re definitely not about to take up arms against the state, and if they think they would do that, then they&#39;re certainly LARPing and live in a fantasy world.exceptions to this rule, especially in the american south, are civil rights leaders and similar political activists. Martin Luther King preached non-violent protest but owned guns for protecting his home against the very real threat of violent racists. (there&#39;s some interesting writing about this if you look it up. google something like &#34;martin luther king guns malcolm x&#34;)the bigger risk is accidentally killing somebody with a gun, like an &#34;intruder&#34; that is actually somebody you know. or a kid accidentally firing the gun and killing themselves or somebody else, or somebody intentionally killing themselves.edit: added &#34;but&#34; in front of dependent clause &#34;for self defense&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Excellent.  There&#39;s no reason defensive gun buyers should be demographically different from the general population.  It&#39;s understandable that gun sales for hunting or other activities might show differences, but we all have the same personal security needs.Side note: I&#39;m one of the people here with a large collection of firearms.  One thing to realize when you see the statistic that the US has more firearms than people is that only a percentage of them are really combat worthy/capable.  Most of my collection, for example, are collectable historic pieces, or dedicated target/sporting firearms.  Some of these could feasibly be pressed into service if you had absolutely nothing else, but they would be extremely sub-optimal for the task."</p>

Google gives a bunch of highly-relevant results.&lt;&lt;hans reichenbach relativity&gt;&gt;: first result is a list of books about relativity, one of which is Reichenbach&#39;s &#34;Philosophy of space and time&#34;; good, but there&#39;s no real information there. Second is about Reichenbach but nothing to do with relativity or even, really, philosophy of science. Third is about philosophy of science and mentions some of Reichenbach&#39;s work but not related to relativity. Fourth mentions Reichenbach&#39;s &#34;Philosophy of space and time&#34;  as part of a list of books relevant to a seminar on &#34;time and eternity&#34;. None of this is bad, but it&#39;s not great either. Google gives a couple of online philosophy encyclopaedia entries, then a journal article on &#34;Hans Reichenbach&#39;s relativity of geometry&#34;, then the Wikipedia article on Reichenbach ... much more informative.&lt;&lt;luna lovegood actress&gt;&gt;: I thought this would be an easy one. It was easy for Google, which gave me her name in large friendly letters at the top, then her IMDB entry, and a bunch of other relevant things. Literally nothing in the Marginalia results was relevant to the query.I guess maybe popular culture is just too monetizable, so no one is going to write about it on the sites that Marginalia crawls? Let&#39;s try some slightly less popular culture.&lt;&lt;wilde &#34;a handbag&#34;&gt;&gt;: First result is kinda-relevant but weird: it&#39;s about a musical adaptation of The Importance of Being Earnest. It doesn&#39;t mention that famous line from the play, but one of the numbers in the musical has the words &#34;a handbag&#34; in the title. Second result is a review of a CD of musicals, including the same work. Third is a bunch of short reviews of theatrical items from the Buxton Festival Fringe, one of which is a three-man adaptation of TIOBE. Next four are 100% irrelevant. Next is a list of names of plays. Last one is actually relevant; it&#39;s an article about &#34;Lady Bracknell through the decades&#34;. Google puts that one first (after, sigh, a bunch of YouTube videos which look as if they might actually be relevant).I really like the idea of this, and many of the things it turns up look like they might be interesting, but it isn&#39;t doing very well at producing results that are actually relevant to the thing being searched for."</p>

booklet tells you how to do that; but in your impatience you will probably already
have started pressing the keys on the keyboard, and discovered that this removes
the copyright message. This is good; _you cannot harm the computer in this way._
Be bold. Experiment. If you get stuck, remember that you can always reset the
computer to the original picture with the copyright message by taking out the &#39;9V
DC IN&#39; plug and putting it back again. This should be the last resort because you
lose all the information in the computer.&#34;You cannot harm the computer in this way.&#34;That single sentence started a life long journey. I doubt I would have been bold enough at that age to mess around with one of our most valuable possessions."</p>

I&#39;d ask, oh, it will rollover to next year? The reply: &#34;No, it won&#39;t. But that&#39;s really the wrong way to think about it.&#34;So it turns out people were taking much more time off now than when PTO was unlimited. They started denying request and making up trivial rules, like 2/3 of your team must be available at any time (regardless of the team size), oh, and those rules weren&#39;t in the official policy. Good luck trying to get specifics in writing.Eventually they changed back to an unlimited policy but secretly told managers they should start denying requests after x number of days have been used. I think it was five weeks, which again is still generous but it bothers me because the intent is to hide that number in hopes that people will use less. I also get no tracking for how many days I&#39;ve already taken unless I go through my requests and count the approved ones myself.The unlimited policy is definitely a scam at many companies. Most of my team has been denied requests for reasons that don&#39;t exist in the written policy, like, &#34;you recently had PTO already.&#34; Honestly I&#39;d rather have a policy that only allowed 3 or 4 weeks with a minimum mandatory that each employee is required to take at least two weeks off per year."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ll accept that what the author posted is the truth. Atlassian did not give him what he wanted or needed. And now this battle is public, he will never get anything else from them.  The proverbial glove has been thrown down and they will fight you on all fronts.To everyone else, If this happens to you, I implore you to get legal counsel ASAP, and keep it quiet.  Find out all your options and strike a quiet deal with your employer. That is the best you&#39;ll ever get.Almost any large company has much deeper pockets than you do and their reputation is more valuable that their ethics.  You&#39;ll rarely win in the court of public opinion and you&#39;ll probably never get hired anywhere again.  I say this even if you were 100% in the right."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Recent ex-Atlassian employee here. No part of this article matches with my experience. It&#39;s one of the better companies I&#39;ve worked for. I usually took 3-4 weeks of PTO a year, it wasn&#39;t a big deal. We didn&#39;t even have to register our time off in a payroll system or anything like that. Yeah you couldn&#39;t take 6 months off and expect to keep your job, but I felt like 3-5 weeks of PTO was the norm there. I also had female managers who took 3-4 months of maternity leave. It wasn&#39;t a big deal. This article complains about being at a job for 2 years without a promotion. That&#39;s the mark of an entitled person. P4 is still a great position with solid pay."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m longing for the return of the mailing lists.Sure, the format is slow and somewhat complex, but then it seems like all the places are devoid of non-immediate conversations.Companies are moving to the Slack, informal groups to the Discord. I&#39;ve been using IRC for years and I still love it but with recent adoption of Slack it seems everyone wants to push all the communication there and I don&#39;t think it works. It&#39;s hard to search for stuff (usually it takes me 3-4 queries to find thing _I know_ is there) and then it&#39;s in lengthy conversational format that takes a bit of time to replay. You might lose window of opportunity to provide important info just because you aren&#39;t present at the moment and since Slack is perceived as a low impact tool, those conversations can happen in late evening hours.And yet all the places that (in my opinion) were better to have more fruitful, thoughtful and searchable conversations are slowly winding down. Newsgroup are long dead, mailing lists are perceived as archaic, forums are closing down one by one. It might be me, but I start to get feeling that even on StackOverflow conversations aren&#39;t what they used to be. Only e-mail is left - in some places at least, because some organization start to have &#34;why send an e-mail while you could send Slack message&#34;. Thankfully those organization usually bless users with capability of installing Slack on their private phones /sToo bad Google Wave didn&#39;t pick up."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hate that everyone is using Discord not just because of searchability but also because it&#39;s difficult to have multiple identities with Discord. It&#39;s frustrating to be looking for help with using some library and seeing in the readme a link to join their Discord server. I don&#39;t want to join those with the same identity I use in gaming Discord servers so I usually just give up at that point."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Maybe it&#39;s just me (30-something year old male, big into gaming), but I love when I see forums on Discord. I think it&#39;s way better to use a system I am already signed up for. I don&#39;t want to sign up again for a million different forums like the old days. I also love the new threads feature by Discord to keep convos more concise and isolated. That has helped forums on Discord a ton. It&#39;s also nice that I can join a server, get my answer, then leave that server with no lingering email sign up for some one-off forum that I&#39;ll never visit again, and then I get bombed with emails after I&#39;m done. And when I leave, it&#39;s worth noting my comments/questions are still on the server for those to find via search if they join after I&#39;m gone [1].I know a lot of people in the comments seem to hate Discord for this, but I personally love it. I guess I&#39;m just saying this as a reminder that there are always others that do enjoy the other side. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯[1] It&#39;s worth noting that I guess this is a Discord server specific setting, so that could vary I suppose."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;If high prices held you back from building, you are in luck, as the tables have now turned&#34;Except... many builders will find some other reason/excuse where prices are high to keep prices high.  We were looking at building a house - talked to builder last November and... looking at $470-$480k range (ballpark estimate).  Lumber was going higher, but we&#39;d reduced the house plan size.  Lumber kept going up... and up... Then... no parts were available (IIRC certain trusses were unavailable for months, that&#39;s just one that stuck out).We regrouped a bit later.  House was now going to be min $620k, but... no guarantee it would be $650k or $700k.  Builder has been working on spec homes in the $700k-$900k range last few months, whereas exact same size houses 1 block away they were building and selling in the mid-$400s 14 months ago.Before we cancelled the project, we asked why we couldn&#39;t build something smaller and target a time in a few months, as lumber was coming way down to where it was 18 months ago.  &#34;Everything else has skyrocketed...&#34;  which... I know things have gone up some in the last 18 months, but I think there&#39;s simply some &#34;get high prices while you can&#34;.When talking to some home finance folks, they&#39;re all saying &#34;watch out for HELOCs in 18-24 months - people will be clamoring for HELOCs as they won&#39;t be able to sell these $700k houses they&#39;re buying, because they won&#39;t have appreciated at all, and the homeowners will be trapped&#34;.There may be &#39;blowout&#39; prices on lumber itself, but around here I&#39;m not seeing any &#39;blowout&#39; prices on new construction in the short term."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve been following these prices closely for most of the year and what’s striking to me is just how wrong nearly all the industry experts were throughout the year. I don’t recall reading a single opinion that was anything other than “prices will remain very high for the foreseeable future.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t think prices are &#34;cratering&#34; so much as just returning to normal rather than price gouging.Now if I could just buy a GPU for a normal price..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Founder Home Assistant here.Home Assistant is turning 8 years this week. To celebrate we have launched crowdfunding campaign for Home Assistant Amber, a device for both beginners and home automation enthusiasts and the easiest way to get started with Home Assistant.For more info see https://www.crowdsupply.com/nabu-casa/home-assistant-amber"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The UniFi Protect integration is awesome. Turn on outdoor lights on motion, disable loud doorbell ding when the dog is sleeping, change privacy zones, send critical notifications to bypass silent mode on iOS devices when a person is detected while away… really amazing stuff.The HomeKit Controller integration is also neat. All kinds of HomeKit compatible devices can just work with Home Assistant. Honeywell Lyric is the best example: PIR sensors with local push for lighting automation or special alerts when gates open to prevent the dog from escaping the backyard.Edit: More useful things!I have my washer and dryer in a garage. Can’t hear the machines inside. The Z-Wave light switches around my house have status LEDs, so one LED is dedicated to the washer and dryer status based on power draw from the outlet. Works really well. The same status LEDs are shared for all light switches around the house, so
it’s a good ambient notification.The Mac app can provide webcam or mic status as a sensor, which turns on a key light when I join video calls and turns on an LED on the light switch outside my office to signal when I’m on a call.I also get a push notification on my computer and a LED light on the light switches when the Roomba is full. It fills up a few times during its typical run while I’m working.I also have the door status (open/closed/locked) from the Lyric as LEDs on the light switches. Very easy to tell if something is unlocked or open at a glance while walking around the house."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice to see HA getting some love on HN. A colleague recommended it to me about 3 years ago as an alternative to Domoticz. I&#39;ve migrated back than and haven&#39;t looked back since. I consider myself a real Home Assistant enthousiast. I&#39;ve contributed some small amounts to the project, created and maintain my own add-ons and love to share my configuration with others.Although most of the things currently just work, especially with the (migrated) UI integrations. Some things still feel very unfinished, like blueprints. Which was a terrific idea, but maintaining and keeping those up to date is an absolute nightmare and you will have to that yourself [1]. Same with battery powered devices. When they work, it&#39;s all great, but having to watch their battery level is just a hassle. You can create your own automation to do that for you, but it seems unnecessary.For me the community also sometimes feels very hostile. For instance, you can have a Portainer add-on, but installing other Docker images makes your system &#39;unsupported&#39;. Same with some blacklisted images [2], which break Home Assistant Supervisor. Or when the maintainer of one of the add-ons completely ignores a breaking issue after a day [3].1. https://community.home-assistant.io/t/reload-automations-aut...2. https://github.com/home-assistant/supervisor/blob/main/super...3. https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-adguard-home/issues/1..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I remember that story about Zachary McCoy.
This whole thing continues to get worse quick and will continue to get worse. I know people say we need legislation and regulation on data privacy and tech companies which we do. But before that gets taken seriously (at least in the US) it&#39;s going to take something real scandalous done by tech companies and actually affect the common folk where they actually start to care.Right now the average user does not care at all about security and privacy except the small niche groups of us on HN, Reddit and other tech/Geek forums. The regular average user will continue to still use Facebook, Twitter, Google, Apple etc. As long as the average user keeps using their services and vote with their data and wallets I doubt much will change anytime soon.Until we get some real data privacy laws and regulation we just have to matters into our own hands. I don&#39;t use Google search unless I need to, and always have my VPN on (Mullvad).Edit: Then again, once we did get data privacy laws and regulation could we actually trust the companies and politicians and LE. Probably not. That&#39;s why I also feel the laws and regulation needed for tech is more of like a &#34;The public thinks we did something&#34; type of situation. There will still and always will be under the table deals.If the regular user can realize eventually how they feed these companies with their data and what happens with their data it could also hinder or start to hinder data collection at the government level (NSA, GCHQ, Project Raven and so on)."</p>

It is also half-baked because Microsoft&#39;s management has no particular strategy or plan for what they want Windows to be.So Windows 11 just feels like an &#34;and kitchen sink&#34; where someone picked up an iPad, noted down a bunch of random features without rhyme or reason and then told the people below them to shove them into Windows for some reason.Then you step back and realize that very &#34;101&#34; features on Windows are still incomplete like the migration to Settings, Windows Search being objectively worse than the Power Toys Run (let alone Google Desktop Search RIP or FileLocator Pro), and UI elements that haven&#39;t been updated since Windows 2K.As cliché as this sounds, Microsoft needs someone with a vision for Windows at the helm, someone they trust enough to go hands off and let them materialize that vision. Regardless of what that vision is, at least then Windows would be a something, rather than a whole host of competing ideas and contradictions i.e. a mess.PS - Ironically the &#34;Windows 11 PC Health Check&#34; app symbolizes Windows 11&#39;s problems: Released in a half-complete state, pulled, then re-released as a &#34;Preview&#34; also in a half-complete state. The app to check if you&#39;re ready for Windows 11 is a &#34;preview&#34; less than 30 days before the FULL retail release of Windows 11... It is almost too perfect."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have to agree, even though I have plenty of pro-Windows comments.To me Windows 11 feels like Vista, and to everyone that got burned with the rewrites on the WinRT side, just using plain Win32/MFC/Forms/WPF feels liberating.Multiple teams are fighting UI politics over WinUI, MAUI on top of WinUI, React Native with WinUI, and classical UWP is not going away (Windows 11 Store is written in it), then ASP.NET team is pushing Blazor everywhere including on Web Widgets.I will just wait for Windows 12, whenever it comes up, the UI war will be settled by then."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ive been using win 11 on my laptop for a couple months now.I like the new UI, it feels simpler and less gaudy. The drop down menu expansion thing is fine. I also prefer the redesign of the settings app. I find casting my screen and bluetooth works better. Windows has been missing something decent window snapping features forever and although it&#39;s a bit clunky I appreciate that it&#39;s there.The only thing that has annoys me is the taskbar not disappearing when its supposed to, leading to it covering the bottom of maximized applications. Most of the time its not there but sometimes it&#39;ll just stick after coming up.I didn&#39;t know about the android apps feature but I might give it a shot when I go home. Widgets I just haven&#39;t used at all despite being aware of them.I still have win10 on my desktop. I don&#39;t remember the switch being painful when I went to the rolling release windows insider on my laptop. Frankly win10 is fine too, so unless there&#39;s an android app I want to play around with I wouldn&#39;t bother switching."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very typical of Apple, using opaque approval procedures. They&#39;re acting like bullies because they didn&#39;t get what they wanted and because they have the money/power to do so. Apple wanted to buy FlickType but they didn&#39;t agree on the price or Eleftheriou didn&#39;t want to sell (I doubt it), and so from then onwards started the downhill ride. I fully support Eleftheriou on this just for the principle, but if I were in his place I would have agreed at a very large sum from Apple (even lower from what I had in mind) just so that we could all be happy right now ;-)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Meh. The problem is FlickType requires network access during use. The App store licensing is ok with keyboards, it&#39;s not ok with keyboards that get network access. This, Apple perceives as a major privacy issue-- one for the possibility of keylogging, but also for the broader possibility of the always-on logging that the weather apps are infamous for.edit:

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There is an incredibly well produced podcast episode on these ex-NSA engineers working for the UAE that came out a couple of years ago. Check out Darknet Diaries Ep47: Project Raven [1].Synopsis is that the UAE hires ex-NSA employees as &#34;penetration testers&#34; and when they enter the country for cybersecurity work, some are pulled aside to be briefed to an opportunity called &#34;Project Raven&#34; to assist Emirati intelligence with targeting, allegedly in the interest of counter-terrorism. The thing is, only Emiratis have &#34;hands on keyboard&#34; while the US engineers sit beside them and guide them, which supposedly dodges any legal concerns. Those who Jack interviewed decided to leave Project Raven when it became clear they were targeting dissidents, human rights activists, and later, Americans. As you might imagine, ex-NSA employees who target US citizens for a foreign government are breaking the law. I do wonder if it&#39;s these ex-Project Raven engineers that have led prosecutors down the road to where we are now.[1] https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/47/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Co-founder here. It feels incredible to be sharing Replay with all of you. It&#39;s been a labor of love the past five years!Replay started off as a simple experiment in what would happen if we added a step back button and rewind button to the Debugger. We quickly realized two things. First, nobody uses breakpoints. Second, being able to share is so much more powerful than being able to rewind.Here’s how Replay works today. Somebody on the team records a bug with the Replay Browser and shares the replay url with the team. From there, developers jump in and add print statements. The logs appear in the Console immediately so you don’t need to refresh and reproduce a thing.Over the past year we’ve talked to hundreds of users, recorded 2.5 million replays, and worked incredibly hard to ensure Replay would be fast, secure, and robust from the get go.Want to check it out? You can download Replay today. Can’t wait to hear what you think!Interested in learning more, here is our announcement blog post https://medium.com/replay-io/launching-replay-the-time-trave..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am a JavaScript framework author, and was one of those fortunate to get early access and honestly it is the most useful tool I&#39;ve ever used in the debugging space.Sometimes things are complicated. Often there is a need to do digging to uncover the issue. Being able to move forward and backwards and even jumping between seemingly disjoint parts of the timeline are all at your disposal with Replay.Replay has saved me hours of time. And that isn&#39;t hyperbolee. On a couple occasions due to laziness and familiarity I&#39;d do stuff the traditional way and be stuck still after hours (sometimes days) on the same bug. With Replay I was able to shorten that time to about an hour on even the trickiest of bugs.So stoked to now have Replay available to others to help record reproductions of their bugs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a programmer, I’d prefer a combination of the two:Dr Johnson kicked a large rock and said, as his foot rebounded, “I refute it thus.”.as I think it’s weird that a punctuation mark inside a quote can end the sentence that contains the quote.I’d argue like this: in the above case there are two sentences, the quote and the sentence that contains the quote. Both need to be terminated with a period."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hackers tend to use quotes as balanced delimiters like parentheses, much to the dismay of American editors. Thus, if “Jim is going” is a phrase, and so are “Bill runs” and “Spock groks”, then hackers generally prefer to write: “Jim is going”, “Bill runs”, and “Spock groks”. This is incorrect according to standard American usage (which would put the continuation commas and the final period inside the string quotes); however, it is counter-intuitive to hackers to mutilate literal strings with characters that don&#39;t belong in them. Given the sorts of examples that can come up in discussions of programming, American-style quoting can even be grossly misleading. When communicating command lines or small pieces of code, extra characters can be a real pain in the neck.— http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/writing-style.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I got in a heated debate about this with a technical writing instructor. Namely, I was ending a question with a quote along the lines of&gt; Why did Jake believe the AI was “going to kill us all”?The instructor wanted me to put the question mark of the outer sentence within the quotation marks despite the quoted text not containing a question mark.&gt; Why did Jake believe the AI was “going to kill us all?”I felt like doing so changed the meaning of the quote, and it felt like a misrepresentation. This being the “correct” way to do it has always irritated me.I ended up rewording the sentence so it wouldn’t end with the quotation, and have just actively avoided ending sentences in quotes ever since."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It looks like one of the authors is on HN with us.  Can you offer any insight into the cause of the confusing language in the &#34;Science News&#34; piece?  It reads like it was written by a bot not a human.In the sentence &#34;With the theory physicists Gregory Breit and John Wheeler were able to prove that when two high-energy photons collide, a positron and an electron arise, i.e. matter is formed&#34; shouldn&#39;t the word be &#34;predict&#34; not &#34;prove&#34;?A more flagrant example of a strange word choice for a human science writer to make is &#34;A direct conversion would require a laser that emits gamma-ray photons in a highly concentrated steel.&#34; Shouldn&#39;t the word &#34;steel&#34; instead be &#34;beam&#34;?  This seems like the sort of thing an uncomprehending bot might do, conflate those two words.Are my the nits I&#39;ve picked, above, unfounded? Does the author of the original paper have any information which might suggest that an actual human wrote the &#34;Science News&#34; piece?If not I would suggest that we&#39;ve got a bot on the loose!  Eeek!Further, I think I&#39;m seeing rather a lot of &#34;content&#34; floating around recently which smacks of machine origins.Also, to Daniel... Great paper.  Amazing stuff!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was surprised because I thought the Breit-Wheeler Effect has been demonstrated already. It just looks like what they mean here is single photon (or really, two photon), not the so-called strong field Breit-Wheeler that was demonstrated at SLAC and with powerful lasers for decades now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have had this mental question about &#39;what time is it when photons collide&#39;.  Given that a photon could have been travelling for a million years colliding with one that has only been travelling for a microsecond, and from the photon perspective there is no passage of time and no distance.I then kept reading things that tell me photons don&#39;t interact, which saddened me because I like the question.  This now appears to not be the case, is there a specific condition under which photons can interact like this?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"GitLab team member here. I&#39;d like to add some additional context to my previous comments [1][2].Due to a security concern in which a profile containing a file extension would not load [3], we do not allow usernames that end with file extensions (ex: .mov). As noted by many folks here, these are associated with a MIME type but are not MIME types themselves. It is not related to preventing an injection or any such attack vector.The error message for this check incorrectly included MIME type rather than file extension. This has been updated [4].Additionally, there was an issue with how the actual check as it did not include the leading dot. The leading dot was added to the check in a subsequent MR [5].Thanks for all the feedback.1 - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=285357392 - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=285381663 - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/262954 - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/70374/...5 - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/65954"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; One more quick tip: unlike box-shadow, the filter property is hardware-accelerated in Chrome, and possibly other browsers.In Firefox, everything is hardware-accelerated. And the `will-change` property is largely obsolete. (I personally wish they had stuck to the old translateZ(0) hack which was obviously a hack rather than defining will-change, since WebRender—what lets Firefox do all the rendering on the GPU—was already well underway and had demonstrated that something like will-change wasn’t necessary, though it was still a few more years before it was stabilised in Firefox.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, this is way beyond what I expected. Josh consistently illustrates and explains these concepts extremely well. I really enjoy it.I hadn’t considered the idea of colour matching to simulate raytracing. It looks great, but I’m not sure when I’d have a product to work on which would be complimented by this treatment. Maybe I work on boring stuff. Perhaps if it was done with enough subtlety I could get away with it.I also wonder if it could become troublesome if you had nested ColourWrapper components. I suppose the most recent wrapper would take precedence, or it could be designed as such. Maybe I’ll give it a shot."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Speaking not to this study in particular necessarily, I strongly agree with the general point. Science has really been held back by an over-focusing on &#34;significance&#34;. But I&#39;m not really interested in a pile of hundreds of thousands of studies that establish a tiny effect with suspiciously-just-barely-significant results. I&#39;m interested in studies that reveal robust results that are reliable enough to be built on to produce other results. Results of 3% variations with p=0.046 aren&#39;t. They&#39;re dead ends, because you can&#39;t put very many of those into the foundations of future papers before the probability of one of your foundations being incorrect is too large.To the extent that those are hard to come by... Yeah! They are! Science is hard. Nobody promised this would be easy. Science shouldn&#39;t be something where labs are cranking out easy 3%/p=0.046 papers all the time just to keep funding. It&#39;s just a waste of money and time of our smartest people. It should be harder than it is now.Too many proposals are obviously only going to be capable of turning up that result (insufficient statistical power is often obvious right in the proposal, if you take the time to work the math). I&#39;d rather see more wood behind fewer arrows, and see fewer proposals chasing much more statistical power, than the chaff of garbage we get now.If I were King of Science, or at least, editor of a prestigious journal, I&#39;d want to put word out that I&#39;m looking for papers with at least one of some sort of significant effect, or a p value of something like p = 0.0001. Yeah. That&#39;s a high bar. I know. That&#39;s the point.&#34;But jerf, isn&#39;t it still valuable to map out all the little things like that?&#34; No, it really isn&#39;t. We already have every reason in the world to believe the world is drenched in 1%/p=0.05 effects. &#34;Everything&#39;s correlated to everything&#34;, so that&#39;s not some sort of amazing find, it&#39;s the totally expected output of living in our reality. Really, this sort of stuff is still just below the noise floor. Plus, the idea that we can remove such small, noisy confounding factors is just silly. We need to look for the things that stand out from that noise floor, not spending billions of dollars doing the equivalent of listening to our spirit guides communicate to us over white noise from the radio."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the article:Ernest Rutherford is famously quoted proclaiming “If your experiment needs statistics, you ought to have done a better experiment.”“Of course, there is an existential problem arguing for large effect sizes. If most effect sizes are small or zero, then most interventions are useless. And this forces us scientists to confront our cosmic impotence, which remains a humbling and frustrating experience.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the weird thing is that a bunch of people in tech understand this well _with respect to tech_, but often fall into the same p-value trap when reading about science.If you&#39;re working with very large datasets generated from e.g. a huge number of interactions between users and your system, whether as a correlation after the fact, or as an A/B experiment, getting a statistically significant result is easy. Getting a meaningful improvement is rarer, and gets harder after a system has received a fair amount of work.But then people who work in these big-data contexts can read about a result outside their field (e.g. nutrition, psychology, whatever), where n=200 undergrads or something, and p=0.03 (yay!) and there&#39;s some pretty modest effect, and be taken in by whatever claim is being made."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The FTC has been asleep at the wheel with tech companies in the 21st century and consumers have suffered as a result. Apple&#39;s locking consumers into their platform, Google&#39;s steering traffic towards its sites, Amazon&#39;s forcing its merchants to give them preferential treatment. These companies have too much power and we need a government who&#39;s willing to take bold steps to curb them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Schiller comes across as needy and with a very low confidence in their own product. Some other company shows that their product works equally well on both Android and iPhone, and his response is that it&#39;s not fun to watch?Also, this should be shown to everyone that says they prefer the Apple ecosystem because &#34;it just works&#34;. You really can&#39;t get more user hostile than this, where you care more about extracting money from transactions that you&#39;re not a part of than making life easier for your paying customers.Apple let Amazon sell books using their own payment system because Amazon sold a lot of books on their own Kindle platform that Apple wanted users to be able to read on iPhones, but as soon as Apple&#39;s platform was the biggest one they altered the deal to squeeze more money out of it. Like a monopoly would do."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Want to do a mini PSA that you should (probably) read Steve Jobs&#39; biography if you haven&#39;t, it makes posts like this much, much more interesting when you have a fuller background.I wasn&#39;t a Steve Jobs fan so I never read it till recently. Still not a huge fan, but you can still see the tendrils of his influence that still affect today&#39;s world (adobe flash EOL last year, this stuff by not allowing you to buy books on the kindle/amazon app on iphone, continuing to control hardware and software experience). And you can see how it&#39;s gone (4 different ipads, etc)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"https://archive.is/egPlc“The research that we’ve seen is that using social apps to connect with other people can have positive mental-health benefits,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg said at a congressional hearing...“We make body image issues worse for one in three teen girls,” said one slide from 2019, summarizing research about teen girls who experience the issues.
“Teens blame Instagram for increases in the rate of anxiety and depression,” said another slide. “This reaction was unprompted and consistent across all groups.”From what researchers said in a March 2020 slide presentation posted to Facebook’s internal message board."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is it Facebook / Instagram&#39;s fault or us as a culture? As a culture we adore beauty, wealth, power...Facebook seems to be just a platform where our natural desires can have a play. Facebook hasn&#39;t created this impossible beauty ideal, it was created long long ago by Hollywood and the fashion industry. Facebook just makes it super easy for people to become obsessed with something by &#34;connecting&#34; with it. 
It used to be that 40 years ago you watched some supermodel in a commercial for 20 seconds and she was gone. The novelty with the internet is that now you can follow this supermodel and get dozens of alerts a week about her.
If it&#39;s not Facebook it&#39;s gonna be TikTok or something other platform."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t blame Facebook (or Twitter, or any particular company) for this.We can only blame scale. Some things are much more scalable than others, and &#34;beauty&#34; scales. And the &#34;occurrence of beauty&#34; does, too.Before the advent of scale on almost every aspect of our lives, a local musician or theatre group found easy income.Now, since after the invention of gramophones, more people can listen to less and less musicians, i.e. numerically.One movie is seen across the world and then millions of times on streaming services, while your local theatre group starves.Just like that, before, some people were considered more beautiful than others as it is done now. But one beautiful girl could only make, say, 20 girls jealous and anxious.Now, with the advent of Instagram, and internet-driven scale in general, one beautiful girl makes 20,000 girls jealous. So the anxiety and jealousy is numeracally widespread. This is where beauty scales.Also, before, one average looking girl felt threatened by the beauty of one beautiful girl in her area. Now, there is the &#34;feed&#34;, where she sees hundred girls more beautiful than her. This would not have been statistically possible in earlier times. This is where &#34;occurrence of beauty&#34; scales. Where, hundred years ago, a girl would see maybe 3-4 girls better looking than her, now she sees 300.____- I don&#39;t believe in a set standard of beauty. I don&#39;t believe that beauty is objective either. In this comment, I use &#34;beauty&#34;, &#34;beautiful&#34;, etc. as a short and logistically convenient way to represent &#34;perceived beauty&#34;, &#34;seemingly beautiful&#34;, etc. I hope this won&#39;t be an issue.- I am also aware of other sources of anxiety, one simply being money- money buys new clothes more frequently, and people in new clothes and/or makeup look more pretty. Cosmetic surgery is in similar line. Here what scales is display of wealth.- Filters, editing, etc. also might play a big part. People know this. Hence the popularity of the &#34;Instagram vs. Real Life&#34; meme format."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"So here&#39;s a potential business model for this: salvage rights.When ships sink, the owner generally still retains ownership of any property. Sometimes the location of the wreck is known. Sometimes it needs to be found. It can cost a lot of money to find a wreck and recover any property.So salvage rights are a principle of maritime law such that whoever does this is entitled to a reward commensurate with the value of the goods recovered (eg 10%).I imagine there are orbital slots that are essentially unusable because of space debris (eg Project West Ford [1]). If orbital slots are sufficiently scarce then these could have value. At some point it may become commercial to spend the effort cleaning up an orbit and making it available. Companies could then be compensated for the value they create this way.I do believe this will still require a dramatic decrease in launch costs, as in orders of magnitude more. But we&#39;ll see.My personal belief (and hope) is that the future of getting into orbit is orbital rings [2]. If so, that completely changes the game because cleaning up an orbit essentially becomes a problem of just holding up a giant &#34;paddle&#34; (for lack of a better word) that is fixed to a point on Earth (essentially) and just letting the debris hit it.[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_West_Ford[2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMbI6sk-62E"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m very skeptical of the technical challenges associated with this problem (business model and financing aside). The amount of delta-v required to perform maneuvers to repeatedly &#34;dock&#34; with different pieces of space junk, and then again to de-orbit is very high. You MIGHT be able to de-orbit on the order of magnitude of ~10 pieces of low-earth orbit debris per mission. Maybe. If you&#39;re really good. And low-earth orbit junk isn&#39;t the major issue since it will de-orbit naturally in a reasonable time-frame. Higher orbit junk is what really matters, and will require much more delta-v to reach, and then again to de-orbit after &#34;docking&#34;.Allow me to blindly speculate here: a space-junk company is going to take one of the two following paths:1) Perform low-earth orbit missions to de-orbit a few pieces here and then there, use the good PR to drive funding (let&#39;s just assume they can make the finances work via getting governments to pay for it or something). It will technically work, but it will only deorbit pieces that would naturally decay anyways at a meaninglessly low-volume. But the PR will be good and regulatory capture will ensure their investors get paid. The real problem will remain.2) Go after the really big pieces in higher orbits. These pieces tend to be well-tracked and aren&#39;t really a large problem, but all the same outcomes in option 1 will occur. Investors will get paid, and of course, the real problem won&#39;t be solved.Maybe I&#39;m being pessimistic, but I see space-junk removal companies largely relying on the general public&#39;s lack of knowledge on how orbits work to drive PR. Maybe Kerbal Space Program 2 will go viral enough to fix that problem? We can only hope"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"(Stripe cofounder.)Ugh, apologies. Something very clearly went wrong here and we’re already investigating.Zooming out, a few broader comments:* Unlike most services, Stripe can easily lose very large amounts of money on individual accounts, and thousands of people try to do so every day. We are de facto running a big bug bounty/incentive program for evading our fraudulent user detection systems.* Errors like these happen, which we hate, and we take every single false rejection that we discover seriously, knowing that there’s another founder at the other end of the line. We try to make it easy to get in touch with the humans at Stripe, me included, to maximize the number that we discover and the speed with which we get to remedy them.* When these mistaken rejections happen, it’s usually because the business (inadvertently) clusters strongly with behavior that fraudulent users tend to engage in. Seeking to cloak spending and using virtual cards to mask activity is a common fraudulent pattern. Of course, there are very legitimate reasons to want to do this too (as this case demonstrates).* We actually have an ongoing project to reduce the occurrence of these mistaken rejections by 90% by the end of this year. I think we’ll succeed at it. (They’re already down 50% since earlier this year.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Edwin from Stripe here. (OP, I&#39;ve just sent you an email and we can talk more over there—I&#39;m terribly sorry for the trouble.) I can&#39;t get into too many specifics about an individual business publicly, but unauthorized charges have high potential to be disputed in the near future—and while Stripe itself doesn&#39;t have a dispute threshold, the card networks require businesses to keep disputes low.Although that email in the post was admittedly a template, a human did review the transaction activity and actively sent the email. We&#39;re digging more into exactly what happened here to prevent the confusion from happening again. Over the past few weeks, we&#39;ve been overhauling how we work with businesses in situations like these and are rolling out some meaningful improvements soon."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I went through the same thing.
Some ML algorithm at Stripe randomly classified my business (bog standard WooCommerce/WordPress e-Commerce store selling a single product in low volumes) as a risk and I found that the process for escalating it was Kafkaesque and slow.Switched to Pin Payments[1] shortly after that experience and have never looked back.  Of course, we live in the 2021 century and algorithms will flag issues automatically (I ported my phone number and changed my bank account on the same day, which was fun!), but they&#39;ve always made sure to contact me and resolve the issue within minutes instead of cutting access.  The few times I&#39;ve contacted them, a competent person has both understood the issue and responded to it appropriately and promptly.[1]https://pinpayments.com/"</p>

His dedication to comedy was legendary, and his complexity was intriguing.Norm’s fake late gift to Conan for The Tonight Show, given after Conan was leaving, is a great example of his sort of expectation-bending humor.https://youtu.be/uarJj-K4XH4His appearances on The View are legendary examples of his ability to be uncontrolled and play the dumbest guy in the room at the same time while actually being the sharpest. His intentional subversion played off as uninformed is a seemingly one of a kind talent. There are videos of interviews where he describes some of the background to things he did on the show.https://youtu.be/a4ageUPHgnohttps://youtu.be/Z3PP_SWHUQQ“Not everything has a point” just gets me. It’s amazing how the hosts just want to jump from talking point to talking point and just refuse to let the guest actually talk, which Norm really plays off of.And lastly, the moth joke remains a shining example of his anti-jokes.https://youtu.be/jJN9mBRX3uoHis monologues at roasts, awards shows, and the correspondents dinner were examples of not being afraid of anything."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I literally gasped when I heard this. There is something uniquely sad when one&#39;s favorite comedian passes away.There were many things that made him special, but one thing stands out right now:I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen a comedian pursue Truth so rigorously. So much of his comedy was him shining a light on a given topic and giving 100% unflinching attention toward it, even if everyone else wanted to ignore it or &#34;move on&#34;. This often made the &#34;joke&#34; the audience, in that we found ourselves laughing when we thought we shouldn&#39;t be. But why shouldn&#39;t we be laughing? Why shouldn&#39;t we be discussing this? Wait, why is this uncomfortable in the first place? Have I thought about this enough?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Awhile ago I wrote a Python library called LiveStats[1] that computed any percentile for any amount of data using a fixed amount of memory per percentile. It uses an algorithm I found in an old paper[2] called P^2. It uses a polynomial  to find good approximations.The reason I made this was an old Amazon interview question. The question was basically, &#34;Find the median of a huge data set without sorting it,&#34; and the &#34;correct&#34; answer was to have a fixed size sorted buffer and randomly evict items from it and then use the median of the buffer. However, a candidate I was interviewing had a really brilliant insight: if we estimate the median and move it a small amount for each new data point, it would be pretty close. I ended up doing some research on this and found P^2, which is a more sophisticated version of that insight.[1]: https://github.com/cxxr/LiveStats[2]: https://www.cs.wustl.edu/~jain/papers/ftp/psqr.pdf"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One way to think about why we tend to use averages instead of medians is that it is related to a really deep theorem in probability: The Central Limit Theorem.But I think we can twist our heads and see in a way that this is backwards. Mathematically, the mean is much easier to work with because it is linear and we can do algebra with it. That&#39;s how we got the Central Limit Theorem. Percentiles and the median, except for symmetric distributions, are not as easy to work with. They involve solving for the inverse of the cumulative function.But in many ways, the median and percentiles are a more relevant and intuitive number to think about. Especially in contexts where linearity is inappropriate!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For some things, you can&#39;t even sensibly measure the mean. For example, if you&#39;re measuring the mean response time for a service, a single failure/timeout makes the mean response time infinite (because 100 years from now the response still hasn&#39;t been received).&#34;Why Averages Suck and Percentiles are Great&#34;:

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love to see the cultural differences between korea/japan and the West on the matter of artificial stuff. Whereas in the West people would try to hide fakeness as much as possible, people in the far East have a much more candid view of it.In the West we do understand and like artificiality, but we really want to contain it to the realm of fiction. When some artificiality spills out in the “real” world we raise red flags: “tssk, this temple is not authentic, it burned down 80 years ago and they rebuilt it from scratch”In the East, there is a deep philosophical difference that I would like to understand better - if anyone can point to any reference on that matter? It’s like people have understood that fiction and artificiality are part of our lives, cause people embellish things all the time, and we humans are happy when we believe in things. So instead of being suspicious, they let themselves invaded by artificiality, not unlike the way Western people create emotional connection with novel characters, but in real world situations.And I mean why not? In the West, we get cartoon character-based advertising, we get actor-based advertising. How is AI-based influencer (that doesn’t hide the fact that it’s artificial) is any different? If Tony the Kellogg’s tiger had an instagram account, we’d find it totally normal. Here is the same, except that we just jumped over the uncanny valley.There is a lot to talk about on the subject and doesn’t fit in a hn comment :-)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Anyone with more knowledge know how much of this is BS?She has 60k followers on Instagram which (even if all real) isn&#39;t that much. Certainly not anywhere big enough to make 800k a year that the creator claims he plans on making.They say they have 100 sponsorships but this seems like a marketing statement...influencers all the time talk about how popular they are and I don&#39;t see why we should trust the creator of AI influencer more.I don&#39;t see any major brands on her Instagram though I&#39;m not South Korean so maybe I&#39;m missing something - but more likely explanation seems to be that he has partnered with a few companies for a pittance and is overhyping his creation to get more money in."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Because it&#39;s a terrible policy prescription.  If natural immunity is acceptable, what proportion of the unvaccinated-uninfected population will just take the risk? Half?  More?Millions of people will just (continue to) take the risk, get sick, go to hospital, and die (in decreasing proportions), incurring substantial personal and social costs along the way.Accepting only vaccination as evidence of protection reduces the size of that risk-taking population, and the concomitant social costs.Should there be a third policy option - accepting test-verified infection and recovery as of _now_ as evidence of protection, but discounting future recoveries?  Based on the observational studies cited all over this thread , probably yes.  Seems like associated costs would be higher though, and the only benefit would be less gnashing of teeth here and elsewhere, so its understandable the CDC isn&#39;t rushing to implement it.Should those people just be allowed to assume the risk?  Not while the costs are predominantly social. Insurance (or tax-payers) pay the financial costs, healthcare workers bear the burden of treating a preventable illness, and we all assume the risk that healthcare resources will be stretched to the point of unavailability.  While risk-takers do pay into the same system, their premiums don&#39;t yet reflect the increased expected costs of their personal choice.  While ICUs often run close to or at capacity in one hospital, rarely do they run close at every hospital in a region, as is happening in the south and will happen elsewhere.  While it would be nice if there were more doctors, nurses and facilities able to treat patients, we&#39;re at war with the army we&#39;ve got."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The answer is pretty simple - the moment authorities start saying &#34;well, natural immunity is probably just as good as vaccination, we&#39;ll accept that as equal to vaccination for passport purposes&#34;, a huge segment of the population who&#39;s on the fence about getting the vaccine might just opt to wait until they&#39;re infected naturally, or, even worse, get infected purposefully (EG, chicken pox parties). Which leads to more deaths and outbreaks.In a perfect world, everyone would understand that getting the vaccine is the appropriate choice of action and we could accept natural immunity from people who were infected before vaccines were available - but unfortunately we&#39;re forced into playing these weird games where authorities have to try to incentivize people who aren&#39;t behaving rationally - which in turn leads to further distrust from people on the fence."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s amazing how far Intel has fallen.The 10nm debacle exposed how far they&#39;ve fallen behind on fabs to the point that they&#39;re outsourcing to TSMC. Like, how humiliating must that be?Intel completely missed the mobile revolution. They had a stake in that race but sold it (ie XScale).Intel&#39;s product segmentation is bewildering. They&#39;ve also kept features &#34;enterprise&#34; only to prop up high server chip prices to the detriment to computing as a whole, most notably ECC support.And on the server front, which I&#39;m sure is what&#39;s keeping them in business now, they face an existential threat in the form of ARM.Intel had clearly shifted to a strategy of extracting as much money as possible from their captive market. I&#39;m not sure price cuts here are necessarily about AMD but more than their previously captive market now has more options in general.How the mighty have fallen."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Have been with Intel for almost two decades, I finally moved to AMD for the very first time recently and I&#39;m glad I did. Intel is being called &#34;Toothpaste Company&#34; for a reason. It has deliberately slowed down its innovation since gained performance advantage over AMD with CORE, for over a decade now. Between each iteration, there was not many changes but kept adding fancy instruction sets such as AVX512 useless to most if not all ordinary users. It&#39;s a shame that I bought it actually. But over time I gradually realized that the only occasions I used those fancy stuffs were benching marking new systems. So those fancy things mean nothing to me other than showing off to friends."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Intel is NOT competing against AMD only. In the past couple of years, we’ve seen a number of big tech companies developing their own chips. Focusing on AMD would be quite myopic from a strategic pov. This market is only getting more competitive. Either you compete on performance or price."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It makes me sad that FF browser share has continued to decline steadily.  The past couple years of releases have been some its the best in terms of my own UX, since perhaps the Phoenix era.It&#39;s pretty fast these days, the UI is good, has a lot of great extensions and privacy features.I use Brave at work to have a better chrome-based experience with gsuite.  It&#39;s also a fast, excellent browser with good privacy features, built-in ad/tracker blocking and for the time being seems to be user-not-revenue-first.But using a non-free browser feels like a trap to me.  Just as what happened with Internet Explorer, Chrome, and Netscape before, being the middle man between the user and the rest of the internet is just too tempting for any company not to try to leverage for their own advantage.FF hasn&#39;t been always perfect, but for 20 years now they have made a browser that didn&#39;t have a shady corporate agenda.  It feels like the writing is on the wall though.  Even people I know who care about FLOSS are using Chrome as their daily driver these days.Mozilla is great and I hope they continue to focus on building a best-in-class browser."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d like to mention (once again), that Firefox on Android is a huge leap in everyday browsing experience over Chrome - and you should try it if you haven&#39;t. Due to mainly one reason: ad blocker extensions; which aren&#39;t supported on Chrome.Since that&#39;s where most users are, I hope Mozilla will be able to communicate these advantages better. Chrome is arguably better on the desktop for most users, unless they&#39;re in the tiny subset of users who care about privacy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The fact alone that FF is the best-optimized browser for uBlock Origin makes it an easy choice for me.It&#39;s interesting to me that many of my favorite/most used web technologies in the past decade or so have come from individual, non-profit developers just trying to make something useful, free and flying in the face of a lot of legal and industry norms (e.g., gorhill, elbakyan). In my experience, these tend to work best on FF + VPN, or on Tor (built from FF)."</p>

It is very hard to publicly criticize some of the behavior of a group you are a member of without burning bridges or deeply harming relationships. At the same time, saying nothing publicly is read as tacit approval.I interpret the article as a giving Amazon credit for why people like Rust, and Steve&#39;s response as a public disagreement saying that such credit is unwarranted and gives Amazon more power than it should have over Rust&#39;s future direction."</p>

https://twitter.com/steveklabnik/status/1437441118745071617To summarize:* Amazon has too much administrative influence* Amazon has marginalized the core team* also un-stated dirty tricks by AmazonI think rust is great, and I love with the rust community has accomplished, and I wouldn&#39;t want to see Amazon break that. But from this thread I don&#39;t know enough to raise objections. It sounds like a Rust foundation governance issue, the sort of thing that comes up from time-to-time on most big successful projects.[edited to fix formatting]"</p>

At all. &#34;The practice of coming up with pithy statements to guide decision-making&#34; is the Amazon part.&gt; they&#39;ve also taken steps to marginalize the core team. and some other dirty shit I won&#39;t say rn.This sounds like the real concern, and it sounds really concerning, and I hope people come out to speak publicly and candidly about it.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Huh, never thought I’d see XCheck in a news article. I used to work at Facebook and spotted abuse of this system by bad actors and partly fixed it. It’s still not perfect but it’s better than it used to be.I think I might have agreed with the author of this article before working in Integrity for a few years. But with time I learned that any system that’s meant to work for millions of users will have some edge cases that need to be papered over. Especially when it’s not a system owned and operated by a handful of people. Here’s an example - as far as I know it’s not possible for Mark Zuckerberg to log in to Facebook on a new device. The system that prevents malicious log in attempts sees so many attempts on his account that it disallows any attempt now. There’s no plans to fix it for him specifically because it works reasonably well for hundreds of millions of other users whose accounts are safeguarded from being compromised. His inconvenience is an edge case.With XCheck specifically what would happen is that some team working closely on a specific problem in integrity might find a sub population of users being wrongly persecuted by systems built by other teams located in other time zones. They would use XCheck as a means to prevent these users from being penalised by the other systems. It worked reasonably well, but there’s always room for improvement.I can confirm some of what the article says though. The process for adding shields wasn’t policed internally very well in the past. Like I mentioned, this was being exploited by abusive accounts - if an account was able to verify its identity it would get a “Shielded-ID-Verified” tag applied to it. ID verification was considered to be a strong signal of authenticity. So teams that weren’t related to applying the tag would see the tag and assume the account was authentic. And as I investigated this more I realised no one really “owned” the tag or policed who could apply it and under what circumstances. I closed this particular loop hole.In later years the XCheck system started being actively maintained by a dedicated team that cared. They looked into problems like these and made it better."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Strong opsec that the supporting documents are actual photos of a computer screen from the visible moire (or somehow altered to look that way).After numerous leaks, Facebook&#39;s internal security team became very good at identifying leakers. The person responsible for this 2016 post was identified within hours and terminated the next day: https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/blakemontgomery/mark-zu.... The leaker was easily identified by the names of friends liking the post (that and part of their name was visible).Facebook-issued laptops are filled with spyware, monitoring everything down to the system call level, and practically every access to internal systems is logged at a fine level. The only way to exfiltrate data with plausible deniability would be to photograph the screen with an individually owned device. The fact that you searched for the internal wiki page and viewed it are nothing, but that you shortly invoked the keyboard shortcut for a screen capture, then inserted a USB drive, and copied a file (&#34;Screen shot ____.png&#34; even!) to it (all logged) ... congratulations, you&#39;re caught."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The new Windows 11 defaults manager is amazingly user hostile. [1] Microsoft decided it&#39;s a great idea to make non technical users manually adjust 15 different file and protocol associations in order to change the default browser.Microsoft&#39;s statement on this: we are implementing customer feedback to customize and control defaults at a more granular level, eliminating app categories and elevating all apps to the forefront of the defaults experience.More granular control is nice and all, but I don&#39;t buy for a second that it couldn&#39;t be behind some &#34;advanced&#34; button. I think the most probable explanation for removing the app categories is a calculated move to steer people towards Microsoft products which have access to backdoor internal functions to change all of these automatically.I do remember how bad things were back in Windows XP days when every random toolbar would change all the associations. I don&#39;t wish for that experience to come back for non technical users either. Microsoft could perhaps look into allowing digitally signed apps to change the associations automatically (a single summarizing OS confirmation prompt might be wise), and non-signed apps would have to instruct users to manually change things.--[1] https://www.theverge.com/22630319/microsoft-windows-11-defau..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The amount of dark design patterns around getting edge as the default browser is sickening.  Opera was flagged as PUA by many AVs for simply changing the default browser after asking users post-install if they wanted to use that browser as their default - just as edge does (and before Firefox copied that same mechanism here).  Now every post-windows update screen (which takes place before you even log in...) comes with a full-page nag screen asking you to &#34;Use Microsoft recommended browser settings&#34; [1]...  This is on the heels of a screen that says &#34;Let&#39;s make Windows even better - this shouldn&#39;t affect what you&#39;ve already set up&#34; [2].  Even more disappointing is not that they&#39;re doing this but that nobody is taking these platforms to court over it in a meaningful way.[1] https://www.windowslatest.com/2020/11/15/windows-10-is-now-n...[2] https://www.windowslatest.com/2020/06/07/windows-10-full-scr..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As I was reading this article I kept thinking to myself &#34;Microsoft is going to boot Firefox from Windows&#34; before realizing that MS doesn&#39;t have that sort of power (compared to say Apple).It&#39;s really interesting how MS will approach this. Unlike Apple, MS doesn&#39;t have direct control over which apps go on the operating system, they aren&#39;t even in a position like Google where their app store is the dominant platform for getting apps.This will be interesting, interesting to see how MS responds. Will they give in and let users easily set their default browser or will this turn into a cat and mouse game.Lastly I think what MS is doing with the default browser is foolish. Did they learn nothing from the antitrust cases of the 2000&#39;s"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a Greek myself I never really thought much about this word. Yes, it is not common but I thought I understood this. After reading the linked article I am not so sure anymore and I am not really sure how I would translate it.I cannot translate it to English in a single word but the way I understand it would be &#34;what is needed, no more, no less&#34; (which is also mentioned in the article).I found two greek sources that seem to agree with me [1], [2]. Especially in the first it gives also as synonym the word &#34;daily&#34;. However it also mentions that in the biblical context although it is widespread understood as &#34;necessary&#34; the correct interpretation (of the whole phrase) is rather &#34;give us today the bread of tomorrow&#34;.So, as a conclusion, I guess even as a Greek I am as much confused as all these scholars that try to translate it![1] https://el.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%B5%CF%80%CE%B9%CE%BF%CF%8...

								<p class="story__comment_others">"In Persian we have an old word which is even used today called “Roozi”. It is a combination of “Rooz” + “i”. The main part translates to “day” and this word refers to what you need to live for a day. It’s also used in prayers which asks God to provide us with what we need to live for the day.This word instantly reminded me of that but I don’t know if they are conceptually related or not."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This kinda feels like one of those acquisitions where all the special sauce that makes the acquired company a great company is the exact opposite in the acquiring company.That is, from all I&#39;ve heard, Mailchimp is a great company to work at, and the founders definitely had the &#34;scrappyness&#34; that let them become so successful without VC funding, and their customers really like them too.Intuit, on the other hand, is basically the poster child for &#34;regulatory capture&#34; company. Also, since employees don&#39;t have equity (though I&#39;m assuming they&#39;ll get fat bonuses for this), it&#39;s bound to cause some level of strife in the company."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here are some numbers I dug up:Mailchimp has ~13MM users and 800k paying customers. In 2019 they had revenues of $700MM. In 2020 they had EBITDA of ~$300MM.They are fully bootstrapped and have taken on zero outside funding."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"@&amp;$#But can&#39;t fault them. Congrats to the entire mailchimp team! You all deserve all the rewards, especially for bootstrapping.Hope everyone there made out like bandits, and may this give them the financial freedom to pursue new passions in their lives.For those curious about the founding story, How I Built This did a podcast with Ben Chestnut (released July 12, 2021): https://www.npr.org/2021/07/09/1014699766/mailchimp-ben-ches...Small tidbit: mailchimp was a major pivot into SaaS (before that was a phrase) from another already successful services business (building websites). The team realized scaling a software product was a better idea than selling their time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One thing i remember best about the original C&amp;C is a gorgeous installer [1]! Being one of the first games that came on CD, I thought it is the standard of the things to come.Unfortunately, the future disappointed: every other game came with a boring windows installer.[1]: https://youtu.be/cioyLQ2O6yc"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Something to note about the 90s-era is that the &#34;death ball&#34; of cheap units was *aggressively* mitigated in almost all strategy games.* Civilization 1, 2, and 3 had &#34;stacks&#34;, but if you kill one unit in the stack, you kill ALL units in the stack. As such, &#34;death balls&#34; were incredibly fragile, one well placed attack kills the whole stack.* Command and Conquer has infantry, which get rolled over and instant-killed by tanks. The overall &#34;death ball&#34; of tanks can eventually reach endgame proportions of death, but the cheapest units are fully ineffective at death-balling.* Starcraft had a 12-unit selection cap. It required a lot of clicks (on purpose) to create a death ball, so only the highest levels of players (with high APM) could attack-move with a whole army effectively."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"OpenRA is currently my favourite free/libre computer game. They&#39;ve done a fabulous job at keeping the feeling of the original game while updating things like cross-platform support, screen resolution and network play and added build queues (and waypoints, I believe) that was present in later C&amp;C games. They&#39;ve also tweaked the game play, making thieves able to hijack vehicles and cloak (They are probably the most fun unit to micro around) and radar jammers able to deflect / confuse missiles, and added per-country special units like in RA2 (The French invisible phase transport is wild), and changed the tech tree so medium / heavy tanks require service depot.I remember in the original Red Alert, if you ordered an airplane to fly into the shroud, it&#39;d just disappear into the darkness, but in OpenRA you can actually use them for scouting (which totally makes sense). OpenRA also has fog-of-war which suddenly makes planes and helicopters key units for ground support.I don&#39;t like war. The arms trade should be abolished. We should help refugees get safe passage and eliminate borders rather than build walls or drop bombs on them. Anyone working with defense in any capacity, like militarizing borders with drones or whatever, should immediately quit or turn whistle blower. Still, I find this war game incredibly enjoyable. Applause to the hackers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This mentions something that has always irked me, YouTube trying to be informative about who the music is licensed by. For one, it&#39;s completely useless on classical piano music because the Content ID algo finds similarity in a dozen different recordings. But even when there is one canonical recording, such as Rick Astley&#39;s Never Gonna Give You Up, I&#39;m informed that the music is licensed by:(on behalf of Sony BMG Music UK); UMPI, Kobalt Music Publishing, LatinAutor, Warner Chappell, BMI - Broadcast Music Inc., UNIAO BRASILEIRA DE EDITORAS DE MUSICA - UBEM, LatinAutor - UMPG, SOLAR Music Rights Management, AMRA, UMPG Publishing, CMRRA, LatinAutorPerf, LatinAutor - Warner Chappell, and 15 Music Rights SocietiesWhat is happening here? Does YouTube have legal arrangements with all of these bodies to make sure they get their penny per kiloview?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Presumably this will encourage the creator of the 1914 work to create new works."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Here’s what triggered this: The ceremony includes bits of a recording (of tenor John McCormack singing “Funiculi, Funicula”) made in the year 1914.
The Corporate Takedown&gt; YouTube’s takedown algorithm claims that the following corporations all own the copyright to that audio recording that was MADE IN THE YEAR 1914: “SME, INgrooves (on behalf of Emerald); Wise Music Group, BMG Rights Management (US), LLC, UMPG Publishing, PEDL, Kobalt Music Publishing, Warner Chappell, Sony ATV Publishing, and 1 Music Rights Societies”So what&#39;s going on here?  Did some record company reissue the song later on CD, so YouTube is treating it like it was released at a later date than it was?https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain_in_the_United_St...:&gt; All works first published or released before January 1, 1926, have lost their copyright protection, effective January 1, 2021.Google probably should compile a list of public domain recordings to act as a blacklist for YouTube copyright claims.  Maybe that should even be legal a requirement for such automatic enforcement systems.  If they partner with some library or national archive, such a project could help with media preservation efforts."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Rightly so. The &#39;gig economy&#39; is abused by quite a few companies to create employment like situations without the required trappings (social security payments, employee protection, hourly minimums and so on). This was long overdue, let&#39;s hope it has precedent effect for other companies that abuse the ZZP construct."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If this ever happens in the U.S. I won&#39;t bother with driving Uber anymore and this would probably put them out of business. The Taxi industry will win back from the disruption that Uber caused.This has nothing to do with worker&#39;s rights. No one gave a crap about Taxi driver&#39;s work standards and they are/were treated worse than Uber drivers.This is all about the Taxi industry fighting back.75% of all ride share drivers would prefer to remain independent.In Chicago, I can make $42/hour driving Uber.

I suspect the statements only hold for the initial page load, that spinner and the slowly but surely updating fake counter holds visitors enthralled for the final outcome.Anyway, the path is clear: close that Starbucks tab after ~2 seconds of faked cookie setting time and get your caffeine kick elsewhere.[1,2,3] just search for it - most results are commercial entities trying to sell some &#34;marketing&#34; or &#34;website enhancement&#34; service which I do not feel like boosting by linking to them.

Kind of Ironic! Thomas Midgley, Jr. (1889–1944) was an American engineer and chemist who contracted polio at age 51, leaving him severely disabled. He devised an elaborate system of ropes and pulleys to help others lift him from bed. He became accidentally entangled in the ropes and died of strangulation at the age of 55.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a very distinct memory of disembarking from the Budapest to Belgrade night train to the smells of leaded fuel in Belgrade.Budapest was no standard of cleanliness at the time (late 90s), however Belgrade was truly still in its post-war phase and had all of the energy, anger and edge of a place that had been pretty beaten up.We were robbed, given a pistol in a nightclub (still have no idea what was going on there, I just remember being really surprised that pistols came in styrofoam and shrink-wrap packages when they are new... Being from Canada I had never even seen a pistol before), were surrounded by really beautiful people who we thought wanted something from us but who were only generous and kind, and .... the smell.The smell of that leaded fuel was everywhere. It smelled sweet and was so unique. It&#39;s what has stuck with me 20+ years later.One other side note from that trip. We were in the countryside (mean to be meeting a friend from home in his ancestral/family village but took the wrong bus) and someone in the village directed us in to a pub that was basically an old barn. Inside there were many middle eastern guys and a mix of Serbian and english speaking people. I was given a pin by one of the middle eastern guys after I threw an excellent game of darts on the dartboard next to him.Years later I had a job for a defense contractor and the subject of that trip and the pin came up. I showed him a picture of it and he recognized it instantly: al-Aqsa Martyrs&#39; Brigades. I looked it up and so it was.We were put up with a local elderly woman who served us some type of soup in the morning and then someone gave us a ride out of town to a bus stop that had service that day. We waited only an hour until the first car came along, reeking of leaded fuel."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"PipeWire is how audio should be on Linux, and it&#39;s ready to use. No more complications between PulseAudio, ALSA, and JACK. PipeWire implements all 3 of these interfaces, which means you can use applications that depend on any or all of these interfaces simultaneously with no conflicts. Playing a video in Firefox and a track in a digital audio workstation at the same time works with no special configuration. PipeWire makes audio on Linux as easy as it is on other OSes.The Arch Wiki page describes some of the use cases for PipeWire: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PipeWire"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For the last ~12 years, I gave PulseAudio a try every time I upgraded the Fedora distro on my main computers. I almost never had the catastrophic bugs many people complained about. But pulseaudio has always taken 10-15% of one CPU when in use (be it on audio/video calls, or music/movie playback). This is across 3 different laptops and 2 desktops. It is not a huge deal, but it is a bit frustrating on laptops where battery life is precious. I understand that PulseAudio is very powerful, but it represented no practical gain for me personally, with my very simple use cases, so I simply disabled it.Weirdly, I found very few people complaining about PulseAudio&#39;s CPU usage. Maybe nobody cares about 10-15% of one core.However, I am happy to report that PipeWire seems to not have this problem at all. Since it became default on Fedora, it has barely shown on top&#39;s first page. Given that it is even more ambitious than PulseAudio in terms of latency, this is incredibly impressive!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wanted to try debian 11 last weekend. First time I installed it from debootstrap. I plugged in a 1TB SSD on an USB 2.0 to SATA case, formatted it, prepared the root filesystem with debootstrap, chrooted to it, installed a bunch of packages, setup locale and timezone, installed linux-image, grub and booted it. Worked flawlessly.Tried a &#34;ps|aux&#34; and discovered it is already running wayland and pipewire. Works so well it is boring. Nice!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Good related reading: https://raphlinus.github.io/color/2021/01/18/oklab-critique...., with some analysis of various colour spaces of different types, focusing especially on their behaviour in gradients, to do with interpolation.My biggest complaint about perceptual colour spaces has been that they make working with colours near gamut boundaries really hard. For example, with #ff0 (yellow) in LCH, you can’t tweak any of the three parameters in either direction without going out of gamut (play with it at https://css.land/lch/ to get a vague idea of what I mean, though it doesn’t handle going out of gamut well). Yet such colours have plenty of practical value, and it’s a shame that many things eschew them because they’ve drunk too much perceptual uniformity kool-aid. Colour palettes often just don’t have any decent yellows at all. (To be sure, you do need to use such colours with care, but to remove them altogether is distressing.) For colour pickers especially, perceptual colour spaces have just been no good, because of their weird shapes and because you’re more likely to want to pick interesting colours nearer gamut bounds.So I’m really glad to see this, because it’s just what I’ve been grumbling about the absence of. Thank you Björn, I continue to enjoy your work!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the real story is subjective, not quantitative. Color pickers:https://bottosson.github.io/misc/colorpicker/OKHSL works a lot better than the alternatives. It&#39;s really nice!OKHSV doesn&#39;t seem as good, and neither do the other new ones."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My personal complaint with color pickers is that they make it hard to find many normal environmental colors. Where is brown? I&#39;ve learned to find it around red, a little toward orange, and a dark saturation. It&#39;s not intuitive, and I don&#39;t feel like I just pick _some_ brown because I can&#39;t easily explore the space of browns through beige and tan. Flesh tones are similarly difficult.I&#39;m not sure what the solution is. A purely algorithmic color picker probably isn&#39;t the answer because it&#39;s not just our color perception that matters, but also the way colors are formed in our environment (which is what gives us so many browns)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Related to this, there is an intimacy of small community which makes you feel valued and a proper contributor, that social networks really seem to oppose: they want to make the network bigger, you are part of the biggest world context, everybody on TikTok is eating a habanero while watching Bob Ross, so only if I do the same nonsense do I have a chance of 100 people noticing and liking  the video and maybe opting to see more of my content.When I put it that way it feels banal, but like, you know the “fast-growing subreddits” list on Reddit? There were meetings! Someone worked on that! People literally sat in a room and said effectively, “Hey Fatimeh, what is the status of the ‘make subreddits suck faster’ feature? Management is very interested in delivering that in Q3.” Right? Like this connection from global to personal is just automatically assumed, nobody spends a waking moment thinking it could be anything but that way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Somehow this post takes the least interesting part of the source article[0] and draws false conclusions from it.&gt; In the simulation, the decision whether to rebroadcast is random, rather than being driven by “virality” or cognitive bias, so the simulation is an optimistic one.
&gt; It turns out that message propagation follows a power law: the probability of a meme being shared a given number of times is roughly proportional to an inverse power of that number.So they implement a textbook model and a textbook result comes out - surprise? There’s nothing to be drawn by this.I may share the authors sentiment but frankly this blog post is bunk.There’re some interesting parts in the source though once you get through all the grand-standing fluff.[0]: https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/information-overl..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As soon as your news feed becomes too big for you to read all of it and then decide whether to repost anything, the quality of information you propagate is going to fall because of that filtering process.I avoid this by unfollowing people very frequently. I see one stupid candid or a pout or a food shot, I just unfollow that person.Same goes for SJW/White Supremacy types. Whether you are OP or a sharer, you get muted/unfollowed.This is how I use Quora. When I used Facebook five years ago, I used it this way.Twitter I use only for professional content. Very strictly. I also set the trending country to Namibia, so that I don&#39;t even know what they are talking about.I am less and less active on social media with the passing of days, but a good social media experience can be achieved by strictly filtering normies, politics, food porn, etc."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I had a brief love affair with Elixir/OTP recently. The language ist beautiful, the platform very impressive. Genserver and the actor model are very powerful tools for concurrent systems and Phoenix is one of the best web frameworks I ever tried.BUT the tooling was a bit lacking (e.g JetBrains IDE, good debugging workflow), the library support was a bit spotty (e.g for Auth, everything high quality but often abandoned). Then if you use e.g GCP there is no real first class language support and if you deploy to Kubernetes then there is a lot of overlap with Beam/OTP for deployment management etc. this and I feel for most quick web development pure functional programming is too much mental overhead for me (maybe this comes down to practice). I feel way more productive with e.g Go or Node.I have mad respect for Jose Valim and the community for delivering such an exceptional project in a world saturated with languages and frameworks. But I fear its not for me. At least not yet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very curious about the recent surge of Elixir / Erlang posts on HN, is there a reason for this?How is the the job market surrounding this as well for Elixir / Erlang devs?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great resource, thank you. I&#39;ve been slowly transitioning my programming time to Elixir/Phoenix the last couple years. Every couple weeks I dive in, but mostly going back to Rails. But recently with the `1.6.0-rc.0` release, this time it might stick. HEEx templates are fantastic, esbuild as the default is a really good choice, LiveView is getting some traction, and the packages seem to be picking up. Fantastic language &amp; framework in general."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; “The biggest mistake was to miss Kubernetes. We were in that collective thought bubble where internally we thought Kubernetes was way too complicated and Swarm would be much more successful,” Jérôme Petazzoni, one of Docker’s first and longest serving employees, said. “It was our collective failure to not realize that.”They were not wrong on saying that Kubernetes was very complicated, at least in some sense. In the beginning no one wanted to use it because they could easily setup Docker Swarm with minimal effort. This argument still pops up frequently on HN when there&#39;s a new post about Kubernetes.I guess the problem was they didn&#39;t realize why Kubernetes needs to be that complicated. And if a system is complicated for good reasons, that&#39;s actually good business opportunity and tons of people and companies will be willing to make the effort to fill that gap."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good read, and touches on a lot of the pain points from that era. As someone who was lurking on HN at the time during the containerization boom, I think that the key failing of dotCloud/Docker was not capitalising on Docker Swarm almost immediately. Docker Swarm was touted almost from the start but the repeated delays gave it a reputation of smoke and mirrors left people scrambling for solutions.I also clearly remember the multiple high profile spats that &#39;shykes had on HN which burned a lot of bridges. At the time he had a reputation for answering lots of questions on HN which helped a lot with community building. After those bridges were burned there was no one to speak for Docker as the developer mindsets shifted slowly towards Kubernetes. IIRC the Github PRs were also a source of contention as dotCloud corporatised.To be fair, Kubernetes was a real slog to understand at the start and had a lot of competition; it was definitely not the same level of simple, direct technical solution that Docker was.Interesting trip down memory lane and what a pivotal technology! Regardless of the rest Docker is a true cultural phenomenon and a testament to the insight of the creators working outside of the myopia of big tech."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The truth is, Docker had the chance to work closely with the Kubernetes team at Google in 2014 and potentially own the entire container ecosystem in the process. “We could have had Kubernetes be a first-class Docker project under the Docker banner on GitHub. In hindsight that was a major blunder given Swarm was so late to market,” Stinemates said.&gt; Craig McLuckie, Kubernetes cofounder and now vice president at VMware, says he offered to donate Kubernetes to Docker, but the two sides couldn’t come to an agreement. “There was a mutual element of hubris there, from them that we didn’t understand developer experience, but the reciprocal feeling was these young upstarts really don’t understand distributed systems management,” he told InfoWorld.The article criticizes Docker Swarm as myopic, but IMO, there were only two possibilities for Docker to move forward; either they acquired Kubernetes, which was a possibility in this telling of events, or they won with their own Docker Swarm."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This was really when people started figuring out how bad fallout from thermonuclear bombs could be. General Fields described it most lucidly:&#34;If Bravo had been detonated in Washington, D.C., instead of Bikini, Fields illustrated with a diagram, that lifetime dose in the Washington-Baltimore area would have been 5,000 roentgens; in Philadelphia, more than 1,000 roentgens; in New York City, more than 500, or enough to result in death for half the population if fully exposed to all the radiation delivered. This diagram was classified secret and received very little distribution beyond the Commissioners.&#34; [1]Image reproduced here [2].Thermonuclear bombs are really terrifying. If one goes off and you&#39;re in the fallout zone do not go outside for at least 2 weeks. If you survive the initial blast you have about 10 minutes to get inside where you must stay. If you&#39;re still outside and it&#39;s &#39;snowing&#39; ash you&#39;re already dead. More tips and tricks in [3].Though these days, they say it&#39;s likely that a single individual or small group can have even worse impact from a basement bioterror lab.[1] Hewlett and Holl - Atoms for Peace and War around pg 181 (free pdf history book) https://www.energy.gov/management/downloads/hewlett-and-holl...[2] https://whatisnuclear.com/img/castle-bravo-if-on-dc.png[3] Nuclear War Survival Skills (free pdf book) https://www.oism.org/nwss/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"9/11 was my birthday, and I was just outside of NYC in school that day.I was in math class. The phone in the classroom rang and my teacher turned on the radio (1010 WINS) immediately. After hearing what had happened she broke down in tears because her husband worked in WTC. My parents worked in NYC (as did most of my classmates&#39; parents) and was very concerned.The school district evacuated the elementary schools to the gym at the middle school because our town had a major dam and there were concerns that could be attacked too, which would&#39;ve flooded the low-lying areas where the elementary schools are. Eventually, school was dismissed and I ended up at my neighbor&#39;s house. Her husband was a FDNY Captain.So many people I know died or were permanently harmed (physically or mentally) that day.While nearly every second of that day is permanently etched into my brain, there&#39;s one day that&#39;s even more vivid. My FDNY Captain neighbor took me to ground zero in early November 2001. I&#39;ll never, ever forget the smell of burning flesh and the hundreds of firefighters using rakes looking for human remains. He told me to never forget, and I never will."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When reviewing 9/11 attacks (likely the biggest and most disastrous intelligence failure in U.S. history, give or take Pearl Harbor), it&#39;s worth remembering that it could have been much worse.  If the first plane had hit Indian Point nuclear reactor what, 30 miles from NYC and upwind?  It&#39;s likely a Chernobyl/Fukushima disaster would have resulted with an exclusion zone well into NYC.  That was reportedly part of the plan but as I recall they wanted a more media-friendly target.Additionally, the fact that members of the Saudi government aided and assisted the hijackers, and that they were tracked and monitored by both the FBI and the CIA, yet no action was taken to stop them, not even a simple warning to airlines to increase security after that Aug 6th Presidential Daily Briefing?  What a debacle.We should have left Iraq and Afghanistan alone and done the regime change op in Saudi Arabia, except that Wall Street likes its petrodollars so Washington props up the House of Saud and its theocratic dictatorship. And that&#39;s still going on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was in the Navy and had been at my first command at a nuke base in the PNW. I walked to the galley for breakfast and they had some TVs you could watch while eating. I watched the second plane hit.
 I walked to work which was a telecommunications station. We processed messages for different regional commands and would call them directly whenever they had an emergency action message (EAM). I walked in to a completely chaotic watch floor. Every message was an EAM that day. Every phone was ringing or in use, every computer that could alarm was alarming, our dial up modems were constantly busy. All my coworkers were shouting and running here and there. I had never seen it like that and as a young Sailor it was very worrying. Everyone we called to inform them of their EAMs would ask if we knew what was going on or knew if someone was mobilizing but we were just as much in the dark as everyone else.I remember at one point our Leading Chief Petty Officer (LPCO) yelled for everyone to stop what they were doing and told us to call our parents and loved ones to let them know we were safe. That was the longest day I’d ever worked at that command and no one left that day, even those from the previous night shift. The fact that no one, even our CO, had any idea what was going on…that the military was in the dark, was such an unnerving feeling."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I write on medium [1] and I don’t think switching to a stand alone website would be good for me at all.Medium has “publications” where my work gets sent out to hundreds of readers that are reading about a topic, not necessarily from me - I’m not notable at all in the field so I’d have a rather hard time getting people to subscribe to __me__.If I were to make my own website, I’d lose a ton of discoverability.Plus, the monetization on medium is fantastic. Nowhere else would I get that return per view - I’m currently averaging around 25k views a month with a $500 return.I do have my gripes with the platform, but in my case, Medium is the worst platform for writing besides all the rest.
 [1] https://anth-oleinik.medium.com/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are two sides to this, though we often only hear one.For readers who aren&#39;t subscribed to Medium, it can be annoying. You go to read an article, and if that article is monetized, you see a banner to sign up. Plenty of people leave immediately.Now let me tell why, as a writer, I still use Medium and will continue for the time being.I only post 2-4 articles on there per month. But even then, I&#39;m seeing ~50K views per month and this month I&#39;m on track to earn $1000.To see those same results on my own blog, I would need to learn a lot about SEO, affiliate marketing, and have a large Twitter following to direct traffic to my blog. I would also need to maintain it myself.Sure, I might have a higher chance of going viral on HN, but how likely is that even anyway?As a full-time developer with a newborn who&#39;s just looking to earn some fun money, Medium is perfect. I write, submit to a publication, and they take care of the rest.People may say, &#34;I&#39;m not going to read your posts on Medium.&#34; My answer is: okay? Can&#39;t make everyone happy. But I&#39;m still getting 50K views from people who do want to read them, and I&#39;m okay with that.The other point to make is that Medium only pays for views/reads from other Medium members, so I don&#39;t necessarily care if I go viral on HN or not. If I really cared about going viral, I would just post my article to something like dev.to and then submit it to HN.If you&#39;re just looking to write and get views/go viral and don&#39;t care about money, then it might not make sense to post to Medium. But if you want to earn some money with relatively little effort, Medium is hard to beat.Edit: Here&#39;s proof of my claims for people questioning them (https://medium.com/@SunnyB/proof-of-medium-stats-700c2b0b638...). Note: it is a Medium link to an unlisted post. Didn&#39;t know where else to put it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Every nights I read through the hackernews posts of the day which didn&#39;t reach the front page for my newsletter. Every time I click on a medium posts and that I click &#34;previous&#34; the page freeze during 1-2 seconds.Therefore I have a ban on Medium posts. When medium.com is in the URL it is automatically discarded, unfortunately they offer white label domain so I happen to click on some of those links.Also I didn&#39;t do stats about it, but if you want to blog about something and do it on Medium you have a much lower chance to be featured on HN (not talking about others forum ). Choose wisely. HN is not the center of the world but there are only a few places that can offer 50k visits"</p>

It&#39;s probably just a keyword or link that tends to co-appear with other, actually rule-breaking content, and some automated system has learned to block it.Still, it does seem like the sort of thing that could get Facebook in trouble with a regulator if you squint at it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The day this number reaches 100% will be on of those before/after moments. Considering the only problem with remaining 8 titles not running is DRM/anti-cheat, it is possible that we&#39;ll see this day arrive.I usually make fun of &#34;linux on the desktop&#34; prophets by saying &#34;Yes, 90% is great but problem is that everybody uses a different 90%&#34;. But 100% of the 50 most popular games is a different thing. It is a level of compatibility that you may not even achieve on windows depending on your hardware. Of course, performance and a few bugs will exist, but compatibility will be good enough for almost everybody.I wonder if this coupled with steam deck will finally make supporting linux sustainable. I mean, a point where supporting is so cheap and the number of users is big enough that it becomes profitable to do so. If that happens, most excuses to not support linux will finally vanish away."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m very curious if we’ll start seeing a move off of windows for gaming rigs with this.  The 100 dollar premium for windows takes a big bite out of a 1000 dollar gaming rig."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A few thoughts:1) Proton labels like platinum, means how much effort you need to put for the game to run on linux. It says nothing about how well it will run. So “work on Linux” means basically that it works on Linux. It says nothing about performance. For instance I had a game labeled platinum run without effort on Arch with 50fps with constant drops to 30 ~ 25fps whereas on windows it runs at a constant 60fps with rare drops to 55/50. (Yeah, I’ve tried all variations of proton, kernel, disabled composition etc)2) In my experience people that says that they see no difference in performance between linux and windows they usually have a powerful gpu, not a medium or low end one. So if you hear on the internet people claiming that the performance is about the same, it’s highly dependent on the game and/or your system specs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is more just &#34;missed optimization opportunities in EC2&#34; than a statement about mistakes in AWS as a whole.If you want to talk systemic AWS mistakes you can make, we accidentally created an infinite event loop between two Lambdas. Racked up a several-hundred-thousand dollar bill in a couple of hours. You can accidentally create this issue across lots of different AWS services if you don&#39;t verify you haven&#39;t created any loops between resources and don&#39;t configure scaling limitations where available. &#34;Infinite&#34; scaling is great until you do it when you didn&#39;t mean to.That being said, I think AWS (can&#39;t speak for other big providers) does offer a lot of value compared to bare-metal and self-hosting. Their paradigms for things like VPCs, load balancing, and permissions management are something you end up recreating in most every project anyways, so might as well railroad that configuration process. I&#39;ve experienced how painful companies that tried to run their own infrastructure made things like DB backups and upgrades that it would be hard to go back to a non-managed DB service like RDS for anything other than a personal project.After so many years using AWS at work, I&#39;d never consider anything besides Fargate or Lambda for compute solutions, except maybe Batch if you can&#39;t fit scheduled processes into Lambda&#39;s time/resource limitations. If you&#39;re just going to run VMs on EC2, you&#39;re better off with other providers that focus on simple VM hosting."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"AWS is complexity-as-a-service. This is why, as a one-man company, I went baremetal[1]. One flat price, screaming fast performance, and massive scalability if you get a beefy enough machine[2]. I don&#39;t have time to fiddle with k8s, try to figure out AWS billing/performance tradeoffs, or deal with untraceable performance issues due to noisy neighbours and VM overhead. My disaster recovery plan is a simple DB dump script to S3, and I know I can get another baremetal server up and running in less than 20 minutes.[1] with IBM Cloud 1 year free startup credits[2] Let&#39;s Encrypt and StackOverflow run their entire databases on a single beefy baremetal machine. https://letsencrypt.org/2021/01/21/next-gen-database-servers..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Biggest mistake I’ve made:Shifting any non trivial infrastructure into AWS verbatim is always more expensive than running it yourself. You need to rearchitect it carefully around the PaaS services to make a cost saving or even break even.An extreme example of this is it cousin who works for a small dev company doing LOB stuff. They moved their SQL box into EC2 and it’s costing more to run that single RDS instance than their entire legacy infra cost was per year.I’d still rather use AWS though. The biggest gain is not technology but not having to argue with several vendor sales teams or file a PO and wait for finance to approve it. All I do is click a button and the thing’s there."</p>

The lighting, the composition, the textures, the even level of detail…I would recommend everyone try it out for themselves to see what I’m talking about.

French Rust is fully compatible with English-Rust, so you can mix both at your convenience.Interesting factoid: in France, most of the stop signs say &#34;stop&#34; due to the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals linked below.In Québec, on the other hand, most of the stop signs say &#34;Arrêt&#34; due to nationalism reasons. Bilingual Arrêt/Stop signs exist, but are rare."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know this is a joke. But.. when I learnt C programming, and in order to smooth transition from algo classes to practical programming, we were told to #include a header file that would more or less do what this does for rust. The header file would also enforce curly braces and parentheses when writing loops or condition statements, as far as I remember. Fact is: it actually helped. Problem: my first foray in the industry would involve C and guess what? They used english-C (sorry no better word for it) rather then french-C. I fought for a few weeks re-learning the language."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They also expanded all keywords, so &#34;fn&#34; becomes &#34;function&#34;, &#34;mut&#34; becomes &#34;mutable&#34; (which is not even a common word? How about &#34;altérable&#34; or &#34;modifiable&#34;?). Interestingly the Result::Err variant was kept short with Résultat::Arf which is an onomatopoeia.10/10 looks very painful to use.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve read all the comments, and as usual, no one&#39;s asked &#34;what do other industries do?&#34;Money-handling, for example (banks, payment systems). If ever there was a Fraud Magnet, that&#39;s it. I&#39;ve heard PayPal described as &#34;a giant fraud-detection system, wrapped around a tiny money-transferring system.&#34;And yet, they don&#39;t seem to be in the news all the time like &#34;data theft&#34; stories are. Could it be that the legal and regulatory and insurance systems have made it a manageable problem? Someone steals your credit card, your losses are capped. Someone steals your Personally Identifying Information, sorry, pal; change your passwords.So maybe treating PII as the same thing, in every way, as money is the answer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good. Security will only be a priority when it&#39;s more expensive than profit."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"People are worried about the wrong stuff. SolarWinds was bad but it was likely intel operation. They wanted access to networks for intelligence purposes. They jacked it so they could access assets behind corp firewalls. Spys will always try to spy.IMHO the Kaseya hack was far worse, maybe worse than WannaCry but with better outcomes. This was a criminal operation, provided by criminal software suppliers that really was only resolved when the keys were leaked on a forum.The rumor is that local intelligence forced the disclosure of the keys (eg: guns to heads), because this is pretty much the destroy the world scenario that is unstoppable.
It is easy easy for attackers to cause billions of dollars of damage in a day.Its not getting better. It can&#39;t. Our systems are designed for large scope of trust with massive surface areas. Security is a game where the defenders cannot mess up once. Its hopelessly asymmetric and can never be better."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have a semi-related anecdote about surprises from devices.I use a CPAP. After a year, I went back to the doctor for a followup, and was asked to bring the SD card so they could review the data it collects. The device records the times and duration of use, various settings, and some metrics on breathing (apnea events, etc). I knew it recorded this stuff on an SD card.I brought the card to the appointment, but the doctor said &#34;I don&#39;t need that, I have your data here.&#34; It turns out that the CPAP contains a cellular modem, and it phones home and reports in real-time. I had no idea this thing was recording any data at all. It wasn&#39;t verbally disclosed to me by either the doctor or the equipment technicians. I imagine there&#39;s something buried in the fine print of the (long lost) documentation, possibly even in the fine print of some form I signed, but I was caught off guard and none too pleased.I&#39;ve since done some research on this and discussed it with my new doctor when it came time to get a new CPAP. The doctor acted surprised by me having a problem with it. She immediately jumped to the defense of the manufacturer and insurance company, claiming that they &#34;needed&#34; that data. She said that if I disabled it, insurance would refuse coverage.This is insanely invasive, even with disclosure, and ought to be illegal without explicit, obvious verbal and written disclosure. The insurance defense is complete bullshit. For one, I paid cash for the CPAP because I had a high-deductible insurance plan and would have had to pay out-of-pocket anyway (and never claimed it even for the deductible offset).I realize a CPAP isn&#39;t a fridge, and there&#39;s at least a case to be made for insurance enforcing compliance (at least when insurance claims are involved). I don&#39;t agree with the undisclosed enforcement mechanism, nor do I agree that treatment should be contingent on monitoring (it is for some other treatments, but not for most; no one is monitoring diet, exercise, drug use, cigarette consumption, or other risky behaviors, and threatening to withhold treatment for non-compliance).Anyway, I&#39;ve ranted enough, but there&#39;s a serious problem with the normalization of surveillance technology."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It should also have an arm on the door to slap your hand when you open it for the 41st time in a day. I mean, that&#39;s insane, you deserve a slap.Btw, this reminds me a bit of my parent&#39;s Renault that would tell me every damn time I started it to follow traffic regulations. I wish I could slap that car and it would feel it.And then there&#39;s my father-in-law&#39;s Mazda, which has a GPS system that sometimes finds him 200 km off the mark, and it keeps talking nonsense. You can&#39;t silence it because the touch screen doesn&#39;t work while driving. Yeah you can guess how that makes one feel.. like slapping it.Oh boy, I also have an Amazfit smart watch, imagine mountainbiking at high speed, you quickly want to see how many KMs you still have to go. You look at the screen and it says: &#34;PAI 50 Good Job!&#34; (full screen! Despite talking the time to make the display show you only relevant things in settings) and you need your f-king other hand (while biking) to dismiss the notification. Yup, slapping and cursing it is.Do people even use the stuff they make themselves?"</p>

I would break it open and remove the WiFi antenna if I had no choice of buying a non-connected one.I&#39;ve bought a robo vacuum cleaner recently. Luckily there still are 100% offline models available. Unluckily they all are overly stupid, can&#39;t have lidars and map your home (while I can see no reason why this has to require Internet access and can&#39;t be implemented an autonomous way)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Phony Diagnoses not just at nursing homes, also in mental facilities.  Was really surprised (better word-traumatized) that one flippant casual mention of not valuing my life in a private text message was enough to to get me detained by police in a facility for a night.  &#34;Doctor&#34; threatened me with drugging just because I refused to answer some of their questions and instead insisted on a lawyer.  Funny how  freedoms can be taken away so dubiously even when not charged of a crime nor arrested in a system that exists outside the criminal system.  I&#39;m surprised and not surprised similar behavior happens in nursing homes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I haven&#39;t finished the article yet.  I got sidetracked by the claim that Haldol is &#34;a powerful sedative.&#34; I understand that journalists are neither doctors nor pharmacists, but if you&#39;re reporting on a story about medical ethics, maybe know a little bit about drugs, how they work, and what the words you&#39;re using mean in a medical context.Haldol is a typical antipsychotic.  If the patient has no symptoms that indicate its use, they should absolutely not be taking it.  There&#39;s a lot of side effects.  Some may even persist after the medication is discontinued.One of these side effects is that it can be sedating.  I&#39;ve been on the patient side of a misapplied antipsychotic myself.  They can make you very tired and cause you to feel &#34;drugged&#34;.  This is not the same as a drug being a &#34;powerful sedative&#34;.  Words mean things.  Words in a medical context have specific definitions and nuance.  If you&#39;re reporting on medical malpractice, it&#39;s important to get the vocabulary correct so that the way you word something represents the truth rather than a sensationalized version of it.I can definitely believe that these people were medicated in ways that were dangerous to their health for the convenience of the staff.  However, when you call Haldol a powerful sedative, I have to assume you&#39;re either trying to make the situation sound as horrible as possible or you have no idea what you&#39;re talking about."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Antipsychotics have horrific side effects but are useful in institutional settings to make residents/patients/inmates easier to manage - psychiatry is the tool used to legitimize drugging people without need for their consent in such settings, for the benefit of others and the institution. It makes me despondent to read an article like this as I believe there are too many perverse incentives and cultural taboos for this situation to change in any meaningful way."</p>
