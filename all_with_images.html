								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For the professional (or former professional) astronomers among us, I will make my somewhat amused observation that what people are most paying attention to is not really the distinguishing features of JWST.People seem most impressed by the apparent increase in resolution of the images, which is not from a certain point of view the hardest thing to do .  HST might have done that if its instruments had been of different pixel size or imaging array size / focal length.   Ok, the much larger mirror is an achievement.   But anyway, the resolution of the images is often not what really is the limiting factor for photometric observations.  Yes it is sharper/higher resolution, but that wasn&#39;t the key selling point.The new thing is observations in the IR, which is somewhat a technical footnote in many gushing announcements of these images (or some discussion here too).   And the general public knows little about that detail&#39;s importance, especially since the images are stylized / colored anyway to look just like RGB images that we are so familiar with.   But everyone can easily appreciate a sharper image.Anyway, still a momentous achievement.  And thank god we have a scientific field where stunning images was enough to get the public to support a $10B project.**Edit to add: I did not mean to detract from or diminish anyone&#39;s appreciation of the images and accomplishment at whatever level they are enjoyed.   And of course many here are technically knowledgeable about the IR aspect.   I just write to point out that for the most headline-grabbing images and newspaper writers, the sharpness of the images over the actual IR frontier is what grabs the attention."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s a backyard telescope versus Webb: https://twitter.com/AJamesMcCarthy/status/154694183270093209...More comparisons on Twitter, some zoomed in:- https://twitter.com/Batsuto_/status/1546899241880240128- https://twitter.com/Batsuto_/status/1546900387931766784- https://twitter.com/JBWillcox/status/1546881033597075457- https://twitter.com/jason4short/status/1546626672488632321I&#39;m not a physicist, so I&#39;ve only recently learned about redshift. Hubble&#39;s deep field images were very dark red/orange because further objects appear redder (into infrared) before they disappear to the observer. Webb&#39;s sensors are more red/infrared-sensitive than Hubble&#39;s, so along with extremely fine, super-cooled optics using exotic materials to align and capture every single photon, its red sensitivity allows Webb to peer deeper, further, and dimmer than we&#39;ve ever been able to before.And I&#39;ve read that the &#34;spikes&#34; coming off the brighter stars are generally from stars in our own galaxy and they&#39;re not lens flares. They&#39;re caused by the edges of the telescope. Hubble&#39;s stars would have 4 spikes in a cross; Webb has 6 in a snowflake because of the shape of Webb&#39;s mirrors having 6 sides. Or something like that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Question for anyone who happens to be an expert: Is there any way to quantify how much better Webb is independently of the amount of time used to take the exposures? Like, could Hubble achieve the same quality of images as Webb if it was given 100x (or whatever) more time exposure?I&#39;m trying to understand how much the improvement is &#34;speed of convergence&#34; vs. &#34;quality of asymptotic result&#34;. (Though... is that even a valid way of trying to understand things?)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Watching the livestream i was more than surprised, that color correction actually happens in Photoshop.Also, there seem to be multiple layer-masks involved for specific regions and objects.I get that you can shift and composite color, based on hue, apply filters etc, but: Photoshop?Curious if anyone can explain, that what we see is actual science or some touched up version of objects in our universe.p.s.: What struck me the most is the absence of noise, especially for the deep field photo. Hubble took many exposures over weeks, which normally would allow for reliable reduction of noise, webb took some shots over the course of hours and there’s hardly any noise to see. Weirdest part is seeing them just “healing brushing” away some dots - how is the decision process on altering images like that?(edit for typos)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&lt;https://www.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/www/files/home/jwst/d...&gt;The science performance report of JWST is a fascinating read. Some of the highlights that sent me down a rabbit-hole- On Predicted lifetime of consumables - Before launch, JWST was required to carry propellant for at least 10.5 years of mission lifetime. Now that JWST is in orbit around L2, it is clear that the remaining propellant will last for more than 20 years of mission lifetime.- On Orbit - Orbit around L2 is maintained through regular station-keeping burns, which are scheduled every three weeks- On observatory lifetime - At present, the largest source of uncertainty is long term effects of micrometeoroid impacts that slowly degrade the primary mirror.- On Other spacecraft performance - JWST is now generating 1.5 kW to match the power load, with a capability of &gt; 2 kW- On Fault management - Of the 344 single point failures at launch, almost all of them related to deployments, only 49 remain; these are common to most science  missions (for example, only one set of propellant tanks, only one high gain antenna)The section on &#34;Pointing and guiding&#34; which mentions how complex sub-systems interact to achieve &#34;line-of-sight stabilization&#34; and how its not possible to test those systems together in an end-to-end fashion on the ground is interesting."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Meta - I am honestly surprised, and sightly appalled at the general attitude in these comments (and also in yesterday&#39;s thread).Uber has essentially not just broken laws, but outright exploited workers/drivers... and people comment &#34;Aah but the local taxi mafia was bad&#34;...??!? I&#39;m sorry but that does not justify exploiting workers. That does not justify using political influence to enter/gain markets. This isn&#39;t some messiah coming to save us all from the &#34;horridness of local transport&#34;.I&#39;m not saying that having Uber as a player is necessarily bad, mind you. But it&#39;s possible to have some positive benefits for some people while hurting a lot of others. I sincerely doubt too many HN users have driven taxis, but my conversations with Uber/regular taxi drivers hardly painted a favorable picture of Uber. (Nuance - please note that my taxi drivers doesn&#39;t represent all drivers. There will be happy and sad drivers, my point being it&#39;s not always sunshine and rainbows... which the article speaks about too.)I wonder if this being a YC owned communication platform affects/biases users (some of whom I&#39;m sure are YC founders etc themselves), however the ratio of apathy/&#34;taxis were already bad&#34; to &#34;Uber shouldn&#39;t exploit workers, nothing justifies it&#34; is disappointingly low.(I know this is a particularly ranty comment and I had kept quiet on the last thread but seeing the same type of comments here pushed me.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My personnal experience.
I come back from a trip in romania - bucharest.
At first I didn&#39;t take Uber but tried for the regular Taxi from the airport.
All of them requesting ~40USD.
At the end I go with one who put the meter and indeed arrived to 200 Lei (~40 USD). I payed in euro because I didn&#39;t have enough local currency, hopefully I had some and the driver accept.Taking some information it&#39;s way too much, but would I have argue with how the meter was operating anyway?Now, I need to comeback to the airport at 4am.So instead, I reserve a airport transfer from the airline itself, pay in advance something like 30 USD this time.And... no one show up at 4am. Mobile phone of the transfer is not answering... I never heard of them *So I install Uber, hopefully it&#39;s working, enter my visa (from my country, no need for local currency at all), after 10 minutes, someone very nice take me and I just paid like 15 USD to get to the airport, at 5 in the morning, with the invoice by mail.How do you compete with that? Taxi business need to reflect. And every country is the same strangely, it&#39;s as universal than taxes: you can&#39;t escape!* Edit: In fact I know what happened, and there is nothing to do, because I looked at the invoice and on the third page of the voucher PDF there, it&#39;s said that I needed to call 24h before to confirm the transfer... They don&#39;t call, you have to call. Even after the first confirmation I already did for confirming the pickup address some days before, I wasn&#39;t feeling paranoid enough. So you can&#39;t say nothing because I didn&#39;t read the last page, but it&#39;s a dumb heavy process, do people changes their mind and decide to live forever in the country frequently?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Shocking stuff like this, weaponising drivers against city governments to do Uber&#39;s bidding to lobby:&gt; MacGann insists that Uber drivers were seen by some at the company as pawns who could be used to put pressure on governments. “And if that meant Uber drivers going on strike, Uber drivers doing a demo in the streets, Uber drivers blocking Barcelona, blocking Berlin, blocking Paris, then that was the way to go,” he said. “In a sense, it was considered beneficial to weaponise Uber drivers in this way.”&gt; The files show MacGann’s fingerprints on this strategy, too. In one email, he praised staffers in Amsterdam who leaked stories to the press about attacks on drivers to “keep the violence narrative” and pressure the Dutch government.Uber was weaponising their workers (while fighting as hard as possible to not call them workers and pay for workers&#39; benefits) against local governments, they were behaving like a tech-mafia, a mob with sprawling power across the globe.What the actual fuck?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the interesting aspects of giving a shit is that it will lead sometimes to you doing things which are not in your short-term selfish narrowly-defined &#34;best interest&#34; but because you give a shit you&#39;ll do it anyway.  Some of these lead to long-term value that is very significant but you can&#39;t know at the time.I was once asked by a client (bank) to take a call with one of _their_ clients (a pretty important hedge fund). I did this as a courtesy even though I thought our product wasn&#39;t appropriate for the hedge fund.  Anyhow I get on the call and it&#39;s the COO, the Chief Investment Officer, the CTO and a couple of other _very_ important people at this big fund. (ie a much more senior call than I really expected).  Anyway, because I give a shit, I told them our product wouldn&#39;t really be right for them and explained why.  They thanked me and I heard nothing more of it.Until a couple of years later where I offered a job out of the blue because one of the people on the call had been impressed by how I had dealt with it, and by pure coincidence his partner was a recruiter who was tasked with headhunting for a CTO role and he said &#34;hey you should check this guy out&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Everyone saying it doesn&#39;t scale is missing the point.Scaling is a winner-take-all, venture capital mindset. The article is about service businesses, which do not need to hit web scale! We are talking about services here not your web startup.Even beyond services, giving a shit and building saas is not impossible. In fact, I wish more tech companies started small and stayed small. I absolutely want to run a digital small business and I want to give a shit, it makes the building feel purposeful instead of this product-led growth at all costs bullshit.I hope we see a software middle class grow in the next decade. Middle class tech companies are going to be coming from the bootstrapper + founder focused funds (TinySeed / Calm) and they are going to have a distinct advantage if they understand their strategy/context in their chosen verticals."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Are you saying I can outsource my shit-giving activities?Sign me up. I&#39;ve been unable to give a shit for quite some time. I wish I could give a shit, but the world has become a pretty ugly place, in large part because of deliberate attempts to demoralize those who give a shit.You see it all over the place on social media. People do a weak-ass form of shit-giving in the form of &#34;raising awareness&#34;, the least conceivable level of effort for something you wish you could give a shit about, but don&#39;t actually give a shit.Of course even if somebody tried to GaSaaS, the space would promptly fill with people giving as few shits as possible for as much money as possible. Too many major charities do that: they&#39;ll take your money and spend it mostly on advertising for other people to give their money, too, and very little on the things you&#39;d expect if they actually gave a shit.I know TFA is more about the business sense of giving a shit, but I&#39;d love to see somebody able to give a shit in a larger sense. Unfortunately, I can&#39;t give a shit because it seems nobody gives a shit any more -- except the people who are passionately devoted to making sure other people feel miserable instead."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Sorry if I miss something obvious, but how is this not solvable by the compiler?I&#39;m a huge functional programming evangelist, but high-level stuff like this does not belong in a low level language bytecode like WASM.Wasm should only care about two things: Security and Performance.With the standard blowing up like crazy we&#39;ll get neither. Worse, we&#39;ll cemenent the current duopoly of browser engines, because we&#39;ll make it (again) so complex that no-one can create an alternative.We shouldn&#39;t have GC, Exceptions or Tail calls in WASM, as long as the compiler can provide them.What we should have is multi memory support and memory read permissions, because without them WASM lacks basic security primitives.[1]Reference types maybe. But I&#39;ve yet to see a convincing argument as to why they are absolutely necessary.Everything else (as long as it can be done by the compiler) is just bloat.1. https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity20/presentat..."</p>

They all — all, 100% — interrupted my attempt to give them some money.&#34;This is a good touchstone to use for &#34;you&#39;ve overoptimized your site, tone it back&#34;. I am also taken aback every time I&#39;m on a site, I&#39;ve got something in my shopping cart, I&#39;m headed for the &#34;check out&#34; button, or I&#39;m even on the checkout page, and some stupid interstitial pops up.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve talked about this on HN but I&#39;ll say it again.A couple years ago, after being an Android fan for the better part of a decade, I finally bought myself an iPhone and pried myself away from Google&#39;s ecosystem wherever I could. And Apple didn&#39;t even need to do any work for me to make this decision. It was the years of abuse from Google that you experience when you decide to use a Google product or service. And a big part of that was the constant A/B/C/D/E/F testing. I never felt like I was using a complete product, everything felt like a constant beta that could be changed or rearranged at any point, and I was just doing free testing work for them while they harvest all my data.Every app update was a risk of the app rearranging itself, or features appearing/disappearing. Eventually it didn&#39;t even come from app updates in the Play Store, and new interfaces would just appear one day when a server somewhere marked your account as being in the group that gets the new UI. This app that you were familiar with could at any point be rearranged when you open it on any given day. Then maybe a week later you open it and it&#39;s back to how it was before. A button you thought was here suddenly isn&#39;t, and you question whether something actually changed or if you&#39;re losing your mind. It&#39;s a subtle gaslighting that eventually I couldn&#39;t stand any more.To me, A/B testing means you don&#39;t respect your users. You see them as just one factor in your money machine that can be poked and prodded to optimize how much money you can squeeze out of them. That&#39;s not to say a company like Apple is creating products out of the goodness of their heart, but at least it feels like it was developed by humans who made an opinionated call as to what they thought was the right design decision, and what they would want to use. And in my 2 years of owning an iPhone, I&#39;ve never opened my reminders app to find out that it&#39;s completely unrecognizable, or my messages app has been renamed or rethemed for the umpteenth time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem with AB testing is that it&#39;s a short-term strategy. For example, if a news site runs AB testing with headlines, they&#39;ll find that bullshit clickbait headlines get more pageviews than concise, accurate headlines, but the constant use of clickbait headlines will over time destroy overall traffic to your site. More frustratingly, sites run by smart people tend to fall into a balance where the worst articles get the most alluring headlines."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What I really don&#39;t understand about this shitcoins is the scale of it. When I read this story I basically thought &#34;ok, but you&#39;re going to spend a load of money pumping but there&#39;s no way there&#39;s liquidity for you to actually perform your dump&#34;. But if you look up DOCK today you&#39;ll see its market cap is $14m and it&#39;s daily traded volume is $1.5m. I would get it that you could move some of these coins using a few bill boards and some sponsored ad reads if they were tiny volume traded, but the implication of this is that millions of dollars are moving back and forth every day on a coin that has absolutely nothing going for it. Who is doing that? There can&#39;t possibly be retail moving in and out of this stuff. Really I kind of assume this all has to be wash trading right?"</p>

So cool!After an image loads, you can resize your browser text (Ctrl + / Ctrl -) to instantly reveal a different image with each resize event. By sweeping through very small and very large zoom levels, you can make peoples&#39; fingers trace out a diagonal line from top-left to bottom-right as the registered point moves with the underlying voronoi canvas as it scales up and down.Side note: how hard would it be to reduce the time delay between identifying a point and displaying an image? Could this be made realtime by preloading all images? The flicker would be terrible but I&#39;d want to try it at least briefly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is not a historic low, but a definitive low. There are several reasons for this.- in time of a crisis, the world seems to ralley around the dollar, as it is backed by the strongest economy and the strongest military.- this crisis has hit Europe hard, as it is not only close to the war, but of course, too dependant on Russian oil and especially gas.- there was a lot of inflation internationally, the US federal bank was the first to raise interest to combat inflation. The EU lags behind and is limited in action due to the fear of destabilizing some of its member countries with too high of a debt.Consequently, there is a lot of good reason for the Euro to be weak at these times. However, if the energy crisis can be solved and the war contained, a weak Euro also is also pushing exports from the EU. So there is a lot of reason for this trend to be stopped, if not reversed, until the other extreme is reached again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is bad for Europe because our salaries (before tax) have already been lower than US salaries. Additionally we pay much more taxes than you guys on salaries (up to 50%) and on VAT (~20%).Means at the moment until salaries get inflation adjusted that we pay a premium price for everything."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"PepsiCo Inc (PEP, Nasdaq) isn&#39;t merely a beverage company - as explained in this strategy document - it is a space company. The Pepsi Universe, with respect to its 8 light year characteristic length, reflects the scale of the total addressable market (TAM) that PepsiCo can expand into.Noted short-seller and equity valuation skeptic Jim Chanos once described the TAM of space companies as infinite, because space itself is infinite. This pessimistic take anchors our low-end fair value estimate of PEP to $infinity / share. Since PEP currently trades at around $170 / share, we believe there is considerable upside to the long term buy and hold investor."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Can someone explain why this won&#39;t result in a renaissance for peer to peer and e2e encrypted chat/forums/social media etc.? When government or industry makes it nearly impossible for consumer needs to be met we inevitably see a grey and black market spring up to meet those needs. My prediction is that if legislation like this becomes widespread we&#39;ll see a freely distributed application rise to prominence among a gaggle of others, it&#39;ll dominate the chat and social market until even grandma is using it and the establishment will have a right proper freak out as other social media giants implode and everyone is communicating anything they want with zero oversight from the government or industry. This is roughly how I remember the Napster affair going when DRM was pushed hard by the recording industry, it eventually collapsed but not before dealing a massive blow to the status quo and forcing a transition to streaming."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If UK government really cared about children, and not about surveillance and censorship, they would solve the problem another way.The only way protect children online is to ban them from Internet. Children should not have access to normal laptops and smartphones, instead they should use &#34;kid phones&#34;. Such phones would allow children to communicate only with people approved by parents or teachers and visit only approved sites. This way they will enjoy perfect safety which this Bill fails to provide.Every site which wants to become approved, must fulfill all the requirements from the Bill and indicate this with a HTTP header. Kid phones and laptops should allow only to visit such compliant sites.Kid-oriented phones and laptops must be visually distinctive: for example, have a shape of a cute animal. In this case teachers, parents or police will be able to instantly spot and confiscate illegal devices.This is a win-win plan: kids would be safe and adults would be safe from government overreach. Obviously no government will agree to such plan."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"With respect to the politicians not turning up, it&#39;s worth noting that at least some of the candidates for PM are against the Online Safety Bill and want to scrap it. So for them, campaigning to become the next leader may actually be a more useful way to spend time than hearing what they already know.It appears the OSB has become a victim of incoherent requirements specifications. It&#39;s grown enormously during its gestation period and is now trying to do way too much, including things that are self-contradictory. Some politicians recognize this, for example Kemi Badenoch:https://order-order.com/2022/07/11/watch-badenoch-slams-onli...but I recall others saying similar things. I just can&#39;t find the references right now."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This comment is from the perspective of a Calibre power-user, and someone who has been involved with the software for years now.I must admit, I&#39;m slightly shocked at some of the comments here. Kovid puts in an extraordinary amount of work (nearly 80 hours a week) into Calibre - of which most is for free, in the name of open source software. Anyone who has spent a decent amount of time on the mobileread forums will also know him as a remarkably intelligent, dedicated, and all-round fantastic guy. He&#39;s very patient and kind with beginners, responsive to feedback, and rarely loses his cool with anyone. His only &#39;crime&#39; was being blunt with a bug report around eleven years ago, and I&#39;m struggling to see why people are so myopic as to turn that into their entire perception of him. Add to the fact that he eventually fixed every bug in that thread as well as second-language difficulties that he likely experiences, and the vitriol that people have for him is undeserved.The proof of the pudding is Calibre itself, which is a joy to use. It is hands down one of the most useful programs on my computer. It&#39;s rarely buggy, fast, logical to use, very feature-rich, and rather customisable. I&#39;m perplexed as to whether some of the people in this thread and I are using the same software. It&#39;s very easy to set up, as all you do is either point to a pre-existing library of files or create a new one. Adding books is trivial, as is editing metadata, and the reader itself is splendid. That&#39;s really what most people need out of e-book software, but Calibre really does go above and beyond any e-book software on the market right now. The only close competitor is Foliate, which is not cross-platform like Calibre, and even then it simply lacks many useful features that I rely on with Calibre, despite having a much cleaner UI."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Kovid Goyal, the developer of Calibre, is a very responsive, very gentle person. Whenever I needed help, I have gotten help from him. [1] - Calibre is an indispensable tool for me to manage my digital library with close to 800 books.I support him regularly. Consinder doing it as well if you appreciate the app. Go to https://calibre-ebook.com/ , there’s a support link on the top right.[1] This is the forum dedicated to Calibre

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Calibre does its job so well it&#39;s downright essential for anyone thinking about dealing with ebooks. Glad to hear that full text search is added in this version, using it with a bunch of reference books saved will be so useful. It might be worth splitting out the fiction books I have to clean up the results. Maybe it works with tag filtering, I&#39;ll have to check."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is great! Gcc support opens up more platforms, more targets, and the opportunity to more easily integrate with the various common embedded toolchains that are built around gcc.And it&#39;s free software, for those that care, this matters."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have mixed feelings about the idea of a GCC frontend for Rust.On one hand, having frontend diversity for a language helps bring new people into the language; think of the groups who can&#39;t use Rust because it doesn&#39;t support certain targets or can&#39;t integrate with their existing toolchain. There is a lot of talent that could be brought into Rust just by virtue of them being able to be included and the less barriers of entry, the better.But on the other hand, I don&#39;t want to have to think of implementation specific behaviors, bugs, quirks, et cetera. Having an ecosystem built with thousands of people wrestling with that problem seems like a recipe for buggy software and burnout. People say that a spec would help with this aspect but I&#39;m sceptical; a spec doesn&#39;t prevent divergence from happening, it just gives you a frame of reference for what is correct. You also don&#39;t need multiple implementations to have a spec either!I fear that the way this is going to pan out is that we&#39;ll have multiple frontends for Rust, but the vast majority of engineers using the language will only ever think about &#34;true&#34; Rust: the current mainstream implementation. Issues in crates that primarily affect &#34;alternative&#34; Rusts will go unacknowledged, be tossed out, or have hacky patch jobs. We&#39;ll end up with either a) two separate, but high quality, ecosystems or b) one shared, lower quality ecosystem that is constantly fighting itself. I hold Rust in really high regard and it&#39;s my favorite language at the moment, so this thought is scary to me.Though, there are a lot of smart people involved so maybe it doesn&#39;t have to be so doom and gloom. A couple of years ago I thought that cross-platform software was really messy and hard to get right but languages like Rust have the proper language features to make things like this much easier (though not perfect!). It could be that the emergence of multiple frontends could necessitate features and tooling for the Rust itself which makes all of that I said a non-issue. Maybe. Hopefully."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am the author of this feature.  The background here is that the SQL standard was ambiguous about which of the two ways an implementation should behave.  So in the upcoming SQL:202x, this was addressed by making the behavior implementation-defined and adding this NULLS [NOT] DISTINCT option to pick the other behavior.Personally, I think that the existing PostgreSQL behavior (NULLS DISTINCT) is the &#34;right&#34; one, and the other option was mainly intended for compatibility with other SQL implementations.  But I&#39;m glad that people are also finding other uses for it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is great! I have multiple places in our code where I&#39;ve had to define multiple unique indexes (with conditionals) to get around this. It&#39;s definitely confusing behaviour the first time you encounter it.Honestly I think SQL already breaks it&#39;s own standard of &#34;NULL = unknown&#34;. One example: If you do a LEFT OUTER JOIN and the joined data is missing, you get NULL in the resultset. But in that case, it&#39;s not &#34;unknown&#34; whether there are records that can be joined to, the answer is that there are definitively no records there.NULL is univerally considered by most programming languages to equal &#34;not present&#34; vs &#34;unknown&#34;, and in many cases by SQL in practice. The ship has probably sailed on actually changing the default behaviour, but optional flags like these are a good step."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is amazing. We moved from Oracle to Postgres after being on Oracle for 15+ years. That was a huge move that took 2 years. One of the biggest hurdles was rewriting thousands of sql queries. One of the biggest things we had to change was accounting for how oracle handled nulls versus how Postgres handled nulls. However, we missed this nuance about how Postgres treated nulls and unique. It wasn’t until about 2 years into using Postgres, and running into so many issues, that we finally stumbled upon this nuance in the documentation. Crap. That required making a bunch of more changes to account for this. At this point I’m firmly convinced that null handling is the hardest part of database work ;-)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Per the article this came in response to questions raised by a Columbia faculty member critiquing the university&#39;s data. I thought that report[1] was actually more interesting than the original article.As per the quote at the top of the report:&gt; Rankings create powerful incentives to manipulate data and distort institutional behavior for the sole or primary purpose of inflating one’s score...It would be shocking to me if Columbia was the only institution that fudged its numbers a bit in pursuit of a higher US News ranking. Given how important that ranking has become in US culture, I wonder if it&#39;s time for the methodology to change to require audited/auditable metrics rather than continuing to allow self-reporting.1: http://www.math.columbia.edu/~thaddeus/ranking/investigation..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For context, U.S. News and World Report used to be a trusted periodical that reported national and international news. In the 80&#39;s they started ranking colleges and selling it as a separate publication, which turned out to be pretty profitable, so they repeated the trick by ranking hospitals (1990), cars (2007), and then states (2017). The news business went online only in 2011, then shuttered in 2015. Since then they&#39;ve just been a rankings company, but they kept the name to trade on their reputation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"You are describing the hedonic treadmill. Essentially, you become used to your surroundings, and while they are objectively great, from the perspective of inside your own head, this is now normal and you / your monkey mind wants more.There have been a lot of post floating around the internet with various solutions, the most popular being Stoicism &gt; Positive Psychology / Happiness research &gt; Buddhism / Meditation. I&#39;ve dabbled a little in all of them and they all have something to offer.Essentially, you are experiencing a disconnect between how it feels to be you and how you expected to feel. As someone only a little older than yourself, I would say this: your job will never love you back, and especially in the software realm, it may not be as fulfilling as something like woodworking or therapy. It does pay the bills, though.The above mentioned happiness research / positive psychology suggests that having multiple, meaningful social roles that you can fulfill outside of work will allow you to shoulder more responsibility and find meaning in your life.What I&#39;m trying say is that in the second half of life, it is our job to give back. So start there.Also, this is in my morning bookmarks to revisit:

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some advice from someone a bit further down the career path:* If you want to try something, try it! Save up some runway, do your own thing. Try some other projects right now, don&#39;t wait. (You won&#39;t be able to devote full time effort to them, but can still make progress.) You may find that what you dream about isn&#39;t all that, or maybe it is. Either way you can take steps forward.* I learned to be happy with my life after I&#39;d taken a few alternative paths. Nothing like jumping to a situation, realizing it wasn&#39;t what you thought it was, and then jumping to a different situation, then realizing it wasn&#39;t all that great, then jumping to a different situation... After I did this a few times, I learned that I needed to create happiness where I was, not try to find it elsewhere. YMMV.* It is a cliche, but kids are only young once. Enjoy that time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was there 5 years ago. My psychology was getting worse by the month as everything I did seemed more and more futile.I quit my job, travelled to some bucket list destinations like Japan, Fiji, Galapagos, machu piccu, then went on a 5 month backpacking trip across both islands of New Zealand with my (ridiculously) supportive wife. I immersed myself the whole time in zen philosophy and tried to lose my egocentric placement in the universe.It was a great reset for my depression, but did nothing to erase the fundamental feeling that all of reality and my actions within it are pointless.For the first year I took my passion projects seriously, devoting almost a full work week of attention to them. At a certain point, I stopped those too. I realized I was merely creating my own flavor of the distractions I&#39;d tired of.Now the only things that bring me real joy are improving my home environment, the health of my family, and getting out in the sun and playing sports. That kind of &#34;out there, just around the corner&#34; abstract life satisfaction I was chasing seem as ridiculous to me now as participating in US politics. It is all ephemeral."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Being the same vintage as Jim, much of this brought back memories.There really wasn&#39;t any such thing as a tech stack - our company would produce software for various Unixen and, especially, Vax, and the language was alway C, with some Pascal on the Vax side (as, I was told, the Vax Pascal compiler produced far more optimal code than the C compiler).Being a software engineer was like being a furniture-maker. You had to master a small number of tools - the saw, the chisel - and then craftsmanship consisted of discovering an affinity with these tools and a love of getting ever more skilled at using them. This path wasn&#39;t for everyone, which was fine - plenty of management and other non-tech roles for those folks - but if you grooved with your tools it was a real joy to be able to move from chair- to table- to cabinet-making and carry and refine your skills as you went.This idyll could not last, however. Before too long it became uneconomical to make furniture this way, so for your chair making project you instead had to learn how to run a chair-making machine. When you moved onto a tables project, the machines there were infuriatingly dissimilar to the chair-making ones you&#39;d just mastered. Worse still, moving back to chair-making after a year or two, you discover that the old machines you knew are now obsolete and you have to re-learn how to run their replacements. This stops being fun, or interesting, after a while, and yet sadly it&#39;s all that most younger software engineers know.Occasionally, there is the need to make some shim or gizmo that the machines don&#39;t cover, so out come the trusty saw and chisel of yore - much to the amazement of the young&#39;uns, who are astonished that an old-timer can still wield these antiques so effectively."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thing I hear from a lot of software engineers from the time-frame of 1980-2000 is how much software engineering - to engineers at least - was about the craft. It was all about the craft of making good software. People invested real energy into trying to do it right, and treated it as such. This is of course likely colored by experience and &#34;rose tinted&#34; glasses, however, I think we as an industry have let this go, especially since the rise of bootcamps. It just isn&#39;t about the craft anymore, its all about &#34;hustle&#34;. There is some truth to the fact that engineering in this time there was more caring about it as a craft, caring about performance, caring about shipping quality etc.I like thinking about things as a craft, I don&#39;t always like the &#34;hustle&#34; aspect that is pervasive now, it guarantees shipping too early and never taking quality &amp; craftsmanship seriously, I feel like.I want to work somewhere again that sees engineering software as a craft again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Even if we did see then (and we mostly didn’t) that small, frequent releases were better in a whole bunch of ways, we couldn’t really do it. It was expensive to ship on physical media, and disruptive to our customers to have to do frequent installs.It&#39;s still disruptive to customers. As a software engineer I love CD/CI. It makes the entire process much smoother and more efficient.As a customer / end-user, though? Nope. I absolutely hate it. Maybe I&#39;m just getting old but I&#39;m extremely nostalgic for the days where I got to decide if I the upgrade was worth it to me or not. These days things will change and move you on without any notice or opt-in what-so-ever."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This area of finance is utterly, completely backwards and seems like one of the most (evil)successful bits of proper-burden reversal in existence. The entire concept of &#34;identity theft&#34; as it exists now is 100% pure industry propaganda. Nobody is cloning bodies and transplanting brains or something. It&#39;s not that anyone is &#34;stealing my identity&#34; it&#39;s the financial institutions don&#39;t bother to verify it and then somehow have managed to make a system where this is my problem. If I haven&#39;t chosen to have a business relationship with a given financial institution or credit bureau, and they choose to give somebody else financial services, it shouldn&#39;t matter if that person used my name or widely circulated information about me, anything less then full biometrics/video for signup and establishing mutual certificates and cryptographically signed interactions thereafter should be presumptively invalid. If Person M lies to a Bank A about their info claiming to be Person A and tries to escape their commitments sure they&#39;ve committed fraud, but if the Bank A then tries to go after Person A then the bank are literally accessories to fraud and should face criminal prosecution or at the least massive financial penalties (with both expenses and punitive fines paid to Person A). If the banks want to have private credit bureaus to help them with scaling, abstracting and reducing bias in the risk aspect sure; there are reasonable arguments for that. But said credit bureaus should have no role in identity verification, and if they are lying about people (claiming financial things about them which are not true) that again should be on them, with serious statutory penalties.All the burdens are completely backwards, in turn massively perverting the incentives. And it&#39;s eternally infuriating. Some rando applying for a credit line on the opposite side of the country should be Not My Problem, 100% of the time, whether they have my name or address or a random symmetric 9 digit number some government assigned me. All the tools exist for financial institutions to manage their risk/convenience tradeoff, but they&#39;re the ones who have the power, information and should have the incentive to do so. They are externalizing onto the general public instead."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s shocking to me that this type of email change swapping still works. I might have to write up a blog post explaining how to fix it permanently.It&#39;s a fairly simple process though.1. Create a table that tracks every email address change on the account. It can&#39;t just be a single field because once compromised, people have learned to just change the email address twice.2. That table should contain fields for: user_id, email_from, email_to, confirm_key, reversal_key, created_at, confirmed_at, reversed_at, created_ip, confirmed_ip, reversed_ip3. When an email change is initiated, an email should be sent to the new email address with the confirmation_key to have them verify the new email address before making the change.4. Once verified, an email should be sent to the OLD email address notifying them of the change and including a link to the reversal_key to use if they did not make this switch, including the IP address and approximate geolocation of the IP address for some context.5. If the user clicks the reversal link it will clear the confirmation and reversal links of every email change that came after the link that was clicked,  ensuring that the original change can always be reversed no matter how many changes were made afterwards, revert the email address change and force the user to update the password. This password change screen should warn them that their account was likely compromised and strongly recommend they enable MFA (if available on the site) to prevent it from happening again.I spent a year working on a site that dealt with a TON of fraud and phishing against the user base. This was one of the biggest issues that we dealt with, but this approach completely resolved the problem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Moderately tangential, but I just had my Uber account hacked today. I also used a strong, unique password managed by a password manager. As far as I can tell, my email wasn’t hacked (Google Workspace account backed by a physical security key). My best guess is they scammed support, but I am just taking a stab in the dark.The worst part is, you can’t even talk to Uber support chat unless you put in the account’s current email, phone number, and last 6 digits of the credit card on the account. I have the attacker’s email address, but not the phone number, so I couldn’t even chat with support. They have an “email support” form, but it asks for the same info. I put in what I knew, but I haven’t heard back from support since the attacker took my account this afternoon, and I fear I’m not going to get it back."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What annoys me about this the most is the message from Steam, that sort of plays along with this.&#34;This game is no longer available for sale on Steam&#34;. No big deal, right.Ok, fine, but it doesn&#39;t imply the servers going down and the title becoming unplayable...Then 2nd message:&#34;Please note this title won&#39;t be accessible from &lt;date&gt;...&#34;Once again, accessible doesn&#39;t imply &#34;the game won&#39;t start, thanks for the monies&#34;.It&#39;s a bloody shame that I can start any games from the 90s on an emulator and they run just as fine, even content heavy. While these titles are completely riddled with DRM and screw you over after X years.Publishers need to come clean, and after years of milking the cow, they must have a plan allowing paying customers to play the title they&#39;ve been enjoying all these years. Otherwise, they should be forced to include the verbiage at release date &#34;This title will stop working as of &lt;date in the future&gt;&#34;.This kind of nonsense only promotes cracked games."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Still a million times better than what it replaced. About 20 years ago I was working with the Australian taxi cab industry. The hq of the regulatory authority shared the address of the main payment system. The regulatory authority was made up of representatives of each taxi cab company that each had one vote. There was one taxi company (the one that controlled the payment system allowed) with 200+ subsidiaries that made up that organization. If anyone tried to get into the taxi industry they&#39;d use their 200 votes to say they are not allowed by regulations. This was a company making 2billion a year in one state of Australia alone (NSW). It was so incredibly fucking corrupt and i am thankful to Uber Lyft and all the other incumbents for managing to get their foot in. It required dirty dealing to get past this corruption."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Uber isn&#39;t the most ethical company for sure but here in Brussels the taxi industry is pretty shady as well.Getting a taxi license costs an exorbitant amount of money and it&#39;s done through all kinds of dodgy deals.There&#39;s 1-2 companies that have a monopoly on the whole industry.There&#39;s weird rules about which types of taxis can &#34;serve&#34; the airport, akin to what mobsters are responsible for collecting trash in what areas.You&#39;ll often get &#34;sorry the payment terminal is out of order, cash only&#34; BS.A study a few years ago showed the main taxi company, according to their tax documents, earned a ridiculously low amount of money per day (= obvious dodging of taxes).They clearly refused to innovate for years. When you called their number you&#39;d get some unintelligible voice on the other end that would give you about 10 sec to state your details before they&#39;d clearly run out of patience.You could only request pickups at specific addresses that would then be connected to your phone number / profile. So &#34;pick me up on this street corner&#34; was impossible.The last time we called one for a ride to the airport they didn&#39;t show up at the agreed time so we got an Uber. Taxi company called us many times screaming insults down the phone, followed by an offensive email with an invitation to pay and threats of small claims courts.In light of all that, I have zero problems with someone else moving in fast to break things."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I actually joined a political party in my country, because they had the intention of protecting Uber.Some people wonder, but why? Why protect such scummy company?Well, it was literally to save lives, as much illegal Uber behaviour is, what they were trying to replace was worse, MUCH worse.Where I live &#34;Taxi Mafia&#34; was a thing, not just in the usual sense people imagine, like blocking competitors using regulations, but people were murdering others, there were beatings, assassinations, theft, high level government corruption, the Taxi Mafia was evil and destructive as any other &#34;&lt;drugs/guns/slavery&gt; Mafia&#34; you can imagine.A lot of people claim Uber is evil because they say their workers are contractors and not employees. Well, before Uber if you wanted to be a driver, you had to purchase your own car, open your own company, and then give 50k USD to the local mafia boss, and promise to join combat whenever called. Combat? Yes, combat, gathering up drivers to kill a competitor was a thing, one infamous case for example: out of town driver parked near airport to deliver someone, a client in a hurry got on his cab as the other client was leaving, the local mafia didn&#39;t like this happened, so they surrounded the car and invited the driver for a &#34;walk&#34;, took him under a nearby bridge, and they all kicked him until he was a mangled mess, and then they kicked him some more to make sure he was dead."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;Google makes $40bn...If I can create something that just a tiny fraction of people find useful, then I can create a huge amount of value.You conflate two meanings of value: monetary value, and intrinsic value. Search engines are intrinsically but not monetarily valuable to users. Search engines are monetarily, but not intrinsically, valuable to advertisers. You can get into trouble when you conflate these two meaning of &#34;value&#34;.In fact, right here is the pivot on which the internet goes from an idealistic shang-ri-la for geeks, to a commercial hellscape for the unwashed masses. It is surprisingly easy to create intrinsic value with computers! You see it all day every day on HN: some geek had a thought, spends a weekend making it, and then deploys a solution.It is surprisingly hard to extract monetary value from an intrinsically valuable solution. In fact, I believe that creating artificial scarcity is the hardest part of building an internet business, requiring invention on par with the intrinsically valuable part - and yet its the very thing that idealists rail against.(And making something artificially scarce does seem morally repugnant. And yet I don&#39;t see any other way to pay developers. Full stop. Open source software + consulting fees is a good way to go, but that can&#39;t apply to hosted search for the public. Well I guess it could, you could teach businesses how to game your own engine!)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Perhaps a better approach would be building an open source www index or even a full current cache - as an enabler for people to build their own search engines?Right now it is extremely difficult to build your own web crawler that would compete with Google. And that is not because of the technology, but because multiple sites will prevent your bot from accessing them if you&#39;re not Google or Bing - either through robots.txt, or through directly banning your IP if it&#39;s trying to crawl and it&#39;s not a confirmed google-bot.Having a non-profit, open source, crawler that keeps an up to date index (or web cache) of the web would help competition spring up."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Disclaimer: I work for Google, though far away from Search.Regardless of search engine design, there&#39;s HUGE money in SEO. Any successful search engine will be gamed. Do you have the developer power to go red-queen against all the large companies in the world?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"(disclaimer: lead brand manager, been at the table of a lot of the meetings where these logo changes happen.)There&#39;s a few different reasons (especially depending on the company) why that these happen, but I personally think it boils down to two unintuitive quasi-psychological reasons.- When suits are fumbling around looking for a new shiny project that&#39;ll give them a sense of &#34;legacy&#34; and their fingerpints all over (that won&#39;t affect immediate profits), somewhere in marketing and brand is usually the first place they&#39;ll grab.  If wins, fantastic, they&#39;ve secured their legacy both in a career-spanning sense and at the company itself with a bonus. If it fails disastrously, easy enough to quietly switch back to the old and to save face by tackling a different project.- Sort of relatedly, a lot of marketing suits hate feeling &#34;left out&#34; of trends; it&#39;s something I loathe about the industry, the hyper-focus and optimization of being at the crest of new trends (when arguably they&#39;re usually shittier than the previous ones). Oftentimes their entire salary / sense of purpose of being at the job is tied into with presenting the latest and greatest, and insecure designers will be too happy to be enablers.(My opinion may be a minority of the industry itself as if it were me, we&#39;d be back to 90&#39;s era logos for the sheer zany quality.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article is confused about the difference between a logo and a word mark, which is what they are showing. Big brands are super pedantic about how and where logo marks and word marks are used. You shouldn&#39;t be seeing these word marks in contexts that are not already dripping in branding for the company.Look at the Pinterest Brand guidelines (https://business.pinterest.com/en-au/brand-guidelines/) and you well find them saying: &#34;Only use the Pinterest badge (please don’t use our word mark)&#34;. The Pinterest badge is the exact same stylised letter P from the old wordmark. So, almost everywhere you encounter a Pinterest logo it will be the stylised graphic. They can do that because enough people recognise the brand that they can drop the &#34;interest&#34;.The Facebook logo is an even weirder example because they are comparing the old Facebook app word mark with the newer Facebook-the-company word mark. That logo was specifically designed to look different from the app. Now that Facebook is now Meta, that uppercase logo has been retired.Microsoft, Facebook, Pinterest, Spotify and Airbnb all have stylised logo marks. eBay and Google use word marks, but are brightly coloured and immediately recognisable 99% of the time they are seen."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These are just the word marks, not the full logos.I mocked up a comparison of the logos (Microsoft/Airbnb/Spotify/Pinterest rarely use their word marks without the accompanying icon) and they start to retain a _little_ more personality, at least for the tech comparison.https://imgur.com/a/v5yKD3oIt still seems fair to say they&#39;re more bland than past iterations, though. The theme is ”[optional icon] + sans serif word mark”, and it&#39;s a good example of “small m minimalism” — a kind of unthinking collective march toward an absence of detail — touched on by The Cultural Tutor in this thread:https://twitter.com/culturaltutor/status/1538211892707086338&gt; Perhaps minimalist design is so prevalent because we no longer have anything to say.&gt; You don&#39;t need me to explain what the Gothic cathedral says, for example.&gt; But the skyscraper? It doesn&#39;t say anything, really. It&#39;s just... there.&gt; And suddenly everything, everywhere starts to look the same.&gt; Absolute neutrality. No detail. No identity.&gt; What does that say about us?"</p>

It’s all over Twitter etc., too.[1] https://web.archive.org/web/20220710064519/https://www.daily...[2] https://web.archive.org/web/20220710061754/https://gendai.is...[3] https://web.archive.org/web/20220710062542/https://news.yaho..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a lot of words for the basic conjecture that he was killed by/for being a moonie.The problem with this reporting is that it takes the killer&#39;s supposed words at face value. This is a big risk, especially as at this stage we are not entirely certain that those words are accurate.Now, this may eventually appear to be the case, but the level of certainty presented in this article is unfounded."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Lichess is amazing given how little they receive in funding. The interface is miles ahead of commercial competitors.They also handle guest plays much better. I&#39;ve faced less cheating bots and no annoying pop ups on lichess when playing as a guest compared to chess.comCan anyone point me to how they handle cheating detection? I would love a high level overview of how it works especially when you have no data on the player.fun nugget: HN users hosted tournaments on lichess at the start of the pandemic [0]0] https://lichess.org/team/hacker-news"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Always excited when chess pops up on HN once a month or so. As someone who picked it up as a hobby in December, I can attest that lichess is a great app and site for folks looking to get back into the game or get started (I’m also a premium chess.com member as I use both products).For those of you thinking about picking up chess, I’d highly recommend watching the Chess Brah “Building Habits” series on YouTube. Watch the first five or so videos, and just start practicing those habits in rapid games (recommend 15 minute with 10 second increment on lichess, which shows up as 15+10). Embrace the losses, and just keep working on not hanging your pieces for free.If you’re intimidated by playing other humans, you can try the “Maia 1” bot on Lichess. It’ll likely beat you up for a while if you’re a beginner, but it’s a bot designed to play more like a human, and it’ll help you get the reps to feel more comfortable playing other humans.From there, just enjoy yourself. Chess can be frustrating because by design you always lose about 50% or your takes, but once you learn to accept the losses, it can be a great mental exercise to keep your brain sharp."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yes! The front-end code for Lichess is what got me to learn Mithril years ago. Really clean code for such a complex application. Here’s a great example:https://github.com/lichess-org/lichobile/blob/master/src/ui/..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For the past few weeks, I&#39;ve been collecting and refining prompting tricks for getting GPT-3 to emit and understand various types of non-prose output. Many of these are discussed in the Twitter thread the OP links to, but I&#39;d like to highlight a few of my favorites here too.- GPT-3 can produce simple SVG diagrams (https://twitter.com/goodside/status/1545883023719239689) from an English description, or incrementally modify a given SVG diagram (https://twitter.com/goodside/status/1545888869207400454).- GPT-3 can produce diagrams using Graphviz dot notation (https://twitter.com/goodside/status/1545109709035900928), including diagrams that incorporate real-world context (https://twitter.com/goodside/status/1545112039147847682) not given in the prompt.- It can emit and understand HTML and Markdown, including table markup — e.g., &#34;Produce an HTML table giving the members of the Beatles and their instruments&#34;- It can accept/emit multiple named files, with arbitrary content, simply by embedding those files as values in a larger JSON/YAML document. Here, (https://twitter.com/goodside/status/1545848754883919872) I demonstrate completing the file tree of a trivial Python package given a README.md.- It can understand the raw JSON file contents of .ipynb files, successfully following directions given to it in markdown cells, emitting multiple code cells, etc.While all this is fun, as many people have pointed out the model has a bad habit of &#34;hallucinating&#34; — producing highly specific, wrong output. Avoiding this (https://twitter.com/goodside/status/1545793388871651330) is more of an art than a science. Be highly skeptical of any output you get from GPT-3, and search for verification methods where you can."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a fascinating use case that wouldn&#39;t have occurred to me at all, quite cool, even if it &#34;doesn&#39;t know anything about anything at all&#34;.It even does pretty good with Verilog, which I assumed it would have issues with, admittedly some of this is just &#34;google-able&#34;, but even so. It can even create a reasonable attempt at a testbench (even though it doesn&#39;t quite get it right), which is crazy to me.*Explain this code:module my_module(a,c,y);
 input a,c;
 output y;
 assign y= c ? a : 1&#39;bz; 
endmodule*This code is a Verilog module that defines three inputs (a, c, y) and one output (y). The output y is assigned to the value of a if c is true, otherwise it is assigned to 1&#39;bz.*What is 1&#39;bz ?*1&#39;bz is a Verilog constant that represents a bit value of &#39;z&#39;, which is used to indicate a high impedance state.*Why is high impedance used ?*High impedance is used in digital circuits to allow multiple drivers to share a single bus without contention. When two or more drivers attempt to drive the same bus at the same time, a contention can occur and the bus voltage can become undefined. By using high impedance, drivers can avoid contention and allow the bus to remain stable.*Give me a testbench for this module*module testbench;

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s not just biology. It&#39;s basically every subject in high school. The amount of knowledge in the world has exploded in the last 100 - 150 years, yet our school system refuses to adapt and pretends we&#39;re still in the early 1900s. Back then you actually could get a good and reasonably in-depth overview of what makes the world work before going to college or work.But those kinds of aspirations are completely futile these days. People in the ministries of education and other responsible bodies will argue that high school&#39;s purpose is not to educate on a subject in depth but to give a broad overview of many subjects but that&#39;s completely besides the point. Because the point is that the only way that they are able to &#34;give you a broad overview&#34; these days is by force-feeding you ever more facts and knowledge in sliced up classes, compressed into ever more shallow and boring text books and then letting you puke it all out in brain dead exams, many times a year for many different subjects, in parallel. Bulimia learning.Which is beyond sad, because basically every subject can be the source of wonder and amazement if taught the right way and with enough time to explain and explore. Which is why we need to let our kids choose the subjects they are interested early in school and get comfortable with the fact that they won&#39;t have any knowledge about other subjects when they leave high school. There simply isn&#39;t any other way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had been putting off quantum physics and time was running out. I was worried forth semester physics at MIT was going to be tough, but then through some miracle of providence the EE department decided that a solid state chemistry chemistry class plus Into to Biology could be substituted for quantum physics.Because I had already taken a solid state chemistry class, all I had to do was take a basic introductory biology class; how difficult could that be? It turns out that biology is hard, very hard.The other students that filled the large lecture hall weren’t ordinary first year students; they were pre-med students. Instead of relaxing by the swimming pool reading a colorful text with pictures of jelly fish and beetles, it felt more like I was taking swim lessons with a few hundred sharks.The lectures by Professor Luria were great (he had won the Nobel prize four years before) but the number of facts seemed impossible to remember. My fellow students were writing down literally every word written or uttered during each lecture. There wasn’t any mention of jelly fish or bugs or pea plants, but there were complex diagrams depicting even more complex biochemical pathways. I was accustomed to math classes and engineering classes and computer science classes. Biology was very different, more facts and less study of how to apply fundamental principles to prove some theorem or solve some engineering problem.I survived the Biology class, but it would have been a lot easier for me to take the physics class."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"During the first part of the pandemic I watched the lectures for the Introductory Biology course [1] from MIT OpenCourseWare. I cannot recommend those highly enough!Almost every lecture brought up and highlighted something really cool and fascinating. Like how RNA sequencing over the last couple of years has gone from expensive to almost free, and what its uses are. Or time-lapse of bacteria adapting to antibiotics. Or just the first lecture showing a video of someone sticking a syringe into a cell. There were even some labs that could be done via a normal web browser.For me this was so much more engaging than the biology I was thought in high school, where we mostly learned things from outdated books.[1]: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/7-016-introductory-biology-fall-..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This exact thing happened to us. We have a store located in Puerto Rico and Shopify would randomly stop payouts every 3-4 months or so because they needed to re-verify our owner address information. Apparently, most of Puerto Rico is not verifiable by their shitty address verification API, so it triggers the freeze every time it retries the verification. It was one of the most frustrating experiences I&#39;ve ever had and cost us thousands of dollars.Stripe also did the same exact thing for very similar reasons and at one point we had over $300,000 USD frozen with them, which was basically our entire monthly payroll expense. We had to explain to our bank why our accounts were suddenly drained. This one was worse than Shopify&#39;s since we actually never received any communications notifying that this was going to happen. At least we got an email from Shopify that we just hadn&#39;t noticed.They&#39;re all broken. And Know Your Customer needs to eat shit and die."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This problem seems endemic to big tech platforms, particularly when money is involved. I remember hearing similar stories about PayPal a decade ago (still do for what it’s worth).While I can understand the desire to not interact with a user of the platform (shopify, google, PayPal, etc), because of the cost, and because many are likely to be bots or actually fraudulent. It’s precisely at these edge cases when computers and automated performs the worst.These are the situations where the scenario is imperfectly modelled in the system. Maybe the engineers didn’t think of the edge case, or an ML model never had training data to cover it.Point is, it doesn’t matter. People problems need people solutions. Remediating edge cases involving people’s livelihoods strikes me as most likely a people problem.When you’re asking a person or company to trust them in a business relationship into the future, such as by being their shopfront, there’s only so many you can destroy before word gets around. I haven’t used or recommended businesses to use PayPal for a decade, because I saw them time and again inflict pain and financial stress with no recourse.As another example, look at the general sentiment around Google Cloud. Would you build a business on top of it? Does that include an exit strategy to multi-cloud, because you’re unsure if they’ll support the service you use?If you can’t scale to provide a human to help other humans caught in the edge cases of your own system, then you need to acknowledge you’re causing harm.A dog food company that kills a puppy every week, is really a puppy killing company that sells dog food.It’s a matter of perspective yes, but if you got into it to help feed dogs, surely the last thing you would want to do is harm them?And if you became aware your killing puppies, would it not be the top priority to ensure it never happens again?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Shopify should be scrambling to do a public post-mortem right now. They &#34;Fixed&#34; the situation within a few hours of the tweetstorm, showing that they know they f&#39;d up. Shit happens - but how does shopify assuage small businesses that this won&#39;t happen to them next? A public apology, post-mortem and steps to make sure this never happens again."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article says Musk agreed to buy Twitter mostly as a joke. I think there&#39;s a far better explanation. This wasn&#39;t a joke for Musk because after agreeing to buy Twitter he proceeded to sell billions of dollars&#39; worth of TSLA stock, supposedly to finance the purchase. Even for the richest man in the world that&#39;s not a joke.I think a better explanation is that Musk offered to buy Twitter as a cover for selling billions of dollars&#39; worth of TSLA.Look at this story: https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-sells-billions-of-dol...
The headline is: &#34;Elon Musk Sells $8.5 Billion of Tesla Shares After Deal to Buy Twitter&#34;Why does he need a cover? Because TSLA is way too overvalued. He has to know that it is overvalued. Tesla&#39;s market cap is double of Toyota, VW, Mercedes, BMW, GM, Honda, Ferrari and Volvo all combined! [1]. If you sell stock while knowing your company&#39;s stock is way too overvalued, you&#39;re fleecing unsophisticated investors. Pretending to buy Twitter provides a convenient cover.Musk pretended that TSLA valuation is reasonable. Musk even called out Gates for shorting TSLA stock [2]. If he didn&#39;t have a cover then Musk would look like a hypocrite for selling TSLA.In reality, both Musk and Gates sold TSLA, the only difference is that Musk sold stocks he owned, but Gates sold borrowed stocks. But Musk used buying Twitter as a cover, so he gets to pretend to be morally superior. Even though both men sold TSLA, according to Musk, Gates&#39; sales means that he isn&#39;t serious about climate change [3].[1] https://companiesmarketcap.com/automakers/largest-automakers...[2] https://nypost.com/2022/05/31/elon-musk-calls-out-bill-gates...[3] https://www.businessinsider.com/bill-gates-shorting-tesla-wo..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So much noise here and ill-informed comments fail to give a broader understanding of  what&#39;s going on. Elon bought up Twitter shares early in the year for a reason, because he wanted more control over Twitter. He bought up so much Twitter shares that when it was announced via the SEC, Twitter offered a board seat under the clause that he wouldn&#39;t acquire too much % control over the company. He obliged, but then left when he realized he couldn&#39;t make the changes he desired at the company. Plus, people on the board at the time, specifically Dorsey, was nudging him to buy out the company as a whole. So he did, hastingly. That was an ill-informed decision and obviously a mistake made with respect to doing due-diligence. In hindsight, before the market crash that price may have made sense. But fast forward today with looming recession talk, it&#39;s pretty clear he realized it&#39;s overvalued (we know this from tweets about twitter deal being repriced). And so he needed an escape hatch, hence the issue with bots and the unverifiable mDAU was a great talking point. In fact, he may as well be right on the issue as Twitter doesn&#39;t want to reveal how they calculate it. What he&#39;s trying to do right now is pretty clearly force the board to give a better deal. He&#39;s not sold any stock and likely won&#39;t unless he&#39;s actually out for good. But given the amount of effort and thought he&#39;s put into it and making it clear that he should pay a lower price depending on the bot issue, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s much doubt he&#39;s not actually leaving Twitter. Whether the courts will force an acquisition at the current price however, is a looming question. My bet is they settle at a lower price."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not knowing anything about glyphosate, I went to the article before reading the comments. I’ll just put this here because it was clear the researchers wanted to be sure people see it. From the first paragraph of the article—&gt;&gt; In 2015, the International Agency for Research on Cancer determined that glyphosate is a “probable human carcinogen” (IARC, 2015). However, the European Food Safety Authority and the Joint Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)/World Health Organization (WHO) Meeting on Pesticide Residues (EFSA 2015, FAO/WHO 2015) determined that glyphosate is unlikely to be a carcinogen. The US EPA concluded that “available data and weight-of-evidence clearly do not support the descriptors “carcinogenic to humans,” “likely to be carcinogenic to humans,” or “inadequate information to assess carcinogenic potential” (US EPA 2017a). Controversy and concern that the rising use of glyphosate may have adverse human-health effects exist (Myers et. al., 2016)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been in the field for many years and I see the EU on the forefront of public chemical safety, both in terms of legislation and enforcement.
ECHA is transparent about glyphosate [1]. It is not even labelled as CMR on REACH Annex III [2], and that&#39;s saying a lot.
If you follow the developments, you will find that there is no way to prove a chemical as &#34;safe&#34;. All it takes is one bloke on record to develop any health condition which can be linked to a chemical, and it will be scrutinized six ways to Sundays. Often leading to the introduction or decrease of an OEL, or a classification of this substance. As new humans are born all of the time, and diagnostics and analysis methods are still being improved, the likelihood of any given chemical to be &#34;harmless&#34; asymptotically approaches zero.
1 in 2 people develop cancer during their lives [3]. There are currently &gt; 23000 chemicals on the EEA market at &gt;= 1 t/a [4].1 https://echa.europa.eu/hot-topics/glyphosate

I see nothing unreasonable about not allowing people to cross this boundary. The law does not prevent recording. It says you cannot record closer than 8ft. Why would somebody need to get closer than 8ft to an officer doing their job, when you have no involvement in the situation at hand? Adding more people to the situation simply increases the stress of all involved."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In the early 2000s someone (drunkmenworkhere is what I remember) made a blog post generator that you could sign up for, add some names, some interests, and it would generate blog posts with Markov chains and some other magic. I signed up, not fully understanding how it worked, added some friends and family as names, played around with it, it wasn&#39;t what I thought it was and moved on. Meanwhile it kept generating entries about me and my family doing fantastic things.At some point my then ex-wife (we&#39;ve since reconciled) was google-stalking me and came across these entries. At some point they became outlandish enough that she contacted me to ask what was going on in my life. There was a very confused conversation where I had no idea what she was talking about and she was somewhat concerned about my health and safety. It wasn&#39;t until I talked to a relative and started googling myself with some specific terms that I came across the entries and was able to figure out what was happening. I emailed the individual running the project and asked to end the entries and if possible remove them from the internet to avoid further confusion."</p>

Otherwise it would happily barf up random Markov walks from all of the other conversations without any consideration of context.In the span of one weekend at least five hundred unique users attempted to chat with it, some for hours on end. I only have a few logs left, but the conversations generally progressed from horny to irate or bizarre."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It is a nice article. Summary is they wanted lighter cars so accel/decel would require less power and the gas/brake system would be lighter/smaller. So then the wider gauge is helpful to increase lateral stability (to prevent tipping over) since the cars are so light.In my opinion these kinds of historical mechanical/civil engineering stories are quite interesting. Would love to see more."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good to know it was for steadiness against the wind given its light construction and the original intent to have if go on (under?) the GGB deck.I’d like to know why the tracks are flat and not angled  and require regular grinding down to even out the washboard effect this causes… which results in that high pitched sound whenever it enters a curve due to slippage."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Despite the District’s claim, I still wonder if the Southern Pacific had a hand in the choice of a non-standard gauge, to help make sure they’d never be ordered to take over BART and bear its operating losses. That risk might seem slight today, but it would have been more of a concern in that era, years before Amtrak, when railroads were being required by their regulators (ICC and CPUC) to operate other unprofitable passenger services.As the posting concedes, “The pamphlet does not specify why only the wide gauge of five-feet-six inches was tested and not others.”"</p>

It had polyphonic aftertouch, which most synths don&#39;t have today.Most have velocity sensitivity, meaning each note transmits how much initial force you applied. And most have aftertouch, meaning they transmit how much force you continue to apply after hitting bottom. But for most it&#39;s just channel aftertouch, meaning it transmits the aftertouch of the key you&#39;re pressing the hardest.The CS-80 transmitted aftertouch of each individual key, and had nice controls to to adjust how it used that information. A lot of synths can use polyphonic aftertouch but only a few new ones actually have poly-AT keyboards. The ones I know of are the Hydrasynth (out for a couple years now), the Behringer UB-Xa, and the Iridium keyboard (both introduced this year).Vangelis was also a huge CS-80 fan and used it on the Blade Runner soundtrack. Incidentally, a boutique synth that replicates the CS-80 pretty well (without keyboard) is the Deckard&#39;s Dream. It&#39;s $4000 but that&#39;s way less than a vintage CS-80."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Everyone already probably knows this, but if you search &lt;Song Name&gt; acapella or &lt;song name&gt; isolated vocals on youtube you can get the vocals to songs you want to cover. Sometimes its the original isolated, but sometimes its just someone singing it. I&#39;ve been having a lot of fun with Reverbmachine&#39;s Legends bank and vocals from youtube. Eurythmics Sweet Dreams for example.On a tangent, when I was in prison my mom died, and Kate Bush was her favorite music. Also in prison as a coping mechanism I created my own superstition that music on the radio was a message for me (I know it isn&#39;t but I needed a way to just get a little space to breath). Like Tom Petty meant the the day was going to turn out ok. So I programmed myself to be super receptive to Kate Bush being popular again and it&#39;s been amazing for my mood and productivity. Programming little positive things into my makeup has been really important in getting through stuff, be it addiction or just day to day difficulties."</p>

Sadly he had retired 2 years before I started working on Excel.Fun fact: when they were about to ship Excel 1.0, they didn’t know what to name it then so they had an internal poll.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The filed letter (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000110465922...) isn&#39;t the knockdown argument I would be expecting.Musk is saying, you haven&#39;t demonstrated your numbers are accurate.  But having signed the merger agreement and waived due diligence, I think he needs to demonstrate that they are _not_ accurate.  Complaining Twitter rate-limited his API access (which would be very foolish on their part) or that their bot measurement standards are &#34;arbitrary&#34; doesn&#39;t seem to get there.The letter complains that Musk asked for data allowing him to &#34;independently verify Twitter&#39;s representations regarding the number of mDAU&#34; -- but where does the agreement provide for that verification as a condition of the deal?  Maybe Twitter didn&#39;t provide sufficient information for Musk to &#34;independently verify&#34; that number -- that means nothing without showing Twitter had a duty to provide that information, or that Musk had a right to his own verification.  (Any lawyer agreeing to the other side&#39;s verification of such a thing probably isn&#39;t a very good lawyer.)The last paragraph, complaining about firings and hiring freezes and departures, seems positively desperate.  Who seriously cares about this stuff?&#34;I relied on your numbers but now they seem soft&#34; is different than &#34;I relied on your numbers but now they are clearly wrong&#34;.I have enormous respect for his engineering and business skills, he&#39;s accomplished some remarkable things.  But he doesn&#39;t seem so great as a dealmaker.  Perhaps he&#39;s badly advised, but hey, he chose his advisors.I would think Twitter will sue for specific performance, and they probably have a case.  And Musk is liable for their full market cap, and any trial would depend on a legal team that has a hard time writing a clear letter.  I think Musk is in trouble here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Chancery courts will compel performance of this transaction absent a showing of an material adverse advent.  Very, very high bar.  The buyer is a highly sophisticated investor and the grounds that he is alleging form the basis of the breach of contract were and are public information that has not materially changed nor been alleged to have materially changed since the signing of the merger agreement.  Moreover, and most critically, it is not being alleged that spam accounts have any substantial impact on the earnings of Twitter.  Thus, the courts will obligate Musk to buy the business as he agreed to in April."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For anyone thinking he can pay the 1B$ termination fee and walk away, it&#39;s not that simple.The 1B$ is a &#34;reverse breakup&#34; fee, and applies when an outside force (like SEC or financing) prevents the deal.  That 1B$ has nothing to do with any choices on either side, and is unlikely to factor into this process.At this point they&#39;re clearly going to trial, and it&#39;s not unlikely that the cost to Elon will be somewhere in the neighborhood of the difference between the fair current market value (~20B$?) and the purchase price (~44B$).My guess is it&#39;ll end up being ~10-15B$."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The utterly inefficient and overpriced Canadian telecoms exist only because we allow one specific behavior:1. A new local player comes to town, builds their own infrastructure (e.g. connects one building to fiber) and starts offering competitive service.2. Rogers/Shaw/Bell/Telus immediately offer better terms for the residents of that building.3. The competitor runs out of money and leaves.4. The telecoms revert to their usual pricing.This hurts competition, this hurts customers, this hurts long-term infrastructure resilience, but not a single politician ever comes close to even admitting the problem. I understand you cannot do it on the federal level where both major parties are on the telecoms&#39; payroll, but it could be a very low-hanging fruit for someone running for a municipal position to address. But nope, identity politics, words, feelings and fighting climate change with paper straws seem to be what the electorate wants instead. Sad."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"People in other countries probably don&#39;t understand just how powerful - and depended upon - the big telecoms are here in Canada.They have no presence outside the country - they are so bloated and inefficient they couldn&#39;t compete - but they are omnipresent here.There are lots of people who depend on Rogers for home Internet, home phone, mobile phone, TV, and home security, not to mention business services that consumers also depend on, like the payment networks that are down.Plus their media properties, which probably come in useful when the government starts to think about allowing more competition or decreasing the taxpayer money being funneled to them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I see a lot of people noting the lack of communication and updates from Rogers.To me it would be shocking if they were providing updates. Canada’s telecommunication monopolies are not known for their customer service and, even worse, they seem to have internal corporate cultures of entitlement and arrogance that drive an “F U” attitude in general when it comes to external communications and accountability. So you won’t see a post mortem. You won’t see timely updates. You certainly will never see some kind of status page!I’m sure Rogers will be forced to do a post-mortem for large commercial clients where contractually required, but I highly doubt we will hear a word from them about the cause of this or what was/is being done to rectify it. They probably have an ETA but feel no obligation to share it.Rogers isn’t alone. I would expect the same behaviour from Bell or Telus. Canada has serious issues when it comes to its big telco carriers and it represents major risk to the Canadian economy."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The first thing that pops into my mind is &#34;Abenomics&#34;:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abenomics&gt; IMF affirmed that Japan&#39;s nominal GDP contracted by $1.8 trillion during 2012–2015 while real GDP contracted at an annual rate of 6.8 percent[58] in the second quarter of 2014, after the Consumption Tax hike came into effect in April. This fall is the worst since the devastating earthquake and tsunami disaster[59][60] hit Japan in the first quarter of 2011 when the GDP shrank by an annualised 6.9 percent.So, his economic policy might have been as bad as an earthquake + tsunami.That said, he was not the only one supporting this policy, and nobody deserves to die for a mistake."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"By this point in humanity&#39;s development, their brains had developed the ability to automatically block the parts of reality screaming for their attention, results of an economic system based on coercive consumption. Attention grabbers bifurcated into subtle, nefarious actors intent on slipping past in-brain ad-blocking and the shouters, turning up the volume and animations to make ads impossible to not see. People were subtly crippled, partially blind, now. Yet it was, after all, the mind&#39;s defense mechanism against an increasingly hostile environment trying to rob it of its most precise resource: attention.That was, of course, until they banned psychic violence in the &#34;Goddamn, get out of my brain&#34; amendment in the late 21st century."</p>

You tell them the solution, and they tell you it should be documented. You tell them it is documented, and you even tell them where. They tell you it should be more prominent.I&#39;ve had this happen where the warning was in bright red, bold letters at top in a separate box that said &#34;WARNING!&#34; but even after I sent them the link telling them it was documented, they still didn&#39;t see it.I&#39;m sure this banner could improved.

One party playing requires another to find a given word — the name of town, river, state or empire — any word, in short, upon the motley and perplexed surface of the chart. A novice in the game generally seeks to embarrass his opponents by giving them the most minutely lettered names; but the adept selects such words as stretch, in large characters, from one end of the chart to the other. These, like the over-largely lettered signs and placards of the street, escape observation by dint of being excessively obvious; and here the physical oversight is precisely analogous with the moral inapprehension by which the intellect suffers to pass unnoticed those considerations which are too obtrusively and too palpably self-evident.’”—From “The Purloined Letter” (1845) by Edgar Allen Poe"</p>

According to sources from the defense ministry, he was employed by the Maritime Self-Defense Forces for ~3y until 2005. Weapon seems to be homemade.No updates on Abe&#39;s status since a 13:30 update from the local fire department. He&#39;s injured in chest- and neck areas, has internal bleeding and did not show vital signs.14:40: PM Kishida arrived at the PM residence by helicopter ~10minutes ago and is currently in discussions. A press conference is expected soon.14:46: Police: Suspect Yamagami says he was frustrated with what ex-PM Abe was doing and approached him with the intent of killing him.14:49: Live announcement from (a doubly understandably very sweaty and intermittently sobbing but surprisingly composed) PM Kishida: Abe is in critical condition. Hopes and prayers. Elections are ongoing. Unforgivable act. Doctors are working hard to save Abe. Not appropriate to address the political situation at this moment and I am not comfortable to do so. Cabinet members convening in Tokyo and work to be ready for any outcome. I do not have full information to be able to make any further detailed comments."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wrote Hacking Healthcare for O&#39;Reilly, created ClearHealth/HealthCloud open source EMR, managed health systems for 15+ years, blah, blah, blah.It is very good there is are the transparency regulations. It is worth briefly explaining some of the reasons why many facitilities are having a hard time complying. There are some bad actors, absolutely true. However &#34;Hanlons Razor&#34; -- never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity -- definitely applies.Many health systems are a lot more like &#34;medical malls&#34; than they are single monolithic enterprises. Lots of health systems use really, really old technology and also a lot of it from a company called &#34;Epic&#34;. Epic does what it wants, when it wants and there is basically nothing anyone can do about it. There is rarely one central consistent mechanism and source of truth for pricing data because it gets generated from a complex web of different entities, systems, and processes. Herding all those cats is why it can take a health system a long time to comply. And also why a fine of even a million dollars can be small potatos vs the cost of actually complying in a timely manner.Just one facet, MUMPS is a widely used technology which you probably haven&#39;t heard of and which very few technologists understand. Lots of people are struggling to create new code to meet the new regulations using 1970s era technology including MUMPS.Another, a lot of health systems have been around a really long time. The insurers they work with also, (since the 1960s at least). They have Electronic Data Interchange EDI relationships built on the standard called 837. Business logic that surrounds pricing and billing is often buried in 50 years of tech debt. Everyone is deathly afraid of making too many changes too fast because when those systems break the money stops flowing and a health system will literally go insolvent. People still have hard physical lines connected to Medicare mainframes.This is a similar situation to other regulated industries like banking, airlines, etc. Modernization is hard, time consuming and very expensive. These regulations are a good driver for all that, but it takes time. Having been in some of these boardrooms there is not typically a cartel of evil executives figuring out how to screw patients. A lot of the time it is a group of relatively normal people trying to hold up a technological and business process house of cards with chewing gum, paper clips and hope.Disclaimer: I have been involved with the development of some of the fee schedules and health systems mentioned/criticized."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When High Deductible Insurance was introduced the supposed concept was to &#34;give employees a stake in their costs, and therefore lower them for both employer and employee.&#34;However, even today doing so is very challenging, and before laws like this it was essentially impossible. There&#39;s no way to shop around American healthcare, with the system itself working against you at every turn (e.g. doctors prescribing named brand, and you not be allowed to switch back to generic without another $100+ appointment).You can try calling and getting quotes, but they&#39;ll just waste a bunch of time and then give you a RANGE with no assurances. Even getting the quote requires your doctor to write up the entire work-order, which itself can get pushback, and or cost money.Then you have random things like for-profit life flights, which are automatic bankruptcy machines. Imagine one minute driving down the road, then suddenly waking up in a hospital, and then getting billed $80K for just the trip to get there let alone your hospital treatment or recovery. And insurance doesn&#39;t cover it.Aside but all ambulances around me are &#34;out of network&#34; and don&#39;t work with insurance at all. So I guess I should shop around by moving cities..?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting to read that only 33%-50% of hospitals comply with the law and post their prices.  If there&#39;s one thing this country needs to do it&#39;s demand transparency everywhere.Especially our government.  Spending.  Salaries.  It all needs to be public."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A better formulation of DRY is SPOT (Single Point Of Truth). Definitions (code, data) that represent the same “truth”, i.e. when one changes all have to change to represent a consistent truth, should be reduced to a single definition.  For example, if there is a rule that pizzas need at least one topping, there should only be a single place where that condition is expressed, so that when the rule changes, it isn’t just changed in one place but not the others. Another example is when fixing a bug, you don’t want to have to fix it in multiple places (or, more likely, neglect to fix it in the other places)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Every time I read an article like this, &#34;why &lt;often cited best practice&gt; is overrated&#34;, I think, yeah you are right in theory. But most places I have worked, these best practices were not overused, but underused. If you have the problem that your coworkers create unneccessary abstractions, I envy you, because I have so often had the opposite problem. Maybe this is not the case if you work in a great software development team. But if you work somewhere where they do software development on the side (science, hardware, etc..) it is the main issue.People not able to factor out functions or structure their code in a readable way. Variables are called v1, v2, v3. Unit testing seen as a waste of time. CI seen as a fun toy. They lack the experience to even notice the difference.Maybe I&#39;m becoming a curmudgeon, but I think many people would be well served by just googling &#34;&lt;my programming language&gt; best practices&#34;, learning the acronyms like DRY, and just following them. And when you have gained some experience, sure, then you should question the wisdom and not follow it blindly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;  Instead of our code being architected around the concept of how pizzas are made in the abstract, its architecture is tightly coupled to the specific needs of these two pizzas that we happened to be dealing with. The chance that we will be putting this code back the way it was is extremely high.Mistake 1: Switch from DRY to premature optimization.&gt; You might think that legit reasonable developers but would not actually do something like this and would instead go back to the existing invocations and modify them to get a nice solution, but I&#39;ve seen this happen all over the place.Mistake 2: Assumption of incompetence to support your argument.&gt; . As soon as we start the thought process of thinking how to avoid a copy paste and refactor instead, we are losing the complexity battle.Mistake 3: Strawman argument. DRY does NOT lead to over-complicating things.
Overcomplicating things leads to overcomplicating things.Now, i wasted 5 minutes, so you can waste some more to reply to this comment, instead of completely ignoring this dumb random blog post."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The maritime coverage map shows coastal coverage around countries with inland coverage right now, i.e. they are bouncing the connection via one of their satellites to a nearby groundstation.Starting in Q4/2022 they want to cover mid-latitudes around the globe. That might mean that they plan to enable inter-satellite links then? (This is a bit surprising - on one hand, this step extends coverage towards higher and lower latitudes but on the other hand not as much as they already have inland-coverage (cf. Brazil). It also extends longitudinally around all of the globe?).Coverage above mid-latitudes requires satellites in polar orbits to join the network. (Their non-polar orbits have an inclination of 53° which means that satellites go no further north or south than that (plus a bit whatever their range is)).https://api.starlink.com/public-files/maritime-coverage-map...."</p>

  - Godspeed You! Black Emperor: F♯ A♯ ∞ (one of my favourite albums. listen with your best headphones. HD650s are good)
  - Aphex Twin: Selected Ambient Works Volume II

  - Boards of Canada - Music Has the Right to Children
  - Sun O))): Black One (extremely experimental doom metal. the musicality of it is questionable at times but it&#39;s fantastic to study to)
  - Sleep: Jerusalem (occasional vocals but trust me they&#39;re not distracting)
  - Tim Hecker: Harmony in Ultraviolet
  - Bill Evans: Sunday at the Village Vanguard

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Looks very nice.One thing I noticed is you are using server sent events for subscriptions.  SSE have a lot of nice properties but do have one nasty limitation (from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent...):&#34;Warning: When not used over HTTP/2, SSE suffers from a limitation to the maximum number of open connections, which can be especially painful when opening multiple tabs, as the limit is per browser and is set to a very low number (6). The issue has been marked as &#34;Won&#39;t fix&#34; in Chrome and Firefox. This limit is per browser + domain, which means that you can open 6 SSE connections across all of the tabs to www.example1.com and another 6 SSE connections to www.example2.com (per Stackoverflow). When using HTTP/2, the maximum number of simultaneous HTTP streams is negotiated between the server and the client (defaults to 100).&#34;This can lead to some weird bug reports from users."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Roblox is horrendous. It is as dangerous as any dark corner of the Internet, except that it appears child-friendly to parents. It _seems_ to have controls, and _seems_ to restrict bad behaviour, but it does not, and cannot. My daughter was roped into an online paedophile ring when she was 12. The initial contacts and grooming were made through Roblox... almost right under our noses. Every time we, as parents, looked at what she was doing, it seemed okay. We could have dug deeper, but did not. Luckily we caught it before it progressed too far, but some damage was done.Wherever you can, tell parents to flat-out block Roblox.Edit: Because people are asking how it works.Roblox is a lot about bragging rights for individuals. You gain skins, trade for rare items, buy Robux for real money that can be used to buy items. Players flock around those that that have rare or expensive items. My daughter had a &#34;super super happy face&#34;. I just googled, and it is current selling for $350. It makes them feel wanted and important. So just like fornite and skins in other games.The groomers feed the celebrity, sense of community and so on to engage in chat. It starts as in-game chat, which you can never see the history of, before moving to DMs. The chat has tricks to get around removed words, so they all communicate in some sort of code that they all pick up along the way. Then they are able to divert them to other platforms where there are fewer controls. My daughter was made to create instagram account and an a porn one. Then they follow up on other platform calls (or phone calls) and follow the usual grooming techniques.The trick is to identify the marks by how they behave in the game, and in the more popular, and social ones, I think that it is quite easy (in retrospect)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like Hearthstone is a good example of the maximum amount of communication two strangers can have on the Internet.  You can choose 6 pre-made things to say to your opponent; Thanks, Well Played, Greeting, Wow, Oops, Threaten.  This might be too much; I have definitely seen people get mad from their opponent using the voice lines too much.My thought is that this significantly reduces the richness of the in-game interactions (implies less engagement, implies less revenue), but doesn&#39;t need moderators to keep the game from being used for illegal sexual encounters, which is nice if your game targets kids."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the challenges here is that the incentives are misaligned.  It&#39;s well-understood in the cash-shop games industry that most of the revenue comes from &#34;whales&#34;, users that buy large quantities.  In a game targeted at children, who themselves don&#39;t have income/credit cards, it&#39;s unlikely that the &#34;whales&#34; are in the target demographic.  Rather, it is likely most of the &#34;whales&#34; are adults who are spending large in order to use the in-game currency to exploit interactions with others.Not only was this predictable, it seems nearly by design.  I don&#39;t see how Roblox can ever fix this without fundamentally changing their business model.  Their business model is essentially structured to enable commercial sexual exploitation of children over mobile platforms.On my own network I used various means to make it impossible for anyone to use Roblox, music.ly, TikTok, et al.  Services that are targeted specifically at children but provide a pathway for semi-anonymous communication are already ripe for exploitation by bad actors, the microtransactions aspect of Roblox just makes it even worse.It&#39;s ironic, but platforms intended for adults tend to be safer for children, because they don&#39;t concentrate bad actors in the same way."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Part of taking on SOC 2 is also choosing whether you want your attitude to be &#34;Let&#39;s do the minimum to get past the audit&#34; and &#34;Let&#39;s take this framework, and figure out where we can learn from it.&#34;The post mentions background checks. On the one hand, I understand there&#39;s a real issue with these. On the other, if my PAAS isn&#39;t ensuring repeat offender fraudsters don&#39;t have access to sensitive data, that&#39;s possibly an area of concern. Hopefully the things they took from the other mentioned company do increase due diligence in vetting employees who have access to sensitive/regulated information.Use it as a framework to actually think about BCP, DRP, etc, etc, and it won&#39;t be a total waste of time.Edit:
Also adding I bring up background checks as an example of learning from vetted practices, rather than trying to attack the decisions of fly. I respect this article, especially where it&#39;s easy for people on the internet to criticize decisions, when the reality is security is a series of tradeoffs, and to function as a business means having imperfect processes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This content marketing is so good I don’t even know if I’d call it marketing: it is legit educational with a weak (in a good way) “throw some money at us” CTA. Bravo."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Careful, now. “Getting SOC2-certified” isn&#39;t the same as “doing the engineering work to get SOC2-certified”. *Do the engineering now. As early as you can. The work, and particularly its up-front costs, scale with the size of your team.*Emphasis mine.I&#39;ve uttered this phrase or something like it so many times that I want to get this line fire etched onto a large, thick and sturdy block of wood and go back in time to several jobs where I and my cohorts got stuck with shoring up SOC2 tasks and smack my former execs with it.Half joking but the pain and trauma from past SOC2 audits due to exactly this is real."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"De-nuclearization of other European countries is a long-held goal of the German environmentalist movement and the Green party. It&#39;s understandable that France doesn&#39;t want to go with that, as they don&#39;t want to be forced down the same ruinous path we&#39;re currently on here in Germany. And honestly, good for them.It&#39;s just sad to see how little actual science is respected in Germany. I did my PhD at the French nuclear energy agency and my French colleagues would always be puzzled when I talked about German energy policies and our anti-nuclear sentiment. But here in Germany the Green party will probably never reverse it&#39;s stance on nuclear energy, as their rise to popularity was strongly fueled by the anti-nuclear movement from the 80s and it&#39;s the one thing they can&#39;t abandon without losing a large number of followers.I partially blame the highly ideological stance on the way people rise to power in politics and administration in Germany. In France, top positions in the administration are usually filled by people that are technically excellent and have gone through the system of grandes écoles (ENS, ENA, X, ...), whereas in Germany most people rise through social engineering and party politics and most top positions in the administration are filled by people with law degrees that don&#39;t have a clue about technology. In my opinion that&#39;s also a reason why we completely fail in everything regarding digitalization, lawyers are simply not good technical problem solvers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You know how I know environmentalists are just dragging their feet on nuclear for ideological reasons?When we talk about a storage facility for nuclear waste, a scenario they insist you prepare for: if human civilization completely collapses to the point that any of the currently spoken languages on earth are no longer able to be read how to we keep the, whatever comes after us, from busting up the concrete and digging down deep into the earth and playing with it. That&#39;s the last gasp of someone out of obstructionist ideas. I&#39;ve had these people tell me that launching the waste into the sun would be dangerous for the sun, they aren&#39;t serious and need to be ignored.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_nuclear_waste_warn..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"About time. Nuclear is hardly an environmental risk even compared to the &#34;cleaner&#34; fossil fuels like gas.Hopefully this will allow the EU to return to competitive reactors designs instead of leaving China to pull humanities weight on that front.Though tbh I wouldn&#39;t be sad if we bought Chinese reactors until we are back up to speed, having Chinese nuclear &gt; no nuclear. Everyone bitching about China stealing IP finally have something to steal back."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This kind of highlights a subtle interactive design or user experience component of the Trolley problem.Part of the Trolley Problem is that the choice is between an action or inaction.  But these problems, or the first one at least, have two buttons.So you&#39;re making a choice.  Yeah, some might argue it&#39;s a technicality.  But what if you put the Do Nothing choice on a timer?What if you made it an asynchronous &#34;Problem of the Day&#34;.  No action by the end of the day triggers Do Nothing, etc.Lots of cool, interesting design choices.  There&#39;s an unstated subtle ultimatum hidde. in these problems, but still cool.Sorry, geeking out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Level 20 was weird. It was a choice between letting a trolley run as normal (&#34;emits CO2, kills 3 people in accidents over 30 years&#34;) or running it into a brick wall and decommissioning it. For some reason more people picked the latter. So, they just dislike public transit? What about the emissions and death rate when everyone switches to cars instead?Goes to show how easily the context and exact wording of a question can sway people&#39;s opinions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Let&#39;s not let the perfect be the enemy of the good.This is a huge step forward for iPhone users. Look, I get it. From the typical HN perspective, this potentially looks like a lot of hype. But many of you aren&#39;t looking at from a high level.In the world we are now living in; even what&#39;s happening in the United States right now, being able to protect yourself from well-funded, determined attackers for the average person couldn&#39;t come at a better time.There&#39;s a huge gap between Fortune 500 executives, government officials, etc. and regular people in terms of the resources available to them to prevent state-sponsored attackers. It doesn&#39;t take much these days to go from a nobody to being on somebody&#39;s radar.If you&#39;re a woman seeking an abortion in a state where it&#39;s illegal or severely restricted, you could be the target of malware from your local or state government or law enforcement. In Texas, you can sue anyone who aids and abets a woman who attempts to get an abortion for $10,000, which is enough to get someone to trick someone into installing malware on a phone.No, it&#39;s not China or Russia coming for you but it doesn&#39;t take much to ruin someone&#39;s life.I don&#39;t think this is virtue signaling or marketing hype by Apple; if anything, this is right in alignment with the stance they&#39;ve had on privacy for years. Even for a company the size of Apple, putting up $10 million to fund organizations that investigate, expose, and prevent highly targeted cyberattacks isn&#39;t pocket change.At the end of the day, this is all good news for user privacy and security going forward. I also suspect if I lockdown my iPhone, my other compatible devices using the same Apple ID will also lockdown. No IT department required."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am so excited about this news. I understand that some people are pessimistic, and view it as a &#34;giving up&#34; on complete security against nation-states. I think that&#39;s the wrong way to analyze the situation.The dream I have is someone making a phone that is purpose-built to be secure against state actors. Unfortunately, this makes very little economic sense, and probably won&#39;t happen (maybe if some rich person started a foundation or something?). The phone would need to have pretty restricted functionality and would not be generally appealing to mass market consumers.As it stands, securing a mass market modern smartphone, even from just remote attacks, is just intractable. We should not bury our heads in the sand and wishfully think that if they just spend a little more money, close a few more bugs, and make the sandboxing a little better, somehow iOS 16 or Android 13 will finally be completely secure against state actors. The set of features being shipped will grow fast enough that security mitigations will not someday &#39;catch up&#39;.This is the next best thing! The more we can give users the freedom to lock down their devices, the more the vision of an actual solution comes into view. This is the first step towards perhaps our only hope of solving this someday - applying formal methods and lots of public scrutiny to a small &#39;trusted code base&#39;, and finally telling NSO group to fuck off.Even this dream may not pan out, but at least we can have hope."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"With this announcement, Apple are saying &#34;we will protect you from state actors&#34;, which is a role usually performed by states. Apple is saying &#34;we operate at the same level as nation states; we are a nation-state level entity operating in the &#34;digital world&#34;: It&#39;s a flag-raise.It&#39;s the first such flag-raise I&#39;ve seen. Security researchers talk about protections from state actors all the time, and there are tools which support that... but this is the first public announcement, and tool, from a corporation with more spare, unrestricted capital than many countries. It comes at a time when multiple nation states are competing for energy and food security; and Apple are throwing up a flag for a security-security fight (or maybe data-security). This is not just handy tech, it&#39;s full-on cultural zeitgeist stuff. Amazing."</p>

LinkedIn is an absolute godsend for bad guys, allowing easy targeting of everyone in the company with spear phishing emails and texts. I know many security professionals no longer use their real name, and don&#39;t list the real name of their company, because they know it&#39;s such a great hacking vector. Not sure what/whether LinkedIn can do anything about this.2. I wish there were more information about what the vulnerability was in the PDF in the first place. I think a lot of people would be wary of downloading a PDF from a stranger, but not from someone who you had multiple interview rounds with and who offered you a job."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve got to say, this is an incredibly cyberpunk article.&gt; Ronin, the Ethereum-linked sidechain that underpins play-to-earn game Axie Infinity, lost $540 million in crypto to an exploit in March. While the US government later tied the incident to North Korean hacking group Lazarus, full details of how the exploit was carried out have not been disclosed.It&#39;s not in William Gibson&#39;s style, sounds more like Bruce Sterling&#39;s.&gt; Axie Infinity was huge. At its peak, workers in Southeast Asia were even able to earn a living through the play-to-earn game. It boasted 2.7 million daily active users and $214 million in weekly trading volume for its in-game NFTs in November last year — although both numbers have since plummeted.&gt; Earlier this year, staff at Axie Infinity developer Sky Mavis were approached by people purporting to represent the fake company and encouraged to apply for jobs, according to the people familiar with the matter. One source added that the approaches were made through the professional networking site LinkedIn.Also gives me Charles Stross vibes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those that don&#39;t want to read the whole thing, (supposedly) the attackers reached out on linkedin to a bunch of employees asking them to apply to a fake company. One of them did it, went through a bunch of fake interviews, and then got a fake offer, in the form of a PDF.They opened the PDF and that installed a keylogger on their system (it doesn&#39;t explain how).The attackers then used that engineer&#39;s credentials to take over 4 of the 9 validators on the blockchain which they then used for their heist."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is the unfortunate reality of India; the government/police don&#39;t need to actually go to court. It can harass companies and executives by simply threatening to / actually carrying out unnecessary &#39;raids&#39; through the tax department.The usual process is for the a bunch of policemen and beareaucrats to just show up unannounced; seal the office so that no one can enter or leave, and seize computers / phones, files and demand random stuff like invoices for $10 purchases from three years ago and so on. This can happen regularly until all business basically comes to a halt (unless the company complies with whatever the government wants). [1]The next step is to threaten arrests and actually carry out some arrests on trumped up charge, and you can wait forever until trial (unless you comply with what the government wants). The trials usually result in acquittal after several years but the process is the punishment. The media in the meanwhile is happy to go along with the official version (that the company is question is allegedly employing shady accounting practices).The next stage is painting the company as &#39;anti national&#39;, arrange for a few mobs to harrass folks / attempt lynchings and finally actually &#39;dissappear&#39;/kill people (this last step is usually reserved for judges/writers etc since others usually comply before this step)[1]: https://www.economist.com/asia/2021/10/02/indias-government-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Rule of law is a joke in India.Center has central agencies and each states has their own police department. 
So whenever there is a noticeable criticism from someone centre or state govt will send their police/agency your way. You will be detained, put through the worst conditions and false charges will be filed. Most of these charges don&#39;t hold in higher courts but the damage is done. You will suffer, a lot. 
You will not dare to speak up again.This is even so comical, sometimes centre will send agencies against another party politicians in power in a state they are not in power, and state will send police for local politicians from centre party.

The combination of single core CPU and graphics performance, device thinness, battery life in this laptop is unmatched.It’s funny how Apple came back from the worst the Mac has ever been to the best in a span of few years. Johnny I’ve doesn’t dictate things around Apple anymore but the silicone chips team now does."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I spent an embarrassing amount on a lackluster early 2019 MBP. It&#39;s fine as a general purpose laptop but is just a little too slow for serious dev work, a little too heavy as the main travel laptop, battery life a little too short for my liking.I got an M1 for my work laptop maybe 4 months ago and it might honestly be the best laptop I&#39;ve ever used."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m sorry if this doesn&#39;t add anything to the discussion, but one of MKBHD&#39;s latest reviews discusses the differences between the MacBook Pro 13 and this new MacBook Air. The video does a great job of shining a light on all of the tradeoffs between the two devices.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSdKnNj7ozkThis little device is a beast!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"More big companies that use open source should do this or something similar. The dividends to security, developer productivity, etc are probably extremely high, particularly for a company with hundreds or thousands of engineers already. It&#39;s such an efficient use of money to give it to the people who already have the expertise to do the work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is such great news for ruby. Here’s hoping with these resources rubygems and bundler can add improved support for signature verification. Rubygems supports gem signing but without a good scheme for trust, key rotation, etc it is not particularly usable.  Sprucing this aspect of the ecosystem up would go a long way towards allowing ruby to maintain its historical role at the vanguard of language specific package management.Another thing I would love to see is the ability to incorporate a signed attestation that a gem was built from a given signed commit. A common dirty trick by supply-chain blackhats is to publish a gem which contains code other than that of the corresponding tag in source control.  Given that rubygems has no means to browse package contents other than downloading and extracting the tarballs for manual inspection this means that people typically reference changelog or diff links on source control hosts, despite the fact that those diffs will only be accurate for gems published by good-faith actors following platform norms.There are a number of ways to fix this and I sure hope one of them gets implemented."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is great.Lately I&#39;ve been learning to play traditional Irish music. Often I&#39;ll want to hear as many versions of a tune as I can; don&#39;t care if it&#39;s studio musicians, a session at a bar, or a few mates in their kitchen, as long as it includes the specified tune.What will often happen if I search, for example, &#34;Monaghan Jig,&#34; is that I&#39;ll get a few results from famous albums and professional YouTube content creators, then a bunch of other jigs, The Hag At The Churn, Lark in The Morning etc. and they&#39;ll drown out videos with the actual jig I want.After that I have to experiment with variations like, &#34;Monaghan Jig concertina,&#34; &#34;Monaghan Jig pub session&#34; etc to find the other videos YouTube&#39;s search had dismissed for me that indeed included &#34;Monaghan Jig&#34; in both the title and the content.With this operator I can hopefully save myself a lot of guesswork and frustration."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m suprised to see that some say Youtube&#39;s search is bad. I often find myself wishing that that I could get a youtube level of accuracy in my Google searches. I don&#39;t usually scroll to find the result I&#39;m looking for. I tend to find the big view and small view videos with the same level ease.*Also a premium subscriber. Youtube in many ways is a necessary part of this version of the internet experience and I detest having to sit through all the ads...if I have to pay $10/month seems fair to me. Just my 02 cents."</p>

And that&#39;s the kind of tip everyone here is applauding. I would like to say webdesign is in a sorry state nowawadays, except it was also that way 20 years ago.

The grants for the science of ecosystem stewardship are in the 10k-50k$ range.Over the past few years, something killed over 5 billion giant starfish and “science” has no idea what did it.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s several very good provisions in this legislation (3rd party payment processors, non-preferential treatment for 1st party apps), there are several that have a mix of upsides and downsides (sideloading is one--I personally like knowing that Facebook can&#39;t ask people to sideload some privacy destroying crap on iOS).Then there&#39;s:- Allow developers to integrate their apps and digital services directly with those belonging to a gatekeeper. This includes making messaging, voice-calling, and video-calling services interoperable with third-party services upon request.- Give developers access to any hardware feature, such as &#34;near-field communication technology, secure elements and processors, authentication mechanisms, and the software used to control those technologies.&#34;Apps will use near-field communication technology and other mechanisms to track us (consider how many device related APIs have restrictions in web browsers for just this reason), and I think it&#39;s credible that the interoperability requirements are going to be used to smash end-to-end encrypted messaging. You can have a decentralized end to end encrypted protocol. Can you retrofit every existing messaging service to use it in the short-term? Probably not.As an end user, the things that give developers maximum freedom are not necessarily the things that let me use my device with maximum freedom. I support people who want a FOSS device that is in no way locked down. I just don&#39;t want that, because I don&#39;t want to play systems administrator for an always on tracker in my pocket."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is huge. Forcing Apple to allow app side-loading, third-party payments, etc is going to wrest away control of the iOS ecosystem (and eat pretty heavily into their revenues [1][1] https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/10/apple-implies-it-generated-r...I hope some of these regulations spill over into the U.S. and the rest of the world."</p>

Sad that being in UK probably means we&#39;ll ignore it because &#34;Brexit.&#34; I got a text the other day telling me that, since we&#39;ve left the EU, roaming charges are back. Hurray!Without making this about politics, this is a great step forward. Still unsure how Apple &amp; co. will make their proprietary video and messaging platforms &#34;interoperable&#34;.

I&#39;m not naive enough to believe I wasn&#39;t being recorded previously, but I can&#39;t help but find this trend of sticking a camera directly in my face whenever I&#39;m trying to make a purchase extremely insulting and violating to my sense of privacy. Now after watching this I have almost no doubt that facial recognition software is installed on these systems.I&#39;ve spoken to other people about the rudeness of this but most people seem to think it&#39;s fine. Perhaps I&#39;m just weird and more bothered about this stuff than most people.

The speaker argues that even though models are known to be inaccurate, companies like tinder or insurance companies might still use the model outputs since they have nothing better. 
Therefore, in some future (or already today?) you can suffer from bad model predictions because you are &#34;not normal enough&#34; for the model to make good predictions, and might therefore receive a wrong predicted life expectancy and higher insurance bills."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Making accurate calculations of data center cost is of course complicated and rarely manages to take everything into account, but the common knowledge I’ve heard is that there comes a point when a company is so large that going on-prem is what actually saves them a lot of money.If FedEx is not large enough to be one of those companies, how large do you actually have to be? Or has cloud pricing changed to the point where this is no longer true, and even huge corporations can save money in moving away from their own premises?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Its weird to have companies say they&#39;re moving from Mainframes to the Cloud.The Mainframe is a sort of cloud, each one has usually double the spare capacity and you call IBM to unlock it.The cost of running a Mainframe is measured in terms of MIPS based on amount of compute used and there&#39;s compute reserved for offloading things like JITs (zAAPS). Essentially a version of cloud compute costs.I can understand if you&#39;re locked into COBOL with EBCDIC and can&#39;t find talent, but Z runs freaking Ubuntu now! I know IBM works furiously on modern ecosystem support.Not shill for IBM, but what exactly is it that they&#39;re expecting to be so different from their cloud migrations? Or is everyone here caught up in the &#34;Mainframe old&#34; falsehood."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Academics are not the place to go to make useful novel contributions, there are too many confounding factors.  First, the university owns whatever IP you come up with, and will happily exclusively license that IP to entities with no interest in developing it.  Monopolistic corporate power centers aren&#39;t known for fostering novel competition to their established businesses.  This is why it took so long - and serious capital - to get something like Tesla going, as the likes of Toyota, Ford, GM etc. were closely tied to Exxon, Chevron etc. via their investors, and had no interest in developing electric cars.Any kind of applied research in the US academic sector these days is best understood as corporate R &amp; D for established interests in pharmaceuticals, technology, industrial chemistry, etc.  You&#39;re certainly not free to do blue-skies renewable energy research (budgets for that are still miniscule at best, and have been since the 1980s), for example.  The job description has become indistinguishable from that of in-house corporate researcher - narrowly defined assigned problems are what you get to work on, and &#39;academic freedom to pursue the research wherever it leads&#39; is a quaint myth.The obvious fix is to eliminate exclusive licensing of academic IP (i.e. repeal the 1980s Bayh-Dole Act), which would force corporations to spend capital on their own private R &amp; D divisions if the wanted exclusivity, and simply make any university-held patented discovery available to any entrepreneur who wanted to develop it for a small flat fee.Until then the author is 100% correct about entrepreneurship being the only way out of the trap."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Although this article is well-written, I&#39;m not convinced that he was &#34;lost,&#34; or that he didn&#39;t really like math, based only on a few anecdotal stories. Furthermore, the article says that &#34;he dropped out of high school to become a poet,&#34; but please note that, a number of students drop out of high school in South Korea to fully focus on the college entrance exam, in hopes of getting into better universities. This is not uncommon at all. And sure enough, he got accepted into the best university in South Korea, majoring in astronomy and physics. One of his classes was even taught by a Fields Medalist. If this is his definition of &#34;being lost,&#34; I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ll ever be found."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This passage caught my attention:He proceeds just as deliberately when doing mathematics. Wang was shocked when he first witnessed it. “I have this math competition experience, that as a mathematician you have to be clever, you have to be fast,” he said. “But June is the opposite. … If you talk to him for five minutes about some calculus problem, you’d think this guy wouldn’t pass a qualifying exam. He’s very slow.” So slow, in fact, that at first Wang thought they were wasting a lot of time on easy problems they already understood. But then he realized that Huh was learning even seemingly simple concepts in a much deeper way — and in precisely the way that would later prove useful.Having gone through the American education system, I felt like I was in a factory being evaluated as a potential end product. Steamroll through as much material as quickly as possible. Optimize behavioral patterns for the next performance metric. Rinse and repeat. Is this really the best system we can come up with? Can the pace of mathematical and scientific advancement be optimized by steamrollers? I wonder how much potential we&#39;ve missed as a society because the education system has been trying to force everyone through the same hole, and destroying intellectual curiosity in the process.Personally, my experience with this educational system turned me off from &#34;math.&#34; It was only much later in life when I learnt that the mindless algorithms that I had to personally execute for years on end to get into university could barely be considered math at all. Only then could I begin to appreciate how elegant real math could be. And I doubt I&#39;m alone in my experience."</p>

me. I relate to what he describes as &#34;finding things&#34;. Those things

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The nationalization of news and politics in a country of 330 million people is toxic. We’re one country but we don’t share a single set of values. Even the notion of “blue America” and “red America” is misleading. What would be unremarkable in San Francisco would raise eyebrows in Baltimore.I noticed this acutely living in Atlanta for the better part of a decade. Politics was not a big deal when I lived there. Atlanta was “blue” and the rest of the state was “red” but politics was forward looking and productive. The mayor when I was there, Shirley Franklin, was truly put the city above partisanship. A Democrat, she endorsed Mary Norwood, an independent, in 2017, because the Democratic candidate was a protege of a mayor she believed to have been corrupt: https://www.wabe.org/former-atlanta-mayor-shirley-franklin-e.... She waved aside criticism suggesting that she (a Black woman) should have endorsed the Black Democratic candidate instead of Norwood, a white woman.Then in 2018 all hell broke loose when Georgia’s governor’s race became the subject of national attention. The state became a battleground in a proxy war between New York and Mississippi. Racialist rhetoric reached a fever pitch in the New York Times and Washington Post (but notably, the Atlanta Journal Constitution was far more prudent). They made Georgia out to be an unreformed Confederate backwater, instead of a state that’s the destination for huge numbers of Black residents leaving California, Illinois, and New York, attracted by plentiful jobs, low taxes, and an excellent public university system. The national media completely misrepresented Georgia and the people in it to the rest of the country."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Axios is expanding into local news coverage.  This is their PR and wow the bullet point approach sometimes really just doesn&#39;t do it for me.For a more involved take of the underlying topic, consider _News for the Rich, White, and Blue_ by Nikki Usher.
http://cup.columbia.edu/book/news-for-the-rich-white-and-blu...I don&#39;t agree with all of Usher&#39;s takeaways but there&#39;s a lot of good stuff in there. And as to the headline – yeah, sure, the &#34;local news crisis&#34; is partly causative in the polarization sure but lazy and biased coverage can compound all sorts of nasty dynamics.While I&#39;m here, Mark Lamont-Hill and Todd Brewster&#39;s _Seen and Unseen_ would be my pick for a recent media read. Lots of great history, recent and less so, as well as analysis:

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not a word about why media antitrust is important... even though the article casually mentions that &#34;Newspapers continue to be consolidated by hedge funds and private investment firms that believe they can wring more profits from the papers through synergies as the industry declines.&#34;&gt; &#34;Axios is owned by Axios Media, whose investors include Glade Brook Capital Partners, Lerer Hippeau Ventures, Greycroft, and NBC News. NBC doubles up as Axios’ media partner.&#34;https://marketrealist.com/p/who-owns-axios/Not only that, people employed by today&#39;s media conglomerates are increasingly drawn from the &#39;wealthy liberal coastal elite&#39; sector and are typically filtered through an unpaid internship process before getting hired, leading to non-representative &#39;journalists&#39;, which is probably doing as much damage (i.e pushing the populist perception of news media as a symbol of out-of-touch elitism) as the corporate consolidation is.Another side effect of this trend is the death of investigative journalism, which generally upsets the state and corporate power centers who are increasingly joined  at the hip.  For example, the last Washington Post investigative series of note was &#34;Top Secret America&#34; from about a decade ago, and now that Jeff Bezos owns the paper and AWS is actively seeking CIA and NSA contracts, forget about anything else like that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Doesn&#39;t look like the author knows what he is talking about. His point about early stage startup should not use K8S is fine. But the next advice about not using a different language for frontend and backend is wrong. I think the most appropriate advice is to choose a stack which the founding team is most familiar with. If that means RoR then RoR is fine. If it means PHP then PHP is fine too. Another option is to use a technology which is best suited for the product your are trying to build. For example, if you are building a managed cloud service, then building on top of K8S, or FireCracker or Nomad can be a good choice. But then it means you need to learn the tech being used inside out.Also he talks about all of this and then gives example of WhatsApp at the end. WhatsApp chose Erlang for the backend and their front end was written in Java and Objective-C. They could have chosen Java for backend to keep frontend language same but they didn&#39;t. They used Erlang because they based their architecture on Ejabberd which was open source and was built with Erlang. Also WhatsApp managed all their servers by themselves and didn&#39;t even move to managed cloud services when they became available. They were self hosting till FB acquired them and moved them to FB data centres later on (Source: http://highscalability.com/blog/2014/2/26/the-whatsapp-archi...)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I agree entirely.I like to call what the author is referring to as, &#34;What-If Engineering&#34;. It&#39;s the science of thinking you&#39;ll be Google next week, so you build for that level of scale today. It involves picking extremely complicated, expensive (both in compute and skilled labour) technologies to deploy a Rails app that has two features. And it all boils down to, &#34;But what if...&#34; pre-optimising.It happens at all levels.At the individual unit level: &#34;I&#39;ll make these four lines of code a function in case I need to call it more than once later on - you know, what if that&#39;s needed?&#34;It also happens at the database level: &#34;What if we need to change the schema later on? Do we really want to be restricted to a hard schema in MySQL? Let&#39;s use MongoDB&#34;.What&#39;s even worse, is Helm and the likes make it possible to spin up these kinds of solutions in a heart beat. And, as witnessed and evidenced by several comments below, developers think that&#39;s that... all done. It&#39;s a perfect solution. It won&#39;t fail because K8s will manage it. Oh boy.Start with a monolith on two VMs and a load balancer. Chips and networks are cheaper than labour, and right now, anyone with K8s experience is demanding $150k + 10% Superannuation here in Australia... minimum!https://martinfowler.com/bliki/MonolithFirst.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I lean conservative in my tech choices but I just don&#39;t see the big issue with Kubernetes. If you use a managed service like GKE it is really a breeze. I have seen teams with no prior experience set up simple deployments in a day or two and operate them without issues. Sure, it is often better to avoid the &#34;inner platform&#34; of K8s and run your application using a container service + managed SQL offering. But the difference isn&#39;t huge and the IaC ends up being about as complex as the K8s YAML. For setting up things like background jobs, cron jobs, managed certificates and so on I haven&#39;t found K8s less convenient than using whatever infrastructure alternatives are provided by cloud vendors.The main issue I have seen in startups is premature architecture complexity. Lambda soup, multiple databases, self-managed message brokers, unnecessary caching, microservices etc. Whether you use K8s or not, architectural complexity will bite your head off at small scales. K8s is an enabler for overly complicated architectures but it is not problematic with simple ones.&gt;Did users ask for this?Not an argument. Users don&#39;t ask for implementation details. They don&#39;t ask us to use Git or build automation or React. But if you always opt for less sophisticated workflows and technologies in the name of &#34;just getting stuff done right now&#34; you will end up bogged down really quickly. As in, weeks or months. I&#39;ve worked with teams who wanted to email source archives around because Git was &#34;too complicated.&#34; At some point you have to make the call of what is and isn&#39;t worth it. And that depends on the product, the team, projected future decisions and so on."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have witnessed something quite similar. During the flash-floods in 2021 in Germany, locals in the Ahr region absolutely rose to the occasion. Farmers were evacuating people in head-high water with their tractors during the night, local restaurants were already providing hot food and water the next morning wherever they could reach, pharmacies were loading whatever they had available on ATVs to somehow get much-needed medicine down precarious mudpaths. Local construction companies were already clearing rubble and building emergency bridges out of it. One Excavator was just basically standing in the middle of the river and ferrying people and rescue partys across. The local racetrack basically just organized everything while politicians were still playing the blame game. When our local firebrigade was officially pulled back from active duty because we lost one of ours during rescue operations in the first day, basically everyone just went down again and just tried to do whatever was possible. Absolutely stunning what people will do when they are face to face with disaster. I freely admit that I was crying like a little girl when I first saw the endless columns of Bundeswehr, THW, Fire Brigades, Farmers, basically everyone who could just streaming to help people they never met but were neighbors and friends for me.Sorry for the rambling, but I am still not emotionally disconnected enough from it to concisely talk about it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; And the most unusual thing about all this is: None of this is unusual. At least not within the national tapestry that is The Great American Small Town.It also isn&#39;t unusual in the cities. Humans are wonderful and terrible everywhere. It reminds me of the 30 Rock episode where Jack and Liz go to Georgia to find a new comedian in touch with the &#34;real America&#34; and Liz keeps insisting that all Americans are real Americans and there is no &#34;real America.&#34;The acts of people after 9/11 in NYC remind us of the good in humans just as this small town inspires us.As Mr Rogers said, &#34;When I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me, &#34;Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For some reason this reminded me of the Ray Bradbury story, &#34;The Town Where Noone Got Off&#34; which is a dark little story indeed about two men and a small town on a railroad line.  This one is a bit more positive.However, it turns out this whole incident was apparently due to the lack of a railroad crossing guard system of any kind at the intersection.  The most basic system has flashing lights warning of oncoming trains, and even that wasn&#39;t present.https://www.kwch.com/2022/06/30/amtrak-derailment-places-spo...In that respect it&#39;s also a story about the poor state of American infrastructure."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Given some of the people here might run their own servers, the self-hosted alternative is to have something like Sonarr PVR for newsgroups and torrents, alongside a tracker indexer like Jackett, and then Plex for the frontend. In this combination, you &#34;subscribe&#34; to TV shows and select movies on the Sonarr system, and then the downloading is taken care for you even when new episodes arrive. These will then appear on Plex which is refreshed by the pipeline automatically. The system integrates with private trackers and is capable of maintaining your seed-ratio if that&#39;s important.I recently fell into this rabbit-hole while trying to organise my music. For music there is Lidarr, which also ID3 tags your music and reorganizes it into folder structures. This is convenient since organizing anything using Plex is a nightmare."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I became a single parent when my daughter turned 1 year old. When she got old enough we&#39;d go fishing, bicycling, swimming, and hiking a lot. We&#39;d also go to a used book store twice a month (on pay day) so she could pick out a few books to read. She loved doing that.She had no interest at all in learning how to code or gaming but she loved helping in the garden and in the kitchen prepping and cooking meals.When she got to Jr. High she wanted to join the &#34;Cheerleader&#34; squad so there were a lot early morning rides to school I had to make, and lot&#39;s of Basketball games I attended until she graduated, but I had a lot fun cheering along with them.During those years I setup a campsite on our property so her and her friends could go hang out there. I&#39;m sure they had more fun than most parents would approve of but they never got into any real trouble, the police were never called, and no one got hurt bad enough for the parents to call me. For the most part all those parents knew exactly where their kids were and what they were doing. And that I was close enough to deal with anything that came up. But there were never any serious issues.She&#39;s 37 years old now, still loves to hike, backpack, swim, fish, garden, and cook, and most important, she still likes to hang out with me!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My son is 12 y/o, and he&#39;s into Minecraft.Yesterday he discovered the server mc.openredstone.org. He spent all day yesterday and about one hour today, and he ended up building a 4-bit adder.On this server players learn how to build logic gates, and mix them so they eventually build CPUs. It&#39;s fully gamified, so beginners are called &#34;students&#34; and more advanced players are called &#34;builders&#34;. To become a &#34;builder&#34; you need to pass some trials. The &#34;builders&#34; probably have their own challenges (not sure, my son is still a student), in any case, they behave like teachers. So a student will find a builder who will give them instructions, and guide them through more and more complex designs.So, yesterday my son had no idea what XOR or NAND is, and today he already built a 4-bit adder, and has dreams of building an ALU.I&#39;m quite excited to be honest. By the way, I&#39;m not in any way connected with whomever put together this Minecraft server. I don&#39;t even think it&#39;s a for-profit thing, as far as I can tell, it&#39;s fully non-profit."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Might be off topic but a nugget from having two girls (5 and 11). Kids don’t care about budget or how much things cost. We have toys we’ve spent hundreds of dollars on only to have the near free to free one be a hit. I say this to make sure you know your employment status likely only effects your kids if it effects you. Or said differently, to the extent it effects you it will effect them.Kids will generally have fun with anything you show a degree of interest in. The copper pipe plumbing example in this thread is a perfect example. A simple Task became a life long activity for the kid. They will remember it forever and tell someone in the future “this time I welded with my dad”… they won’t remember that time my dad didn’t hire a plumber.Things off the top of my head that have been a hit - 
Planting plants 
Fashion design 
Basic coding activities or contests 
Shooting
Anything that requires safety procedures 
Lawn work (but make it fun or set a timer)
Writing a story where they write some of it, you add in silly bits, they write more , repeat till laughing out loud. 
Both my girls super in to etiquetteBest of luck buddy and squeeze these years for as much as you can."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m not sure what the cause of your chronic pain is, but I would highly recommend reading John Sarno&#39;s &#34;The Mindbody Prescription.&#34; I&#39;ve dealt with chronic pain for years and it&#39;s the only thing that&#39;s had any effect. Please, please, don&#39;t write it off until you&#39;ve read the book. Note that Sarno&#39;s work focuses on back pain, but it applies to all types of chronic pain (including migraines, which he discusses in the book).- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jQtmSZetJM- https://aaroniba.net/how-i-cured-my-rsi-pain- https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/09/well/mind/john-sarno-chro...- https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/well/chronic-pain.h..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Do 1 task a day, no matter how small it is, do it consistently for a week or two. Then every other day you do 2 tasks for a month, and you start working up to a point where you feel you do what you can within your limits and get joy from that 1 (or 2) items you can scrap off.If you live with family focus your tasks maybe on easing their life, pull out 10  weeds out of the garden, take out the trash, fix a squeaking door. Small but attainable things.Chronical pain is a mess, it&#39;s relentless and it&#39;s always there, it doesn&#39;t go away, but you learn to deal with it. Focus on the pain initially, learn what pain you have and focus on it. I learned to focus on it and make a mental note (do not know how else to say) that it&#39;s not worth paying attention to, and I get by without medication. It&#39;s not always easy and there are days where you want to cry and cry and just fall asleep so you do not have to feel it.
It&#39;s normal and accept that not all days will be the same and successful.It&#39;s a tough hill you are up against, but all shall pass and all will be well in the end. It&#39;s unbelievable sometimes, but all shall pass. Remember that.Good luck, don&#39;t falter, reaching out is the first step!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was in a similar situation, minus the physical disability (I was mentally in a really bad place though). The only advise I have is to not think of any job as below you. I don&#39;t know your exact situation or your disabilities, but if you can deliver pizzas to at least keep your head above the water, do that. Having gone through YC you&#39;re obviously also a bright and intelligent person, how many different companies have you tried consulting for? Some companies could be more understanding than others of your situation, in which cases making 1500 a month shouldn&#39;t be a huge problem in this industry. Sorry you&#39;re going through this friend.."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; full Linux desktop&gt; The Core Project is a highly modular based system (...) It is not a complete desktop nor is all hardware completely supported. It represents only the core needed to boot into a very minimal X desktop typically with wired internet access.That is not a full desktop, and the [The Core] project doesn&#39;t say it is.That being said the concept of &#34;full desktop&#34; is somewhat loaded. Today we have a somewhat unreasonable expectation that at least one, but sometimes several browsers, office suites, multimedia viewers and editors to be a &#34;basic desktop&#34;.Back in the 90&#39;s people did not expect the computer to come with any such software applications built-in."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Direct link:http://tinycorelinux.net/I have wondered how such a tiny distribution is possible. I&#39;m thinking of the kernel, in particular--when I try to compile my own kernel with no module support and only the drivers I need built-in (&#34;make localyesconfig&#34; will do this), it comes out like 10MB compressed. And I am no kernel expert, so it&#39;s hard for me to tell which settings I can change and what will happen if I do.Then when I boot the most bare-bones system with /bin/sh as init, it is using like 70mb of RAM doing nothing.So anyway, I found that you can just grab their kernel config, I&#39;ll be curious to see how it differs from more typical configs: http://tinycorelinux.net/13.x/x86/release/src/kernel/config-...Windows 95 ran in 8 MB of RAM. (Well, officially 4 MB for marketing purposes, but no one thought that was actually enough.) I would be really impressed to see a graphical Linux  environment that could run in that amount of RAM."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I sure wish Starlink supported IPv6. They&#39;re a brand new ISP planning for millions of customers and decided from the start they couldn&#39;t get enough IPv4 addresses for everyone. Fair enough! But we&#39;re stuck with Carrier Grade NAT and it is a drag.On Starlink it&#39;s impossible to host a server socket directly, which makes any peer to peer networking a PITA. Geocoding IP addresses doesn&#39;t work so I have to bend over backwards to convince, say, Youtube TV that I&#39;m in the Sacramento metro and not LA where the POP is. Also the shared IP addresses seem to trip a lot of DDOS protection; I fill out 10x as many CAPTCHAs on Starlink as I do on my other ISP. And I sometimes get random network stability problems; a few weeks ago Starlink screwed something up so no one could keep a persistent connection up more than a few minutes. Seems to be fixed now, but I bet it was their CGNAT system.I realize half the world lives with CGNAT. It&#39;s not unusable, at least web browsing works more or less. But IPv6 would solve all these problems. A little surprised that a new ISP created in 2021 wouldn&#39;t have IPv6 support as one of their launch features. There&#39;s hints they are trying to get it working but it&#39;s not an official thing now.

If 20% of users want to be able to do something in TypeScript that the language doesn&#39;t support, they either can try to get the change into the core language, or live without it (or fork it). If it changes, it&#39;ll change for everyone using TypeScriptBut in Clojure (lisps in general), you don&#39;t have this restriction, so modifying the language for your own need, becomes a lot easier. Lots of work on Clojure is simply done in libraries, as it&#39;s possible and doesn&#39;t impact the core of the language, which everyone shares."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As much as I respect Rich Hickey, it&#39;s hard to say anything positive about this. It has basically nothing to do with open source. It&#39;s entirely specific to how he chooses to run his own projects.Open source is not a gift in the sense that you &#34;get what they give you&#34;. You are entitled to the source code. You are entitled to modify the code. You are entitled to distribute your modifications.Are you entitled to be part of the development process and to state your opinions about how things are going? Yes...if those are the rules of the project. The thing is, that has nothing to do with open source, it&#39;s always project-specific, so the full post largely doesn&#39;t make any sense as a comment on open source."</p>

Maybe that should be considered the good default of things.At least one in every town that everyone could use, for free, forever, without restriction to ANY of the knowledge anyone desires.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So, if I get it right. First there was Libgen, which is mirrorable. Then, some Z-Library copied Libgen and added some more books, without making it mirrorable. The goal is to make these new books, which are not mirrorable — mirrorable (i.e. to &#34;preserve&#34; them).So, why not just re-upload them to Libgen, then? I guess somebody will do that now anyway, but you could easily done it in the first place, without making your own mirror, which is not a mirror of Libgen. Just upload them to Libgen and make a mirror of Libgen."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It gave me a pause to think about how it came that I can never really tell what am I looking at anymore. Forget the HN title, which is stupid — what does this landing page tell me? Well, that it&#39;s… next gen, and it apparently can catch up with me, which is not much, since I&#39;m not really catching up with what&#39;s going on anyway. Also, that it&#39;s &#34;tooling&#34;. Like IDE, or framework, or maybe a chainsaw. Can&#39;t tell.&#34;Getting started&#34; page tells me that &#34;Vite&#34; (pronounced as &#34;veet&#34;) is &#34;quick&#34; in French, then it proceeds with quite wordy installation guide. It also quickly mentions that it&#39;s a &#34;build tool&#34;. Finally. So, like gulp or grunt, I guess? But it doesn&#39;t even mention those, or any other build tools it supposedly replaces. And it seems unlikely, since everybody uses some script that comes with angular or vue or any other framework of your choice nowadays…"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Working with front end for 5+ years have nearly made me switch careers. 
There&#39;s an absolute onslaught of languages, frameworks, patterns and now also &#34;tools&#34; that never really work in you editor, and you never really grasp before moving on to the next thing.I think me and my team have spent 90% of our time working with tooling, and all creativity and joy has gone out the window - because you never become a master, an expert og know your way around the codebase before you&#39;re suddenly 2 years behind.It&#39;s a shitshow and no one really seems to know what the hell they are doing - even the teachers of this stuff - they just know &#34;how&#34; rarely why.Way, way too much complexity and abstraction for simple tasks. Some things &#34;should have&#34; become easier with quick scaffolding, auth templates or whatever, but they always only work 95% and you use an endless amount of time fixing the last 5% instead of building creatively.Vite was the same thing, faster yes, but my VSCODE broke because of the myriad of build tools and plugins on top of each other from older projects."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Incredible amount of negative comments. It takes more time to type all that negativity out than it takes to read about what Vite is and what it does.Frontend dev here. Vite is amazing. It doesn&#39;t take long to get what it does if you try it out (you can avoid reading about it that way).I won&#39;t bother summarizing what it does, the website literally covers it. Reading really became superpower in this day and age."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love how they&#39;ve said &#34;constrained to C space&#34;.Many people say speed of light is the absolute speed limit of anything or information can travel. Sure it is, which is easily proven by physics. But the physics we know of applies to what we know. There might be something completely different to what we&#39;re seeing/observing/theoritising with our smartest people and best equipment.I&#39;m not saying we can just go faster than C by advancing technology: I know it&#39;s limited by relativity and is not a matter of advancing tech.What I&#39;m saying is that there will probably be advancements in physics and technology so that C limit will of course stay the same, but it will be the physics inside the box whereas a complete new understanding of reality outside the box would be discovered, where things can travel &#34;faster&#34; than C using other dimensions or something that we even haven&#39;t thought of yet &#34;outside the box&#34;, while still being perfectly compatible with the &#34;regular&#34; &#34;inside the box&#34; physics we love and use today, without violating and relativity rules of our classical physics.Then they&#39;ll probably look back and just laugh at the people who thought C was the absolute limit to everything."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; As soon as Sphero completed the acquisition, bringing Kelsus in as an app developer, two things happened: 1) Sphero told us they needed fully revamped iOS and Android apps six months later with no schedule wiggle room. 2) Sphero spent the first two of those six months organizing a team on their side and hashing out requirements for the new apps.This exact pattern has preceded every mismanagement disaster I&#39;ve ever seen:1) Management gives an unreasonable deadline to developers before defining the deliverables. Clock starts ticking.2) Management then fails to settle on the requirements for months and/or continuously moves the goalposts while people are trying to work, turning an unreasonable deadline into an impossible deadline3) Developers start realizing that they&#39;re going to receive the blame when impossible deadline isn&#39;t achieved, despite not having any control in the matter. They start leaving for new jobs, and the death spiral begins.It&#39;s the universal pattern of a management team that doesn&#39;t know how to do anything other than make demands and then apply pressure. Unless you can get someone in charge who has real leadership and planning skills, it&#39;s not recoverable."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve seen this twice. First time the PE firm installed their CEO who came in and immediately started talking about cleaning house. A bunch of developers left fearing a layoff. That was bad enough, but what he really meant was sales. He gutted the sales team and brought in his guys. Sales tanked, company growth stopped, hard. Features dwindled and bugs grew. This clown and his cronies were gone after two years and the company still struggles today.Second time. A $10B company acquired a $4B company. The parent demanded high margins from the company that had been running on low margins and legacy, near end of life applications. Layoffs ensued and the parent was choking on the acquisition. They’d been sold on a bogus modernization effort that ended as soon as the acquisition closed. That acquisition is a drag on their earnings today, six years later.Getting to see these type of disasters first hand is pretty cool imo."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I actually gave away a Porsche 911. This was not a mall giveaway but a marketing experiment for my new startup: Flat 6 Club.Yes, we wanted something in return, in this case, we wanted you to buy a t-shirt or start a subscription (merch+content+events), which gives us essentially all the same info, which would enter you in a sweepstakes to win the car. We also wanted to promote the club, which we did.We researched it and contracted a sweepstakes company who helped us run the sweepstakes legally.In the end, we gave away the car to a very nice man and his wife, who we flew in from Minnesota to San Diego for the giveaway event.Some people did think it was a scam.But there are several operations that actually do give cars away such a Omaze, Diesel Brothers and many more.There’s a model there based on the new post-search world we live in that has to do with high engagement increasing Return On Ad Spend and other AdTech voodoo.No doubt there are lots of scams but there are also real winners out there.We’ve only given away 1 car. We learned a ton.I decided to kill the monthly subscription after we gave away the car because we grossly underestimated the amount of up-front ad spend required to achieve a good ROAS and I knew we wouldn’t be giving away another car for a long time.The biggest surprise to me was hearing from people that were sad that we killed the paid membership/giveaway program.This was $9.11/mo for membership and occasional swag drops and automatic entry into our next giveaway —whenever that might be. I communicated personally with some of these folks.The gist of what I learned was that for $9.11/mo, people enjoyed the hope that they may one day win a 911. We literally had people beg us to bring it back. This is probably the same happiness that a lottery ticket brings to many people. It’s not really that they expect to win. As long as someone wins, they’re buying some hope, some excitement… a dream."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m wondering if the last sentence from the abstract is more of a holy grail than the conversion of methane to methanol:&gt; ... The confinement of mono-iron hydroxyl sites in a porous matrix demonstrates a strategy for C–H bond activation in CH4 to drive the direct photosynthesis of CH3OH.https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-022-01279-1Selective C-H bond activation (of which this paper is an example) is extremely difficult. It has been the focus of intense research for decades. Having a tunable catalysts system that performed this transformation would be a game-changer for the production of just of about every organic molecule. The authors just focused on methane as the hydrocarbon feedstock, so it&#39;s hard to know how general the process might be."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Apparently the technique works at close to standard temperature and pressure. Considering that the Sabatier process can be run off water and electricity, and desalination can be done with sunlight, we have all the puzzle pieces for converting seawater to methanol via solar power. The chemical byproduct is oxygen, itself very a very useful element though difficult to compress and store. Even if the byproduct O2 is released to the atmosphere this looks very promising."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This was a great write up. I&#39;ve already sent it to a few people.On the question of what happens if a file&#39;s contents change after the initial checksum, the man page for rsync[0] has an interesting explanation of the *--checksum* option:&gt; This changes the way rsync checks if the files have been changed and are in need of a transfer. Without this option, rsync uses a &#34;quick check&#34; that (by default) checks if each file&#39;s size and time of last modification match between the sender and receiver. This option changes this to compare a 128-bit checksum for each file that has a matching size. Generating the checksums means that both sides will expend a lot of disk I/O reading all the data in the files in the transfer (and this is prior to any reading that will be done to transfer changed files), so this can slow things down significantly.&gt; The sending side generates its checksums while it is doing the file-system scan that builds the list of the available files. The receiver generates its checksums when it is scanning for changed files, and will checksum any file that has the same size as the corresponding sender&#39;s file: files with either a changed size or a changed checksum are selected for transfer.&gt; Note that rsync always verifies that each transferred file was correctly reconstructed on the receiving side by checking a whole-file checksum that is generated as the file is transferred, but that automatic after-the-transfer verification has nothing to do with this option&#39;s before-the-transfer &#34;Does this file need to be updated?&#34; check.
For protocol 30 and beyond (first supported in 3.0.0), the checksum used is MD5. For older protocols, the checksum used is MD4.[0]: https://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice write up. rsync is great as an application but I found it more cumbersome to use when wanting to integrate it into my own application. There&#39;s librsync but the documentation is threadbare and it requires an rsync server to run. I found bita/bitar (https://github.com/oll3/bita) which is inspired by rsync &amp; family. It works more like zsync which leverages HTTP Range requests so it doesn&#39;t require anything running on the server to get chunks. Works like a treat using s3/b2 storage to serve files and get incremental differential updates on the client side!"</p>

And RT has this strange longstanding bug where the image is extremely blurry during editing, and only becomes clear after exporting.  According to a github issue, a workaround is to disable lens correction (and anything else in the &#34;transform&#34; tab) but this didn&#39;t work for me, prompting my most recent switch to dt.current biggest grip with dt... why are those damn arrows at the edges of the screen so tiny???  Expanding and retracting the side panels requires pixel-perfect accuracy on a ~20px target.  I know I could use keyboard shortcuts, but my brain isn&#39;t wired for them yet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Let&#39;s see if this changed anything.But my previous experience with editing Sony RAWs on Rawtherappe and Darktable wasn&#39;t good.The color science is missed up in Darktable and in Raw therappe, I just couldn&#39;t get something decent out.I would be editing for an hour and end up with a weird looking image, while in lightroom I would be done in 10 minutes.People might say that I&#39;m just used to lightroom but I&#39;m not, I was using Capture one, then didn&#39;t shoot anything for multiple years, then just went pack to Lightroom and could edit photos without major frustrations and get decent results quickly.Creative apps in general are a very weak point of the Linux desktop, and when they exist, that have many weird requests and problems that just using them on windows is easier(Davinci resolve requiring the crappy closed source AMD drivers)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"darktable has a pretty steep learning curve and it introduces concepts from cinema (the scene referred workflow) that may be known to video editors and colorists, but that are surely alien even to seasoned still image editors and retouchers.For anyone that wants to learn darktable I wholeheartedly recommended the forum at https://discuss.pixls.us/c/software/darktable/19The darktable developers frequent this forum and it&#39;s an indispensable resource."</p>
