After that, you will simply only need to copy the image file such as .iso, .vhd etc on to the drive and you are all set. Check details from the following sites.https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Windows images that are over 4.3GB(I don&#39;t remember the exact max size) most image burning tools will fallback to NTFS on the USB formatting and some motherboards/laptops don&#39;t like this. (Even on my rather modern Dell laptop)The best solution so far I&#39;ve found is to manually partition the USB into a 1GB FAT32 partition and the rest NTFS. Then you extract the files where needed [0]I learned this method just last year but it seems it&#39;s pretty universal. At least for Win10 ISOs. And I don&#39;t have to boot Windows and wait for its updates![0] https://techbit.ca/2019/02/creating-a-bootable-windows-10-ue..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"While it is not my experience at all, I understand that some folks have certain negative opinions of Beyond Burgers, and other fake meat/imitation burgers:- The texture is off
- Maybe they cook strangely
- Potentially less tasteBut the most important thing about them, and the reason I urge everyone to at least _try_ Beyond Burgers, is they require no violence against animals.This is not an argument that fairs well on HN in general, but the fact that we can eat something this similar to a burger but without the slaughter of living, feeling, individual being is so unbelievably important and incredible.Maybe you think the burger tastes different, or has a strange texture, but I certainly won&#39;t try to argue that because it doesn&#39;t matter. No one needed to die for you to eat it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m generally surprised no one brings up the negative health benefits of processed foods.  It is not healthier to get rid of meat only to replace it with high salt chemically processed food that tastes like meat.It seems like we are going backwards.You know what uses less greenhouse emissions, less water and less land?  The orginal plant based food that gets processed into a beyond burger.If you really care about the planet why are you buying processed anything?  That get&#39;s shipped nationwide / worldwide that creates factories, chemical waste, greenhouse gases.  Buying locally and growing locally really helps the planet.  Going to burger king and getting an absolute burger instead of a whooper is just pretending."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am an avid meat-lover but it does play on my conscience that I am in fact eating a former sentient being and potentially contributing to environmental devastation.I would appreciate answers to the following two, albeit simplistic questions that always plaque me when I consider stopping eating meat products:1) Is it really unethical to eat animals when the natural trajectory of most animals lives was likely to be eaten by other animals or die some horrendous death in their natural environment? Isn&#39;t it better for an animal to live its best life on a free range farm being grass fed, then get quickly and humanely slaughtered?2)If I made a personal decision to stop eating meat, would there be any significant impact at all on the overall environment realistically? For example, I recently watched the documentary Seaspiracy which showed the negative effects of commercial fishing. However, the reality is that me (not) eating a bowl of sashimi once a week makes no difference in the context of, say, countries like Japan slaughtering millions of fish daily (regardless of any change in behavior on my part or my small circle of influence)?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s nice to see hard evidence of this, but anecdotal evidence is plain to see on Amazon.com reviews. For example, a product gets a lot of 5 star reviews stating that the buyer bought it for their child/relative/friend and they are just sure that they will love it... 5 stars! Or &#34;I just got this delivered yesterday and I haven&#39;t used it yet but it looks really great!&#34;... 5 stars.These are then immediately followed by a 1 star review along the lines of &#34;This is the biggest piece of junk I&#39;ve ever bought online. Will be returning to Amazon. DO NOT BUY!&#34;These aren&#39;t to be confused with the indiscriminate idiots who can&#39;t be bothered to use their brains, who leave mindless reviews such as &#34;This is junk but it was cheap and kinda works... 5 stars!&#34; Right.Most times this trend of 5&#39;s followed by 1&#39;s is seen even in the first page of reviews. It&#39;s a serious problem with the platform. I usually search for reviews written by people who have had the product for a week or two and give the pros/cons along with a less than 5 star rating. That helps me avoid the fakes and the idiots.This makes me wonder why Amazon, in all their analytical genius, isn&#39;t cracking down on this when it&#39;s so blatantly obvious."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s gotten to the point where a product with thousands of reviews and an average 4.5 - 5 star rating immediately raises a red flag with me.And Amazon appears unmotivated to do anything about it. As a personal example, I had purchased a mouth guard that had over six thousand 5-star reviews. It was listed as high quality, FDA approved, etc. When I received it, it was a piece of plastic junk with inkjet quality instructions in English and Chinese. Along with it came a note promising a $10 Amazon gift card if I left a 5 star review and emailed them proof of it.I took a photo of the note and forwarded it to Amazon expecting some action - instead I received a canned response about &#34;we take these issues seriously&#34;. A year later, that seller is still there with dozens of products, all with thousands of 5-star reviews."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Last year, I posted a negative review of an inexpensive (~$10) electronic device on Amazon. A few weeks later, the seller contacted me with an offer of a $20 Amazon gift certificate to take it down. I didn&#39;t respond. A few days later, they offered $30, then $40, then $50."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There is an interesting peer reviewed paper published last month with analysis of existing facts about the origin of covid-19. A part from their conclusion:More than a year after the initial documented cases in Wuhan, the source of SARS-CoV-2 has yet to be identified, and the search for a direct or intermediate host in nature has been so far unsuccessful.The low binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 to bat ACE2 studied to date does not support Chiroptera as a direct zoonotic agent. Furthermore, the reliance on pangolin coronavirus receptor binding domain (RBD) similarity to SARS-CoV-2 as evidence for natural zoonotic spillover is flawed, as pangolins are unlikely to play a role in SARS-CoV-2′s origin and recombination is not supported by recent analysis.At the same time, genomic analyses pointed out that SARS-CoV-2 exhibits multiple peculiar characteristics not found in other Sarbecoviruses.A novel multibasic furin cleavage site (FCS) confers numerous pathogenetically advantageous capabilities, the existence of which is difficult to explain though natural evolution...source: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10311-021-01211-0"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;... proponents of lab escape can explain all the available facts about SARS2 considerably more easily than can those who favor natural emergence.&#34;&#34;The natural emergence theory battles a bristling array of implausibilities.&#34;This is a fantastic article, but amazingly almost all of it is year-old news. Most of this was known in March 2020, and nearly all of it by the end of 2020. How does it take so long for the truth to win?I published a meta-analysis covering much of the same ground in November 2020 and this was only after waiting and expecting for several months that someone with a better platform would do so first. The article above covers the most important points but the story does go deeper: https://followtheplot.org/covid19"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the media successfully conflated four separate questions:a) Did it form in nature or in a lab?b) Did it become more communicable via nature or via the lab?c) Did it make it to humans through nature (or wet market) or via the lab?d) If it came from the lab was it on purpose or an accident?as simply &#34;OMG IT CAME FROM A LAB&#34; and then claimed it&#39;s all a conspiracy theory.The media as a whole shot themselves in the foot on this one and we&#39;ll all be worse off for it."</p>

S3 can be cost efficient, but only if you don&#39;t touch data :)Their price calculation doesn&#39;t mention cost of S3 requests, which very quickly adds up and is often neglected.It costs $1 for 2.5M GET requests to S3. They have 180 shards, in a general case query seems to fetch all of them. Presumably they don&#39;t download full shard per request, but download an index + some relevant ranges. Lets say that is 10 requests per shard. So that would be 1800 S3 GET requests = ~1400 search queries cost them $1.Assuming their service is reasonably popular and serve 1 req/second on average, that would be $1,440 per 30 days in addition to advertised $1,000 spent on EC2 and S3 storage.Seems comparable to AWS ElasticSearch service costs:- 3 nodes m5.2xlarge.elasticsearch = $1,200- 20TB EBS storage = $1,638"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think this speaks to the power of defaults. 96% of users have not turned this on because they didn&#39;t even know that its disabled, and when an app asks you if they can track you, the response is going to be a strong no. The reality is that FB&#39;s entire business model has been predicated on the default being that tracking is allowed.If this holds, this will be cataclysmic for FB. You can&#39;t have a huge portion of your wealthy user base just disappear and expect advertisers to keep paying what they were paying previously.BTW, this is also why the covid exposure notification apps failed miserably. They should have always been opt-out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why would you enable it? What possible benefit is there in doing so?The ads won&#39;t get better regardless of the data they have on you. They aren&#39;t exactly using ML or AI to help you get better ads. Its really just boring data queries in SQL or some graph language. That&#39;s the sum total of most advertising intelligence. Its not 21st century high tech. Its mostly relational databases with some NoSQL to make that table linking faster and cached. In cases where they do actually bring out that NoSQL it is to reimplement all the relational smarts just with extra steps. Then its at least shiny and cool.The whole thing is really just about storing and gathering a profile on you as part of them building an asset they can later resell. Creepy technology for creepy uses. An asset full of subtle errors about you that can likely never be seen or fixed. Much later they will invariably then leave all or some of it on a usb stick or some poorly protected cloud server. After that your details will end up in the hands of some scammer or other miscreant to enable them to send you endless emails full of typos, lies, emojis and if you&#39;re exceptionally average like the rest of us: an interesting tale about long lost nigerian princes just needing a bank account. If you&#39;re lucky.So, yeah, leave it disabled. There&#39;s really no point in doing otherwise."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Based on Apple’s job postings I’m beginning to suspect their stance on ads and tracking was nothing more than a clever ruse to weaken competitors while they build their own a personalized ad business for iOS:https://i.imgur.com/y1s9F4JThey also just hired Facebook’s first ads targeting product manager to work for their ad platform. I don’t think Apple ads won’t be limited to the App Store within a couple years."</p>

It&#39;ll take a private company to provide one single website to explore and find all datasets from around the world, making it easier to look at holistic patterns that are happening around the world, or compare patterns between countries.Though, I would expect a much better UX from Google nowadays. This site has more in common with Google Scholar than Google Search.And ultimately I&#39;d like to see them build something where people don&#39;t need to download datasets in order to make use of the data.I compare the state of open data to the state of mapping software before Google Maps. You needed to download map files and open them on special software that you open on your computer to make sense of the data. And then Google Maps came along and flipped that whole model. Open data needs the same leap forward in order for more people to make greater use of open data."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a great resource. At Splitgraph, we index ~40k open data sets, and we make sure to include structured metadata for each one, so we show up in these results. (example [0])One cool aspect of this metadata is that it allows a dataset to have multiple sources. So if two sites index the same dataset, there is no duplicate content penalty like there might be with textual content. If you search for a dataset, it will include links to all its sources (whether canonical or otherwise).For most of the data we index at Splitgraph, the canonical source is 
an open government data portal powered by Socrata (e.g. data.cdc.gov). We noticed that Socrata powered a lot of portals, so we wrote a Socrata plugin for Splitgraph, along with a scraper to index the metadata. The plugin basically implements a Postgres FDW so that Splitgraph can translate from SQL to the upstream query language. In this case, the plugin translates to Socrata&#39;s bespoke API language. But for private deployments we also have plugins for Snowflake, Postgres, some SaaS services, etc.If you find some data on Google Dataset Search with Splitgraph listed as a source, please take a look! Our &#34;Data Delivery Network&#34; (DDN) is implemented on top of the Postgres wire protocol, so you can connect with any Postgres client (or use our web editor). All the Postgres query syntax is available to you; you can even JOIN across any of the other 40k+ datasets indexed at Splitgraph. That includes &#34;live data&#34; like Socrata portals, but also versioned snapshots of data called &#34;data images.&#34; Here&#39;s an example of a point-in-time query across two snapshots (basically a diff) [1], and another query that joins across tables at data.cityofchicago.org and data.cambridgema.gov [2].[0] https://www.splitgraph.com/cdc-gov/distribution-of-covid19-d... – &#34;View Source&#34; to see the Schema.org metadata[1] https://bit.ly/3epvxcj[2] https://bit.ly/3f1ll8K(Sorry for the bit.ly links. The URL for our query editor includes the full SQL string, and I don&#39;t want to mess up HN formatting.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Can confirm. I’m friends with a group of very smart distributed systems engineers who were excited to launch an actually useful crypto project that gets talked about here from time to time.As much as they’re excited about the technology itself, very few people are actually interested in using it. Instead, their business seems to revolve around the value of the utility tokens for their project.Few people are buying the utility tokens to pay for the service. They’re buying them to horde so they can resell to other speculators when the price goes up. They have a lot of tokens in circulation, but only a small number of them get used to pay for the service. Many of them are sitting in the wallets of exchanges where they get traded back and forth but never come near the blockchain.Investors only care about getting more press releases out so they can pump up the price of their discounted tokens, which have a shortened lockup period relative to something like stocks. It’s almost like a pump-and-dump scheme for investors.Maybe their underlying project will become popular in the future, but the volatility of the token price makes it increasingly unattractive for companies that want to actually use it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; 2. You aim to build a community, but in reality 90% of your telegram/discord are scammers and people asking why price is going down/accusations that you and your entire team should go to jail.I&#39;m consistently repulsed by the lack of thoughtful discussion in crypto communities. For a space littered with intriguing technology it&#39;s endlessly frustrating that there&#39;s no HN-like forum. Instead, any community that started off that way is now filled with speculators and shillers.Take your pick for where to source your news: 1. crypto influencers on YouTube who are paid to shill, 2. forums likw Reddit filled with speculators and conmen, 3. pump and dump groups on Telegram.The greed and FOMO on display in the crypto gold-rush is deeply depressing, and for the majority who join the craze at the peak of the bull run, it&#39;ll surely end in tears."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone interested in all of cryptography, I cringe every single time when we call blockchain &#34;crypto&#34;.Sure, there&#39;s cryptography in it. But you don&#39;t call a mail or http server &#34;crypto&#34;. There&#39;s similar tech in git, we don&#39;t call it &#34;crypto&#34;, we call it VCS.Calling this &#34;crypto&#34; is just trying to add a mystic aura for stuff people don&#39;t understand, to further muddy the waters.We have a word for this technology. It&#39;s not &#34;crypto&#34;. It&#39;s blockchain.Sure, it&#39;s your shorthand for &#34;cryptocoin&#34; or &#34;cryptovalue&#34;. Which are again newspeak for blockchain, and we could argue that given its limits and usage of the last years they should be called crypto-investment, at best.Which is still like ordering a pizza and forcefully referring to it only as &#34;food&#34;. I want a pepperoni-food please.Sorry for the rant, but it really feels like it&#39;s just a way to further embellish something with dubious values like the post points out"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Lots of comments already, but I&#39;ll chime on in.I realized this very late in life, but I have a test for when it&#39;s time to pay attention to a new technology. It&#39;s when technical people look at what seems like a groundbreaking idea, seem unimpressed, and say &#34;couldn&#39;t you just _____&#34;, were the blank is filled with something a nontechnical person doesn&#39;t understand or considers very cumbersome.The web: couldn&#39;t you just transfer a file to an open port and use a rendering tool to view it?Blogs: couldn&#39;t you just update a web page?Wikis: couldn&#39;t you just update a web page?social media: couldn&#39;t you just set up group view preferences and use RSS?youtube: couldn&#39;t you just upload a video and use tags for search?twitter: couldn&#39;t you just not? Isn&#39;t that just a worse version of what we can already do??Honestly, I&#39;ve overlooked almost every one of these things, because I failed to understand how removing small bits of friction can cause a technology to explode.Sure, some ideas are crazy new, but some sound too underwhelming to be revolutionary. but they are, there&#39;s no question about it, all those things I listed above changed the world, in ways both good and pretty damn awful."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think &#34;attacking&#34; Crazy New Ideas is how we develop them, iron out the kinks and test our understanding. Criticism is an essential part of the journey from crazy new idea to accepted wisdom.However, the main problem I have with with this article is that it divides people into domain experts and the rest. This kind of black and white thinking is pervasive in PG essays, and always lead to a cute conclusion. You can have two domain experts that disagree. You can have an idea that spans multiple domains, and there are no (or few) experts in all of them. Maybe the Crazy New Idea seems brilliant to experts in one domain, but only because they don&#39;t grasp the others."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"HN comment section pessimism is a new metric for evaluating your odds of success. &#34;It&#39;s too expensive&#34; or &#34;Nobody needs it because we have X&#34; on a project lead by a domain expert is not constructive criticism or conservatism, it&#39;s pure envy.PG isn&#39;t defending Mighty, Dropbox or Coinbase because he has skin in the game, but because he knows what the teams have achieved and what they could potentially achieve.I don&#39;t understand, it seems so obvious to me. Dropbox started as a better FTP, Coinbase is a better Bitcoin wallet, Gmail is a better SMTP, Mighty is a better Chrome. All of these products are meant for the masses because the core technologies/protocols are too complicated or restrictive to directly interact with."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The online ad business generally mystifies me.  While an awful lot of the internet, especially the surveillance advertising part, looks to be the greatest misallocation of engineering (and other) talent in the history of the world, ya gotta ask about the efficacy.The only reasonably accurate targeting I&#39;ve ever run into is the occasional ad for something I just browsed on Amazon.  I&#39;ve never clicked on an internet ad.  Youtube advertising might as well be targeted to an alien race.  What in the hell keeps this whole business afloat at it&#39;s current level?  Am I being programmed to buy that mechanic&#39;s vise because they threw up an after-the-browse ad?No doubt there&#39;s some sort of backend telemetry that proves the value of all this trouble, but I just don&#39;t see it.  Maybe the emperor really is nekkid.edit:  It may well be that the real marketing genius in the advertising industry is not it&#39;s value in increasing sales, whether it&#39;s old school print media/OTA/tradeshows or the newfangled spying-on-you internet variety, but in convincing it&#39;s customers of advertising&#39;s value.  Anything beyond pushing you up a search engine&#39;s ranking strikes me as a sketchy proposition."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author writes that you can either pay with money or you can “pay with your attention”. What’s left unsaid is the cost of that attention. I believe that cost is very high and it isn’t just ads, it’s the design of countless products including social media sites, games and even the site you’re reading this on right now. It’s all designed to extract as much attention as possible, and the cost is people’s ability to concentrate, learn and get shit done. The cost is, in other words, staggeringly high."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As the person who originally asked &#34;why&#34; I feel like I ought to respond, though much of it is covered by other comments. I used to work in more trad advertising, so my question wasn&#39;t so much an objection to working in advertising itself, but specifically Google&#39;s version of advertising, which I see as gross overreach into people&#39;s personal lives.In other comments people have mentioned YouTube subscriptions as being an alternative, it really isn&#39;t - OK, you don&#39;t see any adverts, but they&#39;re still harvesting and selling you. That a privately owned corporation is allowed to read your messages and sell what they find to the highest bidder is vile and honestly makes me wonder how we got here.I quit advertising after only a couple of years because it blackened my soul. If I was helping to harvest people&#39;s personal lives for private profit I can only imagine it would have been worse."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"For about 15 years I&#39;ve been trying to figure out how to articulate a `Tetris is life` essay. &#34;Things are going good, you&#39;re given an S piece that doesnt fit anywhere. You have to decide where you&#39;ll put that blocking piece so that you can hopefully clear it later. This might be an unexpected car repair bill or a death that you aren&#39;t emotionally capable of addressing ... You&#39;re in control, you have a good job, a great partner, and yall are saving to buy a house -- basically waiting for an l piece to complete your `Tetris`...&#34;Anyway, this game of (ha)Tetris is a lot like a lot of people&#39;s lives, just roadblock after roadblock. While the normal version where you start from zero on level one is probably an upper middle class life. And Id say that the majority of people in the world start on level 6 with the board halfway filled with a bunch of gaps and the pieces move at a speed that is barely controllable (im thinking of the classic gameboy version when I imagine these boards)Hatetris is cool. I couldn&#39;t get one line and I consider myself a damn good tetris player. It kept giving me S pieces and threw a Z in there and then an l"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Open-ended homework for those who are interested: solve the same problem, but with actual Tetris rules.I&#39;ve seen a bunch of those &#34;adversarial tetris&#34; variants, and they all operate under the assumption that any of the seven pieces can appear at any time, and with only one preview.Modern Tetris has 3 previews + hold, and pieces are drawn randomly &#34;from a bag&#34;, without replacement (more formally, if P[i] is the sequence of pieces, each aligned subsequence of 7 pieces must be a permutation of the tetrominos).This would be more interesting to make/play. Note that under such rules there exists a strategy that allows infinite play if the well is at least 17 tiles high."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"With all the over-the-top sensationalized news reports, I did not hear an understated humor in a long time and then I saw this in the article! Nice one!&gt;&gt;IBM states that the technology can fit ’50 billion transistors onto a chip the size of a fingernail’. We reached out to IBM to ask for clarification on what the size of a fingernail was, given that internally we were coming up with numbers from 50 square millimeters to 250 square millimeters."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The table in the article suggests to me that instead of this fictional &#34;feature size&#34;, we could use the achievable transistor area as a more meaningful measure of process scale.IBM achieved 50B transistors in 150mm^2, for a per-transistor area of 3000 nm^2.TSMC&#39;s 5nm process (used by Apple&#39;s M1 chip) apparently achieves a transistor area of 5837 nm^2, while Intel&#39;s 10nm is lagging at roughly 10000 nm^2."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is an amazing step and the transistor density chart shows you just how big a deal this is. 1/3B transistors per square mm. Now for &#39;grins&#39; take a piece of paper and make a 2 x 2 mm square on it. Now figure out what you can do with 1.3B transistors in that space. Based on this[1] you are looking at a quad-core w/GPU desktop processor.Of course you aren&#39;t really because you cant fit the 1440 pins that processor needs to talk to the outside world. But it suggests to me that at some point we&#39;ll see these things in &#34;sockets&#34; that connect via laser + WDM to provide the I/O. An octagonal device with 8 laser channels off each of the facets would be kind of cool. Power and ground take offs on the top and bottom. That would be some serious sci-fi shit would it not?[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor_count"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It was obvious at the time. I recall many people reporting that fake comments antithetical to their own beliefs had been submitted using their identities.Why was FCC head Ajit Pai able to get away with citing fraudulent evidence? How can we stop such blatant corruption of the FCC&#39;s policy-making process in the future?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The headline news is that they do so with impunity and achieved their goals at no cost. The corporations (&#34;like AT&amp;T, Comcast and Charter&#34;), their association (Broadband for America), the lobbying firm (unnamed - who is it?), and the FCC, to the degree it failed its duties, suffer no consequences - and indeed the corporations get what they wanted; their plan worked.&gt; The report said investigators had not found evidence that Broadband for America or the lobbying firm it used for the campaign were aware of the fraud. But, the attorney general said, several “significant red flags” had “appeared shortly after the campaign started, and continued for months yet still remained unheeded.”&gt; The attorney general’s office said it had reached agreements with three “lead generation” services that were involved — Fluent, Opt-Intelligence and React2Media, companies that gather customers for clients as part of marketing efforts. Under the agreements, the companies said they would more clearly disclose to individuals how their personal information was being used. The companies also agreed to pay over $4 million in penalties."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I can&#39;t say what&#39;s driving all the playerbase losses but:They stopped development on Diablo 3 a long time ago. It doesn&#39;t have the staying power of more modern online games where new content is added continuously.They stopped development on HotS, which never achieved the same level of pull as League of Legends.Overwatch faces stiff competition from Valorant and other competitive small team FPSes, and also has overlapping audiences with battle royale FPSes.Starcraft 2 is basically dead. WC3 remastered flopped. The RTS genre writ large is definitely in a waning phase.IMO, when a gaming company doesn&#39;t make new games, it is going to see some losses in the playerbase. To me it&#39;s more remarkable that they&#39;ve only seen this much of a dropoff."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Do you guys not have phones?&#34; -Blizzard staff in 2018, in response to booing fans upset that Blizzard wouldn&#39;t make a PC version of a game those same fans obviously wanted to play.This company has been contemptuous of their players for years.   They fell into that classic trap of &#34;If we [do something that will alienate all our customers] we can get 10x as many customers from [untapped market]&#34;    As anybody should have been able to foresee, the old customers were indeed alienated and the new customers never materialized."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Blizzard died the day it was bought by Activision. It has been descending into mediocrity ever since. Many executives left, and many studios/teams inside Blizzard have been shuffled around and between projects, unlike Blizzard&#39;s doctrine of old (tight teams focused on a project until it&#39;s great or must be stopped -- Blizzard&#39;s infamous &#34;Soon(tm)&#34;).World of Warcraft is still being milked till it dries up (and I&#39;m saying that as someone clocking 560+ days in game). Diablo has been abandonned (see the announcement of a mobile Diablo game last year¹, and its reception by the player base). So has StarCraft. Overwatch is stagnant (no new hero for a year) and Overwatch 2 is probably in development hell (pure speculation on my part I&#39;ll admit). Heroes of the Storm is also pretty stagnant (the game went from a hero every month to only two last year, nothing in 2021 so far).In the meantime, there has been a very heavy push for e-sports with Overwatch and Heroes of the Storm (though I have not followed any of those). These efforts seem, to me, extremely centred on American audience, unlike League of Legends which has multiple leagues around the world. I&#39;m sure a ton of money has been poured into this venture, but I&#39;m unsure it has improved the games...Anyway, the last time I launched Battle.net was for Destiny 2... and it has migrated to Steam in the middle of 2019!¹Wow OK, that was in 2018 o_O Time flies, especially with a global pandemic, it seems..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m excited to share that Building Mobile Apps at Scale: 39 Engineering Challenges is out. It&#39;s my first-ever paperback book and one that is free as a PDF for the rest of the month[1].I had worked for years at Uber, first as a mobile engineer, then an engineering manager. Despite being a mobile-first company, I could not shake the feeling that non-mobile engineers and managers consistently underestimated the complexity of large-scale mobile development. I&#39;ve been in so many meetings where an engineer, a PM, or a director would say, &#34;oh, compared to the backend, the mobile part should be simple enough... it&#39;s just another frontend, right?&#34;.I found myself explaining again and again to PMs, engineers, and stakeholders all the hoops the mobile team needs to jump to ship things in production. How mistakes are very expensive - and thus, we need to ship almost all changes behind feature flags. How the build train means that the changes we make today will take at least 2 weeks to get to prod. How devices being offline is something we need to actively support, and anticipate... and so on. I noticed similar &#34;aha moments&#34; each time. Talking with other mobile engineers in similar environments, they were having similar conversations, and battling similar assumptions on mobile being relatively simple.I had been collecting the numerous challenging areas that I planned to publish as a blog post. After I shared the draft on Twitter[2], I got an unexpected amount of interest in people offering to contribute. The contents became too long for a post, and so this book was born. Several people asked for a paperback version[3], and I decided to create the book in print as well, as I felt the contents warranted it.I hope you find this book useful - both if you&#39;re a mobile engineer or if you work with mobile teams. And I&#39;d love to hear any feedback![1] https://www.mobileatscale.com/#pricing[2] https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1335305213394251780[3] https://twitter.com/elevenetc/status/1335595203411972097"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Having read the book cover to cover I can say that it is quite a well made, relatable list of challenges and how they are being resolved in the sector. Foreseeing these types of issues is hard especially if you never went through the process, and quite hairy to resolve as such I believe it is a very good resource to have.On another note each section comes with quite a lengthy follow up material, which I found absolutely amazing to use as a starting point as well.Absolutely love it!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Everything Gergely writes (and he writes a lot! Books, blogs, tweets; and also YT channel) is gold, especially if you&#39;re into mobile dev, interested in growing as a senior developer, or if you live in Europe and are interested by big tech. He&#39;s really filling a huge gap.Re:book, I&#39;ve been an Android dev for 3 years (hybrid &amp; native) and the book really covers the whole spectrum of things (as you can see in the table of contents) that need to be done to have a good app, some of them hard to know in advance. At the same time, it can (and should) be read and understood by non-devs (project managers, directors etc.). Congrats on the launch!"</p>

... this guy appeared on tv, claiming
to be a world-famous imposter. He
said he&#39;d posed at one time or another
as a great surgeon, a theoretical
submolecular high-velocity particle
research physicist, a Finnish
novelist, a deposed president of
Argentina...BOB ARCTOR
He got away with it? Never got caught?ERNIE LUCKMAN
See, the guy never really posed as any
of it. He only posed as a worldfamous imposter. Turns out he just
pushed a broom at Disneyland, until he
read about this actual world-famous
imposter, and he thought, I can pose
as all those things, then he thought,
hell, I&#39;ll just pose as an imposter.
Save a lot of time, a lot easier.
Made almost as much money as the real
imposter with books and movie rights."</p>

But regardless of his story, his talk at Google is one of the best ones I&#39;ve heard [1].&gt; I was interviewed by the co-writer only about four times. I believe he did a great job of telling the story, but he also over dramatized and exaggerated some of the story. That was his style and what the editor wanted. He always reminded me that he was just telling a story and not writing my biography. This is one of the reasons that from the very beginning, I insisted the publisher put a disclaimer in the book and tapes.[0] https://www.abagnale.com/comments.htm[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsMydMDi3rI"</p>

Thankfully, they’re both very cordial with one another and both happily remarried.I have doubts this means anything negative for the foundation, other than maybe a rebrand of the name.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A particularly bad instance of link tracking I&#39;ve found is in TikTok&#39;s link sharing feature.If you share a link from the TikTok app, it gives you a vm.tiktok.com/[xyz] link to send/post elsewhere. It gives you no indication that this isn&#39;t a generic link to the post, nor does it give you an option to expose the generic link to the post.Instead, when you share that link and someone clicks on it and does not have the app, it opens with a header saying &#34;[First Last] is on TikTok.&#34; On the other hand, once you do click on that link (if and only if you don&#39;t have the app installed), you get redirected to the static link to the video and finally obtain it.This is an anti-pattern that enables further tracking and potentially unknowingly exposes user data when links are shared publicly. And there&#39;s no indication to the user that this is happening, since the link is structured as if it does not contain any tracking. Ie a tool like this wouldn&#39;t be able to &#34;strip out&#34; the tracking since it isn&#39;t tacked on in any way, but embedded as the generated link itself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d love if Firefox&#39;s built-in Tracking Protection did without an addon the job ClearURLs does, so two months ago I createdBug 1697982: &#34;Firefox Tracking Protection should protect against URL/queryparam-based tracking (like ClearURLs/NeatURL addons do)&#34; , https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1697982Please vote for the bug if you&#39;d like it too.Also, I see a few interesting comments in this HN thread; this evening when the dust settles, I&#39;ll aggregate &amp; bring them to the bug for consideration if/when fixing this bug is considered."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I would love to see an &#39;educational&#39; mode on this - rather than just removing the tracking elements, put some info on-screen that shows what was removed and why, so people can use this as a tool to learn more about what types of tracking exist online and how common it is. Hopefully that would lead to a more knowledgeable end user community online and we can have more nuanced discussions in the future about where tracking is benign, and where it is not."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you want to treat climate change as an existential threat, then you do whatever it takes to keep all existing nuclear running until fossil fuel plants are gone from the entire continent. And you put a little money to subsidize/stimulate new nuclear on the off chance some of the advanced nuclear concepts work out (or as a backup in case renewables improve slower than we think).You don’t have to stop or even slow renewables deployment to do this. They are fairly different industries with different workforce’s, so there are resources to do both simultaneously without significant interference. And you’re not going to get “too much” electricity as cheap abundant electricity will help accelerate decarbonization of other things like building heat and transport and industrial processes.Existing nuclear ESPECIALLY must be protected. And existing hydro. Number 1 and number 2 (tied with wind) clean energy sources.Nuclear power produces as much energy in our country as coal. We can phase out coal twice as fast if we at very least keep nuclear around a few years longer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A broad carbon price that starts small but rises gradually over time would be better than passing a hodge podge of half measures.  Virtually all economists say this would be more economically efficient (cheaper) and it doesn&#39;t create distortions by favoring politically popular projects over less sexy but more effective solutions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have been noticing the impact of excessive multitasking on myself lately, and I am now actively trying to avoid it.
At first i thought that multitasking would increase my overall efficiency by filling in gaps of downtime in certain tasks, but it soon turned me into a person incapable of focusing on anything deeply.
One day, I noticed that I am unable to read a book the same way i did as a child (cover to cover in one sitting for example), and it kind of shocked me.
I now have a rule that i do one thing only, and start other tasks only when the previous task has been finished. This applies to both productive work (learning, programming etc.) and entertainment (YouTube, books etc.).
I think that it is starting to help, but I feel like it will take time to undo the damage of years of bad multitasking."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My primary school age son, and anecdotally, lots of other kids of similar age, relentlessly multitask in ways that hurts my brain just to think about.He literally is playing a game, watching a YouTube video in another screen, and talking to friends at the same time, and in the most extreme case, is even listening to an audiobook or podcast as well.Asking kids about it, they all say that&#39;s just what they do and look at us oldies like we are from the 20th century or something."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yet multitasking is still being branded as something of a higher cognitive functioning. Byung-Chul Han in The Burnout Society claims that it is the opposite:&gt; “The attitude toward time and environment known as “multitasking’ does not represent civilisational progress. Human beings in the late-modern society of work and information are not the only ones capable of multitasking. Rather, such an aptitude amounts to regression. Multitasking is commonplace among wild animals. It is an attentive technique indispensable for survival in the wilderness.&gt; An animal busy with eating must also attend to other tasks. For example, it must hold rivals away from its prey. It must constantly be on the lookout, lest it be eaten while eating. At the same time, it must guard its young and keep an eye on its sexual partner. In the wild, the animal is forced to divide its attention between various activities. That is why animals are incapable of contemplative immersion—either they are eating or they are copulating.”&gt; ...&gt; We owe the cultural achievements of humanity—which include philosophy—to deep, contemplative attention.”"</p>

Typical problems include:1) Vendor agrees to to NET 60, but begins to display warnings to end users on day 30.2) We want to purchase 100 licenses in bulk, but vendor will only sell individual licenses directly to each user, who must pay using the vendor&#39;s payment system, with no exceptions or alternatives.3) Vendor does not have a method to process payment for multiple invoices combined in one check.4) Vendor sends invoice to wrong account at the same enterprise (way too common).What&#39;s frustrating about these examples is that there is no sales pitch needed; we&#39;ve already decided to purchase the product.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The world is a scary and violent place. Without Liveleak, you might never feel it. Until you see the actual violence and gore, it doesn&#39;t mean anything, it&#39;s just empty words. I didn&#39;t care at all about wars in the middle east until I saw the reality on Liveleak. Seeing dead children and people with their legs blown off made all the commentary on CNN and Fox seem so understated.A lot is said about desensitization as a result of seeing horrible things on the internet, but in my experience, only the opposite was true. Seeing violence online when I was in my late teens sensitized me and made the stories on the TV real. Frankly, I owe a lot of my political beliefs (especially on foreign policy) to horrible realities I saw on Liveleak."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I do hope you also understand our reasonsI mean, I&#39;d like to try, except he didn&#39;t actually give us any of those reasons.Rest in peace, LiveLeak.  You were a beacon of reality that shone through the propaganda, the bullshit, and the sugar-coating. Your demise means that people who want to see something like a shooting that&#39;s been removed from mainstream platforms will be forced to visit darker corners of the internet.  Now if someone asks me &#34;Hey where can I go see that thing that was taken off of Youtube&#34; I don&#39;t have a ready answer that isn&#39;t an alt-right cesspool."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"LiveLeak was the only video site that still felt like the wild west. If I was ever linked to a LiveLink url I knew something crazy was about to happen.I&#39;m sure serving this kind of content had its hurdles legally. And running a video site cannot be cheap in the first place. LiveLeak will be missed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think its hilarious that this project is basically a 5k-line .ino file + immeasurable awesomeness: https://github.com/technoblogy/ulisp/blob/master/ulisp.inoThis is something that is accessible to read and modify in a weekend. Really cool."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Big fan of uLisp, I got it running on an ESP8266. Love how the whole language fits in a single file, making it easy to hack around.Recently I learned how the author generates the uLisp variants for different platforms using Common Lisp:https://github.com/technoblogy/ulisp-builder..And an accompanying article to describe how it works:uLisp Builder - http://www.ulisp.com/show?3F07Also, a treasure trove of other Arduino and AVR projects by the author here:http://www.technoblogy.com/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is really cool, I would love to program my fleet of ESP8266s with anything but C. And I’ve been passively interested in using Lisp for many years. Using Lisp for my program as glue for the normal ESP C libraries would be awesome. I’ve read the documentation of uLisp a bit, two main questions remain:1. What’s the workflow? REPL for development is super cool, but how do I persist my programs? How does »flash this code onto the microcontroller« work?2. How can I interface with the large amount of C libraries out there? For example, uLisp does not provide an OTA library (for updating the software over Wifi), or one for MQTT. I don’t want to rewrite those myself, so how do I call existing C from uLisp?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Honestly, in this story everyone looks like a big child.I would maybe be more sympathetic to DHH if it wasn&#39;t the guy who was so opinionated he pushed through Rails features that everyone else disliked or co-wrote several books on company culture that are glorified ads for basecamp (although &#34;it doesn&#39;t have to be crazy at work&#34; is still a thought-provoking read, at least in part). I can only imagine that he might be similarly self-righteous in workplace situations.I think that, no matter your political views, if a situation gets out of hand that bad over matters that aren&#39;t even really directly related to workplace concerns, something must have gone fundamentally wrong much earlier. These levels of tension and distrust don&#39;t just arise out of nowhere."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m among those with mixed feelings.- list of funny names that is kept in some persistent form and circulates the company with full acknowledgment of the head people: Childish and extremely unprofessional, but still a typical mistake rather than a colossal disaster;- politics and racism issue: looks like typical misunderstanding but on a very fragile subjects. Very easy to get into drama scenarios with this mix. Very easy to mishandle it. But it still seems that this topic is not normal workplace topic. If there is a serious issue in that matter, you go to some authorities. If you did not address it officially and decided to attack the head people - sorry, it&#39;s not the way. That might suggest that there was no real issue as there were no serious actions;- policy change public announcement first then to your team: Yeah that&#39;s a big mistake, something that probably their books wouldn&#39;t even advise. Head people did not recognise  that this is not the way to manage fragile topics.Is DHH and Jason all evil?- These are the same guys that give equal pay regardless of remote worker location.- They were always believing in remote work, which is bigger problem for company and it&#39;s more of a benefit for the 
employees- Many times were vocal about issues with big companies, where many others did not have enough courage to do the same- Creators of a breakthrough tech stack and tremendous contributions to open-source- Always happily sharing their knowledgeThey made a mistake. But they don&#39;t seem to be bad guys here overall.In this context, the article seems to be written by someone who had some personal issues with the guys and he found a way to &#34;show&#39;em all&#34;. Even if it tells his version of the story, to me it&#39;s at least unfair and biased."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In the April discussion about the list of customer names, Singer posted to say that attempting to link the list to genocide was “absurd.” On the Friday call, he went further.“I strongly disagree we live in a white supremacist culture,” Singer said. “I don&#39;t believe in a lot of the framing around implicit bias. I think a lot of this is actually racist.”He continued: “Very often, if you express a dissenting view, you get called a Nazi. … I have not felt this is open territory for discussion. If we were to try to get into it as a group discussion it would be very painful and divisive.”Singer concluded his remarks. Fried responded, “Thank you, Ryan.”A handful of other speakers followed. Then a Black employee asked if the company could revisit Singer’s remarks. (I’m withholding the employee’s name and other identifying details out of colleagues’ fears that they could be targeted for harassment for speaking out.)--Interesting that comments objecting to political hyperbole gets the commenter suspended (leading to resignation) with his name all over the place, while those who called for his censure are deemed as needing to be protected from naming due to &#34;harrassment for speaking out&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi, all. Author of the project here. Sorry to have caused some confusion: this is part of a research project, and it&#39;s not yet meant to be terribly legible to a public audience.In the near-term, this project is about augmenting written texts so that readers can easily remember the key details. See https://quantum.country for an example or https://numinous.productions/ttft for detailed background and discussion."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some context: The author created https://quantum.country which is a text book augmented with spaced-repetition. It seems that Orbit is a toolkit for creating these types of flashcard/spaced-repetition learning webpages for anyone (with the user data being stored at Orbit&#39;s server).I&#39;ll have to say that I&#39;m still not 100% sure how useful this approach is. Most of the times when you&#39;re learning something you&#39;re not merely reading, but you&#39;re also actively using the knowledge in some way. If I&#39;m learning about B-trees then the major part of that learning process is implementing them. If I&#39;m learning some complicated math I will solve a bunch of exercises. Where does flashcards in a text book fit into this?It was also my impression (from the Anki community) that spaced-repetition is far more effective when you create the cards yourself. A common &#34;beginner mistake&#34; is to download a pre-made deck and start memorizing from scratch."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Since it doesn&#39;t look like this project has been discussed on HN before (though it was a bit hard to search for: https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;que...), I&#39;ve changed the title from &#34;Orbit is now open source&#34; to one that describes the project.Edit: ah, but the author&#39;s related essay has been discussed a couple times:Develop Transformative Tools for Thought - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26078115 - Feb 2021 (1 comment)How can we develop transformative tools for thought? - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22147212 - Jan 2020 (44 comments)How can we develop transformative tools for thought? - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21152542 - Oct 2019 (74 comments)"</p>

I have a dog and like to read and occasionally complain about politics.&#34;I&#39;d buy this if I saw it, if just for the lulz and nihilistic outlook when it comes to privacy.In fact... if I were a privacy-focused company, I&#39;d 100% do this as a marketing stunt."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A pretty cool piece.Too bad they have to use text to make their point. It would essentially reach zero people due to rules (https://www.facebook.com/business/learn/lessons/how-to-adher...). Then there&#39;s personal attributes (https://m.facebook.com/policies/ads/prohibited_content/perso...). Then ads that do not sell products/services follow murky rules, and talking about Facebook itself is usually prohibited. (edited from: because the rule they&#39;re actually breaking is the &#34;No Text&#34; rule in Facebook ad creatives.)Is there non-symbolic imagery that they could have used to say the same thing?Perhaps they should have retained someone with this kind of creative experience.Looking critically, the most narrow and serious obstacle to advocate for privacy is storytelling."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is both an ad for Signal and an ad for Facebook Ad&#39;s ability to target depending on who is reading it.What I mean is that for your average consumer, they&#39;ll read this and be horrified that Facebook is using the information they voluntarily gave Facebook to make money. But someone who is buying ads will read this same thing, be impressed by just how tightly Facebook can target, and put $10K into an Ad Account to try it out.As to me, I use Facebook, I am willing to see ads within Facebook using the information I share with Facebook but where I draw the line is Facebook &#34;leaking&#34; into my wider web browsing history (either tracking me, or using my non-Facebook browsing to advertise to me on Facebook). Therefore, I use Mozilla&#39;s Facebook Container extension and blacklist Facebook/Instagram&#39;s &#34;Share&#34; tracking buttons.I also access Facebook from a mobile browser rather than app and use Signal instead of Facebook Messager, to limit Facebook&#39;s ability to track my location and other phone meta-data."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Everyone: PLEASE stop making the argument that it&#39;s &#34;too hard&#34; or even &#34;impossible&#34; to implement spending limits.As the article points out: Every other cloud does this! They all have non-production subscription types with hard spending limits.There&#39;s a difference between &#34;unable&#34; and &#34;unwilling&#34;.The people that refuse to understand the difference are the same people that don&#39;t understand that &#34;unsupported&#34; isn&#39;t synonymous with &#34;cannot be made to function&#34;.Don&#39;t be that person.If you have a large account and you&#39;re in regular contact with an AWS sales representative, pressure them into making this happen. Even if you work for Megacorp with a $$$ budget, keep in mind that your future hires need to start somewhere, need to be able to learn on their own, and need to do so safely.Don&#39;t walk down the same path as IBM&#39;s mainframes, where no student anywhere ever has been able to learn on their own, making it a dead-end for corporations who pay billions for this platform. You, or your company will eventually pay this price if AWS keeps this IBM-like behaviour up.Think of the big picture, not just your own immediate personal situation.Apply this pressure yourself, because the students you want to hire next year can&#39;t."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"AWS employs cost obfuscation by design otherwise the default view when you open the console would show you all of your current active services. Not only is that not the case, a single screen to show you all of your current active services doesn&#39;t exist. You need to take a deep dive into cost explorer (assuming you have access in corporate land) and try to decipher in what that all means."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Random diamond story! As a freshman in college, I took a geology class and our teacher asked all of the women in our class to raise their hand if they would rather have natural or human-made diamonds. Most of the women (over 80%) raised their hands for natural. The reasons they gave all seemed to tie back to branding and natural diamonds being “real.”Then our teacher gave another analogy. He asked if people would rather have natural ice or human-made ice in their water. He broke down that the human-made ice could be frozen in a freezer to a custom size/shape, be a lot cleaner, consistent in how you make it, and chemically no different than H20 than naturally occurring frozen water. As you looked around the lecture hall, you started to see people’s brains unlock. He went on to explain cost efficiencies, ethics, challenges with conflict diamonds, and how you could make a perfect diamond at a fraction of the coast.After a 30 minute lecture, he asked the question again. Surprisingly, the majority of the women still wanted natural diamonds although the number was less than the original amount that raised their hand. That was the point where I realized the strength of diamonds product branding."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good for them. It&#39;s literally the same material, and we can now use scientific and engineering advances to remove the need for people to toil and die underground to get them.Hopefully the process is more environmentally friendly too.They are real diamonds.I find it hi-goddamned-larious that the moment these became viable, the industry switched from &#34;Diamond purity is the be-all and end-all and you must have the clearest, most pure&#34; to &#34;Oh, well of course it&#39;s all about having the right impurities to increase sparkle and character, lab-grown diamonds don&#39;t have character&#34;Just like with sapphires, if we&#39;re not there already I&#39;m sure it won&#39;t be long before exactly the right type and number of impurities or faults can be introduced to mimic any natural diamond."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you want to read about the insanity of manipulation in the diamond industry, this Atlantic article on de Beers from 1982 is a … gem.Of the many shocking moments, one that stood out to me was the way they went after post-war Japan to convert their &#34;backwards&#34; desires to ones of a more &#34;forward-thinking&#34; diamond friendly impulse:&#34;J. Walter Thompson began its campaign by 
 suggesting that diamonds were a visible 
 sign of modern Western values. It created 
 a series of color advertisements in Japanese 
 magazines showing beautiful women displaying 
 their diamond rings. All the women had 
 Western facial features and wore European 
 clothes. Moreover, the women in most of 
 the advertisements were involved in some 
 activity -- such as bicycling, camping, 
 yachting, ocean swimming, or mountain 
 climbing -- that defied Japanese traditions. 
 In the background, there usually stood a 
 Japanese man, also attired in fashionable 
 European clothes. In addition, almost all 
 of the automobiles, sporting equipment, and 
 other artifacts in the picture were conspicuous 
 foreign imports. The message was clear: 
 diamonds represent a sharp break with the 
 Oriental past and a sign of entry into modern life.&#34;&#34;The campaign was remarkably successful. Until 1959, 
 the importation of diamonds had not even been 
 permitted by the postwar Japanese government. When 
 the campaign began, in 1967, not quite 5 percent 
 of engaged Japanese women received a diamond 
 engagement ring. By 1972, the proportion had risen 
 to 27 percent. By 1978, half of all Japanese women 
 who were married wore a diamond; by 1981, some 60 
 percent of Japanese brides wore diamonds. In a 
 mere fourteen years, the 1,500-year Japanese 
 tradition had been radically revised. Diamonds 
 became a staple of the Japanese marriage. Japan 
 became the second largest market, after the United 
 States, for the sale of diamond engagement rings.&#34;https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1982/02/have-yo..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I feel a common issue with such &#34;dead bedroom&#34; discussions is the seeming lack of capacity of some parties (including some prominent toplevel comments here) to understand how deep a need for sex many people have.  To think sex can be replaced with &#34;strong friendships&#34; is laughable to anyone who actually feels a strong desire for sex.The dead bedroom situations I&#39;ve seen with my friends (M-&gt;F equally as well as F-&gt;M) are always the result of one party being incapable of understanding the other&#39;s desire for sex.  This leads them when pressed to try approaches such as, substituting &#34;being nicer&#34; for sex, trying therapy to reduce their partner&#39;s sex drive, or just forgetting about the problem because they are unable to sympathize with it.  Ideas such as initiating sex more often or opening up the relationship either don&#39;t occur to them, are vehemently opposed, or forgotten about.No-one is entitled to sex.  But individuals in a sexually-exclusive relationship are entitled to sympathy, action, and compromise from their partner to bridge severe differences in sexuality, just the same as any other sticking point in a relationship."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really like this post because it exudes nuance. So many problems are boiled down to terse summaries that are barely accurate when examining details.People being hateful and violent are a problem. More of a problem are the conditions that push people in this direction. When presenting the underlying cause, people push back and instead focus on scapegoating or minimizing.This problem occurs in engineering all the time too. We accrue &#34;tech debt&#34; and when it bites us we&#39;re quick to blame incompetence or bad luck. Nobody wants to hear that the problem is because we have to &#34;waste time&#34; working on hardly visible components that don&#39;t change anything except &#34;down the road.&#34;The problem is the same now. We blame &#34;bad apples&#34; and &#34;bad days&#34; instead of blaming our own culture and society and undertaking the effort to improve it. We try to make the world fit our own perspectives instead of critically examining our biases. We outright lie to ourselves, and I&#39;m frankly sick of it."</p>

I have had the privilege of having a decent job (being so-called &#34;economically desirable&#34;) and decent education and was able to find someone who I think loves me for who I am, for some definition of &#34;I am&#34;.That being said, the &#34;incel&#34; problem concerns me. I think the existence of this entire class of individuals shows that the ideals of equity in gender relations, just like the ideal of equity in relations across economic classes (i.e., being equal before the law, regardless of how much money you have) is obviously a grand ideal that we cannot live up to.I once tried talking to my girlfriend about it when the topic came up. I brought up the usual statistics that show that men graduate from college at a lesser rate than women, nowawdays. That they are more likely to die in violence or from drugs. That this compounds with the fact that the status of women in the world has generally raised (a _good_ thing!) and that the average woman wants someone who is above them on the social or economic ladder. Her response was that they had so much &#34;male privilege&#34; and that they have no excuse for underperforming. That, thus, they should still be _ahead_ of women, presumably, despite the goal being that they... shouldn&#39;t be. They need to pull themselves up from their bootstraps, and &#34;man up&#34;, but we also must remember that &#34;man up&#34; is a problematic term that is part of &#34;toxic masculinity&#34;.Of course, all of this was foreseen by French novelist Houellebecq. Economic liberalization has lead to social/sexual liberation. After a period of free love things settle down and here we are. Just as most of the new income generated by later periods of economic liberalization go to the top 20%, so it is with the sexual market.I&#39;ve tried to stop moralizing it for my own mental health. Like the author, I just try to look at it with a degree of sympathy. It&#39;s complex, and it&#39;s kinda fucked up. For myself, these hard statistical realities have increasingly robbed me of the romantic impulse. Marriage to me now seems absurd. An empty, pyrrhic victory."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Something that I&#39;ve noticed recently is that in my work life, I&#39;m finding there&#39;s more bureaucracy in what I do, mostly in the name of &#34;efficiency&#34;. When you encounter a problem to solve, there&#39;s often a process already defined that is most efficient (or at least thought to be most efficient), when accomplishing tasks, there&#39;s a pre-defined way of laying out the tasks (i.e. tickets), updating them, reviewing them, and organizationally figuring out what&#39;s best to do next.In my opinion, these processes are an attempt at organizational efficiency. However, the flip side is it reduces personal agency for the worker. There&#39;s little room to diverge or think about what you&#39;re doing. If you diverge, such as taking longer to do something than what was prescribed, or using a different pattern to solve a problem, there is a cost to you within the system. You must explain why, which itself &#34;costs&#34; something. In a sense, you&#39;re punished for doing things differently.That loss of personal agency is absolutely soul-sucking. You feel like a machine, again at the cost of organizational efficiency. Slack is definitely important because it lets people acquire some sense of personal agency again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"And this is why you schedule flights in the morning: there&#39;s so damn little slack in the system that if things go wrong at 10:00 AM at O&#39;Hare, flights for the whole rest of the day are screwed up owing to the cascading delays.At least in the morning the airlines have had the overnight to unsnarl the previous day&#39;s mess because of the reduced revenue traffic overnight and the corresponding slack that accrues as a happy side effect.This is also why things like the healthcare system, transportation network, and postal system shouldn&#39;t be run for maximum utilization/efficiency under normal load: if there isn&#39;t any slack in the system it gets real ugly when things get squirrelly. In cases of localized disturbance, we get by on mutual aid: linemen and bucket trucks from far away respond in the aftermath of e.g. a hurricane or tornado. Likewise, fire departments from all over The greater Boston area responded to the gas explosions in the Merrimack Valley[0] and companies from even further away repositioned trucks to cover the departments that responded directly.When it&#39;s national or global scale event, you&#39;re left leaning on whatever slack was in the system. As we&#39;re all painfully aware, there hasn&#39;t been enough. The public health and healthcare systems have been doing heroic work, but if they weren&#39;t stretched so tight in the name of efficiency beforehand, there&#39;d be less need for the heroic efforts.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrimack_Valley_gas_explosion..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really love my Bose headphones and in the past year I&#39;ve used them almost exclusively on my Mac.Started running into problems where because I didn&#39;t have visibility on the battery level they would die on me during focused work or meetingsI know there&#39;s some way to get the voice assistant to tell me the battery level but that&#39;s not as useful as being able to glance in the top-right hand corner and having to move from my keyboard to press some buttons I can&#39;t see on my head is a bit silly?So thanks to this repo (https://github.com/Denton-L/based-connect) and the ability to dump Bluetooth logs from Android to Wireshark I was able to figure out how the official Bose app communicates to the headphones not just to get information but also to send commands such as Connecting/Disconnecting paired devices, changing the noise canceling level and media controlIt wasn&#39;t all easy, there&#39;s not great support for Bluetooth in the JS world and I wanted it to be cross-platform one day so Swift was off the table but it turns out to use the SPP protocol on Macos you have to go through the IOBluetooth APIs - Thanks to Pyobjc I was able to call the native Objective-C api&#39;s from Python and thanks to Pybluez I was able to use an interface that was a complete replica of Python&#39;s built-in socketsWould to head some feedback"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Expected a github repo link but instead it&#39;s closed source and it costs $9 and it apparently doesn&#39;t even allow you to set the noise cancellation level. So it&#39;s $9 for an app that has two buttons that send bluetooth packets and it also reads the battery level in some clearly standard way because Android and iOS both show that natively. There&#39;s probably less than a screen worth of code.edit: looking at the tweet[1] it&#39;s an electron app... An electron mac app for $9. Let that sink in.[1] https://twitter.com/DannyAziz97/status/1389482681608679424"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"They forced us in high school to use a service called “TurnItIn” which I really disliked because they took ownership of your writing and added it to their database to diff against all future submissions.It’s supposed to prevent plagiarism, but it made me frustrated to be forced to aid in this system or fail.Being a public school student in the US sucks most of the time - no power and miserable adults. It’s like being imprisoned with some of the dumber, less successful people from the previous generation in charge of you and they have a lot of discretion over your future success.Some teachers are great obviously and make a huge difference, but many are truly awful.If they’re requiring services like turnitin as a matter of policy it’s not a surprise other stuff would be poorly handling student data too.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I work for a large educational company you have probably heard of on a product you may or may not have.I was on vacation a couple years ago, and in some downtime I was just scanning PRs awaiting code review, because I am bad at work/life balance. Lo and behold, there was a PR ready to go that would have exposed students directly to a third party. A reputable third party, but a third party nonetheless. It had the requisite votes but the user had not merged it. I very quickly threw up a blocking review and called my boss.I made quite a  stink about it to my boss, but he didn’t seem to think it was a big deal. I went up the chain to his boss, and he also didn’t see what the problem was. At this point I call my bosses boss and basically beg him to talk to legal about it. He does, and they put the kibosh on the whole thing right out the gate. I’m sure I burned some political capital that day, but in my book at least it was well worth it.Hanlon&#39;s Razor in full effect. Even then though, I know these people well and know they’re not dumb, the way the web is structured makes it really easy to expose people and not even realize it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"My understanding is that the vast majority of these M&amp;A destroy capital. The reason to own dividend stocks is not because they pay dividends but because they don&#39;t have tons of cash lying around to spend on low value projects or M&amp;A.It would be a lot more insightful to discuss the aquisitions that have a known positive impact. The truth is probably that each company had just a few very important acquisitions (that  should be more closely scrutinized).Our current tax laws make vertical integration or even conglomerates more tax efficient. Greater scrutiny of anti-competitive mergers is needed, but we should also make separate companies just as tax efficient (VAT tax, etc) and otherwise closely examine how we can change economic incentives here."</p>

https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot-vega-liteIt&#39;ll be very interesting to see this develop.  My initial reaction, as a vega-lite user is I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s worth learning the new API immediately.Having said that, I do find the idea of writing transforms in javascript compelling, and I can see there may be some situations in which this is a very elegant solution.I think the idea of a plotting library allowing transforms is initially a little jarring - feels potentially like poor separation of concerns.  But the more I think about it, the more it seems really logical: a lot of transforms (e.g binning) are done only for plotting purposes, in which case keeping them in the visualisation logic makes complete sense.Looking further ahead (not sure this is possible in Plot yet, but giving its integration with Observable I&#39;m sure it will be), the idea of a reactive model where charts can both react to user interactions, but also be the source of inputs (select a range, drag a bar, draw a distribution freehand) is very exciting.Transforms and signals are both possible in vega/vega lite, but I can definitely see the benefit of them being cleaner and being able to accept arbitrary javascript."</p>

It&#39;s under the eyes of everyone, and not enforcing such policy will only make it even worse for Amazon itself that eventually will end up selling only non-branded products. Finally it will be only another e-commerce like &#34;ebay&#34; used to be, and something else will replace it. Just enjoy the ride until you can.PS: speaking out of experience, I had one time a talk to a director from an important online shop (top 3 in the country in that specific field) and &#34;this sort of things&#34; was exactly the reason why they chose to use MS Azure instead of AWS. Imagine how deep it can go. And I totally support that.PPS: I don&#39;t understand the downvote.

Is this fundamentally different than Costco using sales data to choose which Kirkland products to launch/sell? If so, how? If not, then why do we not pursue Costco with the same gusto as Amazon? To me this behavior by Amazon seems worse, but I can&#39;t figure out why."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The most interesting part of the HN discussion is not about the definition of what Amazon is doing, but the occasional misunderstanding of how large brick and mortar retail businesses operate at scale (see: buying shelf space/payment dependant on sales/etc).There are lots of folks on here that understand what Amazon is doing, less who understand retail businesses mechanisms.I&#39;m not sure what Amazon is doing is legal (def will vary widely between the eu and us markets), but it is another interesting example of how doing something at scale can be perceived as fundamentally different then when it&#39;s done in a smaller way (especially as it pertains to privacy)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is an excellent example of what I call the Copy-Object-Copy effect.  It&#39;s particularly apparent in frameworks with ORMs like Django.  In Pandas case, devs will do &#39;SELECT *&#39; and use pandas as a sort of pseudo ORM.You run a query to get your data as a bunch of objects, but you&#39;re copying the data over the db connection from the postgres wire protocol into Python objects in memory, which are typically then garbage collected at the end of the transaction, then copy the result to a JSON buffer that is also garbage collected, and then send the final result to send to the browser which has been waiting this whole time.I regularly see Django apps require several gigs of RAM per worker and when you look at the queries, it&#39;s just a bunch of poorly rendered SELECTs.  It&#39;s grotesque.Contrast PostgREST:  100 megabytes of RAM per worker.  I&#39;ve seen Django DRF workers require 50 to 1 memory vs PostgREST for the same REST interface and result with PostgREST being much faster. Since the database is generating the json, it can do so immediately upon generating the first result row which is then streamed to the browser.  No double buffering.Unlike Django, it&#39;s not that I don&#39;t like Pandas, it&#39;s that people way overuse it for SQL tasks as this article points out.  I&#39;ve seen pandas scripts that could be a simpler psql script.  If psql can&#39;t do what you want, resist the temptation to &#39;SELECT *&#39; into a data frame and break the problem up into stages where you get the database to do the maximum work before it gets to the data frame."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Pandas is a very popular tool for data analysis. It comes built-in with many useful features, it&#39;s battle tested and widely accepted. However, pandas is not always the best tool for the job.SQL is very useful, but there are some data manipulations which are much easier to perform in pandas/dplyr/data.table than in SQL. For example, the article discusses how to perform a pivot table, which takes data in a &#34;long&#34; format, and makes it &#34;wider&#34;.In the article, the pandas version is:&gt;pd.pivot_table(df, values=&#39;name&#39;, index=&#39;role&#39;, columns=&#39;department&#39;, aggfunc=&#39;count&#39;)Compared to the SQL version:&gt;SELECT
    role,
    SUM(CASE department WHEN &#39;R&amp;D&#39; THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as &#34;R&amp;D&#34;,
    SUM(CASE department WHEN &#39;Sales&#39; THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as &#34;Sales&#34;
FROM
    emp
GROUP BY
    role;Not only does the SQL code require you to know up front how many distinct columns you are creating, it requires you to write a line out for each new column. This is okay in simple cases, but is untenable when you are pivoting on a column with hundreds or more distinct values, such as dates or zip codes.There are some SQL dialects which provide pivot functions like in pandas, but they are not universal.There are other examples in the article where the SQL code is much longer and less flexible, such as binning, where the bins are hardcoded into the query."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The more I learn SQL, the less I write Python.Although the SQL syntax is weird and so dated, its portability across tools trumps everything else. You finished the EDA and decided to port the insights to a dashboard? With SQL it&#39;s trivial. With Python... well, probably you&#39;ll have to port it to SQL unless you have Netflix-like, Jupyter-backed dashboard infrastructure in place. For many of us who only have much-more-prevalent SQL-based dashboard platform, why not starting from SQL? Copy-n-paste is your friend!I still hate the SQL as a programmer, but as a non-expert data analyst I now have accepted it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"A few tenuous ones it seems not mentioned yet.The title &#34;UNIX MAGIC&#34; is arguably on a banner(1).The wall(1) visible through the window.  (On NetBSD there was also a window(1) utility.)The peak visible through the window in the distance could be mount(1) ________.And of course, there is a man(1) visible through the window.The prominent display of the wizard&#39;s fingers, as in finger(1), in the foreground is probably intentional.Having so many things hanging is probably not a coincidence.Nor is the fact that the shell has an overflow.The streams flowing from the tubes and from a head(1).The object in the tar bucket appears to be composed of segments.Arguably awk is written on what appears to be a block, as in badblocks(1).The ring on top(1) of diff with the string/line, as in strings(1), must have some significance.From the wizard&#39;s hat hangs something with various initials, maybe a tape, a tail(1) or a strip(1).Perhaps the crack in &#34;B&#34; is supposed to mean something.Also, there must be some significance to the question mark/ankh shaped hook on the stirrer in the shell.  Maybe a it is a broken link(1).This just shows another great thing about UNIX.  They took names from common things.  None of the silly names we see today, especially the ones people choose for &#34;tech&#34; companies.The artist should have had the wizard pouring some buffer solution.  Then the overflow would be even better.The &#34;lid&#34; on the oregano, whether intentional or not, is a nice touch.  https://www.etymonline.com/word/lid"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I believe I have one of the originals in my shared office on campus.  The poster was originally taped to the wall in Polya Hall.  I took it down (as carefully as I could) and put it into a basic poster frame I purchased from Michaels.  It will remain in that office unless/until our group moves elsewhere (in which case it will come with us) or I leave Stanford (in which case it will go to whomever else is in that office)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;d like to clarify that my code was running only on machines that were otherwise idle. Not many people were in the lab late in the evenings. MPQS processing nodes could be added and removed dynamically, so if somebody needed a computer that was part of my cluster, they could just quit my program and everything would go back to normal.Also, once the number theory professor learned of what I had implemented, he worked out an agreement with the lab manager to give me legitimate access to the machines. :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In 19 and 82 or 3, I worked at Lockheed Shipyard in Seattle, in a sort of tech writing capacity on a Navy ship building project, based on my recent experience in the Navy. The business closed with completion of the ships.We had to fill out lots of forms that documented what we called &#34;analysis,&#34; and we&#39;d often have to change them based on some factor changing. One change could cascade through the whole form.Paper forms. Green see-through plastic letter guides. Whiteout. Lots of whiteout.We had access to a department mini computer, don&#39;t remember what it was. The language might have been Basic-like, but I didn&#39;t know enough to recognize it as such.I figured out how to write and run programs, someone showed me how to print, and I wrote a program that would accept values for all a form&#39;s fundamental values, and cascade those through calculations for the dependent values, and print out the filled in form. You could save it, update a new value, re-cascade, and print it out again. No more whiteout.Part of the calculation involved sorting. I didn&#39;t know anything about sorting, so I implemented what I later learned was bubble sort. Because that&#39;s obviously how you&#39;d do that.The system administer noticed more load when people ran my program. He found me, and told me not to do that again.I learned that there was a thing called a system administrator. He might have given me a better canned sort, don&#39;t remember.I eventually thought it would be a good idea to quit and go to school, so I did.(I took a number theory class, but had to drop it. I don&#39;t have the math nature.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ah yes, good memories. I&#39;m having a really hard time right now remembering the name of that program that blocked access to the Finder; I think it was &#34;Easy&#34;-something. Google fails me on the name too. Breaking it was a hobby.Some school labs had left access to Hypercard available through that program, so you could just pull up Hypercard and make a new stack that would tell the program to quit.The other way to get around it -- or around many other misbehaving programs in the cooperative multitasking system -- was to bring up the programmer&#39;s interrupt like the author describes, and enter &#34;SM 0 A9F4&#34;, followed by &#34;G 0&#34;. This would set memory location 0 to the _exitToShell function in the OS ROM and then resume execution from there, which immediately terminated whatever was in the foreground.The rest of the system would often be a little unstable after that though, so you only had a few moves left before a restart would be needed.To youths with curious mindsets, an anti-authoritarian streak, and seemingly limitless amounts of free time, little restrictions like these only improved our skills. Systems with challenging but imperfect security are a great way to foster new young talent."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s a part in the Foundation series by Asimov where the Galactic civilization has forgotten how their technology works. They have all this amazing technology, things that generate free energy and terraform planets or whatever, and all that&#39;s left are technicians who kind of know that if you push this button that thing is supposed to happen, but they have no idea what the machine is actually doing internally or the physical principles on which it operates. When the machines break, no one is able to fix them.I think about this a lot and the world seems more and more like this every day."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At the core of it, the very core of it, tech is waged work. Just like in manufacturing, which was outsourced quite prolifically. Tech isn&#39;t special in this regard.The thing that hasn&#39;t come about yet though is, sales, marketing, accounting can also be outsourced. Dare I say automated. It is at the end of the day, still waged work. Marketing is not an asset class. Accounting isn&#39;t capital ownership. Fabrication is a tool, tech is a tool, social media is a tool.The moment that this sort of stuff gets automated there will be a reckoning on how businesses are built in western society. I don&#39;t mean a saleforce competitor with a slicker UI, I mean completely abstracting away payroll and the like.Imagine for a moment:You could say to anyone, &#34;I like the work you do want to work for me?&#34; either in person, online, even here. They say yes. Now suddenly a pipeline process kicks off, like a CICD for recruitment. You have your budget metrics all in place, the receiver has their negotiation asks, etc. And AI hashes out a negotiation, in browser or on your phones etc. comes up with a negotiation contract, highlights the important bits or deal breakers that need a higher level sign off. &#34;Click &#39;Yes&#39; to work.&#34; Done. Hired. Here&#39;s your onboarding package and account credentials, your paycheck comes in at the end of the month.All the while, the two people at the table or on twitter have just been continuing on with their lives. Nobody talked to HR. Nobody had to manually do filings with the IRS. The business owner never opened a dashboard or logged in to their negotiation.ai account. It is not this easy at the moment. But no rule of physics says it can&#39;t be in the future.Entire classes of work could crumble while people could create in a much more competitive manner."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From DoD &#34;2020 Industrial Capabilities Report to Congress&#34;[1] page 9:&gt; issues confronting our defense industrial base [...] first has been the steady deindustrialization of the United States over the past five decades, including workforce and manufacturing innovation [...] While total manufacturing output has grown during this period, [...] the workforce on which a defense industrial renaissance would depend has become [...] an endangered species.&gt; Together, a U.S. business climate that has favored short-term shareholder earnings (versus long-term capital investment), deindustrialization, and an abstract, radical vision of “free trade,” without fair trade enforcement, have severely damaged America’s ability to arm itself today and in the future.  Our national responses – off-shoring and out-sourcing – have been inadequate and ultimately self-defeating, especially with respect to the defense industrial base.&gt; These trends have had particular impact on the core element of a successful manufacturing economy: the machine tool industry.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A couple of frequent mistakes with signin which are usually caused by junior product owners/ux persons not reflecting on what they are doing and blindly copying what they believe is the way to do things.- Having confusing language and poor differentiation between the sign in and sign up form. Symptom, users start filling in the wrong form only to realize their mistake.- Separating the password from the email field with an extra mouse click sucks if you are using a password manager. Doubly so on mobile where using password managers involve a bit of fiddly interactions. Having to do this twice sucks. If you do this, at least have one of the fields in the dom tree but hidden so that it gets filled with one click via your password manager.- Not making the login form password manager friendly my not sticking to conventions for field names for this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Great work and even more surprising: a great writeup (writing that as someone who always struggles to document my own work). This really gives me hope to have an usable, native Linux on the M1 machines.I really wished Apple would see, how much benefit this would bring to their platform. Their new hardware is really exciting, the first ARM on the desktop, which doesn&#39;t just compete, but in many aspects beat current x86 chips. A lot of the Linux and tech enthusiast crowd would love to jump onto Apple Silicon. And while they might not bring huge profits by themselves, these are the people who do come up with great new technologies. Better give them a home on Apple devices. It doesn&#39;t need a complete and formal documentation of every aspect, just supporting those projects with a little bit of information would go a long way. A single engineer who would answer questions by those developers might be sufficient. So come on, Apple, do it! :)"</p>

I am eternally grateful for this; the Samsung Kevin I use is the only blobless laptop currently in production, and now it has 3D accelerated graphics thanks to her work!But part of me is sad to see her working on such closed hardware now.Does anybody think Linux on the M1 will ever be able to touch the internal SSD?  Apple has been locking that down with proprietary controllers and signed firmware since their Intel days (i.e. T1 chip).  Are people really going to drag around their shiny new macbooks with an external USB-C dongle hanging off of it because that&#39;s required in order to run Linux?I worry that the endgame here is Linux becoming Just Another MacOS App.  Apple is quite happy for Linux to be a MacOS app running in their VM.  Elite developers will buy Macbooks and run Linux in a VM because &#34;we&#39;ll have Linux on the bare metal soon, it&#39;s just temporary&#34; and that will just keep getting pushed back and pushed back and pushed back..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Please don’t let your excitement take your focus off this part of the story:&gt; The good news gets even better; non-AMP pages make considerably more revenue per pageview than AMP pages. Initially, I assumed this was due to the nature of how ads load on AMP, however, recent Antitrust lawsuits have proposed that hindering ad competition was a feature and that all non-amp ad tags, such as my company, Ezoic’s, were delayed by 1 second to make them less effective. It is also alleged that Google let their own exchange win, even when someone else bid more!Somewhere, in a parallel universe, people are going to jail and paying substantial fines for this behavior. In this universe, however, politicians don’t seem to think there is a moral hazard in the fact that those of us who work in this industry see what happened and think, “if you get big enough, it doesn’t matter if you get caught.”"</p>

Your work is really an inspiration. You computer scienced the sheet out of this thing.this achievement, and this blog post, to me is on par with blog posts that you would see from a major company where they solve some significant business critical technical challenge in-house. for example: the GitHub blog post about how they created their spinning globe of commits on their homepage, or a Netflix blog post of how they optimized their Network infrastructure to serve so many customers.your work is truly incredible.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My $1200 7 year old Miele dishwasher stopped working a few months ago, with the “Intake/drain” light on red when starting a load. Dishwashers during the pandemic were sort of scare due to massive home remodeling demand, and the professional repair people would have cost $300 just to diagnose, so I went to try to fix it myself.It turns out the water intake valve solenoid was jammed or gummed up somehow, as applying 120V to it directly had no effect. I went to find an OE replacement online only to find that they are $580, sold by only 2 places, and sold out. You need to be a certified Miele technician to buy them.Given I knew the specifications from the model number and the printing on the solenoid itself wrt voltage and flow rate, I bought the cheapest replacement I could find on Amazon, spliced the wires into the existing harness and boom, it worked perfectly.One thing I didn’t understand was why there were so many different inlet valves that all did the same thing. There were 120V AC and 12V DC versions but other than that the only difference was the water connector/dongle/bracket. It seemed absurd there would be so many but the reality is that actual solenoid is super generic and should only cost $20 and should be made to fit them all. Of course nobody really repairs things these days but I think this is the reason why. Even when the part could easily be standardized and replaced/repaired like a light bulb, companies want you to buy a whole new one."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Actual news about hacking! It is interesting that this is in the UK ... i&#39;m fairly sure most rents come with a full-sized dishwaster when furnished and all properties have the plumbing for one. I&#39;m not sure what the market is. Especially that one of the main value adds was &#34;no mess&#34; when our dishwashers all accept pre-form tablets for detergent.Anyway, I adore these kinds of blog posts. Tinkering, naughtiness and a big dollop of technical knowhow."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Loved the obsessiveness! FWIW the entire beer-brewing industry runs on NaOH for cleaning and sanitising. Disposing of it is not quite as environmentally-friendly as the dishwasher manufacturer seems to want you to believe -- in most places you&#39;d be in serious trouble if you poured any significant quantity down the drain.eta: I&#39;ve just looked up the constituents of the dishwasher tablets we&#39;ve been using, and yes, indeed, they&#39;re mostly NaOH, an inert carrier (Na2SO4) and a variety of water-softeners, packaging films to keep everything in tablet form (but soluble) and a small number of helper enzymes, perfumes and whiteners. Looks like a teaspoon of NaOH might work justabout as well. :D"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A common one is fake consent popups for system notifications.Websites need to ask for consent before sending system notifications via the Notifications API. If a user declines, that website is blocked from asking again (for obvious reasons)But many websites cheat this by showing a fake consent popup designed to mimic what the browser would show. If a user clicks &#34;Decline&#34; on the fake popup, the website won&#39;t show the real one to avoid being blocked. So the next time you visit the site, they&#39;ll be able to show you that popup again as many times as they want.If a user finally clicks &#34;Accept&#34; on the fake popup (out of frustration probably) then they&#39;ll show the real popup. To most people, seeing two popups might seem like a glitch, and will just mindlessly click &#34;Accept&#34; twice.The only way to circumvent this is to click &#34;Accept&#34; on the fake popup, and then click &#34;Decline&#34; on the real one. 99% of people aren&#39;t going to know how to do that....I&#39;d post this myself as a comment, but I don&#39;t like that it&#39;s asking for so much personal information (full name, email, state, city, phone, etc)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The &#34;hold-your-offline-device-hostage-until-you-attempt-to-connect&#34; pattern. It goes something like this:When setting up a new unlinked kindle device, Amazon tries to trick you into connecting to the internet by showing a wifi setup screen that cannot be skipped. The only way to skip it is to supply the device with bad credentials and let it attempt to connect and fail. Only when it fails will it allow its owner to skip that step.Microsoft has also started employing the same strategy in windows 10. Within the first year of setting up windows 10 locally, the user will be presented with a screen they can&#39;t dismiss until they link their local user account with an online microsoft account. Again, the workaround here is to let windows try to connect with bad credentials. Once it has failed to login, it will allow the user, a child who urgently needed to get to her online classes in my case, to skip this step.Words can&#39;t describe the contempt I have for companies who engage in these patterns."</p>

Like others I&#39;m running the &#34;native-comp&#34; branch of Emacs, since months, without any issue.It&#39;s now been merged into trunk and it&#39;s going to be the default:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26935401The only drawback I saw is that compiling Emacs itself takes 3x to 4x longer when compiling the native-comp branch."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think that nativecomp represents a huge leap forward for emacs. I continually give kudos to Andrea Corallo and the entire team for making this a possibility.I think that the next major leap for emacs needs to involve the garbage collector and allocation logic. I think that a large class of performance optimizations would be possible with an improved GC, including improvements to emacs existing threading capabilities."</p>

I&#39;ve been using for more than a year on macOS and NixOS, and it&#39;s been superb (though from time to time I clear downloaded packages and the native cache just in case).  It&#39;s definitely an impressive feat of engineering as well. If you haven&#39;t seen the developer&#39;s website on it[0], you should definitely check it out.For Nix users on macOS, see[1].

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I spent years working on the Ubuntu phone. It was a fully convergent device: by default it would present a phone UI, but plugin an a keyboard and screen and it presents a full desktop UI. The UI was designed by a team of brilliant professional designers and it was a technical success.Why isn&#39;t it around any more?(1) The carriers. Many people get a free or heavily subsidized phone from their carrier, who makes money from the data charges. Carriers were just not interested in phones from smaller manufacturers, and it&#39;s not entirely clear that there is no backflow of cash involved at higher levels. There is also the issue of controlling access to user metadata, always a profitable exercise.(2) The manufacturers: why would they put a third-party OS on their phone when they control the entire stack from the silicon to the end-user&#39;s metadata through their in-house Android fork? They can sell hardware at a negative margin if they can profit from selling access to metadata, or possibly data.(3) The apps. Developers want to target the biggest, most lucrative markets so they target Android and iPhone which already have a critical mass. You could provide a container to run Android apps on Ubuntu, but then you end up with no differentiating factor except your Android apps look like crap in desktop mode. Running in a container can also restrict the kind of data collection many apps rely on for monetization.Another problem with apps is that many web services check to see whether the device is iPhone or Android and respond accordingly. Like the browser checks of yore (&#34;you need at least IE 6 to use this site, try updating to a newer browser!&#34;) this gives a less satisfactory experience to end users."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t understand the desire for a Linux phone as so described in the article as a daily driver.The Android platform represents an enormous amount of work that encompasses a more secure base kernel, an unparalleled selection of applications designed for mobile usage and written in a memory-safe language, fantastic sandboxing and user privacy features leagues ahead of any desktop operating system, and great diversity in the hardware market.While it&#39;s apparent that Android has significant downsides - de facto proprietary drivers, an environment of mostly closed-source applications, some Big G integration, and a general lack of long-term updates occasionally countering the work put into security (thanks, chip manufacturers: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26593274), these are problems that can be solved. It doesn&#39;t make sense to throw the baby out with the bathwater.Closed-source applications are more a moral problem than a security one thanks to Android&#39;s sandboxing, and a vibrant ecosystem of high-quality free-and-open-source Android applications (https://f-droid.org - Amaze, Notally, QKSMS, and Tasks are some of my favorites) makes them all but optional. Google&#39;s presence in the AOSP codebase is rather limited (mostly around notifications) and taken out altogether by custom ROMs like Lineage and GrapheneOS. Proprietary drivers remain as Android&#39;s biggest problem, perhaps alongside the manufacturers that ship locked-down phones with bloatware (looking at you, Samsung).Why go the desktop-Linux-to-mobile route when you could fork Android, write drivers for the Pinephone / Librem 5, punch a hole to the base system for privileged applications, and have the best of both worlds with an order of magnitude less effort?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d be shocked if it took off. The FOSS development paradigm seems to be allergic to good UI design, and this is far more important for people on mobile than desktop."</p>

It&#39;s an open platform and it&#39;s one of the only places you can access all streaming services (I think?).

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I consider myself a very politically informed person. I&#39;m not a politically active person however, largely for the reasons mentioned in the article.I considered myself a liberal by the standards of the time I grew up in. My views on some social issues, particularly &#39;free speech&#39;, are considered a conservative now. I am one of the people the article is concerning who will not publicly voice their political opinions in the workplace for fear of potential repercussions. One thing that particularly upsets me, is how willingly other people bring up politically sensitive issues in the workplace. I regularly hear woefully uninformed diatribes on geopolitics and American domestic politics (I do not live in America) in the workplace. Even correcting people who are clearly misinformed on clear matters of fact can cause offense. As a result, I do not enter into such discussions.I feel as though I am more open-minded than many others. I am always ready to be corrected if I am wrong, and I am always willing to discuss my views with people subscribing to other political ideologies. However, I fear the repercussions of offending others who do not have an open mind. I also feel as though many politically active people are not acting in good faith. I feel that the safest option I will not regret is not to engage."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Only nine percent of the British adults we surveyed described politics as “very important” to their sense of identity, and only 22 percent had shared any political content on their social channels in the previous year&gt; When it comes to speaking their minds at work, one of these tribes—home of the “Progressive Activist”—is not like the others.  “A powerful and vocal group for whom politics is at the core of their identity,” as More in Common describes them.i see this more and more. the loud few make a lot of noise, the majority just want to do their jobs. companies have to cater to everyone... but at some point there’s too much virtue signaling at work"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#39;For two-thirds of the population, talking politics sincerely, on the job, is uncomfortable. People who hold certain, commonplace views, stay silent believing that expressing those views will carry penalty not reward. &#39;This sounds like a recipe for disaster for any company. When I worked in the UK no part of my job description was about &#39;talking politics sincerely&#39; or sharing my &#39;commonplace views&#39;. I did that in the pub afterwards.&#39;Ethical Systems&#39; appear to be a great way to stir up rancor and division with the usual cocktail of racialisation (the new segregationists) and genderisation of everything. I can&#39;t see how this would help productivity or enhance people&#39;s work lives in any shape or form. It reminds me of the first frame of a Dilbert cartoon."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Notarization has been a nightmare of a solution to a problem that isn&#39;t effective. You can get practically as much security by pushing malware signatures to the client without the massive privacy overreach of having Apple archive each and every bit of code that you generate for distribution.This is just Apple&#39;s overreach extended to the desktop. Excessive control that makes developer&#39;s lives hell while adding barely any security on top."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wrote a little sh script to notarize HandBrake two (or maybe three) years ago, and that&#39;s was it. It&#39;s not rocket science. But like every new thing, it required a bit of time to read the documentation and to understand what&#39;s going on.The plugin issue described in the article is probably related to the hardened runtime, so it&#39;s unrelated to the actual notarisation process."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The initial setup is a bit of a pain (and the documentation is a bit lacking - though much better than most Apple documentation - particularly for edge cases like mine, distributing a screensaver), but to Apple&#39;s credit the process is pretty solid and is now consistently quick. I&#39;ve notarized dozens of builds of Aerial since the requirement was announced and I think only once did I have to wait to release because their service was stuck.Minor tip: Stapling, while optional, should be recommended (and might as well be mandatory) to everyone that notarize (you staple a certificate signed from Apple that avoids the call home when the user tries to open your software).The only thing that slightly irks me is the contract situation, if you have a &#34;paid&#34; developer account, you absolutely need to sign any update to the &#34;paid app&#34; contract from the App Store even when you want to notarize an &#34;out of store&#34;, open source app.Plus it breaks my script every time..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Slightly off-topic, but... am I the only one who is troubled by the fact that the explanations of &#34;fork and exec&#34; are almost never, ever, discuss the rationale for picking this design instead of &#34;CreateProcess()&#34; a.k.a. &#34;just_launch_this_exe_file()&#34;, or even acknowledge this alternative design? A student would probably expect that to launch an app, there is a system call that would do exactly that: you pass it the name of the application/executable file, and it launches. Instead, there is a small dance of duplicating itself and then re-writing one of the copies--try not to get tangled up in the legs while doing that!The fork+exec has many unobvious advantages over CreateProcess, but also disadvantages, and one of them is that it&#39;s, in my opinion, a completely unexpected approach: I can&#39;t think of any other system object that can only be created by first copying another already existing object and then overwriting the newly created one if needed. Files of any kind (folder/pipe/socket/etc)? Memory mappings? Signal handling? Process groups/sessions? Users/groups? The processes seem to be unique in this regard. How did people come up with this approach? That would be an interesting discussion, I think.Instead, it&#39;s just described as the completely self-justified, with description of &#34;zombies&#34; thrown in the end for boots: and the zombie processes are pretty much an accidental artifact of early UNIX design; if the fork was returning not only globally visible (and therefore unstable) PID but also an fd associated with the child process, neither wait/waitpid syscalls nor reaping duties of PID 1 would have been necessary."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This seems highly focused on systems; I wouldn&#39;t call it representative of &#34;Computer Science&#34; as a whole.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Summary for those that don’t want to watch the video :- Pianist creates YouTube video demonstrating how to play Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata- part of this video includes her playing Moonlight Sonata (of course)- YouTube has a new ‘feature’ that scans submitted videos prior to publication to identify potentially copyrighted material- her video is found to include copyrighted material. She is certain this is a mistake that will be rectified by disputing the copyright claim- she agrees the only person who’s content she is reproducing is Beethoven himself- her copyright dispute is rejected. She is found to be violating the copyright of a piece called “Wicca Moonlight”- she can appeal the dispute but the appeal process is limited, and she risks getting a feared “copyright strike” on her account, wherein three such strikes would mean permanent closure of the account- she says nearly anyone can file copyright claims against published YouTube videos, including bots, and is worried about all the time she’s putting in to create content being usurped by a few bad actors"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve already stated this many times, I&#39;ll state it again.Get your shit out of YouTube and any other Google product.Google is a dumb, faceless, fully automated company only interested in extracting as much data as possible from its users, force them to swallow as many ads as possible, all without caring about listening to them (both consumers and creators), under the faulty assumption that they&#39;re too big for users and consumers to live without them. They simply don&#39;t deserve anybody using their shitty products anymore.The error in this case is quite obvious. YouTube&#39;s scanner incorrectly identified the teacher&#39;s recording of Moonlight Sonata as a copyrighted reinterpretation of the same piece of music originally written by a guy who actually died 200 years ago. And I can&#39;t completely put the blame on Google&#39;s AI: the notes are technically the same, the beat might also be the same, if you calculate an FFT of the audio you&#39;ll probably also come up with similar spectral signatures. But a human listener will IMMEDIATELY notice that was played by the teacher IS NOT the the same as the copyrighted piece of music.The problem is: who is accountable for these mistakes? Who shall I reach out to if Google&#39;s foggy algorithms make a mistake? And, in the case of educators and creators who actually do that for a job, who will compensate them for the revenue they have lost because of algorithmic errors?Until Google can provide an answer to these questions, I repeat: keep your ass away from anything that has their name on it. They are not reliable, the risk of losing your data, your account or your followers because of random automated decision is very high, and the probability of getting a real human to assist you is very low."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Along the same lines, I was publishing church services each Sunday between May and December of last year, with three English hymns in each, mostly old ones well-known across denominations. In total, I got 23 Content ID claims (about 20% of the hymns), claiming ownership of the melody. Every single one was for a work in the public domain. I disputed each, providing the name and date of death of the composer.Two were released (one after three days, the other after 27), the rest were allowed to lapse in my favour (which happens after 30 days).A few of these claims were duplicates (same claimer, same hymn). This showed that even though I had successfully disputed their claim in the past in the grounds of the work being in the public domain, YouTube had not revoked their ability to claim the melody in question.If any of the liars claiming they owned these works had rejected my dispute, it could have become a strike, &amp;c. and there would of course be no recourse, because Google generally refuses to arbitrate.Also, an insidious aspect of the claims system was that YouTube basically didn’t tell you about the copyright claim at all when publishing; you had to close the edit page for the video and return to the list, and see if the Restrictions column for the video said “Copyright claim”. If you didn’t do that, the video would probably be being monetised by the claimer in at least some of the world (and if you disputed it, I guess Google would happily take the lot for the period while they had monetised it—though now that they’re putting ads on everything, this lot isn’t so different from the usual situation; depends on whether you hate the balance of the ad money going to the copyright liars or Google more).(There was also one amusing case where some music being played at a nearby temple was audible during a quiet time in the service, and so I found out the name of the music being played. I claimed fair use on that one, because I didn’t even want that music in it, and it was quiet. That claim was released after ten days.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As Linus points out, the utility of shared libraries depends on the situation. Widely used libraries like libxcb, libGL, and zlib that tend to have reasonably stable ABIs are good candidates for sharing, while the &#34;couple of libraries that nobody else used. Literally nobody&#34; should obviously be statically linked. Software engineering is mostly about learning how to choose which method is appropriate for the current project.However, there important advantage of using .so files instead of building into a big statically linked binary is NOT that a library can be shared between different programs! The important benefit is dynamic linking. The ability to change which library is being used without needing to rebuild the main program is really important. Maybe rebuilding the program isn&#39;t practical. Maybe rebuilding the program isn&#39;t possible because it&#39;s closed/proprietary or the source no longer exists. If the program is statically linked, then nothing can happen - either it works or it doesn&#39;t. With dynamic linking, changes are possible by changing which library is loaded. I needed to use this ability last week to work around a problem in a closed, proprietary program that is no longer supported. While the workaround was an ugly LD_LIBRARY_PATH hack, at least it got the program to run."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Note to 1-bit people: saying that &#34;X is not a good thing in general&#34;, is not the same as saying that &#34;X is a bad thing in general&#34;. All that&#39;s being said here is &#34;tradeoffs exist&#34; and highlighting some issues some people apparently like to ignore.One of my favorite libraries is SDL. Of course, when SDL2 came out, they moved away from the LGPL license to a more liberal zlib license, which allows static linking without infecting the license of your project. Great, except now as years go by and games are abandoned, they stop working in new environments, or at least don&#39;t work as well, and you can&#39;t just force in a new dynamic version of SDL to save things like you used to be able to.The solution they came up with: even if the program is static linked, the user can define an environmental variable to point to a dynamic lib and that will be used instead. Best of both worlds, at least going forward for programs that use a version of SDL2 that incorporates the feature. (Some more details: https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1upn39/sdl2_a...)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The main supposed benefit is not disk or memory economy, but central patching.The theory is as follows: If a security flaw (or other serious bug) is found, then you can fix it centrally if you use shared libraries, as opposed to finding every application that uses the library and updating each separately.In practice this doesn&#39;t work because each application has to be tested against the new version of the library."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So a while ago a i remembered one post from HN, it was some guy crawling google play store and keeping apps that were paid and people used them but had a low rating. He was selling this list, not sure if it was successful but i made something similar and updatedSo far checking only 3 marketplaces, my crawlers found so far about 100k apps, the default filters show only the more interesting once (paid and low rating)Its free.I will add more and more marketplaces eventually. I will also try to add some social features, like &#34;working as a team on some idea&#34; and posting own ideas, but will see how it goes.Feedback welcomeEDIT: i just see it on mobile, it does not look ideal. Will need to work on that hm.EDIT2: just added pagination :), hope it works for you."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good luck tring to do a better job replacing these on Android where every device x android version permutation out there = something breaks for a different user.Like the &#34;Automatic Call Recorder Pro&#34; (highest number of ratings on the list) has &#34;try the free version first to see if this will work on your phone&#34; ... I feel sorry for Android developers. As much as I dislike the &#34;Apple way&#34; of designing products (walled gardens and super opinionated instead of open and providing choices), every time I need to develop something for Android I&#39;m flabergasted at how shit the platform is under the hood. Soo many APIs to do the same thing, depricated system APIs all over the place, but the only way to do things on devices X, but only from manufacturer Y, on Z the API functionality isn&#39;t even supported, on W you need to use newer APIs, on Q you need to use a custom solution - nobody really uses Q but your client got 3 complaints and can&#39;t determine priorities (understandable given the ecosystem fragmentation)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Do ratings actually matter? The only time I look at them is when it’s an Indie game and I want to see people’s impressions of it. Even still, I’ll go on Reddit and find the reviews there.I say this because I have seen excellent but popular apps have very low ratings just because they are popular. Also, when someone gives it a low rating because of a bug that’s fixed 2 days later, is there a mechanism to take that into account?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This reads out exactly how a manic or hypomanic person would experience things and rationalize past events and feelings. The idea that it has to be something complex and in a sense grandiose compared to &#34;just being burned out&#34; is often a very telling sign.Perhaps it&#39;s Twitter forcing the format a little, but I could see myself thinking like this during a hypomanic episode. I&#39;m diagnosed with bipolar disorder (type 2, rapid cycling).

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Does anyone remember that Reddit post where a guy thought his landlord was sneaking into his apartment and leaving him notes? He insisted the handwriting was completely different. Then a poster suggested he get tested for CO poisoning, which it was, and the “different handwriting” was actually a part of his delusion.“Burning out all of the glucose and dopamine in your brain” isn’t a thing. “Functional Neurological Disorder” is another name for Conversion Disorder - a condition of apparently neurological symptoms  inconsistent with neurological anatomy or mechanisms, triggered (most often) by significant stressors, often suffering a longer duration in patients who strongly believe “this is definitely a physical disease!”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Same exact symptoms (the bass guitar string he heard is a thing that gave me ptsd like symptoms/crippling anxiety for a long time after) I had from a TIA when I was overworked. He waited getting a scan so they could&#39;ve missed it later; my office was next to the hospital: nothing showed on the CT one hour after but on the RMI a couple of hours after they found a tiny lesion in one of the regions involved in forming speech (which, like him, I had issues with for a bit). Sounds more likely than glucose to me but that is because this looks too familiar to me.Edit: with symptoms like this, treat it as an emergency, do not wait. I do not even understand how you go to sleep and not the hospital if you actually suspect a stroke? Within 3 hours they can do a lot even for far more serious strokes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been saying this from the start: the well of issues is infinitely deep as soon as you decide that multiple tenants running on the same physical hardware inferring something about another is a vulnerability. I assert, but cannot rigorously prove, that it is not possible to design a CPU such that execution of arbitrary instructions has no observable side-effects, especially if the CPU is speculating.I don&#39;t know what that spells for cloud hosting providers - maybe they have to buy a lot more CPUs so every client can have their own, or commission a special &#34;shared&#34; SKU of CPU that doesn&#39;t have any speculative execution - but I know for me, if I have untrusted code running on my CPU, I&#39;ve already lost. I could then care less about information leakage between threads.We&#39;re going to wind up undoing the last 20 years of performance gains in the name of &#39;security&#39;, and it scares me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;&#34;Intel&#39;s suggested defense against Spectre, which is called LFENCE, places sensitive code in a waiting area until the security checks are executed, and only then is the sensitive code allowed to execute,&#34; Venkat said. &#34;But it turns out the walls of this waiting area have ears, which our attack exploits. We show how an attacker can smuggle secrets through the micro-op cache by using it as a covert channel.&#34;&gt;&#34;In the case of the previous Spectre attacks, developers have come up with a relatively easy way to prevent any sort of attack without a major performance penalty&#34; for computing, Moody said. &#34;The difference with this attack is you take a much greater performance penalty than those previous attacks.&#34;&gt;&#34;Patches that disable the micro-op cache or halt speculative execution on legacy hardware would effectively roll back critical performance innovations in most modern Intel and AMD processors, and this just isn&#39;t feasible,&#34; Ren, the lead student author, said."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The solution will be &#34;do not share the micro-op cache between different address spaces&#34;.Which for old hardware will translate to &#34;flush the micro op cache every time the address space changes&#34;.I would guess that can be done with a microcode update and that the performance hit wont be too massive."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m currently building a distributed mmo emulator using elixir, and it&#39;s going well (performance/bug/effort wise). Distributed via horde/libcluster libraries, ranch as acceptor pool, using livebooks for debugging and performance testing.I couldn&#39;t really ask for anything better, as solo dev in less than 100h basic distribution solved(one process per map, one per player. Maps are spread around the erlang cluster using horde, if a map crashes players seeemlesly reconnect in less than a second, and the map may actually be on a whole different system, especially when the node becomes non viable)
Basic monster ai, fighting logic. Respawn/monster  drops, extensive ddbuggability using observer (gui tool included in erlang, allows me to send messages to processes/see their status/ what they do, maybe kill them in the whole erlang cluster )
Can just use livebooks to do more extensive programming (just connect to cluster, execute a mark down files code blocks, see results live ingame and in the livebook)It&#39;s a very great and easy language for this. I may consider moving couple of things to rust using rustler tho for the fun of learning about nifs"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can&#39;t overstate how good Elixir + LiveView is, especially for prototyping. I have been experimenting with it ever since it first came out, mostly games, and I have to say that building even simple multiplayer games is a lot of fun.An example:https://dev.voppe.it/chess(FYI there is no actual game here, just pick emojis, place them in the arena and watch them fight to the death via a poorly designed combat system. Yes, those placing emojis other than you are other players.)This was a prototype that I built to see if real-time multiplayer games were feasible. Apparently LiveView manages high tickrates decently enough to be a valid solution for (quasi) real-time games. This game for example runs at a whopping 8 ticks/s! It can handle more, as I&#39;ve tried developing with faster tickrates, I think as high as 24 t/s, but I want to avoid server strain. With enough HTML/CSS/SVG wizardry you can get away with quite a lot. But the most amazing thing was the fact that there was no need to fiddle around with state syncing. Everything just works! I have nothing but praise for it.Try LiveView if you have the chance!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m curious about how race conditions would be handled when multiple users, on different regional LiveView servers, take conflicting actions.In the &#34;Let&#39;s walk it through&#34; section, it seems like the Player-to-LiveView connection will process user input (e.g. a Tic-Tac-Toe move) and update the UI to acknowledge this, at which point the user can be assured that the LiveView server accepted their input. But it seems like this happens before the GameServer has also accepted the input. What if Player 2 made a conflicting play and their change was accepted by the GameServer before Player 1&#39;s change reached the GameServer?Given, in Tic-Tac-Toe, the game is simple enough that this is neatly avoided: each regional LiveView server has enough information to only allow the current player to make a play. But in more complex applications, how might you (anyone; curious for discussion) handle this?One answer is something like: The LiveView server is effectively producing optimistic updates, and the GameServer would need to produce an authoritative ordering of events and tell the various LiveServers which of the optimistic updates lost a race and should be backed out."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Inferior endurance is the &#34;dirty secret&#34; of the consumer-level SSD industry.  You and I know better, but the average consumer doesn&#39;t pay attention to write endurance or under-provisioning.While I&#39;m no proponent of storage mining, I do feel a little empathy.  First they sell products that don&#39;t stand up as well to wear, then they wash their hands of it when you actually want to use the thing.  Feels a bit like when stainless steel appliances gave way to plastic ones.That&#39;s why I stopped buying entry-level, and prefer enterprise SSD&#39;s or at least good brands that publish endurance figures and have held up to third-party testing proving them out.Here are some fun experiments writing to SSD&#39;s for days/months/years on end to see how long they&#39;d last:[1] https://techreport.com/review/27909/the-ssd-endurance-experi...[2] https://forums.whirlpool.net.au/thread/9rl1lp19?p=9#r179[3] http://www.xtremesystems.org/forums/showthread.php?271063-SS...I have no problem with a manufacturer publishing a lifetime write rating and denying the warranty once you&#39;ve exceeded it.  But unless they were up-front about it, amending the terms afterward by saying &#34;well, we never intended you to use it like that&#34; seems a cop-out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"as long as you&#39;re within the endurance limits the warranty should apply.  writes are writes as far as the drive is concerned, it could be movies, it could be porn, it could be crypto, it doesn&#39;t matter, the warranty was advertised with a specific wear life and if you&#39;re within that the workload is irrelevant.(writes when very full / etc will cause write amplification, but that still shows up on the endurance counter.  if you want to do a bunch of writes with 10x amplification cause your drive is full then that&#39;s on you, it still counts 10x towards the endurance... but the endurance counter is what they specify in the warranty.)if the drive fails when it&#39;s past its advertised endurance... they can tell you to pound sand and that&#39;s fine."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reminds me of the Paperclip Maximizer thought experiment. An AI which destroys the universe by turning it into paperclips, as its goal is to make more paperclips.First crypto took marginal GPU and energy capacity. Now it is taking SSDs.It has so far produced nothing except higher values measured in fiat. And the higher the values go the more resources needed for the computer networks.Of course crypto is not an AI so it can only get fed more resources if it converts believers to feed it more. More GPUs, more SSDs, more coal, to run calculations.So this should be self limiting at some point. Or maybe I’m wrong and some practical use will come of it but it’s been 12 years without any so far."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"the first reports on this already appeared in august 2020, but somehow all mainstream outlets weren&#39;t too interested. They still weren&#39;t interested in October when the DOJ sent an inquiry about nursing homes or in January when the NY AG issued a report finding New York under counted deaths of nursing home and long-term care facility residents.Meanwhile, CNN put him on the air, to be heralded as a great and inspiring leader by his own brother, a CNN mouth piece, that got state funded special treatment when he had covid. Now CNN simply refuses to report on it.The media landscape is beyond broken in this country."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At this point, do a little introspection. Did you hear about this last year? From who? Did you find it credible? Why or why not? Is there any way you can grow in your consumption of information based on your findings?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"33% of all US Covid deaths have happened in nursing homes. Those 180,000+ deaths happened across the country. Some of the earliest US deaths happened in a Seattle nursing home. Some other early death clusters happened in VA hospitals. This is a public and private national disgrace, not just a Cuomo one.Cuomo didn&#39;t create our &#39;standards&#39; for warehousing the elderly. We did that as a society."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A few thoughts while reading this:In addition to a deeper understanding of engine manufacturing considerations than I even knew I cared to learn, this article helps me appreciate why people are into engine work.The perfect tolerances and synchronization of these machines makes me a little ashamed to use the word &#34;engineer&#34; in my title of &#34;software engineer&#34;. There is no real comparison of the quality of the result.And then I skimmed the source, and it makes me think the author deserves that title. It also validates my belief in vanilla javascript.edit: And later it occurs to me that Mr. Ciechanowski is a true craftsman of software; handmade and built to 1) Be beautiful (and informative), 2) last for years. (The open web standards are the ones that seem to stick around the longest, for better or for worse. (I&#39;m ignorant of the shader world though))"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m a lowly mechanical engineering lecturer. I use Jupyter notebooks to teach fluid mechanics[0]. I make videos of fluid flows with Blender and embed them with the notes along with some basic Python code examples so that students are aware of how basic code can make an Engineer’s life easier (even if Matlab is the standard platform).I also embed simple 3D models with pyGEL3D[1]. It’s fine but very limited. I’m always blown away by this gentleman’s work when it comes up here on HN and would like to use JavaScript instead, but I’ve no idea where to start. Can anyone recommend a good book or online course that would put me on the right path?[0] https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/nolankucd/MEEN20010/tree...[1] http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/projects/GEL/PyGEL/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of those web pages which deserves an award. Some place in some kind of Internet Hall of Fame, an historical archive which shows the only best highlights of what websites were actually capable of presenting. Milestones of web development.This page summarizes pretty good what web technology is capable of, when in the hands of a real professional.---Ok, I just realized this is from Bartosz Ciechanowski, and this reminded me of the Cameras and Lenses [1] article which I&#39;ve seen recently. It was the same kind of quality.This man is a real genius.[1] https://ciechanow.ski/cameras-and-lenses/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interestingly the employees who left have the best career prospects.  Entire iOS team, head of marketing and head of product team.The 6 months free money is hard for anyone entering a strong job market to pass up.A lot of comments seem to think 1/3 left because of the no politics policy.  1 / 3 left because it would increase their wealth or give them the summer covid took away last year.How many people would leave your job now for 6 months salary?  How many could get a job tomorrow if they did?A few probably left because they want to change social policy.  Many are probably staying but still want to change social policy.  The head of marketing, products and the iOS team are not leaving because of social policy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In fall 2008 I moved from Long Island to New Hampshire (for family reasons) and found a job in a small niche B2B shop doing C# Windows apps.  On my first day of work, I notice the receptionist desk has a stack of McCain/Palin 2008 bumper stickers.  The next couple of months were filled with employees talking non-stop about the election, from their deeply conservative point of view.  Being quite progressive left-leaning this was pretty frustrating and distracting to listen to while I tried to just get some work done. They all seemed to believe Obama would send people to their door to take away their guns and assault rifles, and somehow also turn us into the Soviet Union.The thing is, these weren&#39;t bad people. They took a chance on an self-taught programmer / art-school dropout in their late 20s with 1 year of professional experience, and they treated me well. When I moved back to New York (for other dramatic family reasons), the CEO offered for me to stay at their own house.  I just didn&#39;t agree with their political opinions.  I think for most folks working in tech hubs its just the other way around, where they are in a left-leaning bubble and its hard to imagine another POV.  Coming from someone who was on the outside, I can say for me it was at best distracting and at worst alienating, and I can see why companies want to put an end to it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Lots of comments around the line of &#34;ok maybe 30% is too much, but we can all agree they offer a valuable service, so what percentage should they take ?&#34;Uhhhh, not a percentage ? Do you imagine AWS billing you a % of your revenue instead of a given price for a given service ?Give a price to be listed in store, to be reviewed, to be downloaded by a user, ... And let company pay what they owe you. Let them pay through the provider they can negotiate and then pay you back the cost they owe you.It&#39;s ridiculous that it doesn&#39;t matter if my app has a 5$ sub or a 50$ sub, I owe them 30% anyway. What they provided is the same in both cases, they should be able to price it out to me. Their current pricing structure is not setup like a fee for services and infrastructure usage, it&#39;s setup like a tax."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unpopular opinion:This was a no brainer. Apple wanted 30% (or was it less for subscriptions?) on any business that used apps, no matter if they used apple infrastructure or not.Just think about it: one company is in practice  entitled to 30% of what any other business makes (in any industry)!!Also,  I think apple brought this to themselves by picking a fight with Spotify (on Watch support)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article moves the goalposts on what &#34;right to repair&#34; is several times. It generally means that manufacturers should not hide schematics from device users or disallow third party manufacturing of first party parts. However, the author states:&gt; The law doesn&#39;t yet cover smartphones and tablets that she says are getting harder to fix. One problem is keeping older devices updated with new software.Now &#34;right to repair&#34; includes not only designing devices to be easier to repair but also includes legacy software support? Where do we draw this line? If your M1 dies, you can&#39;t fab one yourself or run older software on it indefinitely.Further down, the author writes:&gt; But markets have now become flooded with products that are less repairable.&gt; &#34;It requires laws in place that prevent manufacturers from stopping [supporting] a product too early, or making it pretty much impossible to repair it by design.&#34;Now the author has shifted &#34;right to repair&#34; to mean mandatory first-party device support and design requirements around repair-ability.We must very carefully define our terms here, because requiring someone else to provide on one&#39;s behalf presumes a right to the product of their labor."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"PCs and even most laptops have been very repairable for decades. You can still run Windows or Linux on a 10+ (20+?) year old laptop without an issue. The idea that a 5 year old laptop would be unusable or not get the latest version of Windows is unacceptable.Yet phones cost similar amounts and have nowhere near the repairability. A decade ago you could argue that it wasn&#39;t that important - specs were changing so quickly that new phones became obsolete too quickly. But now it&#39;s a maturing technology, older devices are perfectly good and we still don&#39;t have an ecosystem which encourages longevity and re-use.This is eminently doable - phones are essentially integrated computers. The only reason phones are locked and PCs aren&#39;t is historical. If phone manufacturers aren&#39;t willing to do it themselves, we should legislate before even more e-waste is generated."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Semi-related question... I recently spent an evening trying to familiarize myself with virtualization tooling and my initial impression was that the CLI experience for kvm and hyper-v was rather clunky compared to let&#39;s say docker, gcloud, ignite and kubectl. Also a lot of the learning material seems to be oriented towards GUI. It could be that I just haven&#39;t spent enough time with kvm and hyper-v. I&#39;ve spent a LOT of time on those other tools so maybe I&#39;m just more used to them.Is there good CLI tooling available for virtualization? I would say that I&#39;m looking for the &#34;on-prem&#34; experience where I start by configuring a virtual network, download some unmodified ISOs directly from the operating system vendor, provision my headless virtual machines with a combination of Powershell, Answer files, Bash and Kickstart. I then provide services like DHCP and DNS using my virtual machines rather than the built-in mechanism provided by the virtualization tooling."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Alright HN, I need your help.Sorry for the approximative English, I&#39;m losing my vocabulary with WFH and I&#39;m pretty sleep-deprived.I&#39;ve been building a game streaming platform for influencers for the past months. We scaled to 9k users in a month.We have android x86 running on QEMU-KVM and there are a bunch of issues I need to address.- virsh (and virt-manager) always add a PS2 mouse to the guest. The issue is PS2 mouses have a relative movement and not an absolute one -&gt; When you use a mouse or the touch screen through VNC you have to move the pointer to a position instead of directly clicking/capturing the mouse- My VM resolutions are 720x1080 but VNC always launches in 1920x1080. I have black rectangles on both sides of the Screen.- Streaming the app viewport with VNC has some (small) latency, any way to fix it?- Can we host an arm android emulator on QEMU? (armeabi-v7 or v8)- We had a sales presentation from Canonical for their anbox cloud solution, but they never returned to us with a proposal. Is there any other way for us to have the Android VMs in K8S? Or even Lxc if possible, we are flexible. Also, the juju charms for anbox is nowhere to be foundIf you want to get in contact, my email is jadiaheno[at]ludexgames.com
I can even show you a demo, we have influencers increasing their revenue with our Beat the boss campaign. We&#39;re not VC backed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article unfortunately doesn&#39;t address the business side of the problem.  Fast food restaurants, or place like &#34;Dale&#39;s&#34; mentioned in the article, make very little profit.  It is most likely below 10%.  Here is an estimate:  https://www.restaurant365.com/blog/what-is-the-average-profi....A 10% profit is very modest.  That&#39;s not the story of the &#34;fat cats getting rich on the back of the workers&#34; that the article is alluding to.The problem for the business is that the financial model is set by the fixed or imperative costs, i.e. the cost of rent, the cost of maintaining the capital equipment, the cost of cleaning to meet codes, insurance, etc.  The cost of labor, for cooks, wait staff, etc. is often the biggest part of the expense budget for restaurants.With such a small profit margin, arbitrarily raising everyone&#39;s wages is likely going to kill the business.  There is no room in the budget.  The only choice is to either automate, which will reduce the labor requirements, or raise prices and hope that customers won&#39;t just go down the street.  But they will, they will go down the street--until everyone&#39;s prices go up and there is nowhere else to go.  And all of this is free market capitalism at work.  It is a continuous process of reinvention.In short, I&#39;m not saying that higher wages aren&#39;t necessary, I&#39;m just saying that both sides of the equation need to be examined, i.e. the plight of the worker AND the plight of the business.  And we need to understand that things will probably get ugly before they get better.  Because that&#39;s how capitalism and free market economies work.But watch out for technology and automation...that is the part of the equation that has been &#34;solving&#34; the labor problem for some time now..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Honest question: why do discussions about minimum wage in the U.S. never propose having teenagers having a different minimum to adults?In australia we have a $12.50/hr minimum for 15 year olds. It climbs in increments until about $25/hr.This system allows teenagers to get a foot in the door for low-skilled jobs, and allows adults to get paid a livable wage.The result is that a lot of fast food jobs are performed by teenagers, and they are considered entry level jobs. Adults are then paid more, and take positions where they can add more value that what a teen can provide."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve long felt that many jobs paid unsustainably low wages.  There are a lot of jobs where your net pay is below zero, long term, when you factor in the external costs associated with working, such as needing transportation.  These jobs have been propped up by debt.It looks like the pandemic has put and end to this.  Transportation costs have skyrocketed to such a degree that it&#39;s basically impossible for a poor person to even get a car, because they are going to be outbid by a not-poor person who is willing to pay a lot more for the same crappy car because of shortages.  Repair shops are having issues getting replacement parts, so even maintaining a vehicle is getting difficult.We built our economy on exploitation, and now the exploited have been drained dry.  So now we have to either pay up or do without."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a brilliant architecture.Everyone here talking about no email clients, IMAP and AWS restrictions is missing the point. Although you could use this as a personal account, or as a company. This fully automated system is a perfect ground layer to a number of applications with a very cleaver API.Say you are a small startup, and you will need some email functionality? Give your web server access to writing to outbox and you can send email. Use the sender with + rules and you get replies with customerId, threadId etc. Need to show email interactions in your service UI? Subscribe to the notification channels. Need customer support platform, it is almost built-in.If you don&#39;t see value in this solution, you probably never tried to setup infrastructure to receive email. In fact, at $work, I developed a very similar architecture and it is running flawlessly for 15 months or so. We just don&#39;t do all this git+lambda craziness, we just had already setup EC2 that we added some routes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is great but it&#39;s a bit misleading.It only store email on S3, that mean you cannot read email with your email client.Seem thing with outgoing, you upload email to s3 in a certain format to be send out, not smtp protocolThis is more like an API for sending and receiving. You cannot say generate SMTP credential and drop in your mail client.Also, one of the limitation with AWS SES is you cannot sent FROM or RETURN-PATH to anything, even in production mode, you can only set frm or return-path to verified domain.I have an internal AWS SES/Lambda stacks that I used for email forwarding(only receiving) which use SES to accept email, trigger a lambda and use SES to send a copy to a personal inbox. Plan to cleanup it a bit and release"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A serverless server?It is a great illustration of how the term &#34;serverless&#34; has shifted from literally no server (ex: sqlite database) to &#34;somebody else&#39;s computer&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"HN&#39;s second-chance pool is a way to give links a second chance at the front page. Moderators and a small number of reviewers go through old submissions looking for articles that are in the spirit of the site—gratifying intellectual curiosity—and which seem like they might interest the community. These get put into a hopper from which software randomly picks one every so often and lobs it randomly onto the lower part of the front page. If it interests the community, it gets upvoted and discussed; if not, it falls off.We started doing this in late 2014. There&#39;s an explanation at https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11662380, with links back to others. We&#39;ve talked about it in comments and whatnot (https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;que..., https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;que...), and have intended to publish the list, but only did so recently. We&#39;re slow.If you see a submission that didn&#39;t get attention and which you think is particularly good for HN, please tell us at hn@ycombinator.com! We love getting those requests and usually add them to the pool. It&#39;s fine if it&#39;s your own article, but we like it better when it&#39;s just something you ran across and recognized as good. That&#39;s more the kind of interest that HN is for.A related list is https://news.ycombinator.com/invited. Those are old submissions that we ran across and thought deserved attention, so we emailed and asked the submitter to repost it. Yesterday&#39;s top story was one of these (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26982286). They all go into the second-chance pool, but maybe it&#39;s interesting to see them broken out as a subset too. (If you don&#39;t have an email address in your profile, please put one in so we can send you repost invites!)If you read the old explanations I linked to, you&#39;ll see that the original plan was to turn this system into software that anyone can participate in, likely as a new way to earn karma: users who discover second-chance links that hit the jackpot (that is, which interest the community) would get karma along with the original submitter. That is still the plan! We&#39;re just slow.I think that&#39;s about everything there is to say about the second-chance pool. Questions, feedback, ideas, and views are welcome as ever. And please, everybody keep an eye out for obscure, out-of-the-way stories that got overlooked and let us know when you run across them. It&#39;s one of the best things you can do to help make this place more interesting. Best of all are the kind that can&#39;t be predicted from any existing sequence: https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;sor...."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My suggestion would be to automatically add submissions of unique posts to the second chance pool or have a reviewer look at them when they&#39;re for a domain or user with a high hit rate but fall off new. I&#39;m mostly thinking about technical blogs with consistent article quality like https://news.ycombinator.com/from?site=ciechanow.ski , https://news.ycombinator.com/from?site=raphlinus.github.io and https://news.ycombinator.com/from?site=scattered-thoughts.ne...I&#39;m biased on this though, as someone this might impact (https://news.ycombinator.com/from?site=thume.ca). From talking to other technical bloggers the consensus does seem to be that when we put a lot of effort into a technical article it nearly always makes it to the top of https://lobste.rs/ and /r/programming because it starts on the front page there but will sometimes flop off new on HN and maybe only make it months later if someone else resubmits the post."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thank you for all the quiet moderation work you do to make HN so great. I can say that you’ve personally made my life better, and I’m sure many others would say the same."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Author of Vite here. I see many people evaluating Vite as a webpack replacement, so I want to clarify the goal of the project here:It is NOT Vite&#39;s goal to completely replace webpack. There are probably a small number of features/capabilities that some existing webpack projects rely on that doesn&#39;t exist in Vite, but those features are in the long tail and are only needed by a small number of power users who write bespoke webpack configuration. Some of the commenters here probably belong in this group. If you do (e.g. you tried to migrate and found roadblocks, or evaluated and concluded that Vite doesn&#39;t suite your needs), use webpack by all means! You are not Vite&#39;s target audience by design - and you should absolutely pick the right tool for the job.However, in the context of the general web dev population, 90% of existing devs and 100% of beginners don&#39;t need or care about these long tail features. This is an estimation made based on years of experience working on vue-cli, which is webpack-based. (context: I&#39;m also the author of Vue.js and vue-cli is downloaded more than 3 million times per month on npm). Vite is optimized for these common use cases, and we&#39;ve heard many success stories of painlessly moving from vue-cli/CRA to Vite.This is also why Vite is a good fit for Repl.it where majority of its use cases overlap with the target use cases of Vite.That said, we are also seeing frameworks like Svelte/Solid/Marko building SSR meta frameworks on top of Vite, projects that were previously webpack-based offering alternative modes running on top of Vite (e.g. Nuxt, Storybook), so we believe Vite does cover quite a lot even for power users.So - try it, and if it doesn&#39;t work for you, stick to webpack (specially if you have an existing project relying on specific webpack behavior). As many people said, webpack 5 has made decent performance gains, and if you are targeting modern browsers, consider replacing Babel/TS with esbuild. These should already get you pretty far."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some stats not mentioned in the post. Create React App (webpack) vs Vite (esbuild) on Replit containers:- 1 second start up time on Vite vs 15 seconds for CRA- React.js hello world project is 234mb on CRA and only 34mb on Vite- 1GB RAM for Vite dev server vs 3GB+ for CRAThis is a perfect example of how fast and efficient tools can be, and I think we can do even better! Super excited about the future of JavaScript tooling ecosystem with more focus on efficiency and speed.In addition to the UX win, and I wish we measured this, but I bet this saved us thousands of dollars in monthly cloud spend."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Webdev truly is one of a kind. Not only do you have your source code, you also have your build code, oddly dictating the organization of your source code. For extra fun, some libraries don&#39;t build with build system a, others require build system b, when you&#39;re lucky enough to have a working mix, changing build systems is better to be avoided. Of course periodically the officially blessed build system for your used libraries changes.The webdev ecosystem is so broken, it&#39;s no wonder so many websites deliver assets that are extremely suboptimally optimised, big unused blobs of assets /scripts slowing page load, optimising it all is actually made harder than coding it all."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I built out a simple &#34;technology access&#34; solution for my late grandma about five years ago.  It was just some simple scripts running on a raspberry pi. The scripts would fetch emails from a gmail account, extract the attachments, and display them on loop. The subject line of the email, sender and the date were overlayed on the image.The advantage over those IoT picture frame products was that I could use any display I wanted. A cheap 32&#34; TV was perfect. This was key as her vision degraded.  The approach also allowed anyone in the family with email to send her photos, no proprietary apps or accounts required.She passed away mid-Covid and I didn&#39;t get to see her in her final 6 months, but she always bragged of her &#34;picture machine.&#34; I think she was the envy of many of her fellow nursing home residents!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are so many beautiful UI hints with this.1) The shape of the microphone positively urges the user to lean forward and talk into it. Compare to a modern smartphone where it&#39;s not at all obvious where the microphone is.2) The giant red button next to the microphone positively scream &#34;press me to talk&#34;, and it&#39;s obvious that the red LED will light up when the button is pressed. Removes any &#34;is this thing on&#34;? thoughts.3) The patch panel is quite genius, it&#39;s obvious how to target the desired recipient. One might quibble with the plug systenm, but using the large style plugs is a great choice for unsteady hands. These plugs have more leeway if not plugged all the way in than micro style plugs.4) The recipients are all in a line, and due to the design, one of them is always selected. That removes any &#34;did I select someone&#34;, sa I sometimes experience when sharing on my phone to some social network.5) What&#39;s more, the last selected recipient is persistent, even in the event of a power cut.6) Thermal printer is genius. Yaya can tear off important messages and carry them with her."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Two interesting things about this project.1. Just about 100% of the code already existed, it just needed to be stuck together in a classy box. That&#39;s pretty damn cool: there&#39;s no need to re-invent the wheel for some advanced components, and it means more sophisticated ideas can be built quickly.2. This has been posted 11 times on HN and it finally went viral: https://hn.algolia.com/?q=yayagram"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This should not come as a surprise, and it was largely predictable from the outset.The flu has a base reproduction number (R0) less than 2 (https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/coronavirus/2020/12/07/covid-19...).  Covid has an R0 in the vicinity of 2.5 (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scena...).In the meantime, public health measures like masking and distancing will work against both viruses.  If people become reluctant to socialize because of covid (whether or not there be legal restrictions), they will also not spread the flu.As a broad conclusion, if public health measures reduce the effective reproduction number of Covid to about 1 (stabilizing exponential growth), they will also reduce the effective reproduction number of the flu to something substantially below 1.  Since the flu would have also had a low baseline prevalence in the summer of 2020, it is no wonder that we failed to see a flu season.There&#39;s really no need for conspiracy theorizing."</p>

That is very unusual for a family with young children.No flu, no stomach viruses, absolutely nothing for more than a year now. Thankfully no covid-19 either."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If I caught the flu, how would the government/scientists studying this stuff even know I got it? If you&#39;re anything like me you probably just take some time off and get over the illness without ever seeing a doctor or taking a flu-test. How do they measure such things? I suspect they use some elaborate statistical model to try and generalize the results to the whole population."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Google is saving $1 billion per year because of COVID-19, not because employees are working from home. This is literally mentioned in the article, but the headline is twisted (for clicks no doubt):&gt; During the first quarter, Google parent Alphabet Inc. saved $268 million in expenses from company promotions, travel and entertainment, compared with the same period a year earlier, “primarily as a result of COVID-19,” according to a company filing.Even if they hypothetically continue the WFH setting for all employees indefinitely, other costs will still creep back up once the world starts getting back to normal. They will still hold conferences (and send employees to conferences). Team events and corporate retreats will still happen. Launches won&#39;t be digital-only. Advertising will pick back up. None of this is related to whether employees are at their desks in the office or not."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google may save $1B this year on the P&amp;L, but I can assure you that a large cohort of employees are vastly less effective (especially parents!).  Time will tell how wfh pans out in terms of long-term enterprise value creation, after confounding variables (i.e. COVID) are removed.Source: A lot of my Googler friends are itching to get back into the office -- whether parents or people whose social lives centered around work.Ninja Edit: Google has already announced their return to work plans, which involves substantially returning to physical office spaces.  From early April: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2021/04/01/google-wan..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Always remember:  numbers without context are meaningless. Google had 180bn revenue in 2020.In normal circumstances , even with much more WFH, they&#39;d still pay for regular company get togethers. They&#39;d pay for more satellite offices. They&#39;d pay for conferences because making cross industry connections and promotion is important.These savings don&#39;t mean much. Even more so if they lead to a potential dip in efficiency (not arguing that&#39;s the case, mind you) or reduced employee retention. Less personal engagement leads to less attachment to the company.The effects of that are barely visible after a year."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Is it just me, or is it really obvious that Wout won?https://i.imgur.com/g78YNla.pngEach pixel column is a specific point in time. I added a few landmarks: when the front of the wheel passes the camera view, when the axis of the wheel passes the camera view, and when the end of the wheel passes the camera view. Blue for the top biker (Wout) and green for the bottom biker (Tom).Every single event happened earlier for Wout. Both wheels are the same diameter. Therefore, the entire period where the wheel intersected the camera view, Wout&#39;s wheel was ahead. Including the exact period where Wout passed the actual finish line.If Tom would have passed Wout, you would expect that the bottom wheel would be more &#34;squeezed&#34; such that the end of Tom&#39;s wheel would have passed the camera line earlier than Wout. Same for the other landmark (centre of wheel).You can add more landmarks if you want (e.g. approximate when the wheel passes for 25% and for 75%), but it should be clear by pure margin that Wout had the lead for the whole duration where the front wheels passed the camera view. Pretty much all the computation in this article was unnecessary.Amstel gold made the good call, though I agree that it was probably more luck."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a arguably better, higher level writeup at https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/making-sense-of-the-controve... which concludes:&gt; The black line is a visual approximation of the placement of the finish, but the image from the photo finish camera is the true arbiter of the result – not the other way around. It’s technical and it’s a bit confusing, but it’s clear-cut and the riders and officials are playing the same game with the same known set of rules.&gt; According to UCI regulations, the photo finish verdict is final, because the finish line is what the photo finish says it is.Which makes most of the detective work here sadly pointless.Pidcock probably didn&#39;t need to tweet his take, in the same way he didn&#39;t need to post that ridiculous bogus 5k time! https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/the-column-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The “finish line” could be thought of as a two dimensional plane.  The winner is the first person to touch or pass through the plane.If you’re painting a line then the “finish line” is where that plane touches the ground.  For other races it might be a piece of tape held at chest height — the part of the body that usually goes through the plane first.When the competitors are bicycles then they all the same height — the middles of the front wheels are all the same height off the ground, something on the order of 400mm.  The finish line is floating about a foot off the ground.The specialist streak camera photographs objects passing through a 2D plane.  Ideally you would have that plane aligned vertically so that the finish plane and the camera plane were the same.If for some reason you couldn’t do that — let’s say the camera could only be placed a few feet in front of the finish line so as to see around an object — then you would have to arbitrarily angle the camera plane to intersect the finish plane.The intersection of these two planes will give you the “finish line”.  For a bicycle race, do you set it up so that the finish line is on the ground, or floating 400mm above the ground?  If you do the latter then the projection of the camera plane into the road will indeed give a line that stops short of the finish plane, but that’s irrelevant — the actual finish line at the 
middle of the front wheel is in the correct place.I think the article assumes the former when the organisers did the latter?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Cool to see so much discussion about techno on here!I’ve been a huge dance music fan/nerd ever since I was a teenager and techno is my favourite genre, particularly the deeper and more hypnotic varieties.Check out Donato Dozzy’s 2008 Labyrinth set for an idea of what I mean, it blew my mind at the time (still does) and redefined my musical tastes quite a lot: https://soundcloud.com/user-602354628/sets/dozzy-labyrinth-2...Would be cool to chat techno more with people from this site (and further afield, but I guess I’m thinking the shared interest in tech is another thing in common), I find sites like Reddit don’t really work for me for whatever reason... would there be any interest in a Discord or whatever for techies who like techno? (lol, sorry). Could be fun to share musical discoveries and maybe lead to other interesting connections."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m pleased to see accuracy in the history of techno.I for one did not know it&#39;s roots took place back in the 70s and from the black community.These days when I look at techno artists and their raving followers, its prodimently white. I have since taken active steps to seek out the lesser know black artists to support.Many modern music fundamentals are origins from the black community and very little is correctly attributed and/or black artists are sidelined."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I totally agree this is a very balanced review of the affair.The fact that &#34;kernel maintainers ... are overworked and do not have the time to properly review every patch that passes through their hands&#34; is not a situation created by the group of researchers.If the Linux kernel is so crucial to the real world industry, and the kernel team is so distressed at their work, this is a problem need to be seriously addressed. Proactively punish the whole UMN does nothing to address the real issue here.If the team is so distressed at this tremendously important work and they constantly feel they are on the edge of collapsing, may be you really really really should ask for outside help and even demand more contributions from the big techs.Nobody should overwork, especially those work on something so crucial to the whole industry.Edit: I just read a line from the Rust Foundation page [1]: &#34;Good software is built by happy, well-supported people.&#34;1. https://foundation.rust-lang.org/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Key takeaway from this update:One final lesson that one might be tempted to take is that the kernel is running a terrible risk of malicious patches inserted by actors with rather more skill and resources than the UMN researchers have shown. That could be, but the simple truth of the matter is that regular kernel developers continue to insert bugs at such a rate that there should be little need for malicious actors to add more."</p>

Now, I think The Kids would say &#34;Fuck around and find out&#34; (this is often accompanied by a stencil of an open-mouthed alligator).No matter the form of the reaction, I am still left wondering at the proportions of disregard, hubris, naivete, and perhaps sheer lack of consideration of consequences that went into this whole affair.  For the life of me I simply cannot imagine anyone patting me on the back and saying, &#34;Good show on that paper, old boy!  Smartly done!&#34;  Was there nobody in the whole group who had reservations?  Were any expressed or were they simply hidden away?  I am sincerely curious as to how it managed to get to this point."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is just such a weird fight. As someone who freelanced for long stretches of time, I think there are a lot of positives about freelance / gig work, and I also think that the majority of people who take these jobs understand the position they’re in and are happy with it. They chose to freelance and drive for Uber for reasons.The legit concern is whether Uber or any other freelance company misleads its gig workers on their earnings, and to me the best solution to that is not to force reclassify them as employees or prohibit gig work, but to regulate transparency in compensation. For example, require freelance employers to include expense tracking and calculate workers earnings after expenses. That by itself would fix most of the problems for the percentage of gig workers who don’t realize they’re extracting depreciation from their car more so than getting paid by Uber.The other issues of healthcare, etc., the US needs to solve at a societal level, not an employer level. I think humans have a right to health care. But I don’t think people have a right to a particular job, nor an entitlement for that employer to provide a particular mix of benefits.This idea that we need to provide our social contract / safety net exclusively via employers is so strange to me, compared to simply owning that if we want these to be rights of our citizens then the government should be providing them as tax-paid services."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It blows my mind that these platforms refuse to let workers set their own rates, choose their clients, choose how the work gets done, where the work gets done and how the work gets done. Those are the defining characteristics of what makes a worker a contractor or not.Instead, platforms like Uber dictate rates, dictate how, where and when the work gets done, and penalize workers if they don&#39;t take the clients Uber wants them to take. Uber even dictates what cars they can and can&#39;t use."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It seems backward that the government, instead of fixing government policy and laws that disadvantage independent workers, wants to force independent workers to become employees so that the government doesn&#39;t have to fix anything. It is abdication of responsibility for social outcomes.Many gig workers explicitly do not want to become employees, as there are many disadvantages to doing so. In these cases, the only people that benefit are the politicians that can go on ignoring the real problems."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Reminds me of the more adult 100$ debt riddle. Found it at econlib.org by David Henderson, but I&#39;ve heard multiple variations before, so I have no idea where the original comes from.&#34;It’s a slow day in some little town……..
The sun is hot….the streets are deserted.
Times are tough, everybody is in debt, and everybody lives on credit.
On this particular day a rich tourist from back west is driving thru town.
He stops at the motel and lays a $100 bill on the desk saying he wants to inspect the rooms upstairs in order to pick one to spend the night.
As soon as the man walks upstairs, the owner grabs the bill and runs next door to pay his debt to the butcher.
The butcher takes the $100 and runs down the street to retire his debt to the pig farmer.
The pig farmer takes the $100 and heads off to pay his bill at the feed store. 
The guy at the Farmer’s Co-op takes the $100 and runs to pay his debt to the local prostitute, who has also been facing hard times and has had to offer her services on credit.
She, in a flash rushes to the motel and pays off her room bill with the motel owner.
The motel proprietor now places the $100 back on the counter so the rich traveler will not suspect anything.
At that moment the traveler comes down the stairs, picks up the $100 bill, states that the rooms are not satisfactory, pockets the money &amp; leaves.
NOW,… no one produced anything…and no one earned anything…however the whole town is out of debt and is looking to the future with much optimism.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The one figure that this didn&#39;t quibble with is also wrong.Net profit definitely adds to shareholder value. But suppose that I make  $30 billion, reinvest $20 billion, and create something that is worth $90 billion.  My net profit is now $10 billion.  But I actually added $100 billion in shareholder value!Jeff Bezos knows this, and knows this well.  For many years Amazon ran at a net profit around $0 because it was reinvesting all of its profits in new businesses.  So it was adding shareholder value like crazy!  (And people who didn&#39;t understand this were walking around saying, &#34;Why is Amazon worth so much?  They don&#39;t even make a profit!&#34;)Of course doing this calculation correctly includes estimating the present value of the thing I created.  And that is notoriously hard.  So the proxy used in the real world is market cap.  However market cap is volatile and subject to change based on the emotions of speculators.  Certainly Amazon&#39;s actions last year are not the whole story for why they added $600 billion in market cap!So while net profit is the wrong measure, there is no measure that can be used which really is right for &#34;added to shareholder value&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this is a very smart piece. It exposes very clearly that money is not value.You can bundle existing value from one side, add maybe an extra bit here and there and collect money for the process.
But how much money you collected in the end has very little relation to how much value you added to the system.
Especially since some of the shareholders did absolutely no value creation.Jeff Benzos is a very smart person and an excellent CEO. He used to work for the Renaissance Fund as well. I really wish I could hear his honest opinion on this piece. He will most likely never read it but I hope he would and I hope he took the time to reply with honesty and no ego."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;d extend this even further: never use a single account for more than one purpose. Create a separate account at the same company for the other purpose. Some examples:- Every product/project you manage should be on a separate account on Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc.- Nothing tied to your consumer accounts should be used for anything business related.- Your Amazon shopping account and your AWS account should definitely not be the same account.- Don&#39;t use services where you&#39;re required to mix accounts like this.Some examples:- If the issue in this thread is actually an automatic ban, account siloing very likely would have avoided the issue. ([edit] likely, it would not have been possible to silo accounts in this case, as a child comment points out)- Facebook apparently lacks the willingness to block an account from Marketplace, but they will block an account from all Facebook properties.- Paypal has banned businesses because the account was created years ago by someone who at the time the account was created was 17.The point of this isn&#39;t that it&#39;s impossible to connect the dots that you are the same person. The point is to make it difficult for an automated system to deal too much damage to you, and make it difficult for someone looking at a single account&#39;s history from accumulating too many &#34;strikes&#34; against that account."</p>

He was paying for Google services like YouTube and storage. He couldn’t even get a download of his data.This is why I never used Google Cloud. I’ve heard these stories for years. You can lose everything and have no recourse. It’s not worth it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"With the way the system is designed, it&#39;s trivial to game the system in such a way that your ad-supported competitors get purged from the play store. Just extract the AdMob ID and submit it to click farms all around the world, and within a few days your competitor should be dropped from AdSense forever.Like any Google product, partnering with them is a major risk for your business continuity. I&#39;d never combine Google Ads and Google Play, just like I wouldn&#39;t combine a Google-hosted email domain with a Play account. Hell, even a Youtube account that&#39;s shared with your personal email is a data risk.I do wonder what happened to get the app flagged. Maybe someone found a way to use the app to automate their ad fraud (it&#39;s an IDE after all), and Google determined this app to be the culprit? Maybe one of the app&#39;s dependencies had a piece of malware added? Who knows at this point. Google&#39;s lack of transparency makes it impossible to build any sort of business on their products. I don&#39;t get why people still try to do so."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Collins&#39; role in Apollo 11 is often minimized in the public conciseness, but I find it particularly fascinating from a human perspective.  In certain ways it seems even scarier than Armstrong&#39;s and Aldrin&#39;s jobs.  They at least had more direct control over their success in landing on the moon.  Collins was largely powerless to help if something went wrong.  If that did happen, he would have been faced with the choice of abandoning his crewmates to die on the moon and fly back to Earth himself.  Meanwhile no one had ever been as far from other life as he was on that flight.  When he was on the far side of the moon he was truly alone in a way that no other person had ever been in human history."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve always thought the CSM commanders had the most incredible and challenging role of the three Apollo astronauts. They were undoubtedly the &#34;most alone&#34; humans ever — at least on a physical level.  Every other hour they&#39;d transit to the far side of the moon and would be 2200 miles (3600km) away from the nearest two humans and hundreds of thousands of miles/km away from everyone else who&#39;s ever lived.  Not only that, they lost radio contact.  The silence and solitude must have been wild.For upwards of three days.From the NYT obit:“I am alone now, truly alone, and absolutely isolated from any known life,” [Collins] wrote in recreating his thoughts for his 1974 memoir, “Carrying the Fire.”“If a count were taken, the score would be three billion plus two over on the other side of the moon, and one plus God only knows what on this side,” he added. “I like the feeling. Outside my window I can see stars — and that is all. Where I know the moon to be, there is simply a black void.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love the photo he took, where in the frame there was literally every human who was alive and has ever lived, except Michael Collins himself:https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/imgcat/html/object_page/a11_h_44..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article seems to make fantastic jumps from the believable -- mortality from overall air pollution (e.g. in Delhi) to the frankly unbelievable -- your ultrasonic humidifier supposedly reducing your life by nearly an hour each night, or that a daily commute between Newark and NYC takes half a year off your life.According to this logic, anyone who works in the subway should be dying, what, 10 years earlier? Which is obviously not happening.Similarly, it seems impossible to believe that the minerals in the air from humidifiers are equivalently dangerous to factory pollution or cigarette smoke. Different categories of particles are going to affect the body differently, no? I mean, our body requires minerals -- we&#39;re drinking them in our water all day long -- while certain factories may be belching out straight-up poison.These statistics are just not passing the smell test. They seem to be extrapolations of extrapolations of extrapolations. This article&#39;s conclusions don&#39;t seem even remotely convincing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thank you for this extensive resource on air quality. Yes, it needs to get more attention as it is one of the main drivers of mortality of environmental risks.One thing one has to bear in mind is that often when you optmize your home for low PM (e.g. with air purifiers and fixing of air leackage) your CO2 will get very high causing headaches and reduce cognitive performance.So it always makes sense for indoor air quality monitoring to measure PM and CO2 in parallel.We have open source, open hardware build instructions for a very reliable Air quality sensor that can be used to measure PM2.5 and also CO2 [1]. It is very accurate for the fraction of the costs of commercial sensors. You can build it for less than USD 20 (or with CO2 for less than USD 50) and send the data to our cloud server or any other backend.I am more than happy to send you some free PCBs (you just paypal me the cost of the postage) and you can build your own sensor and log the data. Contact me if you are interested.[1] https://www.airgradient.com/diy/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The biggest pitfall I see with this is we’re extrapolating from large doses of air pollution to very tiny ones.Clearly we have enough evidence to say that smoking a pack a day or living in a smog-filled city will cut years off your life. But we would need truly gigantic samples to show that blowing birthday candles or broiling fish once a week will cut weeks off your life.Instead these conclusions are being derived on linear extrapolations from large air particulate doses. Yet many things in biology follow the principal of hormesis, where a small dose or a toxin may be harmless or even helpful.Similar models have been used for years and are still the gold standard when predicting the health effects of radiation exposure. Yet mountains of evidence show that radiation workers, who are regularly exposed to small dosages of otherwise harmful regulation do not have anywhere near the cancer rates we’d expect from the linear extrapolation models."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"You can have third-party Android app stores. Can you say the same about Apple? While I agree that Google has market-dominance, they are not anti-competition or anti-consumer in the same sense as Apple. Android is open source, Chrome OS is open source, etc. Google is actually providing and contributing something back to the community. Apple intentionally locks people to specific hardware and to their app store."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This report is somewhat bipolar. On one hand it&#39;s arguing that Google and Apple exert too much control over smartphone app marketplaces.On the other hand its proposed remedy asks that Google and Apple exert even more control over these app marketplaces by stamping down on anti-consumer practices like subscription traps and scams.On the other other hand it proposes that Apple and Google should allow third party payment options, making it harder for Google and Apple to thwart subscription traps and scams."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The ACCC has put forward a series of potential measures in response to its findings, including that consumers be able to rate and review all apps, that consumers have the ability to change any pre-installed default app on their device, that app developers be allowed to provide consumers with information about alternative payment options and that information collected by Apple and Google in their capacity as app marketplace operators be ring-fenced from their other operations.Does anyone know what power the ACCC has to make these more than just &#34;proposed&#34;? I&#39;m not familiar with it&#39;s role in the Australian political system."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The internet is split roughly into 3. The top 100 websites get a third of the page views, the remaining top 10k get another third and millions of websites get the last third.The top 100 have dedicated engineering and policy teams teams that will disable FLoC because they&#39;re either not interested in ads (Wikipedia) or have their own first party implementation that doesn&#39;t need FLoC (Facebook). They&#39;ll ditch FLoC.The next 10k might have engineering teams that can make the change, but might be more interested in finding out about their audience so they can monetize more easily. They&#39;ll keep FLoC.As for the remaining millions, only a tiny minority of them will even know this is a thing, let alone care enough to make the change or contact a developer who can do it. These are the folks who have hosted their wordpress site with GoDaddy because it was cheap and quick when they needed a site. They&#39;ll keep FLoC.So the upshot is that github.com, instagram.com and amazon.com might opt out, but the vast majority of the web will not. Me prediction is that at least half of all web pages loaded by users won&#39;t have this header."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"alright 41 comments and everyone seems to know what FLoC is so i’ll be that guy.What is FLoC and whats the big deal?I googled https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358287/privacy-ads-goog...  and it seems like an attempt by Google to add proprietary cohort based tracking to replace third party cookies. well intentioned but could have flaws. anything else i should know?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"FLoC is basically something implemented in a browser. Why website owner should be bothered by it? If client decided to use browser with FLoC than it&#39;s their decision. The only interesting thing might be to inform user that they are using shitty browser that doesn&#39;t respect their privacy and make sure that website works in other browsers.What if Google decides that they will ignore that header? Is there anything preventing them from doing that? Do we know why they decided to even implement this &#34;workaround&#34; with header?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s unlikely that prosecutors don&#39;t realize how Signal works.  It&#39;s more likely they assume that, much like the rest of the tech world, there has been an increase in data collection efforts and they want to test the waters again to confirm/deny this data is available via Signal internals.  Subpoenas are the only mechanism by which they&#39;re able to do so.  That Signal are able to pivot to the media and say &#34;yup, still court-tested, still privacy-focused&#34; is a good thing for Signal.  No need for the derisive tone I don&#39;t think."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The subpoena is from Homeland Security Investigations at LAX airport.They deal specifically with crimes that involve international transport. So this is human trafficking, drug smuggling, money mules, etc.To be honest the rest of it is just standard &#34;we have some phone numbers&#34; boilerplate. Same thing was probably sent to Facebook, Twitter, etc. with the hopes that someone was dumb enough to login and check their messages from a burner phone.Edit: Rereading it, this is a grand jury. They likely already know the who, what, why, and how. Signal&#39;s response will go to support other evidence that they may have recovered from cell phones or cell network. Grand juries historically result in a 95%+ chance of indictment so this isn&#39;t a fishing expedition."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s probably unwise to think prosecutors and federal agents are stupid. They were in the 1990s crypto wars, but not now. What we tend to perceive as &#39;stupid&#39; is in reality, &#39;powerful.&#39; They don&#39;t need to explain themselves, because they put the onus of compliance on you.Gaming out the subpoena, Signal does not have this user information because it does not exist, but it does have server locations, 3rd party service providers relationships, and staff who can all be dragged into the process and system, where they can be charged with other arbitrary process crimes to put pressure on them.It&#39;s a mistake to interpret any official action as a serial, single point transactional request. Like mice, if you think you see one, you have, and it&#39;s guaranteed there are many more behind it. Given where they have used the action to draw your attention, where in relief is the second part of the pinch or funnel they are creating?If the legal system wants to destroy you, they can and do. Signal has antagonized them, and the current political climate is all about getting rid of any resistance to official powers and their unofficial private arms. Politically, there is ample incentive to take out Signal and cause users to switch to more amenable apps from friendly platform companies. They may even be able to compel friendly app stores to patch apps before they are distributed.To me, this subpoena looks like the Cellebrite takedown was analogous to injuring a cop, where the response will likely be disproportionate and even extra-legal, because it is about maintaining public perception and belief."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/02/gop-plan-for-bro...Remember that Republicans tried to ban municipal broadband federally only two months ago! Just an absurdly, transparently corrupt move."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you are a software engineer, working on municipal broadband or starting a local ISP is a really intense way to expand your skills.For the past year, I&#39;ve been volunteering at NYC Mesh (nycmesh.net), which is a non-profit that provides fixed wireless broadband in New York. I thought I knew a thing or two about networking — hell, I&#39;ve even given a talk in the network track at LinuxCon in the past — but working on NYC Mesh really showed me the limits of that knowledge and has helped me learn a ton more."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Municipal broadband really isn&#39;t the solution here. Sure, it&#39;s miles better than private infra, but we down here in NZ have a much better solution. (Not claiming we invented it, of course.)In 2011, Central government started a big infrastructure project to roll fibre out to ~80% of the population. (Called UFB - ultra fast broadband.) However instead of making this just be state owned, the money was paid as cheap loans with a competitive bid system. Companies bidding had to agree to a significant number of regulations, including a requirement to not act as an ISP and to offer wholesale access to the network for a set fee. They could also offer their own services above and beyond the regulated maximum.So to start an ISP in NZ, all you need is some national and international transit, and at least one server to do billing and core routing. As a result, we have dozens of major, actually good ISPs and many more niche ones. Most of them service the whole country - at least the UFB service area.I actually like my ISP. I have IPv6 and a static public IPv4. Peering is excellent and international bandwidth plentiful. Gigabit bandwidth with no usage call and no fair use policy (at least no policy regarding days usage).Municipal internet is great until you realize you just turned a monopoly into a duopoly. Without competition, what drive your new ISP to do better? If you&#39;re super lucky, the goodness of their hearts, I guess. Because you know the old incumbent will just match the new ISP and do not better.EDIT: Folks in other threads have pointed out how bad US government bodies have historically been at investing in infrastructure maintenance. I&#39;d like to note that the NZ model neatly deals with those concerns too. The companies which build out the networks are made the owners presumably when the loans are paid off. These companies become very profitable even though they can&#39;t become ISPs themselves, and are thus heavily incentivized to invest their profits back into their networks to keep them working well and to come up with new products to sell. Already a NZ fibre company has deployed 10gbit fibre commercially, with no extra government support."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"We&#39;re lucky that we can still catch some of them now. The current status of closed CPUs running proprietary firmware talking with closed chipsets running proprietary firmware blobs would make trivially easy to move the malware injection to the iron level for agencies funded by governments. Once they accomplish it, detecting their spyware using software, at any privilege level, will become impossible.
I fear the scenario in which magic packets with a signature that turns off detection in network hardware (proprietary firmware) and interfaces (again, proprietary firmware) can directly instruct a system (proprietary firmware) unbeknownst to the user; it seems impossible today, however all it takes is having enough closed software and firmware so that a covert channel can be created from the CPU to the external world. Governments have enough funds and motivation to tell most network iron manufacturers to produce hardware according to some additional specifications."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In a previous role I worked, law enforcement would send over requests for information from time to time. Once my scripts became better at gathering information requests turned from providing highly specific information (ex: details about this individual, on this date and time doing this particular action) to blanket statements (we think this person is called X or Y - can we get all info covering these two years).General security/crime prevention concerns were being provided as reasons for these searches. I had voiced my concern to my managers but they said as long as we had a paper trail which clearly tied each request to the info provided, they didn&#39;t really care. I left the place shortly afterwards, but it highlights, I think, how quickly these things spiral out of control. How specific turns general, how true belief turns into mere suspicion or blanket statements (ex - everyone in THAT area is a criminal so we need all the info)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The company claimed that the patches had “been released to address a recently identified security vulnerability. The security patch strengthens the protections of the solutions.” However, Vice also reports that the company did not “specifically say whether the addressed vulnerability is one and the same as the one disclosed by Marlinspike.”IIRC Marlinspike didn&#39;t disclose one vulnerability, but a massive class of them: Cellebrite must process media in every possible format and thus relies on components from outside sources, FFmpeg being just one example. Cellebrite inherits security vulnerabilities from all those components, and doesn&#39;t appear to be diligent in keeping them patched (not that a perfect record of patching would protect them - the attack surface is enormous and probably most component developers don&#39;t provide sufficient security).Integrating insecure code is likely a necessary decision for Cellebrite: Writing, maintaining, and updating their own code to process all types of media, and keep up-to-date with all changes to all those types of the media, seems impossible and certainly uneconomical. What could they do? Maybe they could sandbox each component but then they&#39;d need a lot of horsepower in their device."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Previously, data extraction was primarily used in only certain types of cases—typically child pornography or, sometimes, drug offenses. Now, however, cops’ first move is typically to find some sort of incriminating evidence on a suspect’s cell phone, he said, regardless of what kind of case it is....What? Are cops frequently scanning people’s entire phones as a first move now? I had heard that this occasionally happened at borders or with serious crimes, but I had no idea it was this widespread."</p>
