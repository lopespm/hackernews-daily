								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"These changes look fantastic.If I may hijack the thread with some more general complaints though, I wish the Postgres team would someday prioritize migration. Like make it easier to make all kinds of DB changes on a live DB, make it easier to upgrade between postgres versions with zero (or low) downtime, etc etc.Warnings when the migration you&#39;re about to do is likely to take ages because for some reason it&#39;s going to lock the entire table, instant column aliases to make renames easier, instant column aliases with runtime typecasts to make type migrations easier, etc etc etc. All this stuff is currently extremely painful for, afaict, no good reason (other than &#34;nobody coded it&#34;, which is of course a great reason in OSS land).I feel like there&#39;s a certain level of stockholm syndrome in the sense that to PG experts, these things aren&#39;t that painful anymore because they know all the pitfalls and gotchas and it&#39;s part of why they&#39;re such valued engineers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"PostgreSQL is one of the most powerful and reliable pieces of software I&#39;ve seen run at large scale, major kudos to all the maintainers for the improvements that keep being added.&gt; PostgreSQL 14 extends its performance gains to the vacuuming system, including optimizations for reducing overhead from B-Trees. This release also adds a vacuum &#34;emergency mode&#34; that is designed to prevent transaction ID wraparoundDealing with transaction ID wraparounds in Postgres was one of the most daunting but fun experiences for me as a young SRE. Each time a transaction modifies rows in a PG database, it increments the transaction ID counter. This counter is stored as a 32-bit integer and it&#39;s critical to the MVCC transaction semantics - a transaction with a higher ID should not be visible to a transaction with a lower ID. If the value hits 2 billion and wraps around, disaster strikes as past transactions now appear to be in the future. If PG detects it is reaching that point, it complains loudly and eventually stops further writes to the database to prevent data loss.Postgres avoids getting anywhere close to this situation in almost all deployments by performing routine &#34;auto-vacuums&#34; which mark old row versions as &#34;frozen&#34; so they are no longer using up transaction ID slots. However, there are a couple situations where vacuum will not be able to clean up enough row versions. In our case, this was due to long-running transactions that consumed IDs but never finished. Also it is possible but highly inadvisable to disable auto-vacuums. Here is a postmortem from Sentry who had to deal with this leading to downtime: https://blog.sentry.io/2015/07/23/transaction-id-wraparound-...It looks like the new vacuum &#34;emergency mode&#34; functionality starts vacuuming more aggressively when getting closer to the wraparound event, and as with every PG feature highly granular settings are exposed to tweak this behaviour (https://www.postgresql.org/about/featurematrix/detail/360/)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Haxplore is a little web app I created because I didn&#39;t like to click around the HN interface to read submission and discussions. I also wanted to experiment with different ways of implementing keyboard control in web apps and HN seemed like the perfect test subject. So maybe it&#39;s useful for some of you too. The most important features are:- Intuitive keyboard control- Link detection in comments with hotkeys to open them directly- Better readbility and formatting of comments- Hotkeys for the most common actions- Ability to open stories or comments in an overlay for reading long texts"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is great! For stories with 100s of comments it&#39;s nice to start browsing from a collapsed view of top-level comments.- Why is the Comments count shown only for the highlighted story?- On Firefox Windows, pressing the Enter key on an item triggers a popup warning at the top of the page. Took me a few tries to notice what was going on.- Alt + H triggers the Firefox Help menu for me :| Can you change that shortcut key to &#34;?&#34; instead? GMail, Github etc use &#34;?&#34;.- The green background for the comment text is a bit too dark.- Is it just me or is the comment text not showing paragraph breaks?- The zoom in transition when the comment text modal shows up just slows things down. If I&#39;m going to load many comments in that view I&#39;d rather it load instantly. Also, what&#39;s the purpose of this modal? There&#39;s a &#34;Space -&gt; Read&#34; for the comment that I&#39;m already reading. I don&#39;t get it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Can you please avoid blurring the prior column (or at least the comment you came from)? It&#39;s useful to see context that way.Otherwise I think it&#39;s really good. Reddit should have aspired to something this well thought out.(I&#39;d also like page up / page down.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One tip I have to make large-ish awk programs readable is to name the columns in the BEGIN section. Then, you&#39;d use $colname instead of $1, $2, etc. for instance:BEGIN{
     item_type = 1;
     item_name = 2;
     price = 3;
     sale = 4;
     #etc
}Now, in place of $1, you&#39;d say $item_type which significantly improves overall readability of the code."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lots of great AWK tutorials in here that are more in depth, but I&#39;ll share another.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thanks for sharing this. I&#39;m the author.When I wrote my introduction to JQ someone mentioned JQ was tricky but super-useful like AWK. I nodded along with this, but actually, I had no idea how Awk worked.So I learned how it worked and wrote this up. It is a bit long, but if you don&#39;t know Awk that well, or at all, I think it should get the basics across to you by going step by step through examining the book reviews for The Hunger Games trilogy.Let me know what you think. And also let me know if you have any interesting Awk one-liners to share."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In 2017 Cloudflare had an HTML parser bug that caused encrypted HTTP traffic to be leaked. Any website served by Cloudflare was vulnerable to having all of its traffic leaked into the HTML body response of the website that Cloudflare proxied. Given that Cloudflare is the proxy service for 80% of websites that use proxies, this affected a significant portion of the internet.Cloudflare served private HTTP traffic in response bodies, meaning that website results contained cookies, session data, encrypted traffic, all personally identifiable, and because it was served as response bodies, it was *indexed by search engines*, not to mention anyone else who was scraping websites during the time of the incident. It included credit card information, frames from videos, PII, the works, all linked to individual users.This was ongoing for *months.*Anyone savvy could use this information to hijack accounts, scrape personal information, view private browsing habits. Even when Cloudflare publicly announced it (and tried to blame others) when they thought they had cleaned up most of the data, you could still easily use search engines to find people&#39;s personal information by searching for the Cloudflare header strings that started the leaked session information.Many countries have legal policies around data breaches, including required disclosure policies and penalties. In the greatest blind eye turn of the history of the internet, Cloudflare managed to get away with a single blog post, and no other penalties. https://blog.cloudflare.com/incident-report-on-memory-leak-c...THAT is Cloudflare&#39;s disruption."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;More importantly, AWS itself is locked-in to its integrated approach: the entire service is architected both technically and economically to be an all-encompassing offering; to modularize itself in response to Cloudflare would be suicidal.&#34;Eh, somewhat. AWS is already modular in a lot of ways. You want S3? You got it, no matter where you are. (We&#39;re talking after them doing some sort of fee drop here.) You want to run exactly one EC2 instance? No problem. You want a message queue? You don&#39;t need anything else. You can integrate it with the notification service but it&#39;s optional.Sure, some of their services are integrated, but a lot of that integration is just &#34;this service pulls from S3 and writes to S3&#34;, not massive integration at every level.There is some stuff that is deeply tied in, yeah. But it&#39;s not like every single AWS service is deeply tied into half the other ones and the moment you open an EC2 instance you also are buying into a dozen other services. (It may feel like it if you put together a network and override the default block storage, but that&#39;s really just giving you knobs that are simply preset elsewhere, not really &#34;lockin&#34;.) A lot of it is already pretty modular."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Cloudflare is truly amazing.They almost compete with everyone now.DNS: They eat simpledns lunch
Pages: They eat Netlify lunch
Worker: They eat serverless/lambda as in AWS/GCP lunch
R2: They eat AWS LunchAnd finallyEmail Forwarding: They eat ... my own lunch (I&#39;m founder of hanami.run an email forwarding service)That&#39;s being said, from a user perspective, if my domain is already on CloudFlare, I can just host everything on it.Right now, cloudflare workers is pretty great to add some dynamic stuff. And pages is great for static site."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It seems like a lot of people here have been in an ineffective large organisation and an effective startup. I&#39;ve worked at an effective large organisation and an ineffective startup, so perhaps I can shed some light on what these kind of processes are for:* You don&#39;t get to be a large organisation without accumulating generations of previous products. Well, unless you&#39;re google and can regularly fire your customers without going bust. but part from them, you start to need processes just to track what&#39;s going on. (The  ineffective startup accumulated previous product attempts too, and is still paying  for a lot of pointless infra because no-one still there knows which ones can be switched off).* At a large scale, it starts to be pretty difficult to maneuver if each dept of 30-50 people has built or contracted all their own infra &amp; services. Some divergence is useful for agility, but a lot of it is just waste and actually slows you down when you want two depts to work together on something - or even prevents useful collaboration. An effective organisation will make the tradeoff consciously.* When you complete dozens of projects per year, it starts to be possible to invest in researching and rolling out best practices in areas where a startup just has to go with the simple/obvious answer.  When my startup employer moved, it was pretty onerous, and there was a bunch of stuff we never found again. The large org had so many offices that it had a full time dept just for moving offices. (They weren&#39;t dumb, each move consolidated offices -but they kept buying other companies). When they moved us, it was like magic - we went home on a friday and went to work on a monday in the new office, and everything was set up. Well, we had to set up the lab ourselves, but"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s hard because it&#39;s meant to be hard.Once you have a large org that&#39;s making money, you don&#39;t really know exactly why it makes money. Sure, there&#39;s annual filings and there&#39;s still the elevator pitch of what the org does. But the actual how of how it works is difficult to describe in causal terms: if team X or Y was not there, the business would do better/worse? How does this team interact with that? It&#39;s really a bunch of informal relationships between different people, and both the people and the relationships change over time.So what you want to do when you know the whole sorta-works and you want to keep it that way is you pour glue all over it. You try to formalize processes, you give people titles and you make hierarchies. That way you attempt to stop the firm from inadvertently slipping into dysfunction.The side effect is of course that everyone who works there can see ways to improve things, but they can&#39;t see a way to get those improvements implemented."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Big mistake in the article to claim that a single engineer could build Amazon, Facebook, or Google. Amazon is the most egregious.&gt; . A software developer could write a simple e-commerce website in a few days; Amazon employs 1,335,000 people [source].Those 1.4 million people are not coding the e-commerce app but making e-commerce happen as package handlers, drivers, finance teams, etc. on top of that Amazon has many non e-commerce related projects: building hardware (Kindles, Alexa, etc) , AWS and support, and on and on."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Cloudflare will charge per request over a certain threshold, like S3 does for API calls, so it won’t be just 13 cents depending on the rate of requests coming in.“R2 will zero-rate infrequent storage operations under a threshold — currently planned to be in the single digit requests per second range. Above this range, R2 will charge significantly less per-operation than the major providers. Our object storage will be extremely inexpensive for infrequent access and yet capable of and cheaper than major incumbent providers at scale.”Source: https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-r2-object-storage/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Now let’s remember that the internet is 1-to-many. If 1 million people download that 1GB this month, my cost with 
@cloudflare R2 this way rounds up to 13¢. With @awscloud S3 it’s $59,247.52.&#34;When I first saw this, my thought was it&#39;s highly misleading since you&#39;d normally be fronting S3 with a CDN, so you&#39;d only have to pay once to transfer a given resource every few days/weeks/months if the CDN is doing its job, and it can be served to millions of people at no or low cost (already been free on Cloudflare for a long time).Then I came to my senses and realised there&#39;s probably orgs who don&#39;t know/care about that and they&#39;re actually paying these fees for every request.Anyway, it&#39;s excellent to see this released. S3 is not just more expensive and tied to a single data centre. It&#39;s also bad DX, e.g. setting up permissions is way too complicated and the console is &#34;brutalist&#34; in both look and function. I hope this spurs some more competition in the area of storage."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s amazing how much conversation Cloudflare has created with this without even releasing the product yet.I can&#39;t remember the last time there was this much interest in a new product launch - which gives an indication to the market need for pricing changes on this front. However, AWS re:invent is right around the corner and I suspect this will cause an announcement or two to come from the AWS side."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One important part of the chip shortage is the massive amount of price gouging going on.Every IC is being bought up by new 3rd party distributors to scalp to desperate electronics manufacturers.Take a look at this chip we are just now crossing as an example, click on &#39;Non-authorized stocking distributors&#39;:https://octopart.com/tps2052bdgnr-texas+instruments-699312?r...Win Source has a bunch, but you will pay 6x the cost. We have been quoted even 100x the list price for some ICs on our boards.Luckily as a small company we are nimble and can mostly cross to similar components, and have been for months now, but a whole board assembly run can be stopped with a single component being impossible to find out of hundreds on the BOM.Having scalpers in the mix raising the price for all components worries me that the chip shortage might not end for many years, as they can self-fund by raising their prices to stock up on new supply. Not to mention the higher number of random failures as counterfeits easily find their way into the supply chain without &#39;authorized&#39; distributors."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I&#39;ll never understand is why carmakers don&#39;t take advantage of this situation and address a market that&#39;s been literally BEGGING for decades for a new product:A simple, basic car, with the ONLY electronic control being for:- Valve timing
 - Fuel injection
 - Oxygen and throttle
 - EmissionsThere&#39;s a market for budget and privacy oriented customers that all carmakers seem to have ignored for two decades now. Give us a simple car with no GPS navigation, ass warmers, tire pressure sensors, telemetry, backup cameras, USB chargers, proximity detectors, traction control, keyless entry, remote climate control, etc.But instead of addressing this market, these carmakers have decided to throw up their hands and shut down production or pile up unfinished inventory waiting on chips. It makes precisely zero sense.I understand the re-engineering is a cost. But when you&#39;re simply removing existing features, this should be a fairly negligible one.edit: I wasn&#39;t aware any of these luxury features were mandated by governments. Apologies, and disregard."</p>

The rest, as they say, is history.Many companies on this extensive list of ones with 10-year post-terminiation exercie windows [4] might not have this policy if it was not for this know-how benefitting employees put out in the open - between Amplitude, Triplebyte and it spreading to YC, making this approach table stakes a few years later.Sir, I salute your for doing this not just for doing this for Amplitude employees (who no longer had a &#34;golden handcuff pressure&#34; after vesting their original grant - which is most companies actually see as a benefit, and a way to &#34;leak&#34; less equity thanks to leavers often not being able to exercise), but for a part in moving the tech industry forward.Legend![1] https://amplitude.com/blog/employee-equity-is-broken-heres-o...[2] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11198991[3] https://triplebyte.com/blog/fixing-the-inequity-of-startup-e...[4] https://github.com/holman/extended-exercise-windows"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Congrats!HN is always saying that working for a FAANG is better money than working for a startup even if it IPOs, so my question to you is: How did your employees make out during the IPO? Is the prevailing HN wisdom correct? Did your average developer employee that stuck it through with you on your journey end up with more or less than what they would have made working at FAANG?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"All of this gushing hype for the future of artistry is transparently performative. Nobody in this tech cares about art or artists, any of the useful functions of NFTs have long been possible and many orders of magnitude less expensive using public key cryptography or digital signatures."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This would have been more interesting if the author had traced where all the money being plowed into NFTs is coming from.I suspect that most of it does not come from outside of the current ETH (or whatever) ecosystem. I&#39;d bet that most of the volume comes from people who are either treating it as play money, or trying to pump the NFT scam for their own benefit (real or imagined)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"sorry to be pedantic, but it&#39;s literally not multi-level-marketing? Specifically, it&#39;s missing the multi-level part. Your upline isn&#39;t getting $$$ when you sell a NFT. I suppose you can make the argument that if you then take the money and buy more stuff, then your upline gets paid, but that describes most distributor arrangements. Come to think of it, there isn&#39;t really even an upline. It&#39;s just a network of artists and traders with no set hierarchy."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; The containership industry is a good illustration of the supply chain mess: as shown in the first chart, more than 70 containerships are stacked up outside Los Angeles/Long Beach ports waiting to unload. Idle containerships are back to just 3% of the total fleet, shipping costs are surging, manufacturing delivery times are extended and rail shipments are declining sharply from their summer peak, illustrating the far reaching impact of the delays.I&#39;m surprised that the article doesn&#39;t take up what happens when that logjam eventually clears.At some point those ships will clear out of LA and there will be no more pile up. All the goods will have been distributed. Meanwhile, the world&#39;s container ship capacity will have increased by some large factor (30%, 50%) to address the shortage.Fast forward 1-2 years and we have a world that&#39;s a mirror image of today&#39;s: surplus everything. Too much oil. Too much container ship capacity. Too many semiconductors. Too many employees.It&#39;s not like COVID increased overall world demand relative to 2019. Rather, it created a log jam getting everything back to normal.The current action in Washington DC around the budget sets the stage for rollback of the massive government transfers and deficit spending of the last 18 months. Eventually, those evictions will happen. Eventually.Demand shocks can work both ways."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Advocating for an increase in foreclosures (increase the homeless population) and an increase in “acquired immunity” (read: let COVID run rampant and employ whoever survives) is incredibly ghoulish.It’s made even more shameful by its casual tone and tongue in cheek decades-old pop culture title. This article openly and unequivocally advocates for human misery and death in order to avoid upward pressure on wages."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; For all the clients that have asked me about the political and economic problems associated with the rise of autonomous vehicles and more unemployed truckers, I keep telling them they’ve got it backwards: the US has had a trucker shortage for the last few years, and it’s projected to get worse.In addition to the need to point out that &#34;shortage&#34; just means &#34;I don&#39;t want to pay market rate&#34;, a shortage of truck drivers does not negate the concern of automation causing mass unemployment of truckers.The concern is that the 450,000 truckers will lose their jobs. &#34;We want to have 500,000 truckers who would lose their jobs&#34; doesn&#39;t addresses that issue.To be clear, I&#39;m still very much in favor of automation, but people aren&#39;t &#34;getting it backwards&#34; here. These are two different problems."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was hesitant for a while and the massive censorship was part of it. I got vaccinated in May and have convinced others to get the shot since the side effects, while existent, appear to be minor compared to the reduction in harmful symptoms. Talking to my doctor is what did it for me. He cleared up most of my concerns and pressed me that my remaining concerns were too nebulous to be useful. If he just said &#34;shut up and take it&#34; I wouldn&#39;t have.My mother only got vaccinated last month. She and my father are both medical professionals (she&#39;s retired and my dad got it early on since he&#39;s super high risk). Her main hangup was the lies and coercion. She believed that if the vaccine was actually as great as they&#39;re saying they&#39;d be able to make more objective goalposts and win arguments instead of stopping them because the other side is too stupid to make their own decisions. I&#39;m confident there was also some element of &#34;if I get it now I&#39;m telling them their tactics worked.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The original author of the bracket colorizer extension gets a great shout-out in this post and was also involved in the discussions of building the feature.Moreover, he has stated that he was tired of maintaining the extension and seems to be fully in favor of this move:&gt; Author of Bracket Pair Colorizer here.&gt; I follow this thread with interest, my extension is something that grew a bit out of control, and I grew tired of maintaining it.The comments here suggesting that the Visual Studio Code team was somehow wrong for making this improvement or that they otherwise wronged the extension author are not reflective of the actual process nor even the extension author’s own feelings.The blog post does a great job of describing why bracket colorization isn’t appropriate for the plug-in architecture anyway. Making it fast can only be accomplished within the core of the editor code which has more direct access to syntax parsing.This is a win for everyone all around. The Code team did a great job with this feature and the associated blog post."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"VS Code is an amazing piece of technology, despite all the &#34;Electron hate&#34; (although changing to WebView2).I recently commented on it here:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28556588Microsoft engineers are top-notch and this is another feature I&#39;ll be using daily.  Good stuff!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve always wanted something like this extension, but where the brackets aren’t colorized, but rather change size depending on their nesting level, with the outermost brackets becoming increasingly large as the total nesting level of the expression increases — exactly the way brackets do in maths.Ideally, unlike in TeX, additions to nesting levels wouldn’t require a re-flow (i.e. typing a bracket wouldn’t make the code constantly shimmy around on the screen), but rather these would just be changes in the perceived size of these characters, while keeping them where they are on a monospace grid (since a lot of code assumes a pure monospace layout for indentation et al.)In my imagination, this would work by just having a set of bracket/paren/brace/etc. graphemes in each font, that have increasingly-long ascenders/descenders, while the base size of of the “functional” part of the grapheme remains constant. As if there were five versions of the letter g, with an increasing length of the stem on which the lower hook rests.As such, these magnified brackets would be rendered similarly to the way emoji are rendered in terminals: the grapheme would eventually “leak out” of its monospace box (in the emoji case to the sides; in this case above and below), to the point of eventually overlapping surrounding graphemes, rather than re-spacing the text to give it room."</p>

These farms aren&#39;t trying to &#34;spread chaos&#34; for its own sake. It&#39;s just a side effect of trying to gain an audience; clickbait media at its height was exactly the same.Don&#39;t think the payload has anything to do with cultural issues.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the founders of Simula here.We&#39;re flattered that someone posted us to HN, but we were honestly not ready for this much publicity at this precise stage of our project.  It would have been better had this happened a few weeks from now, when we have more accurate footage of our actual prototype to show. Let me explain:1. *Video footage.* The video footage on the front page of www.simulavr.com is taken against an HTC Vive and an older prototype of our window manager. It doesn&#39;t showcase the higher resolution of the Simula One (more than 4x that of the Valve Index), or any of the new features we are intending on releasing with it (hand tracking, AR mode, environments, etc).2. *Prototype pictures.* The website doesn&#39;t have any actual photos of our headset yet!  That&#39;s because we are in the process of finalizing the design.  We have printed parts and plenty of renderings, but they are still changing every week.3. *Specs.* The specs are close to the final specs, but still placeholders. Between supply chain issues, stuff still under development, and issues getting support from manufacturers at our volumes, we might have to change things for the final prototype.One of the reasons we threw up this website in its current form was to get the ball rolling for manufacturers.  They won&#39;t supply us with parts unless we have some sort of product interest, but we can&#39;t generate any sort of product interest unless we have some sort of website. It&#39;s very much a chicken and egg sort of problem.We appreciate everyone&#39;s kind words, yet also understand the skepticism.  For people on the waitlist: expect updates to start to come from us in a few weeks, when we will show some previews of some of the actual goodies which makes our headset special."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s important to remember that this is on the way to being an MVP. It&#39;s not a finished, polished product. This is HN. Don&#39;t we like people hacking on startups any more?I think it looks like a really positive first step. Yeah, the resolution is too low but that&#39;s solvable with a better headset. It&#39;s a bit laggy, but that&#39;s probably due to recording video of VR being hard. The windows are weird sizes, but that might be user choice. Heck, I personally don&#39;t want to code things floating in space, but that&#39;s just a matter of choosing a different background. All those problems are solvable.There are loads more problems that are also likely solvable too. And maybe some that aren&#39;t. We don&#39;t know yet. I&#39;m glad someone is working on the problem to find out. That&#39;s far better than not having, maybe, one day in the distant future, a VR option to use for work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fun note, almost all of it is written in Haskell. If I remember correctly they&#39;ve also done a bunch of stuff that helps Godot, or at least something to do with the Haskell bindings. Very accessible guys, I once asked a question on the gitter, and got helpful replies almost immediately."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We once had a customer who would call us in a panic a couple of times a year saying our inspection equipment was experiencing unusually high false rejects and they were generating very high scrap rate. By the time we got a technician on site the next day, everything was working flawlessly and the customer couldn&#39;t reproduce the problem either. This went on for almost three years with various levels of escalation to the current management. Finally, one day a technician was on site for another project when the customer came up to him and said &#34;It&#39;s happening right now! Come fix it!&#34; The technician rushed over to the equipment and discovered that the sun was shining at exactly the right angle to cause a lens flare in one of our cameras. This happened twice a year as the sun moved along its trajectory. A strategically placed piece of opaque plastic fixed it permanently."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The phase of the moon really can affect performance.  A friend of mine worked on wireless links in Scotland and was struggling with loss at certain times of day, but not exactly the same time every day.  When they graphed loss against time, the pattern was really periodic over many days.  The periodicity turned out to be 12 hours 25 minutes, which they eventually realized is exactly the time between low tides.  The problem was at low tide the reflected path off the water interfered with the line-of-sight path causing signal fading, whereas at high tide it interfered much less.  In particular, see figure 2 of their paper for the correlation between tide height and SNR: https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mmarina/papers/EDI-INF-RR-136...  As tide height really does depend on the phase of the moon, presumably their loss did too, if they measured for long enough."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I heard a great story a while back for a digitization project where historic content was being provided by many libraries around the world, including one in Russia.The quality of the scanned books was excellent, except for a weird distortion every so often where part of the page would be shifted partway through as if someone had shifted half the page in Photoshop. This was only noticed in books over a certain size so people were checking to see if there was some kind of mechanical problem with the scanner (these were robots with automatic page turners so it was plausible that there could be something which was only an issue past a certain position), trying to figure out of there was some way that the software had some kind of memory leak or other issue which would explain the long and inconsistent intervals.Eventually they were on a long-distance phone call to Moscow and not turning up anything when there was a loud rumble in the background. “What was that?” lead to the realization that the library&#39;s scan center was close to a subway tunnel. The vibration of a passing train was enough to cause a glitch but only if you happened to be scanning at the exact time it went by: the reason longer books were noticed was simply because having more pages meant that at any point in time a long book was more likely to be sitting in the scanner and the technicians running the scanner were apparently tuning out the trains as background noise. This was reportedly the first project they&#39;d done with one of the scan robots which can process an entire book unattended so it was plausible that smaller past projects simply hadn&#39;t been scanning frequently enough to hit this problem or that some previous technician had noticed and immediately redone the page."</p>

They are mounted on single sticks so they can be rotated/tilted to various angles.  That&#39;s what the single central mount thing is, the 2&#34; thick triangle bit with the two bolt holes.  The leading edge of that mount also has a classic curve associated with some radar target mounts.  It prevents direct reflections by the mount.https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/15746/lockheeds-helend...Lol, thedrive agrees with me:

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I still haven&#39;t found the &#34;holy grail architecture&#34; for offline-first with backend sync where the backend isn&#39;t just a simple data store but also has business logic and interacts with external systems.Doing offline-first well implies that the app has a (sqlite or similar) local database, does work on that database and periodically syncs the changes to the backend. This means you have N+1 databases to keep in sync (with N=number of clients). Essentially distributed database replication where clients can go offline at any time. Potentially with different tech (for example sqlite on the client and postgres on the backend).When the backend isn&#39;t very smart it&#39;s not too hard, you can just encapsulate any state-changing action into an event, when offline process the events locally + cache the chain of events, when online send the chain to the backend and have the backend apply the events one by one. Periodically sync new events from the backend and apply them locally to stay in sync. This is what classic Todo apps like OmniFocus do.The problems start when the backend is smarter and also applies business logic that generates new events (for example enriching new entities with data from external systems, or adding new tasks to a timeline etc). Obviously the new server-generated events are only available later when the client comes back online.When trying to make the offline experience as feature-rich as possible I always end up duplicating almost all of the backend logic into the clients as well. And in that case, what is even the point of having a smart backend."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I played with rxdb about a year ago, it’s really clever and has some great ideas.It’s built on the incredible PouchDB (the original offline first db) which is a truly feet of engineering. However I feel it is somewhat neglected (not implying that the original maintainers have any responsibility to the users, this is free Open-source, the fact they gave it away in the first place is brilliant). When I last used it about 6 months ago there had been very little activity in years on the github and I am concerned about their use of automatically marking inactive issues stale after 60 days. There is so little activity the only issues that are open are ones from the last 60 days.I found a sync conflict[1] (basically a hash collision, the attachments are unintentionally stripped from the document before hashing) and submitted a ticket, unfortunately as there is so little activity the issues was marked as stale and closed automatically. It’s not a bug that many people will come across but is a legitimate issue for anyone using binary attachments.So, rxdb is really great but I would be cautious about using it when the underlying platform is looking a little neglected. I truly hope someone has the time to take it on as it is an incredible toolkit.1: https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues/8257"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I do this for my mobile app, because the users are often working in remote areas without cell coverage or any network at all.I have a pretty simple strategy though:  I use SQLite on the mobile devices and when the device is back within network coverage, take a copy of the SQLite database, zip it up and throw it up to the server.  It ends up in an S3 bucket (all the device database backups end up with a UUID as their name), kick off an automatic process via a Lambda (triggered by S3) that imports the SQLite database into the bigger DB, job is done.It works pretty well, SQLite databases compress REALLY well.  The only tricky bit is having to check the version code of the database in case I have an old version of the app floating around in the wild (it happens)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We need better ways to fund Open Source projects. We all benefit tremendously by them. I think, this is one way it can work. Companies pledge to donate $X USD  amount per year per software engineer (SE) to a foundation (or whatever legal entity). Then each SE is able to choose which percentage of the money goes to which projects. Channeling the money to the projects that they themselves find more useful. It makes sense because companies benefit but it is  the SEs that know what they are using most."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve just dedicated the best part of 2.5 years to working on my open source project[1] almost full-time. During that time I&#39;ve managed to rewrite the entire library from scratch, discover a new purpose for its existence and (very selfishly) have a lot of fun with the library, pushing its boundaries and re-evaluating its &#39;API&#39; as I discovered/explored the world of generative art.Sadly my personal funds have run out and I&#39;ve not been successful finding sponsors etc. But the work has helped me land a new/exciting full-time job so I&#39;ve wasted nothing through my endeavour. I wish Will McGugan all the best at the start of his adventure, and hope he has as much fun as I&#39;ve had over the next year or two![1] - https://github.com/KaliedaRik/Scrawl-canvas"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The title made it already clear that this is an instance of &#34;I am fighting the good fight, so please give me your money.&#34;  I am an open source/FLOSS enthusiast since 25 years, but such calls still sound pathetic to me.  These days even more then 10 years ago.  Its a bit like going &#34;I volunteer as an ambulance driver, do you have a few dollars?&#34;  I can see that some people dream of becoming financially independent from just coding open source.  I have dreams as well.  But the truth is, only a very select few ever reach that point.  Joey Hess with git-annex comes to mind.  I guess he just hit a nail at the right time, and wrote something that many people actually use.  But if you&#39;re just that tad below the &#34;everyone knows your tool&#34;-line, you will never ever make your living from donations."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As someone who has gone through a kidney transplant, this is actually a bit depressing since progress in this field is painfully slow.I have seen these articles pop up at regular intervals for a decade now, and if we&#39;re going to be honest: nothing much has happened during that decade.  This is still an under-funded area where nothing more than &#34;pre-clinical&#34; prototypes keep getting press - and then nothing.I used to be active on various forums for kidney patients (one of which had more than 27.000 members last I checked).  I&#39;m not very active anymore because it is too depressing to read about people who are less fortunate than me (I have good health, live in a country with socialized medicine and my total cost per year for keeping the transplanted healthy is less than $300).  For instance non-affluent people living in the US.I&#39;ve lost count of how many americans I&#39;ve known who have ended up in a place where taking their own life seems like the best option.  Either because they are tired of finding money for the medications that keep them alive, tired of navigating bureaucracy, because they don&#39;t want to drag their entire family into a financial hole, or because they are just physically exhausted.  (Dialysis is time-consuming and slowly ruins your body)Take some time to think about that.  Think about what it means that every so many months someone on a forum you frequent tells you &#34;I&#39;ve had it - I&#39;m going to give up and die&#34;.  It can be quite taxing if you allow yourself to care.So excuse me for being negative, but this isn&#39;t anything to be excited about.  This is just a reminder that nothing much that actually has any impact is happening in this area.Please take some time to review the national statistics for the US and please consider becoming an organ donor.https://www.organdonor.gov/learn/organ-donation-statistics"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That looks interesting, but the linked article is a bit short on details, but high on praise.For example I would like to know, if the goal is, to actually put this inside of people?Currently it is smartphone sized. That might work, but only if the person moves not much, because it does not seem flexible. And having a stiff smartphone in your body would mean moving like a old school robot. That still might beat the alternative, but would be a serious limitation. Maybe they get it smaller and more flexible - then I would be curious how long the bioreactor and hemofilter lasts, before they need replacement? Because that means dangerous surgery.So the first versions would be probably carried outside the body and connected to your arteries?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Before the launch of the XBOX 360, the company I worked for was one of their suppliers, and without going into enough detail to make me identifiable, the management of our two companies had arrived at sort of a stalemate: We didn&#39;t want to tell them exactly how our algorithms worked, and they didn&#39;t want to tell us exactly what they were doing with them-- think of it like a data compressor where, we don&#39;t want them to know the exact compression algo, and they don&#39;t want us to have their data.So, somehow, It is arrived at that a website will be created that encodes MS&#39;s proprietary data, but doesn&#39;t store it, but also our algorithm is implemented server side, so there&#39;s no leakage of proprietary stuff.A month later, the app is done and tested and I&#39;m decoding data from the website on real hardware. I move on to the next project.Three years later, the Xbox 360 is out, I decide I&#39;m tired of filling out reimbursement forms for Heroku and its got to be a security risk with no updates in 3 years... so I take a look at the apps stats to see if its feasible to shut it down--exactly zero users. Nobody ever attempted to use it, not even once.Ironically and unknown to me, the source code had been lost in a freak accident and when I deleted the Heroku account that was the only copy of the source left.Even worse, a year later someone claimed to have a use for the app and where was it please? And I had to explain we no longer had the source. I remember a very long e-mail about how irresponsible we were."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember a conversation with an inexperienced PM, who was still in the mode &#34;we need to add X because a customer asked for it&#34;.What I&#39;ve learned - although I&#39;ve never had a PM role - is not to blindly just give customers what they ask for, but to figure out what they really need. Their feature requests are often a proxy for something else they aren&#39;t able to articulate.Another thing to be careful about is adding that one thing a customer asks for but nobody else does. You end up wasting cycles and bloating the product with these one-off asks. Sometimes you have to stand your ground and say &#34;no&#34;, because the ROI just isn&#39;t there. Startups in particular are vulnerable to this because they haven&#39;t got a large enough customer base and capital yet to comfortably say &#34;no&#34;, and end up with features jammed into the codebase that are still there, years later, when the original customer that asked for them are long gone.There are exceptions of course - perhaps the feature is for some legal requirement e.g. &#34;we need to show this specific set of Terms &amp; Conditions before the user clicks Yes&#34; they must have and can&#39;t live without."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I once spent a week working on a fairly complex feature for a product that the users were demanding almost daily updates on.  I delivered it and, by coincidence, happened to be where the users were a couple of weeks later and I stopped by to say hello and saw that the user who had been asking for the feature every day was still using the product the &#34;old way&#34;.  I asked why and he didn&#39;t seem to follow what I meant, so I reached over and showed him the feature that he had been demanding I add and he said, &#34;oh, wow, that&#39;s awesome, that&#39;s going to be such a huge timesaver for us!&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Around 1 year ago we got hit badly on our [blogging platform][0] by people/groups submitting fake customer support description of other big companies, either being Microsoft, Facebook, Comcast etc.Rolled out a machine learning model and trained it on the database. 99% of them vanished.Next day, the machine didn&#39;t work and success rate was around 5%.Found out, they have learned the trick and now using symbols from different languages to make it look like English.Trained again, success rate went up again.Next hour, success rate fallen.This time, they mixed their content with other valid content of our own blogging platform. They would use content from our own blog or other people posts and mix it to fool the machine learning.Trained it again and was success.Once a while such content appear and machine model fails to catch them.It only takes couple of minutes to mark the bad posts and have the model get trained and redeployed and then boom, bad content is gone.The text extraction, slicing through good content and bad content, finding out symbols vs sane alphabet and many other thing was at first challenging, but overall pretty excited to make it happen.Through this we didn&#39;t use any platform to do the job, the whole thing was built by ourselves, little bit of Tensorflow, Keras, Scikit-learn and some other spices.Worth noting, it was all text and no images or videos. Once we got hit with that we&#39;ll deal with it.[0]: https://www.gonevis.comedit: Here&#39;s the training code that made the initial work https://gist.github.com/Alir3z4/6b26353928633f7db59f40f71c8f... it&#39;s pretty basic stuff. Later changed to cover more edge cases and it got even simpler and easier. Contrary to the belief, the better it got, the simpler it became :shrug"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you host blobs for free, somebody is going to use you as their host. Even if you just hosted audio, I&#39;m sure somebody will quickly come along with a steganography tool to hide their content on your site (and use your bandwidth).Similarly, if you make compute power available, people will use you to mine cryptocurrency. Even if all you host is text, somebody will come along to be abusive. When you put a computer on the Internet, it&#39;s open to the entire world, including the very worst people.If you&#39;re hosting a community, start from the beginning by knowing who your community is and how they will tell you who they are. If the answer is &#34;everybody&#34;, then know what everybody means -- it means some people won&#39;t want to be there, because some people will make life hard for them.It&#39;s no longer 1991, when you could assume that such people wouldn&#39;t find you. They will find you -- for money, or the lulz. You have to plan for that on day 1. You can&#39;t fix it after the fact."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ll never forget having to be a moderator for a somewhat popular forum back in the day and oh man did I learn how a few people can make your life hell.One thing not mentioned many times in these discussions are the poor moderators. Having to look at all that stuff, some of which can be very disturbing or shocking (think death, gore, etc as well as the racy things) really takes a toll on the mind. The more automation the less moderators have to deal with and then usually its the tamer middle ground content."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is interesting ...For the longest time we tried to convince people that they should have an off-amazon archive of their S3 data ... we even ran an ads to that effect in 2012[1].The (obvious) reason this isn&#39;t compelling is the cost of egress.  It&#39;s just (relatively) too expensive to offload your S3 assets to some third party on a regular basis.So if R2 is S3 with no egress, suddenly there is a value proposition again.Further, unlike in 2012, in 2021 we have really great tooling in the form of &#39;rclone&#39;[2][3] which allows you to move data from cloud to cloud without involving your own bandwidth.[1] The tagline was &#34;Your infrastructure is on AWS and your backups are on AWS.  You&#39;re doing it wrong.&#34;[2] https://rclone.org/[3] https://www.rsync.net/resources/howto/rclone.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Really curious to see how this goes. If they live up to the following paragraph, that&#39;s pretty game-changing:&gt;&gt; This cheaper price doesn’t come with reduced scalability. Behind the scenes, R2 automatically and intelligently manages the tiering of data to drive both performance at peak load and low-cost for infrequently requested objects.  We’ve gotten rid of complex, manual tiering policies in favor of what developers have always wanted out of object storage: limitless scale at the lowest possible cost.The amount of effort it takes to understand and account for S3 Intelligent Tiering is somewhat mind-blowing so to get rid of all of that (and the corresponding fees) would be really nice and TheWayThingsShouldBe™ for the customer -- on top of that most users just don&#39;t even know S3 Intelligent Tiering exists so it&#39;ll be great if Cloudflare just handles that automatically.We at https://vantage.sh/ (disclosure, I&#39;m the Co-Founder and CEO) recently launched a cross-provider cost recommendation for CloudFront Egress to Cloudflare which was really popular and I can imagine doing something similar for S3 -&gt; R2 once it is live and we are able to vet it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know the Cloudflare team hangs out here, so thanks, and great job! This was absolutely necessary for my line of work. Couple of quick questions/confirmations:* R2 will support the same object sizes as S3? We have 500GB+ objects and could go to a 1TB per object. 
* R2 will support HTTP Range GETs, right?Egress bandwidth for objects on S3 is the biggest line item on the AWS bill for a company I work for, by an order of magnitude, and this will just wipe it off for the most part."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A tip: If anyone finds themselves in a tragic situation like this where they can’t work but also can’t afford to take leave, investigate your short and long-term disability benefits ASAP. Also read up on the documentation necessary to begin disability claims.Engage with a doctor early on who can document the severe depressive symptoms that are preventing work (which the author specifically cites in his anecdote). Do it as early as possible to generate a documentation trail. Don’t wait until you’re close to being terminated to begin documenting anything because that will make the claim much weaker compared to someone with months of doctor’s notes documenting the situation.I can’t speak to Amazon’s specific benefits, but most big tech companies I’ve worked for have provided some base level short and long term disability coverage as part of their core benefits, partially to avoid situations like this where employees are unable to work due to external circumstances but are unable to go on leave."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What sucks about stories like this is, while my heart breaks for what this guy went through, managers don&#39;t have the same luxury of defending their side of the story to Mother Jones.I worked as an EM at Amazon. I went into this ready to think he had a bad boss (because those definitely exist at Amazon), but after reading this I feel like there&#39;s another side to this that has more compassion than is being reflected here. He was at turns informally warned, encouraged to take leave, and offered severance. It sounds like he expected a pass on all this for his life circumstances until it was too late. Without more details from both sides as to what the performance issues were, this reads as using a tragedy to get more than he&#39;s owed.I can&#39;t even imagine what this guy went through. He had to watch his wife slowly die while raising two girls and providing for his family. Watching my father die from cancer after a long life was awful enough and affected me for years. His grief has to be phenomenal. I imagine part of his grieving process is lashing out at his boss for not being more understanding. That said, I think his story would be the same no matter where he worked. It&#39;s just more in vogue to bash Amazon.If he wants to lash out at anything, I suggest lashing out at a system that requires us to work while going through such awful life circumstances. That man shouldn&#39;t have had to work. He should have been safe to be unemployed while focusing on being there for his family. The idea that he felt compelled to work to avoid his family going bankrupt is lunacy to me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Believe it or not, this isn&#39;t a rare attitude among managers at Amazon. A significant percentage of SDMs believe they must &#34;keep a high bar&#34; and remove any dissenting subordinates. Word has gotten out about it, mostly on the blind app, which forced Amazon to raise pay bands for engineers 50-100k. This is costing the company a lot of money.The difference going forwards for Amazon is that the stock is mostly stagnant, and so employees are no longer putting up with miserable harsh working conditions, the financial incentives are no longer there."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As someone who is intimately familiar with the Chrome extensions internals and is not employed by a big tech company, I believe most of the changes seem like a step in the right direction.*I&#39;ve been working towards implementing greater support for Chrome extensions in Electron which has involved reading and interacting with Chromium code [0].- Using service workers instead of a hidden background webpage is more idiomatic for web developers.- Forced non-persistent extensions guides developers to a better implementation which relies on less resources.*The deprecation of webRequest&#39;s blocking behavior is what&#39;s most concerning. The implementation in Manifest V2 requires sending a message back and forth between processes with JS processing for each network request which seems to be in part why they redesigned it.However, that optimization costs so much for innovative ad blocking technologies as gorhill of uBlock Origin has mentioned. When ad blocking begins requiring new methods of detection or filtering, it&#39;ll now be up to Chromium maintainers to implement support for it in the new declarativeNetRequest API. This is a tradeoff of performance for reduced flexibility where it is absolutely needed.[0] https://github.com/samuelmaddock/electron-browser-shell"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a stupid idea. But first, a bunch of questions:- Can you legally advertise a product you&#39;re not affiliated with? Is this OK by the ToS of major ad networks?- Is it possible to target ads by user&#39;s browser?I&#39;m thinking, maybe we should crowdfund a public interest ad, targeted at people browsing from Chrome, with some attention-grabbing art or distracting colors, and a clear message: &#34;Want to stop seeing this ad? Stop using Chrome, install a different browser and an ad blocker. Click here to learn more.&#34;, which links to a site directing people to install Firefox and uBlock Origin (and linking to crowdfunding campaign to keep the ad going). Alternative for A/B testing: &#34;Don&#39;t click this ad, it costs us money.&#34;Come to think of it, maybe someone like EFF should do that - they&#39;re well-known and reputable enough that people wouldn&#39;t immediately assume it&#39;s some weird Firefox ad, avoiding the effect being the opposite from intended."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For me (I imagine a lot of others as well), it&#39;s simple. If Chrome removes adblock, I&#39;m going back to Firefox.HN ilk don&#39;t represent a good target market. Can&#39;t really make money off traditionally tracked ads off of us.FWIW, I love Chrome, still do. I&#39;ve been here since those entirely useless but super viral and catchy speed test ad/vids. It worked on me. I love the debugger as a web developer, more so than Firebug.Overall, will be sad to go. Pour one out for Chrome when the day comes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A very nice and well-built tool. Excellent use of sequence numbers for stateless send/receive (SYN cookies): https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan/blob/master/src... (very well-documented source too, a pleasure to read).I once (2016) used it to scan port 22 on the whole ipv4 (had to experiment with rate limits to not trigger alarms and get complaints forwarded by my VPS provider; the clever ip+port randomization technique helps a lot with that). Then took the ~22m (iirc) IPs which responded and ran ssh-keyscan on them to extract and analyze some ~15m ssh banners and public keys (a bunch of them broken, through debianized PRNG etc.) I think most of the scanning + extraction was done overnight, via ~13 VPS rented hourly (whole thing cost &lt; $10, and very few complaints). Fun times :) I should write it up some time, and do it again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A quick plug for my friends over at GreyNoise... they have honeypots all over the internet and identify various scanners as well as their observed intentions.Here is everyone running masscan against the internet: https://www.greynoise.io/viz/query/?gnql=tags%3A%22Masscan%2..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Warning.  Masscan is the best scanner I have ever seen.We have also managed to take down the entire corporate network by using it with a too high rate limit. So tread lightly around massscan and its power. Our pentesters did the same 6 months later. The managed service provider is not able to solve the routing table loop  which causes the firewall to DOS when a rapid masscan is triggered."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For what it’s worth, the thing I find really exciting about Spaces is that they provide a way to create a decentralised global hierarchical directory structure for realtime data. It’s like a free-for-all global USENET hierarchy that anyone can curate or contribute to, complete with decentralised ACLs. Or like DMOZ but for chatrooms. We haven’t published a “root” space as Matrix.org yet (as the “subspace” hierarchy feature is still in beta), but I cannot wait to kill off the public room directory for Matrix.org (which is a total tirefire atm) and replace it with decentralised hierarchies of rooms that the community can moderate and curate like any other content.Add in voice/video rooms, async comms (messageboards, forums, mailing lists, newsgroups), decentralised metaverse worlds like  thirdroom (https://youtu.be/e26UJRCGfGk?t=2263) and then you end up with a skeleton for a whole open universe of interoperable communication.Next up: decentralised search for discovery as well as decentralised hierarchies…"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s awesome for teams to focus on just work conversations but unfortunately not enough.We&#39;ve completely switched our work communication to a self-hosted matrix+element with SSO, so we can be sure our matrix auth is secured the same way our other internal services are.However, some of us also have personal matrix accounts which are offline during work hours and corporate accounts are offline outside of work hours which forbids using matrix as an emergency contact method. It would be great to either ability to sign into multiple accounts or an ability to sign into a single space using account other than the default one."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This seems to built for people with a lot of rooms/people. I think it&#39;s a classic mistake to enable it for all users, and I see it in all kinds of products. Everyone starts out by building something simple, but eventually it&#39;s bloated with features that I don&#39;t need (I&#39;m sure someone does).Personally, I use matrix every day. However, it&#39;s only for a single room. With this new feature, I lost 70 &#34;pixels&#34; (or 140 actual pixels) of horizontal space."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love the idea of doing this. Just like I do the idea of using Apple&#39;s &#34;hide my email&#34; feature. But in reality you&#39;re completely locking yourself into that provider. What if I want to change provider or the provider decides to sunset this feature. My logins are now split up so much it&#39;ll be a full time job getting them set back to my primary email address. It&#39;s a trade-off I guess because you can&#39;t solve it any other way from what I know of!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This would be a large personal disaster and a full time personal project if the service provider decides to shut down the service. One would have to crawl through all services they have signed up for to update the email addresses.Instead get a domain. Configure email as well as a catch all address. Example anything@yourdomain.com would reach name@yourdomain.com which you use as your primary email address.And say, if I am signing up for Netflix, I would give the email as netflix@yourdomain.com. The email automatically reaches my single primary inbox with the catch-all behavior. And if I find a lot of spam to netflix@yourdomain.com, I know which service is leaking my email address and I can quickly block all emails sent to netflix@yourdomain.com"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Long time Fastmail and 1Pass user here. While I agree that it would be best to not be locked in to particular providers, these are two of the providers who have a lot of my trust and to whom I’m paid up years in advance (at least in Fastmails case). Very excited to use this feature."</p>

Pretty embarrassing, though, that probably the majority of comments seemed to take it seriously, even reprimanding the creator for not being serious enough, not taking his Business seriously enough. It seems to create dissonance among many that such a thing even exists. People seem deeply confused it&#39;s not full speed ahead, like every other commercial site, trying to grab money from users. We on HN constantly complain that the internet was taken over by smooth, malevolent, lying mega-corporations, with 1GB ToS&#39;s and thousands of employees..and here&#39;s something completely different and people entitledly shit on it.It&#39;s a joke, people! From HN&#39;s own Stavros. Or, who knows what it is. Something Stavros did for fun and uses himself. A thing. Can&#39;t things just be allowed to be what they are?  It&#39;s like people can&#39;t tolerate the existence of unique things, and have to see them as just really bad versions of a known category of things. &#34;This round thing is bad because I can&#39;t force it into this square hole.&#34; And I guess when someone posts something to HN it gets judged as if submitted by the author and designed, badly, for the person now reading it. Ugly font! Bad colours! Unprofessional tone! Bad marketing! etc. ..Wasn&#39;t the internet 100% like that in the good old days?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The swap of Meng Whenzhou for the two Canadian Michaels demonstrates why it doesn&#39;t matter if Huawei&#39;s equipment is trustworthy or not.Canada was obeying international treaties when it detained Meng.  The Chinese state took Canadian hostages and held them in questionable conditions until they were eventually able to force a swap.  It is now clear that the Chinese government expects certain Chinese executives and corporations to be above both international law and the law of foreign countries in which they operate.If your country permits Huawei to do business within it&#39;s borders, that puts your own citizens at risk of being taken hostage.  Let&#39;s not kid ourselves that national governments care more about people than economics, but letting foreign countries take your citizens hostage without repercussion can threaten your chances of being reelected.Thanks to this episode, public opinion in Canada is now overwhelmingly against letting Huawei operate in Canada.  Given this and pressure from its allies in the five eyes, it seems almost inconceivable that the Canadian government won&#39;t soon ban Huawei from participation in 5G networks.This episode has also raised questions about permitting the operations of other Chinese corporations that are too closely associated  with the Chinese government.  e.g. If a Chinese mining corp operating in a foreign country had it&#39;s operations shut down for environmental law infractions, would there be reprisals in the form of trade sanctions, etc. from China?This kind of lawless behaviour is going to have a chilling effect on all commerce with Chinese companies."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Again, there is sooo much talk around it in all directions.But has there actually been a backdoor exposed?With all the attention turned towards it and that it has been a topic in geopolitics since years - there should have been some ressources allocated towards some reverse engeneering, that clearly shows it is not trustworthy?If not, why not? I mean it surely is not easy - but I always only hear blame without proof.(And I don&#39;t need proof, that the ccp is not nice. I know that.)In either case, my takeaway is, that we need more open hardware, that can be easily verified to do what it claims."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The US has never proved that there is any kind of Chinese surveillance going on with Huawei equipment. Lying and anti-market strategies seem to be the tool of choice of the US government to block the advance of societies that are not deemed to be part of their empire."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"With those comment counts, something dodgy is obviously happening.The interesting question here is whether Facebook is somehow accidentally amplifying it. Certainly it is not in Facebook&#39;s interest to allow this kind of data harvesting. If it hurts you to think that Facebook somehow isn&#39;t maximally evil, at least consider that this is data that could be only Facebook&#39;s. Allowing somebody else to harvest it is money straight out of Facebook&#39;s pocket.So, given FB should not be complicit, what mistake could they be making to allow the system to be haunted? The obvious guess is that they have a feedback loop in the ranking algorithm. It values comments very highly as a signal of good engagement, but they weren&#39;t prepared for &#34;content&#34; that is this good at eliciting low effort comments and have wide appeal demographically. As long as one of these reaches a critical mass, it&#39;ll be shown to tens or hundreds of millions of people just by any engagement feeding even more engagement.Is there anything less obvious?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This could be more benign than the article makes it out to be. Growing a content business in 2021 requires you to understand Facebook&#39;s algorithms and what will get your post amplified. Instagram famously only shows your posts to 10% of your followers by default [1]. The trigger points for your post to reach wider require certain engagement quotas, and if you&#39;re designing your post to get more comments then it&#39;ll hit them faster. Often accounts do these kinds of posts because their profile is about selling a single thing (like a book they wrote) or are dropshipping and focused on the marketing side. The real thing they want to get in front of users is the link in their bio.I think the real issue here is that it&#39;s impossible to tell the benign from the malignant. Is that cute mom blog going to start hawking ivermectin? What is my comment revealing about me that I don&#39;t authorize? There&#39;s no Better Business Bureau for Facebook pages. Maybe there should be.1. https://www.thelovelyescapist.com/2018-instagram-algorithm/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"1.4 million comments on a single post? Holy crap! I was previously wondering on Reddit, what kind of vapid self-importance compels people to comment in threads that already have over 100-200 comments—when new ones go straight to the bottom and no one sees them afterwards. But this is on scale of some mental illness, unless I seriously misunderstand something about Facebook comments."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The thing about Scrum is the observations and principles make sense, but then to sell it as a course they&#39;ve turned it into very specific prescriptions.I went on a scrum course and the takeaway was basically that feedback is a big deal, and you should try to get some repeatedly and quickly. It&#39;s also common sense that you should have tasks written down somewhere, and that some of them are more important than others.You certainly need to think about how long tasks will take, but there&#39;s no reason why you need to do planning poker, that just seems to be one among many ways to think about how long something might take. Tracking velocity is another one of these things that seems replaceable.If you have a team of people that more or less adheres to a few principles, there&#39;s no reason you can&#39;t get things done."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Engineers are encouraged to interact with the rest of the business and build relationships with non-engineers. In contrast, traditional companies often make it impossible for developers to interact with the rest of the business.In my experience “traditional companies” will often have a bunch of people in cushy “gatekeeping“ jobs whose main function is basically forwarding emails back and forth between devs and the business. If you try to get direct access to the business usually the business is quite happy but the gatekeepers get very upset."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really want to say this: SAFe is an awful process and a trend that will hopefully go the way of Unified Process/RUP. I won&#39;t go into it, but it&#39;s largely created and popularized by a vendor to sell their software. It is poison and exists to keep its practitioners employed. It attracts the highest-ego PMs like moths.I find it interesting that they author references Skype circa 2012. It sounds like classic &#34;uppercase A&#34; agile: they reframe success as shipping and hitting other invented agile milestones, while masking shipping lousy and incomplete product that is not succeeding in the market. That was right around the time Skype started being bad. It may succeed on some metrics because MSFT started bundling it, but anyone that actively used it at that time should know what I mean.The idea of an &#34;agile enterprise&#34; is intrinsically absurd. Teams are agile, not companies, and teams and products should be loosely coupled. That&#39;s why the big tech companies in this link have converged to similar answers to this problem (they are not &#34;agile enterprises&#34; but give teams some latitude to solve their own problems, and rather focus on results). Kanban is better in most ways for most teams.Also, Tuckman is a silly model that is only popular because it rhymes.PS: Strawberry-Jam-O-Meter and a Wrong-Order-O-Meter and their descriptions could hardly be more cringe inducing. Skype should be a part of the curriculum looking at less than ideal acquisitions and post-acquisition execution. https://www.wired.co.uk/article/skype-coronavirus-pandemic has is a reasonable overview if you&#39;re not familiar. They lost the consumer market and failed at enterprise (see Teams) and Teams in turn essentially failed in the general market- where most places that were free to do so went with Slack."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Google does this so they have click tracking data. But they don&#39;t need to mangle URLs in Chrome because it supports the `ping` attribute on &lt;a&gt; tags [0].The ping attribute basically adds click tracking as a native browser feature so you don&#39;t need to do URL redirects. It also makes these analytics much easier for the site and mysterious to the user. Looks like most vendors besides Firefox support it. (They were pretty opposed I recall)If you&#39;re a Chrome user, there&#39;s some extensions that disable ping requests/link auditing [1]. (EDIT: a commenter noted that uBlock Origin already blocks these! So I recommend that over this obscure extension)[0] https://caniuse.com/ping[1] https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ping-blocker/jkpoc..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find link mangling to be a great test for when a service becomes too powerful relative to its users, able to add friction to its product that serves no purpose for its users[1]. Google started doing this around 2004[2]. Facebook didn&#39;t do it until a few years ago. Slack and Discord don&#39;t do it. Yet.[1] Example: a search result that&#39;s a pdf. How do I share this link? If I click on it it downloads to my disk. If I rightclick on it I can copy a crappy URL.[2] http://akkartik.name/firefox.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It is really worth it to switch to DuckDuckGo. You can throw a g! at the end of your search if you don&#39;t like the results DDG gave and it will redirect you to Google. That was the feature that gave me the confidence to switch over, it&#39;s painless to get different results, even on a mobile keyboard."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Heya, author here. Fun to see this.I wrote the book after becoming hugely frustrated as an introverted technical founder trying to &#34;talk to customers&#34; but finding zero books about sales/interviews/etc that spoke to my context. That first company (yc s07) failed just as I started to figure it all out, but the casual approach proved useful (and comfortable) in my future businesses, so I wanted to document it for other folks like me.If it&#39;s helpful for anyone, I&#39;ve been answering reader questions with little youtube videos that touch on some of the common misunderstanding and sticking points.[1]Also, back when covid started, I also did a short series (5x 5min videos) about adapting the approach to remote interviews.[2][1] Q&amp;A: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvHabB7atz2uWPZN5m7z3...[2] Remote: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvHabB7atz2tOjQs1OMzj..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Best book on early stage startups period. And it&#39;s barely 100 pages long.My favorite quote from it:“Someone should definitely make an X!”“Have you looked for an X?”“No, why?”“There are like 10 different kinds of X.”“Well I didn&#39;t really need it anyway.”Long story short, that person is a complainer, not a customer. They’re stuck in the la-la-land of imagining they’re the sort of person who finds clever ways to solve the petty annoyances of their day."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Although not quite the same, this reminds me of a very simple trick many blind people are taught during training on how to navigate the city: Never ever ask &#34;Is this line 4&#34; if you want to know which tram just arrived. Ask &#34;which line is this?&#34;  Simply because the first version will make many people answer &#34;yeah yeah&#34; without even looking.  The second version forces them to actually answer your question with something other then yes/no."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Imgur, great service, lasted this long, amazing. But I always wondered how any of these random image hosts afforded bandwidth (reminds of the other various ones like TwitPic who was saved from being taken offline by Twitter). I mean, I have a gallery of images in there, privately stored, directly linked to here and there around the net, without paying for anything for years. I think at one point I can&#39;t even remember now I did pay them a small fee and then they removed that option to go it alone with ads and refused to &#39;take my money&#39;. Which seemed crazy and still does. Does the small imgur community (Which exists as a bizarre also-ran of Reddit) sustain them enough on ad views?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting company. It was created in 2018 [1], and the CEO is Michael Heyward, who was a co-founder of Whisper. Some interesting shuffling happened with Whisper [2] and it&#39;s now owned by MediaLab. Since then they have acquired a number of other properties, the general idea seems to buy declining brands for cheap and extract as much value as possible on mobile. [3] There is no public information on their funding.1. https://businesssearch.sos.ca.gov/CBS/SearchResults?SearchTy...2. https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-whisper...3. https://www.assemblyexchange.com/about-us - their job ads feature this ad network prominently."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hm. My bet would be that you can now count the number of years until imgur links go dead on one hand.This prompted me to check whether there were any backup efforts already, and how much data that would involve. Indeed, archiveteam has some good info: https://wiki.archiveteam.org/index.php/Imgur&gt; Imgur serves a massive amount of traffic. In 2012 alone, 42 petabytes of data were transferred. Fortunately, the amount of images uploaded is much less, albeit still a lot. In 2012, around 300,000,000 images were uploaded; assuming an average size of 120KB, that&#39;s 36TB in one year. As of 2014, there were 650 million images with 1.5 million being added each day according to one source. An analysis in 2015 based on extrapolation from a sample of random image IDs estimated about 2 billion images with a total raw full-resolution image size of 376 TiB.Also makes me think about whether/how much I currently link to imgur in various places on the internet, and whether there&#39;s anything that I should prepare to replace. Do people have suggestions how to best approach this?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I spend a lot of time in the terminal and want to quickly glance at a csv files without making a new script, opening excel, or using a tui. I made tidy-viewer (tv) because current tools like cat and column were not pretty enough.tv modifies raw files in the following ways:1. NA detection and highlighting
2. Printing only significant digits
3. Header and footer meta dataI have been using this a lot at work. There is a lot more work to do, but it is in a usable state.Give it a try! If you like it then star on Github!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some (most?) tools that output data in columns and fit each one to the largest value in that column need to scan the whole file as a first pass just to start displaying data.Not only is it the case with this tool, but from what I&#39;m reading in main.rs it looks like it&#39;s also loading the whole file in memory. I was going to say that scanning the file was a deal-breaker, but if true this is much more resource-intensive.This looks like a nice tool, but these design choices seem to limit its use to relatively small files. It could be updated to have a read-ahead buffer instead and adjust its output as new lines are discovered with values of different width, although doing this without a jarring resize could be challenging.Could someone with better knowledge of Rust than mine confirm this?I see the full dataset being loaded here[1] and the column widths being computed here.[2][1] https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/blob/main/src/main.rs#L183-...[2] https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/blob/main/src/main.rs#L218-..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is such a great post, and really covers the spiritual aspects of what it&#39;s like to work for prolonged periods in VR. Glad to see Immersed getting traction, and taking VR forward.  We all benefit from this.For Linux enthusiasts (possibly the OP as as well): SimulaVR (www.simulavr.com) is working on a portable Linux VR headset with office/programmer productivity as the #1 goal. It will offer the following advantages over the OP&#39;s Immersed setup:1. *More than double the text quality.* We are making a headset with more than double the PPD (pixels-per-degree) of the Oculus Quest 2.  This is extremely important for facilitating multi-hour VR sessions without eye fatigue.2. *Proper window management.* SimulaVR is a fully functional Linux window manager (built over Wayland/wlroots infrastructure).  Unlike Immersed, it isn&#39;t just emulating screens on another host OS.  This means you get an unlimited number of windows, popups can (when desired) behave as new windows, etc.  No hacks are required to get this sort of functionality.  It will also later on facilitate proper 3D/VR applications being able to share the same space with 2D applications.3. *Proper portability.* Our headset is going to be fully portable (with a detachable compute pack in the back), and won&#39;t require you to tether your headset to another computer over WiFi, or take along an additional laptop just to get your VR computer working somewhere else.4. *Proper hackability.*  Simula is built over FOSS, and is not tethered to the Facebook platform. If there&#39;s something you want to change or tweak, you&#39;re free to do so.One thing Immersed has though is immediate availability and scalability (there are an unlimited supply of Oculus Quests floating around :).  We&#39;re likely going to be constrained on the number of headsets we can produce, at least initially, and will have to queue first to the early users.We (and the industry at large) also have a lot of work ahead of us to improve upon a VR-centric UX (incorporating proper tiling management, and other things).  Very exciting."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The most critical thing in this piece:Get a better head-strap! He mentions it in passing in the article, but 90% of the strain from wearing the Quest 2 for extended periods of time can be traced to the garbage default head-strap. You want something that properly balances the headset. If you want, you can even get one that gives you a bit of extra charge, too. There are plenty of options.Something critical that doesn&#39;t seem to be mentioned:You can manually alter the resolution of Quest apps; if an app is looking blurry it&#39;s almost always because it&#39;s set to a lower resolution than native. This is a problem with a lot of &#34;productivity&#34; VR apps, and the main reason why I ended up working on my own for a few months.The standard 90hz is comfortable for me for prolonged periods of time, but if you feel nauseous, you can turn it up to 120hz, though some applications will require manual adjustment.The Quest 2 is really cheap and offers a lot of different ways to do work; you can pretty much throw it in a bag with a USB-C mouse and keyboard (and splitter, so you could technically also bring along a USB-A mouse and keyboard just fine if you bought a 2A-to-C splitter) or a bluetooth keyboard and mouse combo and you&#39;ve got a full computing environment anywhere, assuming you set it up beforehand. And if you bring around a laptop or other small form-factor PC while traveling, it works really well to augment those, too.Literal years ago Palmer Luckey talked about using a Go, a significantly less powerful headset, as a replacement for any monitor setups while traveling with his computer. We&#39;re finally at a point where you can do the same on any operating system, and it&#39;s honestly a really good experience."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is a part of me that is disturbed. I like working at my big wooden table overlooking the city, nice natural light filtering in, the ability to detach from the screen and pace around to take a break. VR for work seems like a trap, you&#39;ll be consumed, ensnared by something that demands all your attention. You won&#39;t know freedom. Maybe this is the current state of headsets, clunky, like a chain with cables, bad tracking and screens. Maybe if it was seamless and I could slip it on as needed, like a pair of sunglasses.The other part of me is that having a giant whiteboard and endless space seems cool. Imagine if the entire virtual space had powerful programming environments, some more powerful version of Mathematica, I could gesture and run a some powerful. Maybe that would be worth it, but it doesn&#39;t seem there yet."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I work part-time for my university&#39;s help desk and I was both impressed and disappointed the first time I came across one of these--one the one hand, its highly customizable and supports SSH access. On the other hand, there is shockingly no way to get the MAC address without connecting via SSH, even though this is popular among academics who often need to get onto MAC filtered networks.In hindsight, we probably could have connected it to the guest network, gotten its IP and then had the networking group look up its MAC on their logs. What we wound up doing is telling the user to go home and check their own router for the MAC, which is obviously less than ideal service."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not trying to shill too hard, but it&#39;s rare I fall in love with a device the way I&#39;ve fallen in love with my Remarkable 2.I can&#39;t say it was 100% worth the price (half was paid as a gift), but everything about it is refreshingly elegant and simple.Great to know recovering from a brick is possible too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oh boy do I have opinions with this one. This seems like a lot of work to avoid using a perfectly good package manager on the device.They could have used rsync without installing rsync on the device. The target device doesn&#39;t need to have rsync for rsync to be used.They could have installed the package manager and left it. It doesn&#39;t run anything in the background on my device. It&#39;s easy enough to verify you don&#39;t have a systemd service or timer running it. (cron isn&#39;t installed, iirc)They could have compiled rsync with all of the libraries bundled with it. (Maybe this is beyond their expertise?)Their solution is using Docker to use the package manager and then overwriting system files on the device in the worse possible way, without understanding what they are doing. At that point, they verified in Docker. Should be safe to run it on the tablet then, yes?What attack vector are they worried about? :/ Toltec is actively worked on, odds are someone would notice someone else fucking with repository.The cherry on top was completely not understanding how the remarkable works. There are two partitions for a reason. The inactive one is used for software updates. When the reMarkable downloads an update, it downloads it to the inactive partition. When you &#34;install&#34; the update, it flips which of the two partitions is active. 
If the update fails to boot, it flips back to the known good state. All they had to do was switch the active partition, the next update would overwrite the broken partition. https://github.com/ddvk/remarkable2-recovery/issues/6This looks like a bad case of tunnel vision, combined with a lack of understanding. I&#39;m glad they managed to figure out how to fix it."</p>

Have invested a lot of time in developing plex&#39;s plugin for youtube, twitch, and my favorite streaming services, paid a lifetime fee to plex. And now the whole plugins system is disabled.That&#39;s the only reason why I&#39;ve switched to Jellyfin. It&#39;s not better than plex.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"In contrast to most people in this thread, I don&#39;t find Jellyfin to be an all-around great experience. Maybe because I run the JF client on a Google Chromecast, and the &#34;Jellyfin for Android TV&#34; app is very unstable. I get roughly one crash a day, mostly when restarting a movie-watching. The UI is okay, but there are a lot of small annoyances (why is there no &#34;restart from beginning&#34; button? Why can&#39;t I use the &#34;wheel/cursor thing&#34; on my remote to go forward/back?, why does it so often fail to automatically recognize/parse filenames, or download cover art? Why can&#39;t a folder contain both movies and tv series?).... All in all, it&#39;s mediocre at best, but I&#39;m still glad it exists: despite everything, I still use it over other alternatives, because it&#39;s open source and works well enough.

In addition to working smoothly with dedicated (&#34;squeeze&#34;) clients which can be Logitech-brand or DIY[1, 2], it has a massive plugin catalog that allows e.g.- airPlay integration: stream to your squeeze-clients via airPlay, stream to your airPlay clients from squeezebox.- chromeCast integration: stream to chromeCast devices from squeezeBox.- upNp integration: stream to upNp clients.The system was originally developed by &#34;SqueezeBox&#34; who also made (awesome) physical devices. SqueezeBox was acquired by Logitech many years ago. Logitech put out one or two devices before giving up, but they are actually playing really nice by continuing to support development on the server (see [0]).[0]: https://github.com/Logitech/slimserver

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The blurring and then sharpening in spatial domain is equivalent to applying a band-pass filter, or rather a band-stop in the article&#39;s case, in the frequency domain. Blurring requires a lot of parameter tuning, in particular the size of the mask and the weight of each the mask element. The choice of parameter can be mapped to particular filter in the frequency domain, e.g. a gaussian filter or an ideal filter. Same for sharpening. Operating in the frequency domain allows you to skip all the trial and error of parameters, by eye-balling the frequency of interest, and suppress its presence.&gt; what you did is still the best out thereIt still is.I worked with a printing company before. The company impart anti-forgery pattern to packaging material by tuning the half tone-ing angle of the printer. The printing company then offer a seemingly transparent film, with special pattern printed on it, to company requiring brand protection. By overlaying the film on top of packaging material, a specifically designed moire pattern would occur. If you squint your mind enough, it is like public-private key encryption in the physical world. Whenever the brand receive dispute over authenticity of purchased items, a special team, a team having that transparent film, will be summoned to verify the authenticity of item in question. It is one of the many ways the brand in question protect their goods. The printing company was looking for a mobile solution instead of delivery the transparent film, that&#39;s where I get to learn more about the printing industry."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article doesn&#39;t say, but te method described in the article is called a notch filter. Here are some links on it, [0], [1], [2], [4]. Instead of cutting a sharp edge on the frequency domain, it&#39;s better that the filter blur the edge to avoid introducing too much artifacts, and this is called a Gaussian notch filter.Anyway here is another method, that also targets peak regions on frequency domain for removal but is based on a median filter instead, [5][0] Removal of Moiré Patterns in Frequency Domain, https://ijournals.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/5.3106-Khanj...[1] Periodic Noise Removing Filter, https://docs.opencv.org/3.4.15/d2/d0b/tutorial_periodic_nois...[3]  Adaptive Gaussian notch filter for removing periodic noise from digital images, https://ietresearch.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1049/iet-...[4] Adaptive Optimum Notch Filter for Periodic Noise

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nature will quite readily calculate the 2D Fourier transform and its inverse for us without the use of a digital computer.This is because lenses effectively do a Fourier transform at the focal point. With the right setup, you can apply filters at the focal point and get pretty much exactly what you would expect. An example of such a setup is the 4F Correlator. [0]Fourier optics is a whole subfield within optics, and it really is rather fascinating.Exposure to Fourier optics really helped develop my intuition around the Fourier transform.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_optics#4F_Correlator"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi,
I am the developer of the app in question, accessible hangman, as well as the other games I hve made for iOS.
I am a blind developer myself, that is why I thought htat making games for the blind would be the best approach for me. I chose Apple&#39;s platform, instead of Android, because of the way that SwiftUI lets me write the UI via code and change visual appearance of buttons, etc just by adding button shapes, icons, etc.Now, I do understand that every app needs to go through review every time it is updated, of course. But this is verion 2.5 of the app, this is in no way the first or second version.
So yes, Apple seems to find a new issue when someone just finds a little light in their brain clicking into place, the first version had no such issue. But after 4 or 5 versions, oooooh wait, your app does not comply with blah blah blah.
So, yes, I think this is unfair.
Anyway, I have some news regarding this whole hing, the update was pushed through and approved finally so I&#39;m a bit less worried, they still say I should talk to them on the phone so they&#39;re going to schedule a call with me.
Let&#39;s see how this turns out. Thanks all."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Apple killed one of the best voiceover enabled single-player poker simulator about 2 years ago.  THETAPoker was absolutely great, and the author invested a lot of time and energy to make the game perfectly self-voicing.  Until Apple review falsely identified it as a gambling-app which needs to be banned.  The author tried to get someone to listen at apple, and was totally ignored.  Now, Apple has a similar poker simulator, called hold&#39;em, which is by far not as good regarding VoiceOver support.  It feels like a scam to kick someone from the AppStore who did a very good job just to make your own botched copy-cat app more prominent.That said, Apple VoiceOver is still one of the best shipped-by-default accessibility systems.  However, we have to thank Steve Jobs for this.  If it were only for Tim Cook, apple wouldn&#39;t even know how to spell accessibility."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At a previous company, when I was developing an iOS app, it was difficult to impress upon the business people that there was a very real risk of Apple simply cutting us off.  (When Apple wanted to compete in our space, or they cut a deal with a competitor of ours, or they came up with some new idea about &#34;security&#34; or &#34;experience&#34;, or simply Kafkaesque random bureaucratic whim with no appeal.)I then had to explain why &#34;the market&#34; hadn&#39;t already corrected that, and why regulators hadn&#39;t.Separate from my professional career, one of the more personal reasons that the reality of the iron-fisted mad-king Apple iOS app store made me sad is... I had hard-won skills at some tricky iOS things, and it would&#39;ve been very tempting to moonlight on some creative apps that did something new, while also generating side income.  But, for this and other Apple developer-hostile reasons, I&#39;d end up aggravated in my spare time, and always with the risk that at some point Apple will stab me in the back.  That&#39;s no way to spend one&#39;s spare time refreshing from the real job."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One thing that helped me is not to care so much about my employer&#39;s goals.It&#39;s almost heretical. But once you embrace this mindset, it does wonders. Or at least, it has for me so far.I think a lot of us want to be proud of the work we do, and we feel that if we slack off, then we shouldn&#39;t be proud. But it&#39;s the other way around. I think the slackers have it right.You&#39;re probably not going to get rich from working a day job. You&#39;re replaceable, and if you left your job tomorrow then you&#39;ll soon be forgotten. This is true for the majority of software engineers.In that context, why do so many of us take on so many unnecessary responsibilities? It&#39;s tempting to say &#34;Well, my employer assigned them.&#34; But how often do you tell them no, or try to present a different approach that just so happens not to involve you?I know someone who is a chronic yes person. They will almost never say no, and they&#39;re pretty stressed day to day because of it. Whenever I point out that they&#39;re taking on too much, they say that they disagree and that it&#39;s their career.That&#39;s true, but they won&#39;t get rich from that career, so I don&#39;t understand why they care so much about it.Just remember to say &#39;no&#39; for yourself from time to time. You often don&#39;t need to take on as many responsibilities as you have."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a 54 year old Software Engineer, who has had a nice IT career for over 26 years, I&#39;m spent.This is coming from someone who has always had a growth mindset and had a really hard time sitting still.  I used to loathe naps and felt like I was missing out if I took one.  Now, I take a one hour nap almost daily and I&#39;m finding that after 1pm I&#39;m basically fried (I start working around 7AM).I&#39;m not sure what to do about it, if anything.  If I could retire now, I would.I&#39;m trying very hard to get my earnestness about learning new things back and I&#39;m finding that my motivation has just tanked.I&#39;m afraid this is a permanent state now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think it’s pretty clear we have an epidemic of burnout on our hands. I think it’s a new phenomenon. And I think immersive online experiences are the underlying cause.I’ve lived much of my life for the past 30 years in virtual spaces of one form or another, from MUDs to IRC to MMORPGs to early and then fully evolved social media. As commercial virtual space showed up, I noticed the engagement hooks and potential for addiction massively increased.As that happened, for my own mental health, I have distanced myself. I’ve left most social media, don’t play multi user games and have ramped up my real world social interaction.If you work hard and have pressing responsibilities, spending the little free time that you have on commercial addictive online pastimes will, in my opinion, guarantee your implosion.Find spaces to be in during the little free time that you have that don’t make someone else wealthy. Then take it a step further, and find things to do that are good for you."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The real reason they were so pissed off at Assange seems to be in two parts:
1) The Chelsea Manning State Department cables. The video was all the hype, but just dig through the &#39;SECRET&#39; cables on Iraq, Saudi Arabia, etc.  Zero interest in &#39;human rights and democracy&#39;, lots of interests in oilfields, pipelines, military sales contracts, etc.2) Those Vault7 CIA leaks are incredibly embarrassing, it&#39;s like so closet criminal organization - and with a program to run cyberwarfare attacks using Russian/Chinese signatures in the code to hide atttribution? That&#39;s kind of insanely deceptive and criminal I think.All told, those revelations make the State Dept. and the CIA look more like some kind of organized white-collar mafia outfit in the service of Wall Street shareholders than anything else.  That kind of raw exposure makes the corrupt insiders in the US government very sad.I&#39;d guess they&#39;ve got a lot more to hide, and are most worried about further eruptions of embarrassment."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t see how anybody could read this and then pretend that Assange has any chance of a fair trial in America. Not only were his communication constantly monitored for years, already a breach of client attorney privilege, the US considered flagrant assassination as a potential way to handle him.I&#39;ve heard many people say that Assange committed actual crimes and it&#39;s time for him to face the consequences of those actions. While I personally disagree about whether he&#39;s done anything illegal,  even if he has it impossible for him to get a fair trial and justice to be served. Everything being done to him is an effort to get revenge on the person who embarrassed the military and intelligence communities."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The interesting bit I didn&#39;t know was the article says that Wikileaks did not publish the complete contents of the Vault 7 materials they had. Not sure whether they just published shasums of the bits they didn&#39;t, or if they proved some other way they had parts they were holding back as leverage.It&#39;s odd to read what was really at stake. Pompeo&#39;s team was ready to assasinate Assange in London, and the only thing stopping them was the justice dept and only nominally the office of the President. What WL (and Snowden) did was show to the public the intelligence community, who was ostensibly accountable to them, for what they truthfully were. The news media took a bigger credibility hit for their history of spiking these stories and delivering hit pieces than the spies ever did.Most people saw how the sausage was made and decided they still liked sausage. Not only do we tolerate what these services do, but now that we know about it and have done nothing to change it, we have acknowledged it and rewarded them for it all. Snowden&#39;s story practically created the ability for retired generals to accept pulpits from tv news where they can armchair QB the issues of the day, and they should thank him for the minor television celebrity and speaker circuit fêting they now enjoy. Whether that undermines the credibility of their institutions is still to be seen, but all that plotting to kill Assange just to sustain some lame narrative about a bureaucracy seems like it was just a fatal distraction from the real unseating of western power that we are clearly into the endgame of today."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"People think if a project on github hasn&#39;t been updated since 3 months then it has been abandoned!!Like, why don&#39;t we just let projects be &#34;done&#34;? Things don&#39;t need to be maintained and updated for eternity.In my mind, the best software engineering is where you solve a problem once and your solution just works and needs no configuration or maintenance or updates.This of course has a very low chance of happening if your system has to exist as a part of &#34;ecosystem&#34; where you expect/assume the presence of some external service that can change its API on a whim (or just disappear).Yes, to a certain degree it&#39;s impossible to design software that does not exist as a part of an ecosystem, which is why I put it in quotes.Some APIs are stable and are guaranteed to continue to exist for a very long time: CPU instruction sets, networking protocols (IP/UDP/TCP), operating systems (AFAICT: Linux (the kernel) works hard to not break user programs, and Windows is kind of known for bending over backwards to maintain compatibility with old programs), file systems, etc.What I&#39;m advocating for here requires that your program be compiled into a native executable binary file, and it must embed all its library dependencies (aka static linking)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been at my current company for maybe 6 years now, in an engineering role.In that time, the service-oriented code which has significantly outlasted anything else, with nearly no maintenance, has maybe surprisingly or unsurprisingly been: AWS Lambda functions.We have quite a few Lambda functions (written in Node) that I believe pre-date even my tenure at the company; the only modifications in the interim, maybe a few lines of obscure bug fixes, updating the lambda node version, we switched from JS to TS everywhere a few years ago, and keeping the CI updated on those repos (which is a rather ironic and wasteful investment of resources given they&#39;ve only changed a half dozen times in something like six years).Checking in on those dozens of functions handling millions of invocations every month, and seeing them just chug along with no maintenance, has convinced me, personally, that if a problem domain can be solved in a FaaS-like way, its the way to do it. Not every problem can, and I&#39;m not specifically advocating for Lambda vs Azure FaaS vs an open source kubernetes-based solution.More-so that, every deployment artifact has to draw an &#34;operations&#34; line, to the left of that is the rote, daily operations banality, and to the right is the ever-changing business problem space. The further right you can draw that line, to push as much as possible into operations, the better; it gives you optionality to outsource that left part, maybe to automated software, maybe to AWS, maybe to an in-house operations team. FaaS draws that line roughly as far right as I think a general purpose programming system can; further right would approach things like Excel, Retool, etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The &#34;essentially no dependencies&#34; thing always fascinates me.Certainly, complex C code is a risk across OS versions but ... perl5 version 8.1 was released just over 18 years ago and after multiple years of annual major releases of perl we&#39;re now on version 34. Many of my chosen cpan dependencies produce the exact same output when on a 5.8.1 install as they do on a 5.34.0 install, and I can move them to a new machine/OS via rsync or tar of the local::lib structure (virtualenv like thing configured by setting a couple of environment variables) and it Just Works.Am I weird here? Is the author? Is python unusually bad? Is perl unusually good? This all seems quite strange to me."</p>

Sort of an Olympic committee for gaming. Give me the option to only play with other verified players. Getting caught cheating in one game then impacts your reputation in _all_ games. There&#39;s a gazillion details that would need to be hammered out to get this right (appeal process, account hijack recovery, etc) but I think the idea has merit. I feel something like this is the only way to end cheating once and for all. Would be so nice if developers never had to think about anti-cheat again, and we didn&#39;t have to run all this super invasive anti-cheat software on our machines."</p>

He says he absolutely knew TSA would see the cash, but said he also knew there is no law limiting the amount of cash one can fly with in the U.S.Here&#39;s the real problem. Civil asset forfeiture is an extralegal action. It&#39;s outside the legal system, which is why it&#39;s nearly impossible to get your money back. It&#39;s why the legality of what Lyon was doing doesn&#39;t matter. It&#39;s not a system of law, but power. He who has the power makes the law on the spot.That the US collectively has resigned itself to this level of clear overreach, utterly indefensible on any legal grounds, not to mention the bill of rights, says a lot about what 9/11 has done.The terrorists won the battle the people of this country thought they were fighting."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article conflates NFTs with cryptocurrency, in a way that looks to me to be intentional in order to bolster his argument that crypto is for rich people to conspicuously consume and to pump and dump on the plebs.NFTs aren&#39;t money, or currency and just because they can be created on some blockchains doesn&#39;t make them so.I also don&#39;t see a genuine effort from the author to really understand why proponents think that this technology will positively change the world. You might not agree with them, but at least then rebut their arguments instead of creating straw men.Bitcoin is open source, the original founder is nowhere to be found, there were no VCs involved in its creation or in the distribution of the coins and the entire network is run out in the open. The Bitcoin network is a commons.The permissionless, decentralized, p2p and stateless aspect of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin is as revolutionary as it was 12 years ago, and in these 12 years &#34;normal&#34; (i.e. non-rich) people had access to them as much as anyone else. Heck, 10 years ago there were faucets that would hand out 5 bitcoins if you solved a captcha.The people who are today involved in the creation and distribution of fiat money have incredible power, a power which is largely hidden from view, but which actually drives and shapes a lot of what we see. Of course these people won&#39;t take an open source competitor lying down."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was involved in a blockchain (DeFi) startup. All the blockchain companies are mostly a huge pyramid scheme. The company I worked for has a lot of big claims, raised millions, wanted to solve world hunger, prioritized partnership, marketing, while having no working implementation. Others in the eco system are the same.The NFT scene is even more BS. It could destroyed uninformed people&#39;s life, just like gambling. However, this kind of gambling is public on the internet with little regulations.I hope more tech people speak about this instead of just ignoring them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel the IPFS blog post gave me a glimpse of how blockchain can be cool. In certain cases, the need for decentralization is so strong that it makes sense to build a blockchain system for it (or other secure P2P network thingy).For example, authentication/identity using blockchain technology seems interesting to me.[1] https://blog.ipfs.io/decentralizing-the-internet-s-root/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I won&#39;t claim it&#39;s more or less impressive, butLuis Antin van Rooten&#39;s Mots D&#39;Heures is at first glance abstract (bordering on the nonsensical) French poetry ..But is actually a homophonic translation of English nursery rhymes - that is, if you read the French aloud, it sounds as if you&#39;re reading the rhyme.Example:    Un petit d&#39;un petit
    S&#39;étonne aux Halles
    Un petit d&#39;un petit
    Ah! degrés te fallent
    Indolent qui ne sort cesse
    Indolent qui ne se mène
    Qu&#39;importe un petit d&#39;un petit

(If you read it aloud you will recognize a well-known scrambled egg...)The effort is in making the French poetry make any sense, which van Rooten (a Hollywood character actor in his spare time) does admirably.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mots_d%27Heures?wprov=sfla1"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is so weird for me.Where I work (backend software development), we do video calls and meetings all the time. Probably an hour every day or more is spent in direct contact. I see this as absolutely essential to get people on the same page - but none of the reasons that people have listed in this thread for why people prefer personal meetings apply to me. For instance, I am extremely grateful if someone writes up meeting notes, I read text documents all the time, and I often require continuous uninterrupted time and respect it in others, and I still prefer voiced meetings.I think the primary reason is if I am trying to clarify an idea for a design or an approach, I will go to the people who have also touched that field of difficulty, and try to explain what I am trying to do to them in advance. The spoken medium in that case gives room for interruptions, immediate elaborations and feedback. A write-up either convinces or it doesn&#39;t; it can be edited but it has feedback cycles on the order of tens of minutes to hours. Spoken communication has feedback cycles of seconds, so even if I was going to write something up, I&#39;d talk it through verbally first, anyways."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author wants to educate people on the benefits of (more) text communication, but I don&#39;t believe it will change minds.Reading the sibling comment from papaf[1] and also a previous reply to me by jakubp[2] about talking things out instead of email, it seems like the higher meta-analysis is that some people have a predisposition to prefer synchronous (videoconference, phone call, cubicle visit) over asynchronous communication (email, chat).One group really prioritizes synchro comm for &#34;emotional nuance&#34; etc.  The other group prioritizes written text&#39;s dense information content and searchability.So if the company has folks like papaf and jakubp, it doesn&#39;t matter if you have a blog article recommending structured emails over video calls.  Some employees prefer not to communicate that way.  In fact, the blog article just makes them express their disagreement with it.  E.g. papaf saying we&#39;re not &#34;efficient robots&#34; and jakubp advising me that I should accommodate his communication style of in-person cubicle visits.To prevent clashing, I guess the higher-level advice is to hire a team where everybody likes to communicate the same way.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28651678[2] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20583427"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In my experience, many people prefer meetings over asynchronous communication because they can&#39;t write. I&#39;m not referring to grammar or to spelling, but to being able to communicate effectively without a continuous feedback from the recipient of the message. When these people are asked to write documentation, the result is usually very sparse text with too many bullet points, table and images.
Good asynchronous communication requires a high degree of introspection, clarity of mind and empathy, that not everybody has. A meeting allows you to pass your message through successive approximations, as in adjusting what you are saying based on the reactions of the listeners and being pushed in the right direction by their questions. Unfortunately it is also much more time consuming, because everybody has to stop whatever they are doing and listen for 1-2 hours, while reading 2 pages of text would taken them 30 minutes and they could have scheduled it at their convenience.I don&#39;t see much of a difference between older vs younger generations nor between native and non-native English speakers.I&#39;m open to accept that it&#39;s just my own experience and that it doesn&#39;t generalize."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; I tried a few of those Kinesis split keyboards. Too squishy for me. Not far enough apart. The CherryMX Kinesis split keyboard was is too clickey for calls and screenshares. Muscle memory made it difficult to switch.This is a really cool hack, and I’m happy that the author found a solution for their pain that works for them, but this bit confused me.Kinesis are keyboards with separated key clusters, but not split keyboards. When one says split keyboard I think they are normally talking about things like the Ergodox EZ/Moonlander which have two physically separate bodies, one for each hand. There are many different models of these with various shapes and sizes, and you can separate them as much as you like. The normal advice is to set them up around shoulder width apart so you aren’t rounding your back to bring your arms together.Most of these kinds of keyboards also support whatever key switches you prefer, and there are plenty of options that are sufficiently quiet for zoom (pretty much anything linear should do the trick)I have been using a Moonlander for a couple of years now, and an EZ before that. They are expensive at around $400 but I don’t think I can ever go back. Most of these split keyboards also run QMK so you can setup binds, layers, and generally configure them however you like."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are probably multiple different causes for RSI in programmers, but for me, a regular keyboard is fine. Even my slouch is fine. I type with my elbows on the table and it&#39;s fine.It&#39;s the mouse that killed me. A handful of years after graduating from college, I thought my programming career was over because the pain in my neck and shoulders was so bad I couldn&#39;t type. I went to a bunch of doctors, neurologists, physiotherapy, etc but nothing helped, not even medication.It turns out twisting my right hand outward in order to accommodate my mouse to the right of my keyboard was the culprit. I changed my entire set up so that my mouse is away from my keyboard when I type, and when I need to use the mouse, I push my keyboard away and have the mouse on the table in the center of my body, with my wrist slightly twisted so that it mimics writing with a pencil. That&#39;s also why Macbooks and similar laptops are fine with my because it&#39;s in the middle.Once I switched to this technique, my carpal tunnel went away. It&#39;s been over 25 years now with no pain. Like I said, different people probably have different causes of carpal tunnel, but for me this was the precise reason."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find it really odd that the OP is staring down the barrel of an RSI that&#39;s going to inexorably lock them (presumably) out of their career and passion, but the learning curve for a proper ergonomic keyboard seemed to high. I was up to an acceptable 40WPM on the Ergodox a week after switching, and his complaints about &#34;the Cherry MX&#34; switches fall a little flat since there&#39;s about a dozen different kinds, all with different noise and tactile characteristics.I just can&#39;t fathom all that unused space on my desk (two halves of two keyboards, going totally unused!) when the investment in some natural-feeling typing infrastructure was relatively small given how much pain I&#39;ve avoided, and will continue to avoid.Edit: clearer word order"</p>

We even made a few tweaks to the code so that you couldn&#39;t just reverse it back into JS with something like https://enkhee-osiris.github.io/Decoder-JSFuck/.Performance was surprisingly alright, and it has never hit an environment where it couldn&#39;t execute.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This seems like the antebellum for an IP reckoning similar to what resulted in the DMCA in the United States in the late 90s. The technology is getting to the point where it makes the law as it stands pretty nonsensical in the face of what can be doneThe scope of patents in software and technology is already absurd, both because 12 years is an eternity for how quickly that industry moves, and because increasingly trivial &#34;inventions&#34; have been let through as the ability for patent officials to interpret complicated digital innovations according to patent law and policy has increasingly fallen behind the field. This is already a serious problem, but currently still takes expensive lawyers to take advantage of. Even if we make legal precedent that says that AI can&#39;t own patents, the advent of better purpose-specific text generation will quickly put patent trolling in the hands of laypeoplePersonally, I think the DMCA was a horrible mistake. The provisions it added to copyright created a ton of horrible precedent that led to the draconian control private companies exert over the lives of billions of people worldwide, justified in law by their intellectual property concerns. I believe that if Intellectual Property ever served a legitimate purpose, it has now run its course and needs to be dismantled. I hope that this new challenge moves us more in this direction, rather than some new awful legislative band-aid that attempts to preserve the status quo by destroying more of our rights"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The applicant recorded his AI as the inventor for some reason (*).  Had the applicant recorded himself as the inventor having used the AI as a tool to invent, then the application probably would have been allowed.Using a mechanical process to search a large possibility space to find a patentable subspace is not new. For example, testing chemical compounds to find a mixture with optimal properties or testing drug dosages to find the most effective treatment is common. The resulting narrow range of mixtures or dosages is patentable so long as it is new (not done before), non-obvious (inventive), useful, etc. Also, if I hire other people to do the lab work at my direction, then I am still the inventor, not the lab technicians. Similarly, AI is just another tool.Edit: (*) After looking into this more, the applicant here is on a crusade to have an AI recognized as an inventor. https://artificialinventor.com/patent-applications/. That web site contains nonsense like the following:&gt; Arguably, DABUS may be considered “sentient” in that any chain-based concept launches a series of memories (i.e., affect chains) that sometimes terminate in critical recollections, thereby launching a tide of artificial molecules. It is these associated memory sequences, and the accompanying simulated neurotransmitter rush, that are considered equivalent to subjective feelings in humans (i.e., sentience). In this way, DABUS has an emotional appreciation for what it conceives."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am a research fellow at a large tech company and part of my job is to produce a certain number of patents per year. I have used AI as an &#34;aid&#34; to developing a patent several times but never thought for one minute it would make sense to list AI as the inventor. That is ridiculous. I have used Excel, R, Google Search, Mathematica, Python and several other modeling tools etc. to develop new IPR, obviously no one would list any of those. It was me doing the inventing, I am just using tool like any other."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Only had time to skim it, but even without all the details it is an excellent overview of the state of the art regarding secure boot chain. You can learn many of the points by looking into the Android boot sequence but this is a more generic and &#39;everything in a single place&#39; write-up. Especially the mechanisms behind dm-verity seem to be not widely known and - in my view- underappreciated.&gt; *This is all so desktop/laptop focused, what about servers?I know that some of the more powerful and Linux based automotive embedded systems use a similar design. While important for desktop/laptop and servers the mentioned points are crucial for systems where physical security of the hardware is limited.Oh, and BTW, if 0pointer.net i doesn&#39;t ring a bell: The author is Lennart Poettering."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If your attacker is both sophisticated and able to access your hardware directly, the game is over; nothing we can do can currently avoid this.What we can do is address the scenarios in which an attacker is either unsophisticated or remote.  Normal network security takes care of the latter case, and for unsophisticated attackers, a good FDE (Full Disk Encryption) system covers it nicely.  For laptops you can either live with typing in a password at every boot, or get a USB key of some kind.  For servers with FDE you might want to use something to enable remote and unattended reboots, like (shameless plug) Mandos¹.1. https://www.recompile.se/mandos"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"An option that wasn&#39;t at all considered in the article is to have the initrd and (optionally) the secret key used for decrypting the disk on a separate device (or devices), for example on an 1 GB USB drive. This way the big disk can have full, real FDE (not LUKS). To an attacker not in possesion of the USB drive the big disk just looks like random data. And the USB drive can be kept on one&#39;s own person and easily destroyed if necessary.The main part is having the initrd on an external, small, device. The secret can be either a regular passphrase, or stored somewhere on the small device.Works fine on my Archlinux. I mount the initrd file system to /boot when I need to update it."</p>

It&#39;s a clusterfuck of bad design decisions at Microsoft, the most offensive one being that they prioritize the execution of their scheduled spyware upload (telemetry) over honoring the agreement with the user that a sleeping PC will remain asleep unless the user takes action. It&#39;ll even install updates at night and then make reboot sounds to wake you up. And the next day, your unsaved open documents are all gone.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have an XPS 9500 and have found this infuriating.I think there&#39;s two separate things going on:As others have noted, S3 sleep isn&#39;t supported, only S1 &#34;sleep to idle&#34; sleep. But I don&#39;t think this is the direct cause of the overheating. In S1 sleep, the laptop can average something like 900mW of power usage, which is enough to annoyingly knock a few percent off your battery overnight, but not enough to make the laptop warm, even in a bag.The seems to be a second problem, specific to Windows, that when in S1 sleep sometimes the power consumption is high (of order 10W), and this causes the laptop to get very hot if not well ventilated. I&#39;ve never been able to figure out if this Windows actually doing something useful in &#34;modern standby&#34; like Windows Update, or whether it&#39;s a bug. Edit: And I should add, it&#39;s crazy that there&#39;s not a way to disable this if it is doing something &#34;useful&#34;.Either way, under Linux the latter doesn&#39;t happen, and the laptop sleeps very cool ... just with the annoying &#34;lose 5% of your battery overnight&#34; problem from sleeping in S1."</p>

These longer active intervals occur for a variety of reasons, for example, processing incoming email or downloading critical Windows updates. Windows components that are allowed to leave the SoC in the active power state are called activators because they are registered with the power manager as capable of blocking the transition back to the idle power mode. The durations of these activities vary widely but are controlled to extend battery life. The durations of the activities can be viewed with the built-in SleepStudy software tool or through Event Tracing for Windows (ETW)-based instrumentation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is slightly tangential, but it&#39;s Atlantic-cable-related, and I just learned about it. Let me set the stage. By the 1920s, analog fax technology was established and there were a variety of experimental and early commercial systems in use. One of the first uses of modems was to transmit faxes over the long-distance telephone network, turning a voltage into a pitch, and vice versa. The electronic marvel of the 1930s in the newsroom, aside from the teletypes, was that you could take a photo in San Francisco and have it published just hours later in New York.But how do you get a picture across the Atlantic Ocean? Those analog fax systems suffer from noise and in the experimental systems of the 1910s and 1920s long-distance was impractical. Shortwave to get over the Ocean was right out. There were no transoceanic telephone links. But there were submarine telegraph cables. Morse code or Baudot telex. Not very fast with no amplifiers along the lines yet. But you could send a telex across the Atlantic ocean.Enter the Bartlane transmission system. First, five photographs were developed from the original negative, at different exposure levels, using a conductive developer. So each point of the image is more or less conductive depending on its exposure. Each of these photos is scanned, as if it had pixels, and a 1-bit intensity value collected for for all five photographs, creating a five-level greyscale bitmap image on tape basically. (Five bits worked with existing Baudot code equipment.)This enormous tape was then sent over the wire. On the receiving end a printer, with intensity controlled by the level indicated, would then selectively expose a spot on a photographic plate to light, as it stepped through the tape. Six hours to send a small image. But digital was the only way to send a photograph from London to New York overnight from its early trials in the 1920s until the 1950s.http://www.hffax.de/history/html/bartlane.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Cool.  We take it for granted, but the intercontinental data (and voice) connectivity cables are an impressive achievement for humanity -- technical, and for global community.  And globe.gl has me &#34;seeing&#34; for the first time a particular cable for which I have a much smaller personal story.One of those submarine cables being severed accounts for one of only two software/hardware downtimes for a B2B startup&#39;s launch MVP, which had been deployed in critical production overseas.Our station appliances at the facility needed to talk with servers (at the network-closest AWS AZ) multiple times a minute, for cryptographic security reasons.  The appliances had a boot-time check for network connectivity (which saw extreme latency and packet loss as network unavailable).  For reasons, the facility powered off all equipment at night.One day, the facility said the appliances wouldn&#39;t &#34;turn on&#34;, I quickly found they were having network problems, but facility insisted their LAN and Internet connectivity was fine.  I was able to carefully SSH in (with terminal responsiveness like a bad dialup to an overloaded timesharing system), and relaxed the timeout on the check that was in a retry loop, and the stations came to life (albeit network requests during operations much slower than normal).  The facility manager advised later that day that it turns out a submarine cable had been severed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a slightly more cynical take on this than it seems most of Hacker News does.Facebook had found a way to monetize it&#39;s iOS app without Apple getting a 30% cut.Apple decided to cut that off to prevent Facebook from making money without Apple taking their cut. The fact that Apple can sell this to users as &#34;privacy&#34; is all the better for Apple.At the end of the day Apple is still a corporation. They are beholden to shareholders, not privacy advocates. Apple will maximize profits and has found a way to cut off revenue to competitor and breed goodwill at the same time.Judging by this comments thread, it is working very well."</p>

It supports sharing your own terminal in Slack too.[1] https://github.com/binwiederhier/replbot"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While I do appreciate the humor here, it&#39;s a personal gripe that conversations on Slack tend to optimize towards speed of responses - and when taken to an extreme, they take the form of:&gt; This message&gt; is&gt; sent over a few lines(awkward pause)&gt; so that&gt; I can get in a point&gt; before you start typing somethingAsynchronous means of communication (Github PRs, Jira tickets, dare I say e-mails) mean that I submit a fully-formed thought as a digest, but Slack sometimes becomes a stream of consciousness - one that I have trouble breaking someone out of."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Daczak serves on the WHO team to investigate the virus origins, but this did not get mentioned in any reports.  Instead he warns other not to discuss it. He does not include notes that research was done on modifying bat viruses to make them infectious to human cells.  These behaviors look like a guilty person, do they not?The wuhan and eco-health researchers had already started work on the furin cleavage sites and why would they stop when DARPA blocked it? Funding can’t only come from the US. Did CCP also block this research?&gt; there is published evidence that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was already engaged in some of the genetic engineering work described in the proposal and that viruses designed in North Carolina could easily be used in China."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"1.  There is no viral backbone anyone knows of which would have been used in this research2.  There is no spike protein anyone knows of which would have been used in this research3.  The PRRAR furin cleavage site is not one humans would have tried it is unlike any other known furin cleavage sites in coronaviruses4.  There are now many known related sarbecoviruses which have been found with furin cleavage sites5.  Furin cleavage sites have independently evolved in multiple different branches of coronaviruses, probably a dozen times that we know of now.6.  The furin cleavage site is short and can easily happen through recombination with another virus due to coinfection.7.  This is very likely what happened due to infection with the SARS-CoV-2 ancestor and an HKU9-like virus.It is not particularly suspicious that the thing which we were worried about happening and causing a zoonotic spillover event is the thing which actually happened."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Guys, two points here. One, this proposal was rejected. This did not happen! Two, their proposal was for genetic manipulation of an existing virus, which research on the existing corona virus shows was not the case.This has nothing to do with the corona virus strains we are currently dealing with, and more importantly, there has never been any credible research proving that Covid was made in a lab. The only paper that got any traction suggested it was non-manipulation based gain of function research, but that was disproved only a few weeks after the paper&#39;s release as well. I know we all want to know where it came from, but the odds against us ever having actual evidence of it being from a lab are virtually zero. And no, rejected research proposals do not constitute proof of anything."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; DST was implemented in 2010 by the previous Government of Samoa to give more time after work to tend to their plantations, promote public health, and save fuel. Instead, it “[...] defeated its own goals by being used by people to socialise more,” according to the Samoa Observer.Maybe I am lacking context here, but that seems a bit mean on the part of the Samoan government. Is extra socializing such a bad thing?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My observations from reading this comment thread, are that Time is a construct created by jewellers to sell more watches. :)Also, we should switch to UTC globally. My 22:00 is your 22:00 and their 22:00. For me it&#39;s my bedtime, for you it&#39;s lunchtime, and for them it&#39;s breakfast. People should adjust their daily activities around the daylight hours they have, and let time be less of a controlling force in their lives.We live in a globalised world, especially in business. So with the whole world on UTC, everyone knows when the meeting starts, when the delivery arrives, and when the end of the year starts and finishes.And if that fails, we should just attach rockets at the poles and push/pull the planet back upright to get rid of the problem altogether."</p>

Click on the job title next to your name and see where you stand compared to all employees with the same role.At a place where Diversity Equity and Inclusion is a stated goal I think this works well. I also know that people don&#39;t always get paid the same amount, and (as I often explain to my six-year-old) fair doesn&#39;t mean the everything has to be equal, but it is very useful to know where you stand.At my new job, the information on Levels seemed accurate based on my offer, and I was very happy with it."</p>

I still remember a guy proudly telling me about his great contract and his face when I told him that I made almost twice as him."</p>

- whether any app is installed
- SSID of connected wifiand formerly,- medical info
- device usage
- screen time
- device accessoriesI don&#39;t keep anything mission critical on mobile, but this is still a gargantuan set of exploits, and each appear extremely straightforward to validate and pay out the security researcher (and maybe even patch). It&#39;s utterly tragic how Apple (and others) have devolved to become the same monolithic, careless organizations they once displaced.I really, really hope something changes. Soon."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Explain I&#39;m naive: why would Apple&#39;s bug bounty program be so poorly run? Is it simply a sign of organizational failure?  
 (e.g. perhaps the managers running the program have been promoted to a position that they simply don&#39;t belong in, and higher up execs don&#39;t care? Or are they prioritizing profit over success?)I would think that, given the profitability and positioning of Apple in the marketplace, that they would be heavily incentivized to provide large bounties for finding such destructive vulnerabilities. And I imagine that there are plenty of security people working there who genuinely care about fixing fix these issues right away."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If your annual revenue is above $100M, you should be held accountable to a strict version of GPDR enforced by an ombudsman, that requires you to patch all data leaking vulnerabilities within 90 days, or pay out everyone who bought your product.I just updated to iOS 15 and it now tells you which sites you have been compromised on, or had your passwords/info compromised on. To be clear, I use a password manager with a unique password on every site, so it is difficult for something like this to have a significant impact. Nethertheless, I was compromised on hundreds of sites and products, and those were just the accounts that iOS Safari knew about. None of them bothered to reach out and tell me. Even my coffee machine was compromised. Ridiculous."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a mid-sized US manufacturer that recently went through a ransomware scare, we contracted with FireEye for remediation and cybersecurity consultation.  I was shocked that they recommended we install ad-blockers as a corporate policy.  I remarked ads are sometimes useful and that many local companies rely upon them (e.g., the local newspaper).  I use an adblocker just to make the internet more useable, but I was reluctant to make that a corporate policy.  I couldn&#39;t imagine there was any meaningful threat from malware in ads as every company from the Journal to the Times to Nordstrom would be screwed without ads.  But FireEye insisted and we now have adblocking installed with the usual image.  Wild times.  I have to believe this is truly disruptive to the internet as we know it.  It seems to me the ad providers would have a huge incentive to counter this narrative and to make damned sure ads are safe.  I have no idea why that&#39;s not happening."</p>

Also I wanted to make sure that I had the same experience as the users.When I left reddit, for the longest time I still didn&#39;t run Adblock because as a shareholder it still felt hypocritical.But a few years ago I couldn&#39;t take it anymore -- the web go so awful with ads on it became unusable.

In an extensive series of interviews with The Counter, he said it was “hard to find an angle that wasn’t a ludicrous dead end.”&gt; Humbird likened the process of researching the report to encountering an impenetrable “Wall of No”—his term for the barriers in thermodynamics, cell metabolism, bioreactor design, ingredient costs, facility construction, and other factors that will need to be overcome before cultivated protein can be produced cheaply enough to displace traditional meat.Is there anyone on HN with deep expertise in this area who can comment on this article&#39;s scientific accuracy?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"FINALLY an article that looks at the basic scientific fundamentals of this. Lab-grown meat, similar to carbon removal tech, is currently super hyped in the mainstream media.Like Pat Brown, founder of Impossible usually says, paraphrasing: &#34;There is no such thing as lab-grown meat, and there will never be. If somebody figures out how to grow cells reliably in a bioreactor, it will make much more sense to sell it as organs for use in medicine than to eat it (financially).&#34;It just doesn&#39;t make sense to grow meat in the lab if we can make it from plant proteins directly. Period.What makes me sad and angry about the startups and billions of VC money that goes into this is that we need to reduce emissions NOW. We don&#39;t have time to fuck around with sci-fi tech that maybe brings down the price of lab-grown meat to a level that the top 10% of the population might afford it, in 10 or 20 years. It has been proven that there are great ways to make meat alternatives from plant proteins directly, we should invest time and money into expanding that!On a side note, I think for a lot of people the existence of research and startups on lab-grown meat is an excuse to continue eating meat. They say that once it&#39;s there, I&#39;ll of course switch over. But they are not ready to switch over to alternatives like Impossible burgers that are just as good now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Obviously, he&#39;s wrong. There are things we know, there are things we know that we don&#39;t know, and, thirdly, there are things that we don&#39;t know that we don&#39;t know. Anyone betting against autonomous vehicles, fusion reactors, and similar hard challenges knows about that third part and will never say &#34;never&#34; - instead they pad their predictions with &#34;not soon,&#34; &#34;unlikely,&#34; etc. In contrast, this dude went full bore and just said &#34;no way we&#39;ll ever get below $17 per pound.&#34; Again, there is definitionally no chance that the third aspect was baked into that prediction, so he&#39;s either insanely naive or just financially incentivized to act that way. And then I found it:&gt; Humbird’s job is to look into the crystal ball. He’s one of the experts NREL contracts to figure out which approaches are viable at scale, how much they would cost, and ultimately if the government should fund them.Well, if you make it your job to give yes or no predictions, then you cannot take that third factor into account, because you would make it very clear to your employer that your work is absolutely worthless. Someone could have equally hired him 10 years ago to answer: &#34;how many man hours would it take to build a rocket that will take us to Mars?&#34; You think he would have said: &#34;no idea, that&#39;s too unpredictable, we have to leave this to crazy people like Elon and then just see what happens?&#34; No, he would have happily spent the next 2 years writing a 100 page document that would spit out some random number between 10 and 10,000,000 years. And then he would lean on his PhD and call it a scientifically backed result."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For the last year or so I&#39;ve noticed an increasing amount of my legitimate professional interactions going into my &#34;Promotions&#34; tab in Gmail. The effect of which has been, after discovering a few mishaps of this sort, to now regularly and meticulously go through a massive pile of &#34;Promotions&#34; just to make sure I haven&#39;t missed something legitimately urgent or important. Prior to Google&#39;s classification errors producing this particular anxiety I used to basically treat the &#34;Promotions&#34; tab as spam to never look at. Now I&#39;m going through all of it with prejudice which means I&#39;m waaaaaaay more aware of marketing drivel than I used to be. As such, I&#39;m pretty sure this &#34;error&#34; is intentional on Google&#39;s part to produce exactly this outcome of drawing eyeballs to inbox advertising."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I understand Apple&#39;s decision to do this. They want to stick it to Epic. Completely understandable desire on Apple&#39;s part. But, sadly, Apple is letting their desire to get vengeance outweigh the interests of their users in having all the games they want to play on their devices.I have been realizing lately that my loyalty to Apple has been waning over the years after having invested heavily in the ecosystem. This is another representation to me of how Apple&#39;s ecosystem is something you have no control over, and you are at the whim of Apple&#39;s legal team in situations like that to be able to play the games you want to play on your devices.Apple remembered their corporate games they were playing and forgot who their real customer and focus should be: the end users. This decision doesn&#39;t benefit their end users in any meaningful way. It hurts end users to score points in their feud with Epic."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s interesting to compare the situation Epic got itself into with previous episodes of Facebook &amp; Google breaking Apple&#39;s rules.When Facebook and Google misused Developer Enterprise certificates to go beyond internal testing and distribute apps to end-consumers, Apple revoked their accounts.  Both Facebook &amp; Google simply admitted they screwed up and Apple reinstated their accounts.[1]  No lawsuits.Epic broke Apple&#39;s in-app-purchase rules and now Epic promises they will comply but Epic didn&#39;t get their dev account reinstated yet.  Big difference is that Epic rolled the dice by filing a lawsuit about Apple&#39;s unfair rules and because they thought there was enough anti-Apple sentiment that they&#39;d get a sympathetic judgement in their favor.  Their gamble didn&#39;t work and in the process, Tim Sweeny&#39;s defiant attitude just made Apple dig in their heels even further.I&#39;m reminded of that quote, &#34;you come at the King, you best not miss.&#34;EDIT reply to some comments saying Epic didn&#39;t make a &#34;promise&#34; to comply with Apple&#39;s rules:&gt;Did i miss something where they actually said that? In this thread&#39;s Fireball blogpost is a link to Tim Sweeney&#39;s tweet of an email screenshot to Apple&#39;s Phil Schiller stating his &#34;promise&#34;:&gt;Sep 16, 2021 at 5:01 PM; Subject: Fortnite and the App Store; To: Phil Schiller&gt;[..] Epic promises that it will adhere to Apple’s guidelines whenever and wherever we release products on Apple platforms.[...][1] https://www.google.com/search?q=apple+reinstates+google+face..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Epic took a stand and we should be behind them 100%. This case was never about winning on the letter of the contract law, it was about moving the standard of practice and attempting to gain some ground against the evils of mega-Apple. If you are reading this Grubber post and thinking you agree, that&#39;s only because you are used to thinking this way by now.The courts simply do not understand the power companies like Apple and Google have apparently. The startup cost of a competitor would be astronomical, as we&#39;ve seen reflected in the quality, cost, and size of the small handful of other smartphone companies recently. Even if we seem new players become competitive, then what&#39;s to stop us from being back in this same situation in 10 years? 5 years? This is why we have Laws.Not even to mention that the telecom companies are still working against progress and taking absurd cuts for themselves.Hosting, platforming, and The Web are in crisis, as we&#39;re all aware. We should be firmly on the side of open access to our (developers) content. Why let the platforms eat our lunch? Maybe we should just be giving them a snack, or a little treat, but even that would just be for &#34;services rendered&#34;, not as a condition for our meal.I&#39;m just so fucking done with this, sorry I can&#39;t help but be a bit angry."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think part of the problem today with individuals trying to figure out how to moderate their social media usage is that it&#39;s not clear what specifically within social media constitutes harm.Is it the like/upvote mechanism? Hacker News would constitute harmful social media in that case. But what might be lost is a powerful lever for democratic input in terms of content curation and moderation.My vote for what&#39;s more harmful is the scroll. I have a web extension that just removes the scroll on my Facebook feed. A few months after setting it up I all but stopped using Facebook, checking in once maybe every two months to visit folks individually. I haven&#39;t done this for Twitter or IG, but then the quality of my main feed is such that I don&#39;t want to remove it outright and want that aggregation of content, somehow.I think that scrolling in general is harmful as a UX pattern, but the obvious alternative of pagination could create all kinds of complexities around deep-linking and fragmentation of content. All the same I&#39;d love to see more platforms adopt this intentional cap on content associated with a given URL. It turns my engagement with content online from scanning to actual reading."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; After the habit of scrolling and liking wears off, you suddenly find yourself in a joyful place. A quieter, calmer, less demanding place where you don’t want to know what others are doing. You focus on what you want to do.But what if you don&#39;t know what you want to do?I feel like this post was written from the perspective of someone who already has their own life goals sorted out, and social media was clearly acting as an obstacle to accomplishing those well-defined goals, so they dropped social media.But when you&#39;re on your own, it is not a given that you have everything figured out and all you need to do is give yourself a lot of free time and just do what you want. The void that remains is exactly the kind that social media is designed to fill for many people.That kind of feeling almost legitimizes the concept of FOMO, because at a certain point you cannot imagine how anything you&#39;re doing could be more interesting than the things that other people are moving forward with in their lives. You want to aspire to be something, and looking for someone else to copy would mean you at least have some kind of aspiration to work towards, instead of nothing at all.Social media is a net negative overall, but once it&#39;s out of the picture you have to work on yourself, and in that domain there are no easy answers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"“ We persuade our minds that liking pictures and joining virtual groups gives us a sense of belonging. Connection with others”Except in many cases its not persuasion. Joining groups actually does give us these things. My gf is part of “bay area moms” group and the amount of useful tips she gets out of participating in that is significant. Or “bay area hikers” for me. Also, if i want to sell something, I hire facebook to find a buyer for my old ipad or iphone.Social media has caught on to the jobs framework. Jack Dorsey references it directly on Twitter earnings calls. He says we need to fill more jobs for more people. He constantly asks what can people hire twitter for?I think to reduce social media to some of the crappy jobs it does serve artificially diminishes what it can be."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is not reinvention of PHP as some are commenting.
In fact I think this is extremely cool.If I understand it correctly, it allows you to achieve reactive data flow in a single page app without any boilerplate.Meaning - you update the database on the server and all the relevant UI(s) will automatically receive the updated data and re-render only the parts of the UI that display that data.This would require a ton of PHP and Javascript dealing with networking, websockets, routing, serializing data and so on.Haven&#39;t tried it yet, but very curious to see if it works."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing I admire about the Clojure community is audacious projects like this. While a ton of these seem to run out of steam, they certainly shoot for the stars and tend to come pretty dang close for a while.For those working in Typescript, Blitz.js seems to do a great job at drastically decreasing the plumbing you have to write to shuttle data between Postgres and React. There’s also a ton of goodies like auth built in. From my first impression it’s the closest the JS community has ever come to a Django, and that’s very high praise in my book."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of Meteor.js[0] from back in the day (2014?), which had a very similar approach—you wrote code that ran on both the frontend and the backend, and database updates were propagated automatically. It suffered from a pretty hard reliance on Mongodb and its own package manager (Atmosphere), and it was at odds with the rest of the JS ecosystem which was settling on NPM.This project looks very cool! I like the focus on composition, Meteor was lacking that (and really, most other frameworks do as well).[0] https://www.meteor.com/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love how honest this is about the limitations and the whole design process. Truly a great example of a real hacker projectI have a Georgi keyboard (mentioned in the article) which I started getting to grips with then put aside during a way too busy period at work. This has made me want to dig it out and try again.I’m also thinking that two of those faunchpads put together on the long edges could make an even better ‘back of phone’ keyboard (or back of mini tablet) for a handy portable note taking device"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a Blackberry fanboy. My Key2 was far, far superior a device to the latest gen iPhone I own. I have tried for years to get used to glass, and while I&#39;m ok with it, it&#39;s still a massive compromise.My second favourite mobile-device keyboard was that of the Ericsson T28 [0] from about 20 years ago. At some point I accidentally discovered a feature I just found outlined at the bottom of page 28 of the T28 user manual [1], where the volume rocker switch on the left side would act as a text entry modifier key, so that pressing the number 2 button normally resulted in a B, holding the volume up and pressing 2 gave a C, and holding volume down and pressing 2 gave a D.I remember getting so, so fast and so comfortable at texting with this method. By random chance, an acquaintance a few years ago in a co-working place had an old T28 that still worked and let me play with. Naturally the first thing I tried was the old input method - and it was like my muscle memory never left. I was so fast and so comfortable with it. She was blown away... after 20 years she still had no idea that that mode existed.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ericsson_T28[1] https://www.lokety.com/ericsson_t28s_manual.pdf"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I applaud any effort to rethink keyboards from first principles.After years of shoulder, neck and back pain I discovered that the root cause was the standard keyboard design. It causes rounded shoulders. Perhaps my shoulders are just too wide. This pinched all sorts of muscles, tendons and nerves. Doctors and physical therapists just failed to identify the issue. Weight lifting didn&#39;t help all that much, even with a strong back I had to scrunch and round the shoulders to type.I finally picked up a second keyboard, and used one for each hand. It was surprisingly easy to convert to. Just added some larger rubber nub things on home row.It&#39;s been life changing. Years of pain was gone in days. No special design necessary.Each keyboard is arranged at an outward angle, distanced so my shoulders are in a natural position.I can&#39;t recommend this enough.On Mac it required a system preference tweak (Karibiner app) so each keyboard can share shortcut keys."</p>

Several models have mainline LineageOS support, I&#39;m running Lineage on my Mix 2S and hope to have years worth of updates going forward.
The hardware is really good value as long as you install an non-tainted OS."</p>

Put one on your resume, the other in production. Everyone goes home happy.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was very keen on machine learning for some time- I started working with ML in the mid 90s.  The work I did definitely could have been replaced with a far less mathematically principled approach, but I wanted to learn ML because it was sexy and I assumed that at some point in the future we&#39;d have a technological singularity due to ML research.I didn&#39;t really understand the technology (gradient descent) underlying the training, so I went to grad school and spent 7 years learning gradient descent and other optimization techniques.  Didn&#39;t get any chances to work in ML after that because... well, ML had a terrible rep in all the structural biology fields and even the best models were at most 70% accurate.  Not enough data, not enough training methods, not enough CPU time.Eventually I landed at Google in Ads and learned about their ML system, Smartass.  I had to go back and learn a whole different approach to ML (Smartass is a weird system) and then wait years for Google to discover GPU-based machine learning (they have Vincent Vanhouke to thank- he sat near Jeff Dean and stuffed 8 GPUs into a workstation to prove that he could do training faster than thousands of CPUs in prod) and deep neural networks.Fast forward a few years, and I&#39;m an expert in ML, and the only suggestion I have is that everybody should read and internalize: https://research.google/pubs/pub43146/
So little of success in ML comes from the sexy algorithms and so much just comes from ensuring a bunch of boring details get properly saved in the right place."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recall attending a technical talk given by a team of senior ML scientists from a prestigious SV firm (that I shall not name here).  The talk was given to an audience of scientists at a leading university.The problem was estimating an incoming train speed from an embedded microphone sensor near the train station.  The ML scientists used the latest techniques in deep learning to process the acoustic time series.  The talk session was two hours long.  This project was their showcase.I guess no one in the prestigious ML team knew about the Doppler shift and its closed form expression.  Typically taught in a highschool physics class.  A simple formula that you can calculate by hand: no need for a GPU cluster."</p>

  - Install just following instructions described

  - F-droid works

  - Apps installed from F-droid works

  - Full screen videos from Newpipe play smoothly

* The bad  - Had to enable &#34;invert colors&#34; to get correct colors

  - Mouse scroll is inverted

  - Can&#39;t choose correct layout of physical keyboard because android thinks there&#39;s no physical keyboard connected

  - Android gestures on the desktop are annoying

  - Can&#39;t access whole screen of vertical apps and they appear sideways on my screen

  - Multiwindow mode didn&#39;t work at first

* The ugly:  - Nothing is actually ugly. Everything mostly works as expected"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the major advantages of Waydroid that I&#39;ve found is that it&#39;s lighter than Anbox. I know some here have compute to spare, but it makes a big difference on my Pinephone :)It&#39;s still early days for Waydroid, but it&#39;s also decidedly a step forwards."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Has anyone had success getting any of these containers to work with a camera?Recently, my bank discontinued their website based deposit system for checks in favor of their app.  I&#39;m reluctant to keep an app with full access to my account on my phone, so a container system like Waydroid or Anbox would be great if I could just emulate the app when I need it.  Has anyone else run into this issue and, if so, how have you dealt with it?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We use Phoenix and LiveView to power all of our non-video interactions on Glimesh.tv[0] and the immediate out of the box features and performance are unmatched. LiveView allowed us to get a completely real time updating channel where streamers can edit their metadata (game, title, viewer count, etc) and all of the viewers can see it in real time. Not to mention we implemented a distributed chat system that sends message updates in real time to both browser clients and API clients. Both of these features combined amount to less than 1000 lines of code and &#34;just work&#34; across multiple web nodes.It can be daunting to jump into such a strange world as a LiveView environment may look (Elixir syntax, OTP terminology, etc) but honestly once you dig in deeper, everything just makes sense. LiveView (and HEEx) continue to be very simple to understand abstractions on top of the rock solid OTP platform. It&#39;s a joy to build real time applications using it, and I very much appreciate the &#34;developer experience&#34; focus both Chris &amp; Jose have for us Elixir devs!I&#39;m excited for the launch of Phoenix 1.6 and HEEx is shaping up to be a complete replacement for your traditional SPA + Backend API, and using one consistent language for your full stack really has very freeing &amp; powerful benefits, especially for small teams![0] https://github.com/Glimesh/glimesh.tv/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Creator of Phoenix here. I&#39;m happy to answer any questions folks have about LiveView, Phoenix, or Elixir in general. We&#39;ve had some big LiveView features land recently with uploads and HEEx so now&#39;s a great time to jump in!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I created Phoenix to build real-time applications. Before it could even render HTML, Phoenix supported real-time messaging. To do that, Phoenix provides an abstraction called Channels.I think it&#39;s really neat that Chris started out with real-time messaging. When I first started working with web frameworks, it definitely felt like real-time stuff was an afterthought—a layer built atop an older model that leaked a lot of the details.Working with LV has been an absolute delight. Need to render a PDF and download? Fire off a `Task.async` to render in a separate thread on the backend. When it&#39;s done, that thread can just `send` a message to the LV process to update the UI that the PDF is ready. So easy and painless. LV really hits a sweet spot for me: I&#39;m primarily a backend dev, but with LV I can build really nice stuff on the front-end with minimal effort/headache from NPM."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If anyone is curious, the origami stellated [1] icosahedron in the second image is built from Sonobe modules [2][3], a kind of modular origami. Basic structures formed by Sonobe units have 3-sided 45-45-90 pyramids on top of an underlying polyhedra with triangular faces.Each Sonobe unit functions as an edge in the underlying structure, so building a structure around an icosahedron, which has 20 faces and 30 edges, requires 30 units, and yields a stellated icosahedron with 60 faces and 90 edges.You can also build a stellated octahedron from 12 pieces, and a stellated tetrahedron (which actually just appears as a cube) with 6 pieces, but that&#39;s just the beginning [4]![1]: Strictly speaking, it&#39;s not a true stellation, which is formed by extending the planes of faces until they intersect.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is super bad ass.I made 8 LED icosahedra and 12 octahedra for a permanent lighting install in Boulder. They’re much larger (and thus were easier to make albeit much harder to handle ;) ) than this. I still gotta do the case study but some pics:

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Fred Rogers really appreciated the world from a child&#39;s perspective.  The idea that when you&#39;re doing everything for the first time it can be very exciting and also scary. He often talks about the &#34;drama&#34; of everyday life. Imagine going to get a haircut for the first time, sitting in a chair that moves up and down and tilts in a way that no other chair you know does, experiencing all the sounds and sensations of scissors and clippers around your head.I hope that we all can see the world from a young person&#39;s perspective sometimes and realise that we don&#39;t need to inject any additional &#34;drama&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The show’s final cuts reflected many similarly exacting interventions. Once, Rogers provided new lyrics for the “Tomorrow” song that ended each show, to ensure that children watching on Friday wouldn’t expect a show on Saturday, when the show didn’t air. And Rogers’s secretary, Elaine Lynch, remembered how, when one script referred to putting a pet “to sleep,” he excised it for fear that children would be worried about the idea of falling asleep themselves.Rogers was extraordinarily good at imagining where children’s minds might go.The more I learn about him, the more I feel he was underappreciated in his time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My mother took me to meet him at a book signing when I was very young. She was a kindergarten teacher who studied early childhood development. I got to speak to him briefly, and thought it was neat.Later in life I asked her about it, and she admitted that she only brought me because she knew how much I enjoyed the show, and that she personally found his manner of speaking (on the show) to be a bit grating. However, she said that upon meeting him in the flesh, all her prejudices immediately dissipated, and she could immediately tell that he was one of the most wholesome, honest, charming people she&#39;d ever met.I haven&#39;t watched the semi-recent film about his life because I&#39;m a big softie and I&#39;m sure I&#39;d bawl, but I do know that he was a very good man who will be missed for a long time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am one of the people responsible for making these lists. The fact that the general public as well as journalists think this data is accurate in anyway is really funny. This an exercise of futility that only increases the overall cost and provides job security for me :)No one working in a hospital knows how much do we acquire things for, or how much we get paid for doing things in advance. And only like 8 people can tell you that information 3 months after the fact.Take the simple exercise of figuring out cost/revenue of an aspirin administration.Cost depends on:
1. Are you an outpatient/Obsveration v. inpatient v. ED?
2. Are you on Medicaid?
3. Is the hospital a part of GPO organization or not?
4. Is contractual obligations of GPO includes/excludes Aspirin?Reimbursement depends on:
1. Insurance
2. Group which you are under the insurance from
3. Contract language whether its a fee/service or bundled
4. Is the visit covered or not
5. how the visit/procedure was coded (most important and opaque factor)Everybody in the know, knows that these lists are a joke, but no one can prove it."</p>

I pay now way more than I did with iCloud, but I am back in control. I am more productive.- Listening to Music takes 3 clicks and just a few seconds
Wired headphones never run out of battery and have superior audio quality- I can take real photos wiht high quality instead of relying on ever newer iPhone models for thousands of dollars which will always have lesser quality than a mirrorless camera for the same price- I have fun again discovering bands and artists on Bandcamp instead of mind numbing listening to Apple Music playlists- Coding via neovim on a terminal and just being on my keyboard navigating not only tmux and co, but also my OS is way more productive and fasterWhich of these can I not do on a Mac?"</p>

I&#39;ve been working since I was 19 years old and I have trust issues. It was very difficult for me to believe in myself and jump into the void but I&#39;m 42 and if I don&#39;t do it now I will never do it.Anyway, I&#39;m a couple of months from the first beta launch.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"We&#39;re a keygen.sh user for our Modality product at Auxon. It&#39;s excellent. Some folks on the team have experience with some of traditional &#34;giants&#34; in the space like Nalpeiron and Flexera. Working with keygen.sh is an absolute joy by comparison. It&#39;s not without a few oddities and caveats of its own, but the experience writ large is so incredibly positive that those few issues are easy to forgive and forget.It&#39;s really interesting to get some backstage access to how this fantastic product came to be and what underpins the motivating thesis behind it.From one founder (also with little ones and a fantastically supportive partner) to another, my hat&#39;s off to you. My many thanks to both you and your partner. Being able to just grab keygen.sh and integrate licensing into our product helped us go from MA to GA in about a week and was also essential in getting some investors over the hump to funding (because we could show traction and an easier path to more of it). As a result, I got to reduce my stress level and spend more time with my kids over the summer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Been extremely happy with mine the past couple months. The little modular port attachments seemed like a novelty at first, but now it feels absurd that you&#39;d buy a laptop with a bunch of &#34;hardcoded&#34; ports that you can&#39;t ever change.The only real Linux related quirk I&#39;ve run into so far is that you have to disable panel self refresh (it&#39;s on by default and causes stuttering). Other than that tiny thing I pretty much just installed my stuff and started using it.One little anecdote: I got a card in the mail from Framework saying that there was a problem with the cable for the touchpad, and it had instructions on how to fix it. Contrast that to my experience with Apple where they would delete forum threads for laptop problems and spend years denying issues until legal action forced them to acknowledge it.Anyway, I&#39;m a fan. I&#39;m really looking forward to when the marketplace opens up with some new parts. I really want my blank keyboard. I&#39;m hoping 2021 will be the year I can own a laptop without a god damn windows logo emblazoned on the keys."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The baseline, preassembled model starts at $1000. Windows 10 Home, quad-core i5, 8 GB RAM, 256 GB storage, a nice 2256x1504 display, thin and light (1.3kg, 11.7&#34; x 9&#34; x 0.6&#34;). Compare that to your other thin and light options at this pricepoint.XPS 13, $1020* i5* 8 GB RAM* 256 GB storage* 1920 x 1200 display* 1.2 kg, 11.6&#34; x 7.8&#34; x 0.6&#34;MacBook Pro: $1300* M1* 8 GB RAM* 256 GB storage* 2560 x 1600 display* 1.4kg, 12&#34; x 8.7&#34; x 0.6&#34;It&#39;s almost a no-brainer, even without considering the repairability, unless you like macOS. Unfortunately, not many people see repairability as a feature yet due to the toxic status quo, but this could change. I think that after brand recognition is established, this laptop could legitimately be competitive in the laptop market, and not just appeal to hardcore techies."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just got one of these last weekend(I ordered it in early August) and so far it’s really great. The modular I/O and general mission of the company was what initially sold me on it, but now actually being hands on with it, I definitely feel secure in my decision to get one. I can’t overstate how good these modular ports are.I also really like that you can bring your own hardware in a lot of cases. For example I had an extra M.2 SSD laying around, so I ordered mine without one and installed it. You can also do this with the RAM, and even the wifi card.The only thing I’ve disliked about it so far is the arrow keys on the keyboard. Having full size keys for left and right but split keys for up and down feels weird, I would have preferred all full size arrow keys and a small right shift(because let’s be honest, when was the last time you used the right shift key?).For anyone curious about Linux on it, I’m running Arch and had basically 0 problems specific to the device. It’s my understanding there were some incompatibilities with certain kernel versions before so maybe some of these problems exist in distros like Debian with an older kernel, but I have had no issues.All in all, it’s just an exciting project and nice to see innovation in the space that isn’t just rounded corners or a sleeker edge or something where they take modularity or performance away for the sake of aesthetics."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My impression is that every SaaS that is successful on ProductHunt (PH) or HN gets copied dozens of times within a few months. That&#39;s especially true for technically simple products. A good example is maybe privacy-friendly web analytics: I think products like Fathom and Simple Analytics were the first to really go after this angle (undoubedtly there were others before them though), and in less than 6 months dozens (hundreds?) of copycats turned up with exactly the same USP and the exact same look &amp; feel. And interestingly it isn&#39;t the first mover who seems to win that market but rather the company with the most agressive (and sometimes outright misleading) marketing. So being the first doesn&#39;t guarantee your success anymore, at least if you don&#39;t have enough time to grow undisturbed.Personally I&#39;d avoid posting products on PH or HN for that reason and instead focus on growing organically in a niche market where you&#39;re not immediately discoverable by copycat founders. In general PH feels more and more phony to me and I think there&#39;s a lot of astroturfing going on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ironically, the increase of SaaS businesses have made me more vary of actually using them.It seems like so many wants to have a successful semi-solo SaaS that pay their bills. They aren&#39;t longer a way to sell a product and a startup idea, but an attempt at a lifestyle. Some people throw up smooth landing pages for barely working products, and quickly move on to the next idea if it doesn&#39;t stick.How can I invest time and money in using a product if I&#39;m afraid the founder will bail after a few months?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a founder at heart; I&#39;ve loved creating - and have a software background. I really resonate with the paraphrased vibe of way, way more SaaS companies. I&#39;ve been looking outside of SaaS to potentially harder science companies rather than SaaS for future endeavors.It is too easy to: splash page, Wordpress, &#34;rails new saas&#34; for a product and then try to sell via SEO / outbound, etc that the field is quite saturated - and un-discovered niches are a lot harder than say 2013."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Based on the distribution of human bones on the upper and lower tall, we propose that the force of a high-temperature, debris-laden, high-velocity blast wave from an airburst/impact (i) incinerated and flayed their exposed flesh, (ii) decapitated and dismembered some individuals, (iii) shattered many bones into mostly cm-sized fragments, (iv) scattered their bones across several meters, (v) buried the bones in the destruction layer, and (vi) charred or disintegrated any bones that were still exposed.What a way to go"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like the theory that this event is what inspired the biblical story of Sodom. It reminds me of how paleontologists use the ancient art and stories of Native Australians to figure out what Pleistocene animals looked like and how they may have behaved.In the story, Lot and his family were one of the few people to escape the city before its destruction. God told his family to not look back at the city as it was being destroyed. Lot&#39;s wife looked back and turned into &#34;a pillar of salt&#34;. Maybe this is a metaphor for the people who went back to the site and couldn&#39;t grow food there due to the hypersaline that was spread across the region by the airburst."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another major explosion theorized to be caused by bolides is the 1626 Wanggongchang Explosion[1] in Beijing which is considered one of the major causes of the fall of the Chinese Ming dynasty.Although having its epicenter in the middle of a gunpowder factory would of course also heavily imply a gunpowder explosion (or maybe both).[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanggongchang_Explosion"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been wearing a Casio F-91W for a number of years now and it really is a joy. It&#39;s always there, and it always works.I&#39;ve gone down the rabbit hole with expensive time pieces but they become a burden / obligation rather than a tool - especially as the prices of certain pieces in the secondary market have gone so high - so over time I&#39;ve reverted back to much cheaper watches and find myself getting more joy out of the cheaper &amp; much better value for money brands.Very occasionally I&#39;ll take it off in favour of a dress watch for a special event but otherwise I just wear it all the time, knowing that if it finally fails I&#39;m looking at $10 to replace."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I got a Casio watch from Amazon about five years ago, there was a deal on and it was about CAD$20. A budgetary driven decision, for sure!But it&#39;s been fascinating to see, over the years, how many times I&#39;ve been approached (in a coffee shop or some other public place) by serious Casio enthusiasts, keen to ask about my watch and to show theirs. There&#39;s so many variations, colours, limited-runs editions... I seem to have accidentally stumbled into a niche with lots of passionate hobbyists - I&#39;m sort of glad I had to replace the awful strap, which snapped, so I actually have something to contribute to the conversation. I had no idea Casio watches were such a big thing, but now I&#39;m not at all surprised there are modding projects like this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s fun to be a Casio fan. I rediscovered the classic 5600E (https://gshock.com/watches/digital/dw5600e-1v) a few years ago and was thrilled to be in a position to afford what I only got to admire behind the jewelry cases as a kid.Then I discovered the community of G-Shock modders and collectors.  There is something very special about Casio watches that is hard to describe.  In some sense I feel they take on the platonic form of a digital timepiece.  And they&#39;re cheap (although they have special ed. titanium models that resell for &gt;$2K).It&#39;s true that they are conversation starters among other fans.The original G-Shock watch released in 1984 was designed with an aim at the &#34;triple 10&#34; concept.  That is, the battery should last 10 years, be able to survive a 10-meter drop and be water resistant to 10 bars."</p>

Nor is it reserved for their flagship models - the 2016 iPhone SE also gets the latest and greatest.Meanwhile, my flagship android phone from 2018, the Samsung Galaxy S9, is stuck on the last version of Android.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s funny how every society has its own way of mistreating children, yet never considers it a problem at the time. We look at the ways children were harmed and exploited throughout history and shake our heads at how our morally underdeveloped forebears could be so cruel and misguided. Then we turn around and declare that our children have no right whatsoever to privacy, and that everything they read and write should be surveilled 24/7 by teams of strangers, for their &#34;own good&#34;.I firmly believe that a hundred years, people will look back on practices like this and shake their heads at the appalling attitudes their primitive ancestors had towards children. But I imagine that&#39;s little comfort to the kids subject to this kind of abuse."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wonder how much harm the constant surveillance does.We are training kids that someone is always watching. That they have to censor their thoughts and hold in their feelings rather than talk about them with others for fear of it being determined to be &#39;wrong&#39;. How many of these kids will be suspended, expelled, medicated, etc for things that were harmless? I think this surveillance will cause these kids to be less independent and delay their maturation because it&#39;s safer to do what you&#39;re told, not explore questions you have, and suppress your opinions.The number of conversations I had in school that would have gotten me I&#39;m trouble today would be a lot. I would guess they would have expelled me for some of it, even though it was totally harmless.Where is the cost benefit analysis? Or is this just another &#39;common sense&#39; solution because &#39;think of the children&#39;?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is pretty outrageous. This constant need to fully control and monitor everything your kids are doing is getting out of hand and will by itself lead to severe problems and mental issues for the future generations.I mean, who didnt share or look at some porn when they were 10 years old? Would it be worth it for a whole army of teachers and consultants to descend on you and file an “incident report” and a “follow up” and “de brief” for this? What a colossal waste of resources and money. The $300k for the software could be better spent elsewhere.And yes, one suicide was apparently prevented, but then here we are again at the same argument, its like the one in the current apple/child porn case.Should we all get monitored just because of one positive but disproportionately small outcome?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is unlikely to work because of the timing delay. Suppose a member of Congress has access to inside information and trades on it. They have 45 days to disclose the trade. By the time the trade is disclosed, the market has already moved: if Pelosi or McConnell or whoever bought low so they could sell high, a month later the increase is probably already baked in."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"https://www.cnbc.com/id/218.htmlThis reminds me of a study which showed that even if you bought the same stocks a month after Buffett and his holding company Berkshire Hathaway disclosed their own purchases, you&#39;d still be way ahead of the game.&#34;The market ... appears to under-react to the news of a Berkshire stock investment since a hypothetical portfolio that mimics Berkshire&#39;s investments created the month after they are publicly disclosed earns positive abnormal returns of 14.26% per year.&#34;But Buffett is a long term investor. 
I am not sure how long the Pelosis hold their stocks...But yes, insider trades :("</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a bit like a popular hedge fund strategy known as alpha capture. In the alpha capture strategy, funds look at the buy/sell recommendations made by analysts (for example those at the major banks). Applying a systematic approach means that they can measure the accuracy of each individual analyst and choose whether or not to follow along by trading the advice from that person. The best analysts eventually get hired into funds for their picks to be exclusive.I built something (DueDilly) that works in a similar way by monitoring the performance of Reddit user&#39;s stock recommendation and tracking how each idea performs and which users do well. You can choose to trade alongside them based on their track records.My site:

Each one boils down to this &#34;I, a stranger, stayed for a few nights in this other strangers home for free, and they were good human beings&#34;. That social proof carried to any part of the globe you visited.I cannot think of an internet app that brought people together in a more meaningful and wholesome way at scale.It was great while it lasted."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Airbnb ruined Couchsurfing because it changed social expectations around hosting strangers at your house. Before Airbnb, no one really even thought people would pay for the privilege to sleep on your couch or your spare bedroom. But once Airbnb started getting popular, I think a lot of hosts on CS were thinking well, this is neat, but I could get paid doing this. And a lot of CS guests became refugees from Airbnb thinking &#34;well, if Airbnb wants me to pay for this, why do I go to CS and get it for free?&#34;I CS&#39;d only once, in Ghana in 2011. It was great, but I was too late for the trend, it died pretty shortly after."</p>

Typed my password, got it wrong. Typed it again, got it wrong. Eventually got locked out of my account, despite being extremely careful to type my password correctly. Went to IT and had them unlock my account...Went back to my PC and tried to log in again. Typed my password very carefully, letter by letter, watching each letter come up on screen as I went. When I went to type the letter p, nothing happened. I hit p repeatedly, nothing.I figured the switch for the p key on my keyboard had died or something, so I went to IT and got a new keyboard. Unplugged the old, plugged in the new. Still no p. OK, this is getting ridiculous. Clicked on accessibility tools and tried to use the on-screen keyboard to type in my password. _Still couldn&#39;t type the letter p, even with the on-screen keyboard._Ended up having to hard reset the machine, and then everything was fine and dandy. Still have no idea what could have happened. It ended up being the last straw that pushed me to Ubuntu, and I&#39;ve never looked back."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This could be the last time we see these funny videos. In this elections they “defeated” all opposition candidates with electronic ballot. Before electronic ballot results, even with all election fraud you see on camera, 90% of opposition candidates were winning in Moscow and Saint-Petersburg. Electronic ballot results were delayed by a few hours and when they released it turned out that opposition lost everywhere. This means next time they won’t even bother with a fraud in camera, they just put the numbers they need in a computer and declare a victory."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had a discussion with some friends about how impressive it is that Putin can do so many outrageous things and the world doesn’t stop him. Clear election fraud, assassinating foreigners, invading Crimea, etc. there are very few other countries that get free passes like Putin does."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the high score but low placement on the HN page, I’m guessing this is being heavily flagged."</p>
