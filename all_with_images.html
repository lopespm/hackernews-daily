								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve spent a fair amount of time talking with nurses about the problems. I&#39;m related to a bunch of people who are nurses across disciplines (ER, ICU, med/surg, etc). It&#39;s been enlightening hearing them talk about the problems...1. Many new nurses make the same or more and long time nurses. It&#39;s frustrating when the nurse in charge with the most experience is making less than new nurses. Some hospitals are even trying to stop nurses from talking about pay.2. Patients in COVID have become downright mean. Add this to the problems nurses have management and doctors (who are often rude and arrogant) and it&#39;s a poor culture. The quality of the environment, from a mental health standpoint, is on the decline.3. IT systems that they have to use were designed by people who have not talked with the workers who use them. They may have been designed with laws and compliance in mind. Nurses aren&#39;t the people who choose or pay for these systems. But, they use them a lot (maybe the most) and it&#39;s obvious they weren&#39;t taken into account when designing the UX. It&#39;s maddening for them.This one is big for product designers. Often we listen to the people who pay for it and miss out on the people who actually have to use it.4. Nurses are the catch all for jobs. Not enough aides? Nurses do the work. Food service workers don&#39;t want to take food into a patients room... nurses will do it. Not only do they have higher ratios of patients but they fill in the work when other areas have shortages, too. So, the work per patient goes up. Pay doesn&#39;t go up, though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is this a shock?- Demanding work: 12 hour shifts, irregular schedules, night shifts, physically exhausting, limited breaks (including bathroom/water!)- High responsibility with unsafe conditions. You&#39;re literally responsible for people&#39;s lives. Poor staffing ratios stretch you thin and make you more likely to make mistakes. And if you make a mistake, you&#39;re at huge risk for litigation... and now criminal consequences too. Responsibilities, resources, and staffing stretched even thinner due to the pandemic.- Administration that treats you as something to be optimized and does the absolute bare minimum to support you. Instead they tack on additional tasks, expectations, and requirements (&#34;no water at a nurse&#39;s station!&#34;). They encourage a culture where nurses provide a concierge service to &#39;guests&#39; instead of critical care to patients.- Hostile/entitled patients. I&#39;d guess many/most patients are not an issue, but it only takes a couple of difficult/combative patients to really ruin your conditions.- Low pay given the responsibility and working conditions for non-travel nurses. https://nurseslabs.com/nurse-salary/#nurse_salaries_by_state Like many others pointed out here, in tech I make way more than a nurse for a job that&#39;s less demanding, has far lower stakes, and is of far less value to society.To me the blame lies mainly in middle/upper management, whose role is to build and empower an effective workforce. If 90% of your workers are considering leaving, you blew it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a close relation that works for one of the oldest pediatric hospitals in the country. It was recently revealed that they will be shuttering almost all pediatric services in the next year because they can 10x their profits by only serving elderly clients. The entire purpose of this organization was to provide pediatric healthcare, and it wasn’t losing money…Sometimes, it feels like we’re min-maxing ourselves to death over here."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very favorable comments all around from the very online crowd who comments here.  I’m much more skeptical.I have no doubt this will work well for some students, but as someone who taught online for the better part of two years I can say with certainty that the experience is very different and (for the wide majority of students) worse than being in person.My colleagues and I can attest to both general learning loss (ie., forgetting specific subject matter information) and a loss of broader “studying skills” (ie., coming to class and doing homework) after the pandemic.In intro classes in our department, mean grades have been a whole standard deviation lower than the long run pre-pandemic average.  That’s a huge effect!This is also not just specific to our department or university but has been written about widely in the higher ed press.People have been confidently predicting that online education “is the future” since the 1990’s.  IMO the lesson of the pandemic is “no it’s not and it’s never going to be.”If online works for you, awesome.  Enjoy!   There are great resources out there.   But I don’t think you are in the majority."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Online learning resources are amazing. Compared to pre-internet, the depth, quality and accessibility is amazing. It really does open an opportunity route for a lot of people.However...Institutional learning, whether it&#39;s K-12, colleges, techs or whatnot have barely changed. The same fundamental dynamics exist, whether it&#39;s tertiary sorting and prestige or primary teaching methods. Education still serves and fails the same groups of people as it did before, in much the same way.Education is an enormous &#34;industry.&#34; It&#39;s in the same realm as defense, energy or transport. Possibly even more important.I really hope to see online resources develop in such a way that schools can be built around them. A formula that a middle school principal anywhere, no matter how rural and remote, can implement. Why can&#39;t we have the best of both worlds?The classroom model didn&#39;t work well for me as a student. I don&#39;t think remote-only would have worked either."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am looking forward to the day, when quality formal education is available online to all which you may complete at your own pace instead of going with a strict semester and class system. Also, along with offline schools for supporting social learning and helping classes which require offline components like labs, in person support classes, interest based study groups etc."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Over the course of a few years I spent a lot of time in a secure environment in a DoD facility to which I had to travel multiple times for a project. The environment, a maze of cubicles filled with computers, had been installed inside a historic building. For historic preservation reasons, the exterior windows were kept as built. For security reasons, there was a sheet of plywood painted white inside all of the windows. The building allowed no natural light to enter and emitted only a diffuse glow. It was a miserable place to spend long days, illuminated only by flickering fluorescent light.We had some serious storms come through while I was there. A lot of the permanent residents went home. As I was a visitor and there just for as long as it took me to fix some problems, I was encouraged to stay and work late. I was assured that we would not lose power because the building had been recently equipped with a generator.A storm came through and the building lost power. It was almost entirely pitch black in the building full of computers, which all went dark, fans and disks suddenly silent. A small fraction of the emergency lights came on. Most were in disrepair and never lit up. It turns out that in a secure environment, one has to make special arrangements to have someone inspect the emergency lighting. We heard the generator spin up. Still no computers, no lights.In the darkness, one little nook came to life. This nook contained the coffee pot, microwave, and refrigerator. Apparently this organization considered only one piece of equipment important enough to be connected to the generator. We thereafter referred to it as the mission critical coffee pot."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I heard a legend once that someone at IBM in the &#34;blue suit and tie&#34; days found himself to be irreplaceable. So at his next contract negotiations, he politely demanded the dress code be removed from his contract.And then he never shaved again, or wore anything more formal than a Hawaiian shirt. Much to the anger of his entire management chain.I read this. I loved it. I remember it. But I cannot for the life of me find any references to it online and worry that I dreamed it all.I would love if someone here has a reference to this and can share it with me. Or tell me I am truly crazy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On being acquired by IBM things went downhill at the company I was working at - no kettles or coffee machines allowed and you had to buy your tea and coffee from the company store/machines (UK - probably run by Serco or some similar awfulness). All the cool computers taken off the desks and stuck in server rooms and you had to use a managed windows PC which in my case managed to crash once or more times a day thanks to some aspect of the Rational Clearcase filesystem driver.I remember all the lectures from overconfident bullshitters with shiny shoes. A company run by salesmen. It is SO SO nice that IBM got eclipsed by the internet tech companies. Even if they are arrogant/difficult in their own way it was a victory for the technically and ethically competent.It seemed then that IBM was where software went to die."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The problem is not so much that selinux is too complicated (it is as complicated as it needs to be), but that we all run software we don&#39;t understand.The whole IT ecosystem has become a hail mary. Even admins usually have no idea what a certain program actually wants to do. If the admin knows how to install the app so that it actually runs, you call them a good admin.From a security point of view, an application is like a nuclear power plant. It&#39;s good if it works as planned, but if something blows up it endangers your whole enterprise.The whole container movement can be seen as putting the apps in a sarcophagus like Chernobyl. That way the radiation hopefully stays in, but history has shown that it really doesn&#39;t. Also, the wheel of history has just turned one more iteration and now admins just view the sarcophagus as something you deploy as you previously deployed the app. Who is responsible that it is air tight? Well, uh, nobody, really.You can&#39;t even blame the applications for that. Let&#39;s say you want to build a good, secure application. How do you know what files your application will try to open? What syscalls it wants to call? Library and framework functions tend to not document that properly.Obscure files like /etc/localtime, /etc/resolv.conf, /etc/ld.so.conf, /dev/zero ... how can you expect devs to build well documented and well sandboxable applications if they don&#39;t know which files their library functions will open?You may have heard of /etc/resolv.conf ... but have you heard of /etc/gai.conf? /etc/nsswitch.conf? /etc/host.conf? Wouldn&#39;t it be great if the man page of getaddrinfo mentioned those (mine only mentions gai.conf)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As an experienced RHEL admin, a few years ago I probably would have said this is very bad advice in any professional context, and you should spend the time to learn it because it will save you one day.Now, I think my advice would be: Put everything in a container, and learn how to run Docker or Podman (or k8s) in a secure way (ie no root containers, be very careful with volume mounts, etc). Yes, they aren’t as mature as SELinux, but containers aim to provide many of the same benefits that SELinux does (and even more) except in a way that’s much easier to manage. Even better is that these container runtimes often come with SELinux and AppArmor policies out of the box on good Linux distros."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve always preferred apparmor. SELinux has always seemed radically more complex for very little benefit, unless you have a tightly constrained OS (like Android, where the VM does most of the work and every app has the same sort of security policy) or a team of admins working full time to maintain it (again, like Android).Apparmor is weak in all the same ways SELinux is weak, at least in terms of the ways that actually matter - that is to say, a kernel exploit is the simplest way out of either. But anyone can write an apparmor profile for any program in an hour, and if you actually know wtf you&#39;re doing you can build very strong profiles and trivially test and maintain them.SELinux is &#34;good&#34; in that if you are building a system like Android, great, consumers get very tight policies for free, and SELinux is ultimately more expressive. But I think 99% of companies looking at an LSM MAC should probably roll apparmor."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The state I lived in developed one of those covid tracking apps. I asked for the source code and was told it wasn&#39;t available and would never be. I talked to people working on other software developed for the state and they all think that software shouldn&#39;t be public.It seems crazy to me that taxpayers pay for this software but it doesn&#39;t belong to them.Knowing what I do know I gotta wonder if it&#39;s just about those developers being ashamed how bad their software is and don&#39;t want others to see it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Large consulting companies like Accenture have entire divisions of their business devoted to &#34;government&#34;. These divisions make money by developing software for governments. It is very much against their interest for this software to be open source because 1) there is visibility into their performance and 2) they can&#39;t sell very similar software to the same government if everyone knows what software they&#39;ve already built.These are the real vested interests preventing this code becoming open source and why lots of government agencies who do their own development are perfectly happy to release the code or access to their APIs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve often wondered if we need to radically change the State&#39;s relationship with the software it produces. As Robert Lessig famously observed, &#34;code is law&#34; in a world controlled by computers. There is increasingly a strong argument I feel in States directly employing software engineers much like they typically employ armies of civil servants to implement policy.Why is software treated as something to be outsourced to a private sector company? Why can&#39;t we have &#34;civil programmers&#34; who contribute to an ever growing body of public code just as the legislative process contributes to an ever growing body of laws. This body of civil programmers (terrible name but hey) could also work hand in hand with the open source community, letting stakeholders (citizens) contribute too."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So, former WGU student here, though I hadn&#39;t completed my degree.Many WGU students HATE these types of articles, because they undermine the legitimacy of WGU.WGU was not designed for traditional students, it was 100% designed for working professionals, where WGU will only admit you with a reasonable amount of experience in your field.WGU is regionally accredited, not nationally, and it&#39;s a non-profit. So it cannot be compared to University of Phoenix, ITT Tech, DeVry, etc.It was founded by a group of governors out west, hence the name. They realized that there were many working adults who possessed a great depth of knowledge, from long working in their fields, yet they had no paper credentials to show for that knowledge.Their model is competency-based, so you must demonstrate you posses knowledge in any given domain. If you can prove you do then you can test out right away, if you fail to then they offer a variety of resources to allow you to get up to par. In many cases classes are tied to obtaining industry certifications.It&#39;s not for everyone, but it is a far cry from a &#34;degree mill.&#34; Does it really matter if a person that has knowledge got it from sitting in a seat, paying ungodly amounts of tuition, or if they got it from life experience? As long as a bar is set, and you can meet it, then that should be what really matters.Just my personal experience, from having attended the university. Unfortunately life sidetracked my completion, but I hope to return one day soon, and complete my program."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; On my first day, I completed 4 courses in the span of 4 hours. At a traditional school, it would have taken 4 months. It made me realize…I had underestimated how much knowledge I had gained from previous schools, jobs, projects, books, papers, and talks. This passage underscores how, for this guy and whoever he was selling himself to, a CS degree was just a credential. He did not have much intention of actually learning anything. That’s (I believe) fundamentally different than most people who seek college degrees."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some context on WGU&gt; An audit by the Department of Education&#39;s Office of Inspector General, released on September 21, 2017, &#34;concluded that Western Governors University did not comply with the institutional eligibility requirement that limits the percentage of regular students who may enroll in correspondence courses&#34; and that &#34;at least 69 of the 102 courses were not designed to offer regular and substantive interaction with an instructor and, therefore, did not meet the regulatory definition of distance education.&#34;They later kept their federal loan eligibility but it sounds like it might have been a case where they skated by due to a lack of clear guidance.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Governors_University"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"“ Medicine has become a three-way negotiation between you, your doctor, and The Algorithm.”This characterization makes it sound like a good thing.  In reality, the doctor’s responsibility is being pushed to the patient because they are overbooked in the name of economic efficiency.As a patient with complex, non-specific medical condition, I can tell you how miserable this is.I can’t count on doctors _at all_ to move the process forward.  It’s always me, reading articles on PubMed and coming up with ideas.I’m not medically trained nor am I scientist.  It’s a lot of legwork for me normally, but the ways that being sick limits me make it much harder.Further, the emotional and intellectual overhead required to negotiate with medical professionals is high.Back when I could afford to, I saw a neurologist at an office that didn’t accept insurance.  She choose to see fewer patients and give them more time, as well as spend time doing research to look for new clues and ideas.This worked really well and I made progress with her.The rest of the American medical system?

Some of that can be ascribed to some being in the school of pro-active, so they want to fix your teeth at the first glance of issues. But in the end, most of the things being quoted were unnecessary. They all seemed very intent on removing wisdom teeth, even when they pose no problems.They re-did the experiment recently, and I think one of the guys they sent got his teeth cleaned and tartar removed from 10 dentists in a week or so. No one stopped to see if it was actually needed, they all just do it by default and charge you for it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Laser bacterial reduction (LBR) is just one example of the many high-stakes medical decisionsWhether or not to drop $400 is not a &#34;high-stakes medical decision&#34;. Also, expecting Google to give you high-quality medical advice when your actual, licensed, trained dental hygienest is not is asking a lot of a search engine.Personally I&#39;ve found sticking &#34;examine.com&#34; on the end of most results to be very useful for anything supplement-related, and &#34;reddit.com&#34; as a suffix pretty good for anything else."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It would be interesting to see the gain curve of this speaker.My (limited) experience with piezoelectric speakers is that they resonate at a single frequency very loudly, and are practically silent outside the resonant peak. Perfect for a microwave beeper, but never going to produce audible speech.The &#34;high-quality&#34; descriptor makes it sound like they have produced a reasonably flat gain curve, which seems really significant! But without any explanation I&#39;m skeptical.It may even be as silly as using an unintuitive technical definition of &#34;quality&#34; - in a second order linear system, the &#34;quality&#34; of the gain curve is the ratio of the amplitude at the peak to the input amplitude... The exact opposite of what a reasonable person would consider high-quality sound."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; To overcome this problem, the MIT team rethought the design of a thin-film loudspeaker. Rather than having the entire material vibrate, their design relies on tiny domes on a thin layer of piezoelectric material which each vibrate individually. These domes, each only a few hair-widths across, are surrounded by spacer layers on the top and bottom of the film that protect them from the mounting surface while still enabling them to vibrate freely.Whoa, does this mean an array of individually addressable micro-speakers becomes feasible? Like pixels in a computer screen, send different signals to each tiny speaker? That would mean craaaazy spatial audio, if I&#39;m not mistaken."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; When 25 volts of electricity were passed through the device at 1 kilohertz (a rate of 1,000 cycles per second), the speaker produced high-quality sound at conversational levels of 66 decibels. At 10 kilohertz, the sound pressure level increased to 86 decibelsRead: Tinny af.Nonetheless, VERY exciting technology. Will be interesting to watch as it matures."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"During a hostile takeover, someone buys 51% of the shares. They then elect a board of people who will approve whatever they want.Then they can do things like &#39;merge&#39; the company with some other company they own at a board-approved value-per-share. That value will be much lower than what they paid per share when buying it on the open market, but not so low that the government gets involved. Eg: Musk buys the shares at $50/share, and then &#39;merges&#39; the company at $25/share, effectively forcing 49% of the shares to be sold at half price. Those shareholders get screwed because they didn&#39;t sell their shares during the initial takeover.Edit: Or, just run the company however they want and share the profits with the other 49%, but ignore their votes, etc.The Poison Pill says &#34;If a hostile takeover starts, we&#39;ll create and sell new shares at a reduced price to existing shareholders- other than the attacker- to prevent the 51% scenario&#34;. This is done not to prevent any takeover, but in the interest of the 49% of holdouts who would have been screwed over. It&#39;s an effective block against the takeover.The board represents ALL the shareholders, after all. They don&#39;t want to see anyone get screwed.But now Musk has made a deal that the board has approved. All shareholders get a specific price that is approved. The board wants this to happen, so there&#39;s no poison pill."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nobody knows yet why the board relented, but the scuttlebutt seems to be that Twitter arranged an internal valuation once Musk put a price on the company, presumably as justification for an internal plan that they&#39;d announce as their alternative to acquisition, and the valuation actually showed Musk was overpaying for the income Twitter was likely to generate.(If the board hadn&#39;t relented, Musk&#39;s next step would have been to arrange for a tender offer, which goes directly to the shareholders, but does not involved Musk acquiring new shares, but rather just a commitment to buy those shares if the board drops the poison pill. Successfully getting that commitment would be a very strong signal to the board, which would likely then drop the shareholder rights plan and allow the acquisition to proceed. But Twitter&#39;s board skipped those steps.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The poison pill was intended to prevent a takeover without the board’s approval (buying 51% on the open market)The board is negotiating an approved takeover which is entirely differentI.e. the board was saying “you can only buy Twitter if we say so”There was no reversal of intentions"</p>

Everyone switched from bitmaps to vectors over a decade ago and now everything is fuzzy, antialiased, scalable, flat, hard to make out.Of course you can always run dwm on linux with a hodgepodge of makeshift utility apps, write your own keybinds to set your brightness and volume and other such inanities, but in order to get a &#39;complete&#39; desktop experience you kinda have to opt-in to GNOME/KDE which are trying to do the same things as Apple or Microsoft, aesthetically speaking.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This took me on a trip down memory lane back to my days in elementary school. I recall our class going to the computer lab once a week and having an hour to spend on an iMac G3, of which some were on OS8 and others OS9. Going back even further to kindergarten, our logins on those Macs were forced to use a simplified UI that displayed only icons/tiles of applications -- no browsing files or anything sophisticated from what I remember (edit: looks like they were called &#34;Panels&#34;) [0]. The Incredible Machine [1] was what I personally looked forward to playing most. I&#39;m sure nostalgia plays a big role in the feeling I get when toying around with emulators like this, but I&#39;m also convinced that the simplicity, curiosity, and novelty of computing in the late 90s/early 2000s is something that I may never be able to replicate again in my lifetime.[0] http://toastytech.com/guis/macos9users.png[1] https://macintoshgarden.org/games/the-incredible-machine-3"</p>

Calculating a minimal perfect hash by creating acyclic random graphs. This conjecture gives now tresholds when to stop trying creating random graphs and start afresh.This eg is needed for large perfect hashes in gperf or integer sets in compilers, such as eg. for C switch statements with Unicode. switch in C is only efficient for dense tables, but not sparse. sparse tables are linear, but could be constant. A switch in Pascal was constant, but so far GCC and llvm didn&#39;t care. gperf neither.see http://ilan.schnell-web.net/prog/perfect-hash/algo.html and http://programming.sirrida.de/hashing.html#c_case_of_string"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From the original letter:  While well-intentioned, we believe that many of the changes proposed by the CMF are deeply misguided and will disproportionately harm under-resourced students. Adopting them would result in a student population that is less prepared to succeed in STEM and other 4-year quantitative degrees in college.  The CMF states that &#39;many students, parents, and teachers encourage acceleration beginning in grade eight (or sooner) because of mistaken beliefs that Calculus is an important high school goal.&#39;

The updated CMF looks better, but I just don&#39;t see how an educator who knows math or how to teach math could come to such a conclusion (that Calculus should not be a goal). If it is well-intentioned, what was the intention... to dumb down math in high school? Perhaps we need to educate those who are coming up with the math frameworks in math and science, or to get people who care on the California Department of Education?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"SF CA resident, parent of two school age children chiming in. The direction with math seems pretty dismal, in that as of right now, everyone is singly tracked together for math through freshman year of high school. This results in children who have higher aptitudes[1] to not be well served by schools. The majority of people I know who have the means opt out of the public school system, which probably makes the problem worse generally but solves a pain point for them.[1] - I take it as a fact that different people have different talent levels for different things, but not everyone agrees with that, and disagreement on this point is a big driver (but not the only driver) in the &#34;everyone gets exactly the same&#34; approach that is trending now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Something is rotten in the state of academia when looking at the evidence there are mathematicians, scientists and social scientists standing bravely in favour of a high bar and a quality education program in mathematics.On the other side of the argument you have people from the Department of Education who specialize in Mathematics Education who seem happy to lower the bar as far as possible in the name of equality.When I was in University the Department of Education was the most woke department on campus, except for perhaps the Department of Gender Studies. We are now seeing policies that favour wokeness ahead of the best interests of the students affected by the policies."</p>

Thanks for all the great feedback.I&#39;ve learned a lot from your comments and pointers.The Zed project is broader than &#34;a jq alternative&#34; and my bad for trying out this initial positioning.  I do know there are a lot of people out there who find jq really confusing, but it&#39;s clear if you become an expert, my arguments don&#39;t hold water.We&#39;ve had great feedback from many of our users who are really productive with the blend of search, analytics, and data discovery in the Zed language, and who find manipulating eclectic data in the ZNG format to be really easy.Anyway, we&#39;ll write more about these other aspects of the Zed project in the coming weeks and months, and in the meantime, if you find any of this intriguing and want to kick the tires, feel free to hop on our slack with questions/feedback or file GitHub issues if you have ideas for improvements or find bugs.Thanks a million!https://github.com/brimdata/zed

								<p class="story__comment_others">"jq is incredibly powerful and I&#39;m using it more and more. Even better, there is a whole ecosystem of tools that are similar or work in conjunction with jq:* jq (a great JSON-wrangling tool)* jc (convert various tools’ output into JSON)* jo (create JSON objects)* yq (like jq, but for YAML)* fq (like jq, but for binary)* htmlq (like jq, but for HTML)List shamelessly stolen from Julia Evans[1]. For live links see her page.Just a few days ago I needed to quickly extract all JWT token expiration dates from a network capture. This is what I came up with:    fq &#39;grep(&#34;Authorization: Bearer.*&#34; ) | print&#39; server.pcap | grep -o &#39;ey.*$&#39; | sort | uniq | \
    jq -R &#39;[split(&#34;.&#34;) | select(length &gt; 0) | .[0],.[1] | gsub(&#34;-&#34;;&#34;+&#34;) | gsub(&#34;_&#34;;&#34;/&#34;) | @base64d | fromjson]&#39; | \
   jq &#39;.[1]&#39; | jq &#39;.exp&#39; | xargs -n1 -I! date &#39;+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S&#39; -d @! 

It&#39;s not a beauty but I find the fact that you can do it in one line, with proper parsing and no regex trickery, remarkable.[1] https://jvns.ca/blog/2022/04/12/a-list-of-new-ish--command-l..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wish that LineageOS could accept the &#34;signature spoofing&#34; patch that is needed for microg (possibly with a toggle switch that would be &#34;off&#34; by default), so that we could avoid the need for the less-frequently-updated https://lineage.microg.org/ and properly install apps from Play Store without the Google Service Framework (that essentially give root access to Google on your smartphone).(and actually I also wish they could implement the shims developed by https://grapheneos.org/usage#sandboxed-google-play in order to sandbox the google play services, so that the user could choose between approach 1 (microg with signature spoofing) and approach 2 (sandboxed GSF) on any smartphone supported by LineageOS (grapheneos only supports Pixel phones due to their ability to relock the bootloader))"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just switched to LineageOS 18 w/ MicroG and oh my lord is this stuff still complicated. I&#39;m fairly familiar with this stuff and yet still it took me many hours to set everything up correctly. To be clear, this is not the fault of LineageOS, this is simply the state of the FOSS Android environment and the fact that Google has no interest in supporting this setup whatsoever, to put it mildly. Not only is it complicated, it also seems to change pretty much every year.First the question is how to transfer all your application data, for which there still seems to be no surefire way. I settled on &#34;Neo Backup&#34;, which mostly worked fine, except for Signal (of course...), and the darned Microsoft Authenticator.So first unlock the bootloader (good luck), then you need to find the correct TWRP for your phone (and careful with 32/64 bit) and flash it via fastboot.Then I flashed LineageOS, which worked fine. Luckily I found an image which already had the signature spoofing patch included, so I didn&#39;t have to worry about that. How do you get root? SuperSU? XPosed? Magisk? OK it seems everybody&#39;s using Magisk nowadays. OK, flashing worked fine, but now, how do you get MicroG on it? If you look at the MicroG homepage, you might think you can just install it with F-Droid, and you actually can, but many things won&#39;t work (like FCM notifications). It needs to be a system app. I tried using the F-Droid Priviliged Extension, flashed it via TWRP, which seemed to work fine but actually wasn&#39;t installed and not working at all. Now what? There&#39;s a multitude of information in forums what to do. Some say to flash NanoDroid, but the last release was in January 2021, it seems it&#39;s not updated anymore? I settled on the &#34;MicroG installer revived&#34; Magisk module, which worked fine (btw, there&#39;s no curated Magisk module repo anymore, you have to search the web and hope you find something that&#39;s not malicious).Of course my banking apps refuse to run because &#34;U ROOTED UR PHONE&#34;, I search for Magisk Hide, it doesn&#39;t exist anymore, now you need to configure a &#34;Zygisk deny list&#34;, whatever that is. Then I also need to hide the Magisk app, my banking works now thank you very much. FCM notifications also work after I uninstall and reinstall my apps which need it...To be clear: I&#39;m eternally grateful to all the developers who make this possible in their spare time. This is not their fault."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Our very popular privacy oriented built-in firewall, restricted networking mode, and per app data isolation features were all rewritten to account for AOSP’s new restricted networking mode and BPF. Additionally, data restriction and network isolation features were merged into a single implementation. Combined, this means that one of our largest pain points each bringup should now be easier to forward port in future revisions!I&#39;m so glad to hear this. Every other custom ROM&#39;s Android 12 version had to remove the &#34;disable internet access per app&#34; feature.Lineage took its time to rebase to Android 12, but they did it without removing important features like this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I switched from Linux Mint desktop to an M1 Air last year.Performance-wise, the M1 is very impressive, probably feels about 80% as fast as my 6 year old desktop (that sounds like snark, but it isn&#39;t). Meanwhile, the battery life is insane (I&#39;ve never brought the charger anywhere but my desk, and will often use it for a week out and about).I opted for the Magic Keyboard and Magic Touchpad, because I had a lot of trouble with everything else.I could not get a mouse setup that worked (I&#39;m strictly no acceleration, and macOS&#39;s acceleration was literally making my arm ache).I switched because I stopped being a fulltime developer, my main machine was getting old (6 years), and macOS has good MS Office support.Overall I&#39;d say I&#39;m about 70% efficient vs on Linux, a bit less so when in active development. The mobility makes up for it, and efficiency just isn&#39;t as important to my day-to-day for now.Many of my gripes are listed elsewhere, but things like middle-click paste is something that is easy to write off but was actually a gigantic part of my process. Also, the fact that everything I want to tweak requires buying an app?I had to pay for an app in order to properly emulate middle clicks on the touchpad! That&#39;s bonkers!I&#39;ll leave this final tidbit though:On Linux:* Open Spotify* Press play button on keyboard* Spotify playsOn Mac:* Open Spotify* Press play button on keyboard* Apple Music opens ??????"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"2 of these 3 things, I have done multiple times on a Mac.  Mounting NFS is natively supported in macOS and has been for nearly a decade.  Mounting SSH is supported by 3rd-party tools, yes, but they&#39;re the same cross-platform 3rd-party tool you&#39;d use in Linux... sshfs, which is built on top of FUSE, which is something you can install on a Mac and is not installed by default in most Linux distributions (although fair enough it&#39;s installed by default on Ubuntu).The only thing I wasn&#39;t familiar with is MTP, which is apparently a Windows-specific protocol that Microsoft forced into the USB standard in later versions, and as far as I know across decades of using Linux, BSD, Windows, and macOS across multiple computers on the same network with shared peripherals I&#39;ve never even used this protocol.What&#39;s the complaint again?OS choice is mostly a personal preference.  As far as I am personally concerned, FreeBSD is the best OS possible to use, and macOS is second best.  But I don&#39;t write blog posts telling people that their preference is incapable of doing things my preference is capable of doing, and if I were to do so, I&#39;d at least do my research first to make sure it was correct."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Read MTP devices&gt; Mount an SSH or NFS driveI know fanboy debates are tiresome, but... I really do struggle to comprehend taking a device that can&#39;t do these things seriously as a computer.As a toy yes, or as a specialised tool for video or audio rendering, which... fair enough. But moving bytes is something any general purpose computing device should be good at. It&#39;s almost something you have to actively design out. It&#39;s certainly a deliberate, non-budget-constrained choice from Cupertino to be bad at this.Crap like &#34;should Apple be [scanning for CSAM | scanning for copyright | scanning for anti-CCP | whatever I&#39;ve almost stopped caring ] before uploading to iCloud?&#34; exists primarily because the devices are so bad at moving bytes around without relying on iCloud."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Well done. That&#39;s a respectable number of sales for your first year!The economics of self publishing is interesting. When I think back on
my first book I count at least 5 years research that enabled me to be
able to write it, 3 years writing it and then many years selling the
thing around industry.  By a pessimistic account I was about £500k
down :) Like you, the first year I sold about 500. Unlike online
fulfilment today, I spent that time stuffing envelopes, staring at a
slowly shrinking pile of boxes in the corner of my study, printing
labels, with occasional trips to the post-office. It was actually
work, and many times I thought &#39;this is crazy&#39;. It doubled for two
more years until dealing with the orders actually became too much
(while doing a &#34;real job&#34;).On the other hand, it got me a string of well paying jobs, established
me as the go-to consultant in a niche, invitations to talk and teach
all around the world, and basically transformed my career. So putting
a &#34;net profit&#34; number to it seems unfathomable. Each book you write,
if researched from scratch, is kinda equivalent to a PhD.What happened next is that I sold the title, from my own publishing
company to a large publisher (MIT). Publishers don&#39;t take many risks
these days, but they will buy a book that already has reasonable
number of sales as a going concern. The advantage is that all
mechanics and business is suddenly off your hands. Without an advance
to pay back you then have a modest income stream and time to write the
next book.Another effect of being a semi-professional writer, as a side gig, is
that other people want to pay you to edit, typeset, and review
works. Learning LaTeX and various markups and text processing tools
has been a huge gift. That can be quite fun if you&#39;re in a vibrant
field that genuinely interests you. And you don&#39;t have to be
associated with academia or a big-name institution for that to
work. In fact I&#39;d say that academics these days never have time for
writing and that most other successful authors I know are independent.I hope your book takes off even more, but right now I think you can
count 600 sales in the first year as a definite success!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My own experience convinces me there are many extra benefits to having written a book. My first book has been out for 4.5 years now. I know many people on Hacker News have read it and I&#39;m grateful to all of you.I&#39;ve enjoyed getting emails about it. Especially regarding &#34;badly managed startups&#34; and  &#34;abusive bosses&#34; many of you have reached out to share similar stories. Maybe at some point I&#39;ll do a blog post that collects some of those email stories. Some people thought I was destroying my career by revealing the dark side of startups, but some entrepreneurs appreciate my realism and practicality, so I&#39;ve gotten three very lucrative consulting jobs, thanks to that first book. And, surprisingly, the book has gotten more and more popular. It sold more this last year than it sold during its first two years. I assume that at some point the book will seem dated and obsolete, but at least for now it still strikes people as current, so the benefits of writing that book continue to pay dividends."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I sold around 300 in my first year (which ended recently), which is much less than the other book I wrote via my publisher. Yet, even though it is sold at a lesser price, my self-published book made almost more money. This is essentially because the percentage I make on every sales with my publisher is really low (10%). So for my next book, I&#39;ll self publish as well.(the book btw https://securityhandbook.io/)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Happy to see “secretlang” out in the open! I have been following development from afar and really like the idea of a “simple” take on a language, but with a lot of wisdom and affordances added since the state of the world back in 1972. In short, Hare seems to be a language that I really should like and I want to take it for a spin.What I find a bit confusing though is the licensing. I belong to the “BSD school”, but can at least claim that I understand (and respect) how GNU looks at things. Looking at Hare’s licensing [1], I am somewhat stumped and my usual modes of thinking no longer apply. What is the threat that warrants this level of complexity? A commercial fork? A community fork? Proprietary drivers? Are these really realistic enough threats to warrant this level of license complexity rather than just stamping ISC and CC-BY on the whole thing and not worry about forks at all? Yes, there is some writing in the README, but perhaps I am too thick to “get it”?[1]: https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/hare#licensingLastly, a sanity check, am I reacting too strongly to this if I feel that it has a bit of chilling effect in terms of my excitement?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Tagged union type seems a defining feature of Hare to me. It is not exactly &#34;tagged&#34; in the sense that it internally has tags but users don&#39;t explicitly see them [1]. This kind of types are normally headaches for language designers (cf. polymorphic variants in OCaml), but the Hare type system is simple enough that it doesn&#39;t pose a significant problem. In turn it gives an intuitive model of conversion; you don&#39;t have to convert from, say, one type of error to another type of error. Zig error type is also similar in this aspect, but it is not as general as Hare&#39;s tagged union type.[1] I really want to refer this as to &#34;untagged&#34; union type, but of course this will cause a confusion with C-style unsafe unions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Since the language is officially announced now, here&#39;s an interesting analysis on the language: https://tilde.team/~kiedtl/blog/hare/Personally I&#39;m very interesting in playing with it. Generics, functional programming constructs, and a lot of the syntactic sugar you find in modern languages have their uses but I think there&#39;s a lot of merit to the idea that you might not want them in a systems language. I think cleaning up some of C&#39;s rough edges and providing batteries while keeping things extremely simple and clear is very compelling. I&#39;m also appreciative that it doesn&#39;t seem overly opinionated where it doesn&#39;t need to be.It&#39;s kind of a bummer that there&#39;s no MacOS support so I&#39;ll have to SSH into my linux box to play with it. I hope the language takes off and support for other platforms materializes. Congratulations to everyone who worked on this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Ways I think Twitter could immediately improve, from the perspective of users:- Optional verification check marks for anyone who wants them. Throw out the Blue Check status symbol. Offer &#34;real person&#34; twitter filter.- Transparent and consistent moderation policies. Bans are inconsistently applied for reasons that are often hard to figure out.- Return to a reverse chronological time and/or down selection of rage-bait content."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"He&#39;s already said that he&#39;d follow all local laws so it would be interesting to see if he can find the elusive path of maintaining free speech, following the law and not having Twitter being a toxic cesspool used mainly to shout down those not our your &#34;side&#34;.Personally my reservations are because I think running a social media site is a lot about understanding people and defining a healthy culture for your elusive market place of ideas. Musk has admitted he doesn&#39;t understand people, is a self-confessed troll &amp; edgelord and and Tesla&#39;s culture seems less than ideal. So lacks any of the qualifications I see as being needed to run something like Twitter. Maybe there&#39;s some other Musk magic that will do what so many others have failed to do."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Here&#39;s an all-time great post about why you might consider SQLite in production with data about performance: https://blog.wesleyac.com/posts/consider-sqliteI use SQLite in production for my SaaS[1]. It&#39;s really great — saves me money, required basically no setup/configuration/management, and has had no scaling issues whatsoever with a few million hits a month. SQLite is really blazing fast for typical SaaS workloads. And will be easy to scale by vertically scaling the vm it&#39;s hosted on.Litestream was the final piece of the missing puzzle that helped me use it in production — continuous backups for SQLite like other database servers have: https://litestream.io/ With Litestream, I pay literally $0 to back up customer data and have confidence nothing will be lost. And it took like 5 minutes to set up.I&#39;m so on-board the SQLite train you guys.[1] https://extensionpay.com — Lets developers take payments in their browser extensions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of my previous employers was using SQLite as a large distributed database - they had their own custom sharding strategy, but essentially the idea was to shard A accounts * B tables * C num_of_days with a .db file for every shard.When I first came and saw it, it...did not sound right. But I didn&#39;t want to be the guy who comes in and says &#34;you are doing it wrong&#34; month 1. So I went along with it.Of course, eventually problems started to pop up. I distinctly remember that the ingestion (happening via a lot of Kafka consumers) throughput was high enough that SQLite started to crumble and even saw WAL overruns, data loss etc. Fortunately, it wasn&#39;t &#34;real&#34; production yet.I suggested we move to Postgres and was eventually able to convince everyone from engineers to leadership. We moved to a custom sharded Postgres (9.6 at the time). This was in 2016. I spoke to people at the place last month, and it&#39;s still humming along nicely.This isn&#39;t to illustrate anything bad about SQLite, to be clear! I like it for what it does. Just to show at least 1 use case where it was a bad fit.SQLite was a tempting first answer, but what solved it was Postgres, and we eventually offloaded a lot of aggregation tables to Clickhouse and turned the whole thing into a warehouse where the events got logged."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The sqlite docs page has a nice article [1] on when to use an embedded database such as sqlite and when to go with a client/server model (postgres, mysql or others)When not to use sqlite:- Is the data separated from the application by a network?- Many concurrent writers?- Data size &gt; 280 TBFor device-local storage with low writer concurrency and less than a terabyte of content, SQLite is almost always better.[1] https://www.sqlite.org/whentouse.html"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I consumed a lot of blog posts like this before becoming a manager. It feels satisfying to read vague principles like this:&gt; Facilitate wellbeing&gt; Personal safety, dignity, and wellbeing of every team member are paramount. Team success is only success if team members feel good about it.But then you become an actual manager and realize that these are largely just feel-good aphorisms that don&#39;t really help navigate the hard work of being a manager.Don&#39;t get me wrong: I think &#34;facilitate wellbeing&#34; and similar tidbits are valid advice. Likewise, a manager who chooses to not facilitate wellbeing would clearly be in the wrong. But when you get into management you realize that the hard work isn&#39;t waking up and deciding to facilitate wellbeing. The hard work often involves making unpopular decisions, or telling someone &#34;no&#34; when their pet request wouldn&#39;t be in the best interests of the team, or defusing interpersonal conflict among two team members who have been feuding for months.These feel-good blog posts seem rather vacuous after being in the trenches of management for several years. Again, not because the advice is bad or wrong, but because it&#39;s just a lot of text around the basics of being a decent human being. Learning how to do the hard things about management or how to make unpopular but necessary decisions is something that you won&#39;t learn from the average blog post or LinkedIn post, largely because these function more as personal branding pieces than actual advice.In my experience, the best management advice comes from talking to the best managers you know personally. Online, the most practical management advice comes on smaller forums where people are either anonymous (and therefore less interested in personal brand building) or older and accomplished (and therefore not worried about blowback impacting their career). The type of feel-good blog posts or LinkedIn blurbs that people associate with their personal brand don&#39;t really add much value after you&#39;ve read 5-10 articles saying the exact same aphorisms."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lot of misconceptions here that cause teams to underperform.1. Managing comes first. (Nope, as a manager your are primarily responsible for ensuring a good outcome. As your title goes from manager, senior, higher to VP etc this becomes more important. Lower job titles you get paid to &#34;do the work&#34;, higher titles are about &#34;achieve outcome&#34;.) In the current market you&#39;ll often run into team members that don&#39;t perform. I see this so often where leads think that they have to &#34;manage&#34; and not do the work and the result is them and their team failing
2. Facilitate wellbeing. That&#39;s nice. But your primary responsibility is to A. Achieve the goal. B. hold people accountable to an acceptable level of performanceGive credit, take blame: That&#39;s a good one.This post is just full of vague language that doesn&#39;t hold anyone accountable. Sucks to be an IC on that team, thinking everything is going well and eventually end up having whole teams being fired since your manager didn&#39;t set the right pace."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Optimize work distribution
&gt; Managers have a portfolio of work that the business needs and people with work preferences. Optimize the dual objectives of delivering value to the organization and giving individuals problems that build their skillset, impact, satisfaction, and/or advancement. Performance is contextual; set people up to shine.I find this so important. A good manager has a good mental map of the business&#39;s short-term and long-term goals, and a corresponding map of each person on the team&#39;s short-term and long-term goals (and strengths/weaknesses) . This map requires constant updating and refining. The magic happens in finding the right fit between all of that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this post hits the nail on the head. Before LSP, you could google for “$language Vim support” and find some results but more often than not, you were going to get nothing.Once LSP gained popularity, the question shifted to “why doesn’t $language have a language server yet?” which set an easy goal post for languages and compilers to go from 0 to 1 in terms of IDE support."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Recycling partially used soap is a good idea. Making sure everyone around the world has access to soap is certainly super important.There&#39;s really no reason US recycled soap needs to be the soap that is sent to (eg) Africa, shipped over oceans. Doesn&#39;t (eg) Africa have it&#39;s own soap production facilities? But I guess American consumers would be unwilling to use recycled soap?  Or just the neat connection between the soap collected in one place and delivered to those poor unfortunates overseas is what&#39;s necessary to get funding and other support? Nobody wants to fund just paying for soap in (say) Africa or just recycling soap in the US, I guess.Causing &#34;60%+ reduction in the number of children who die from diarrheal diseases each year&#34; -- is a pretty stunning claim.  Looking closer... I guess they&#39;re simply saying that children ding of such diseases had dropped by 60% from 1990 to 2020, not that they alone are responsible for that? Just that they&#39;ve &#34;helped&#34; to some unknown extent?  I bet most readers didn&#39;t catch that. That seems a bit dishonest actually. Still, even the 60% reduction in such deaths over 20 years alone is pretty great and I hadn&#39;t known about it! (I believe this is one of the leading causes of death in man parts of the world -- or used to be?).  I suspect this particular effort had a pretty minimal contribution to those numbers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Those tiny hotel soaps are just the peak of the iceberg.My SO used to work seasonally in a hostel in Venice. People leave a lot of half-used shower gel bottles, soaps, makeup products etc.It got to a point where the staff just put all the products which were safe to use(laundry detergent, shower gels, spray deodorant, shaving foam) in an unoccupied room referred to as &#34;the Rossmann&#34; (popular drugstore chain in some European countries) from which everyone in the know was at liberty to take as much as they wished.A fraction of the goods were originally found unopened."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a poor use of resources. Sending anything but money to places in need is just wasteful. This soap effort is not efficient. The expense of collecting the soap, refining it in a garage (including cost of the equipment), and delivering it to the recipients is almost certainly vastly more than if they&#39;d just sent cash and bought brand new soap local to the recipients. And that&#39;s not even factoring in the labor of the people doing it. This is another feel-good measure that is economically stupid, and whose primary purpose is to make the volunteers feel good about themselves. That&#39;s fine, if that&#39;s what they want to do with their time and money. But no one should help them by donating. It&#39;s far better to donate your cash to people that make efficient use of it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s neat to see this on hacker news. Good to hear that folk are noticing that our system works! I&#39;ve been working on embedded systems at Zipline for 6 years, and oddly haven&#39;t made it out to Rwanda yet. Everyone there seems to know my name, though, because of all the weird problems I&#39;ve helped remotely debug over the years. I think Zipline&#39;s flight operators deserve the lion&#39;s share of credit for our success in Rwanda."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In the United States and the United Kingdom, 80 percent of the population clusters around urban hubs with high-traffic hospitals and blood banks. In African nations like Libya, Djibouti, and Gabon, about 80 to 90 percent of the populations live in cities, too. But in Rwanda, that number flips: 83 percent of Rwandans live in rural areas.DON’T BE FOOLED by Rwanda’s rural demographics; the country has a reputation for leaning into health tech innovations. Rwanda’s universal health care system reaches over 90 percent of the population. In 2009, the government piloted a phone-based program, called RapidSMS, to track and reduce maternal and child mortality. By 2013, RapidSMS connected 15,000 villages to the country’s wider network of doctors, hospitals, and ambulances.This is inspiring."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Disclaimer: IANAL, IANATA, this isn&#39;t tax advice, etcForeigners residing in Japan are eligible to participate in furusato nouzei, but Americans might want to note the following clause in the section &#34;Tax Must Be the Legal and Actual Foreign Tax Liability&#34; in Publication 514 Foreign Tax Credit for Individuals[1], which states:&gt;Subsidy received. Tax payments a foreign country returns to you in the form of a subsidy do not qualify for the foreign tax credit.&gt;The term “subsidy” includes any type of benefit. Some ways of providing a subsidy are refunds, credits, deductions, payments, or discharges of obligations.Whether or not furusato nouzei falls under this clause seems to be up for some debate, and AFAIK the IRS hasn&#39;t made a public determination on it either way. I don&#39;t risk it, but I am under the impression there are some that do.Alternatively, the furusato nouzei portion could be not included in the tax credit? But would it be worthwhile...? Sounds like it depends on the situation and frankly seems like a lot of work to get a few gift baskets.[1]: https://www.irs.gov/publications/p514#idm139978451112272"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; This counsels that a young person born and educated in e.g. Gifu move to Tokyo after graduation to earn a living.
&gt; Many, many do. While Japan’s overall population is declining, Tokyo’s increases by about 100,000 people per year.Notably this differs from America in that rent acts as a natural counterbalance here. It’s not common knowledge that a university graduate should move to New York or San Francisco, in fact if you aren’t in a top paying field it’s probably common knowledge that one should not move to these cities.I wonder how much different the population landscape of the United States would look like if NYC, the Bay Area, LA etc had ever figured out how to plan for urban growth in the same way Tokyo did (context: you can afford a small single family home on a middle class income in Tokyo, I think prices there are around 30% over other Japanese cities)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Omoshiroi! This is a really nice write up. Education is indeed very expensive and the towns outside of Tokyo have difficulties surviving, with only older people remaining there. Those towns have to be very creative to attract money and people. You can get a house for free, if you will live there, similar to some Italian towns.In the Netherlands we have similar issue of towns fighting for survival in more rural parts (Limburg). They try to combine schools of several towns to reduce the cost of teachers, and similar combining police stations.Lowering the friction for such &#39;gift tax&#39; is interesting, Japanese are big into all kind of little gifts: if you go on holiday you bring something small, an Omiage. If you attend a birthday party, not only you bring a present (which is usual everywhere) but the guest also get a little gift in return, an Okaeshi."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There are a couple of techniques that I have used in the past that have worked well.First, don&#39;t edit the proposed contract itself. Instead, add a rider that specifically overrides the provisions you don&#39;t like. Something like &#34;Intellectual Property. Work produced by employee shall be considered work-for-hire. &#39;Work&#34; is defined as...&#34; Then add a line to the bottom of the rider that says &#34;If any portion of this rider is in conflict with the main contract, the terms of the rider will override the terms of the contract.&#34; The benefit of this approach is that you avoid the back-and-forth niggling over particular words in the main contract, and you often overcome the other party&#39;s resistance to changing the language their lawyers said had to be there. It&#39;s stupid, but it works.The second technique is simply to say, &#34;this contract isn&#39;t large enough to justify these provisions. If you would like to bump the contract, we can talk. Otherwise, no.&#34; This has worked for me in negotiating software licenses. I haven&#39;t tried it in an employment situation. It works because it forces the other side to acknowledge that their demands have costs, and they can have what they want only if they pay for it. They never do.I am not a lawyer. Heed this advice at your own risk."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m not certain my experience is relevant in this context, but I’ve been fighting contract language for over 30 years. I’m a pro photographer and producer in the biz for many years. I produce unique content that is quite challenging to recreate.So many contracts contain what I call “rights grabs”. They are attempting to transfer my IP to them for maximum profit. I’ve fought this trend with success for decades.I simply cross out the offending language in the contract and make the license contingent on the agreement proceeding as I describe. I’m happy to abandon a contract if it does not go my way (a luxury not everyone has).My largest checks in the past two years have been from lawsuits brought against copyright infringement. In every case my contract revisions have withstood legal challenge and the defenders/offenders have folded when they proceeded as if the original contract language (before I altered, after they signed) stood.There are lawyers who have pursued this niche to great success and I have lawyer team ready to pursue infringement on a contingency basis. It is quite amazing.More than once now, my lawyers have fought for years when the infringers had deep pockets and a terror of precedent. They paid so many thousands to their legal team but lost. I have prevailed in every case.I recognize this is bragging. But so many of my colleagues have just signed for a short term check while losing in the long run. I might be an obstinate  fool, but so far it’s paid off.We in the photo biz have had to survive a huge paradigm shift in the biz model in the last 18 years. But so many people fold for Pennie’s. “I need this $250 right now to make rent”. But my settlement checks are in the $25,000 range typically (25% after my lawyers and agent get their cut).Last I looked, the average income for a photographer in the U.S, was around $7500 a year. Yes, $7500 (no missing zeros). I make six figures consistently and I’m damn proud of this fact.Most of the conversations on this forum are above my skill set, but you folks are generally paid for deep knowledge and rare skills. Don’t let anyone steal this from you."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Let&#39;s talk about &#34;unlimited PTO&#34; -- I&#39;m seeing more of this in my half-hearted job search and I&#39;m really wary about it. I&#39;d like to get my prospective employer to agree in writing to a certain number of days that would be considered normal/acceptable PTO, so I don&#39;t a) feel guilty for taking that amount and b) get shafted in performance assessments for taking a normal amount.Has anybody had any luck getting a prospective employer who advertises &#34;unlimited PTO&#34; to do this in contract negotiation phase? Basically I don&#39;t want to just rely on the goodwill of said new employer to treat me respectfully for taking a good chunk of said PTO, and I want to define what is reasonable expectations up-front."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I can appreciate this perspective because I used to have it. I even wrote a similar blog post 10 years ago - it was on the top of HN and the comment section was a beautiful shitshow. For me, this perspective was a good story to tell myself - it justified why I was only investing my time in “work”, and validated me for having “come so far”.Over time, I have reflected and shifted this perspective. That reflection centered around the question the author hasn’t asked himself yet: who creates these expectations? It’s always some loose definition like “society” or “elite”, or some other handy wavy grouping of people.But, to be clear, those expectations are coming from the author. That’s his perspective of what the world thinks, based on his interactions, based on what he chooses to read, listen to, etc. He&#39;s not describing anyone but himself.I found that if I find myself projecting onto social norms, society, or some other loose definition of “they”, what I’m really doing is projecting a part of myself that I haven’t been honest about yet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Do people find this stuff compelling? Rank speculation and confident assertion with minimal substantive backing?I’d find this statement equally compelling (which is to say, not at all):&gt; Since we stopped using horses as a primary means of transportation, men’s sense of self worth has diminished.  Riding a horse carried a lot of high status connotations: drive, masculinity, towering above the land, and man’s domination over nature.  Now, we drive metal cars, low to the ground, and driving one is seen as commonplace.  All of men’s low sense of self worth stems from this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think there are quite a few alternative explanations for the data cited in the article than the ones the author proposes:&gt; &#34;Today, one in six American men between the ages of 25 and 54 are unemployed or out of the workforce altogether: about 10 million men. This number has more than doubled since the 1970s.&#34;We have this place in the USA called &#34;The Rust Belt&#34; which was once a dynamic and active manufacturing center providing millions of well-paid jobs for these now unemployed American men.  California once had a world-class electronics manufacturing industry (and a garment manufacturing industry) that provided hundreds of thousands of such jobs.  Under the rubric of neoliberal globalization, those jobs were shipped out to Mexico, China, Indonesia, India and other low-wage centers, and the huge cut in labor costs went right into the pockets of a small fraction of now-extremely wealthy Americans. Why neglect that  phenomenon?&gt; &#34;Over the past half-century, the number of men per capita behind bars has more than quadrupled.&#34;Again, we have a robust alternative explanation: the explosion in incarceration under the War on Drugs program launched by Nixon in the early 1970s and continued and amplified by successive Democratic and Republican administrations.  This resulted in the explosive growth of the quite profitable private prison complex (which did not exist before the 1970s), and of course enforcement was highly skewed towards poor and minority groups. These groups were far more likely to smoke crack on the street corner than to snort cocaine in private clubs, and a 100-wt of cocaine powder was considered equivalent to a 1-wt of crack crystal in sentencing.So if the author wants solutions to these problems, why not promote rewriting domestic and international law to exert significant penalties on corporations who outsource manufacturing overseas, and also end the War on Drugs by eliminating incarceration for possession of drugs, and instead focus on a public education approach emphasizing the benefits of getting off drugs and alcohol?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"People are realizing that social media is draining, predatory, and entirely superfluous.Of course there are employees here of social media corporations who would want to stem the tide of this mass exodus, but it&#39;s useless. Social media corporations have overstepped their boundaries and become a net negative on human society.Deleting your social media accounts results in an immediate improvement of quality of life and mental wellbeing. These sites are intentionally designed with predatory psychological mechanisms, they are designed by hackers like ourselves, but the hackers who see &#34;social engineering&#34; as a perfectly ethical practice and not simply psychological manipulation.These services are designed to be addictive, full stop. Addiction is not healthy, and neither is social media. Maybe this will bring SV back to its roots, real technological progress for the nation and not desperate bids for data mining based on cheap psychological tricks.People are growing sickened of the endless scrolls of psychological disturbing viral content combined with the false positivity of human interest stories. It is deepening social divisions, racial conflicts, political partisanship, and general misery. We don&#39;t need social media, what we need is real social connections in an increasingly isolated society, and social media stands in the way of this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve found myself between deleting, deactivating, and moderating my use of these apps for many years of my life.I never found deleting or deactivating to be very helpful. At some time or another you&#39;re going to need said account for something.While deleting is a bit extreme, some of these services will respect the actual deletion and others will not. I suppose the question at the end of the day is...why bother?I&#39;ve found it much more easy to &#34;declutter&#34; by following digital minimalism practices of getting rid of apps, only using browsers, practicing mindfulness of said platforms, and only using said platforms with a specific intention.There&#39;s a laundry list of tips you could use to make social media harder to use or even more bearable, but the most effective approach I&#39;ve used is simple moderation and mindfulness.Also why is Mozilla writing articles about this? I get the privacy angle, but aren&#39;t they also willing to put ads in front of people and other partnerships sacrificing that privacy for users? Like how does Mozilla make money outside of Google search engine being the default?

That is, accounts that are dedicated to a single topic, no matter how narrow or large the scope, over those of people and/or companies.Personal and business accounts, no matter how focused they are, tend to go off topic very often, and there&#39;s nothing to do about it. A designer or an art studio can still post about politics, religion, or whatever the controversy du jour is about. An account about logo design or some python framework, not so much if ever.This allows me to have a feed whose content I sort of control. With Twitter, it gets even better with lists, so I have ones about dev stuff, others about business topics, etc. and the content there is almost on topic most of the time.Since I started doing this, the impact of social media on my mood almost vanished, yet I&#39;m still able to closely follow what&#39;s happening on topics I really care about.When I want to see what&#39;s happening on the real world, I check my Facebook.I&#39;m sure aware of how bad these companies are with personal data. So it you think it&#39;d be better to delete your account, then, yes, do it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Ouch! I&#39;m glad the guy is okay, that could not have been &#34;fun&#34; given the description of the ejection.In Sunnyvale they used to train Orion P3 crews at Moffett field. Of course Sunnyvale and the surrounding towns had a few military contractors doing RADAR development who did not have many military targets to paint, so when a P3 flew over it made for a good &#34;real life&#34; test.On one such flight, the check pilot decided to &#34;spice up&#34; the newbie pilot&#39;s life as they returned to Moffett field by casually flicked on the RADAR threat detector. Sure enough, one of the contractor&#39;s search RADARs was &#39;pinging&#39; them, but unexpectedly they were also testing a tracking RADAR which then subsequently got a good lock on the plane. That made the RADAR LOCK alarm go off in the cockpit and the trainee, as he was trained to do, immediately hit countermeasures without thinking. (That will save your life!)The plane was on final approach to the field, and when it activated countermeasures it consisted of both chaff and IR flares (bits of magnesium, lit and cast to the side to distract heat seekers) These mostly landed on the Sunnyvale golf course which is in the approach path.I used to play that course, and after this event there were a number of burn spots where the flares had landed and then burned out on the ground, and for probably two months there were bits of foil chaff that could be found in various nooks and crannies around the course!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Just give us a web filesystem already. Stop with these shitty infantilized GUIs with no hierarchical organization and an overreliance on search to find things. I have literally hundreds of thousands to millions of files on my local machines and have no trouble remembering where I put things. Drive can&#39;t seem to scale past a few dozen before it&#39;s confusing, useless, and apparently lossy. Remember when web servers would serve up the contents of a directory as a list with hyperlinks on the file names? That actually worked ffs. I cannot understand how we could be moving backwards so quickly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It feels like Google’s attention span, leadership longevity, and product development patience is roughly 3 years.  Any product that survives longer than that probably has transcended beyond being a “pet project/toy” into a PR-problem or revenue-stream significant enough that it takes on a life of it’s own.  As management turns over, that lease on life is renewed…https://killedbygoogle.com/While this fosters new ideas and opportunities, that conversion into long-term direction and execution can be pretty rough."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Times have changed in many more ways than one.These days I greatly prefer to own my data more directly, which I accomplish using a NAS. I don’t use Dropbox OR Google Drive, I use Syncthing, which can do stuff that neither of those could ever dream of in terms of syncing between machines.Not only do I not want Google Drive, I don’t even want anything like it.That said, I totally get why it’s still important. I do use Google Drive at work and for that type of use case I would not argue in favor of self-hosting. Syncthing is great for a single person or even a fairly large group of people, but not for a big organization. Not to mention you probably use Google Docs or Office 365 anyways, both of which are integrated with their respective company’s storage offerings. Syncthing won’t give you directory sync, docs integration, or granular ACLs.But that’s actually perfectly fine, because I don’t need any of those things. Hell, I flat out don’t really want them. You could probably get something similar with ownCloud which I did try running, and I’m not even particularly enticed. I’m sure Synology has a full suite as well, but it’s not what I want out of my NAS. Part of being happier with my technology was just as much realizing what I didn’t want as it was realizing what I wanted."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love textualize/rich (and charm)!I think this solves some of the web&#39;s browser problems by breaking things out into components:- browsers are way too complicated to build, terminals are way easier- browsers have a huge attack surface, terminals are smaller- browsers lock you into JavaScript (more or less), terminals don&#39;t- browsers have to support tons of backwards compatibility (quirks mode, TLS), terminals have less to support by being more circumspectIt feels like we&#39;re on the beginning of the next cycle a little. First we scattered a bunch of apps to see how we should use the internet, then we focused on the browser, now we&#39;re scattering some more apps to see which solves our new problems better.To that end, presuming we stick with terminals, I wonder if they&#39;re at risk of falling prey to the same problems, or if they have different potholes in their future. One thing in particular I saw someone else mention in a comment in a different thread is that terminals are almost all written in unsafe languages like C, which feels super bad. Something else is auth and identity--something the current web is pretty bad at."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Looks like a lot of great work went into this.
But I&#39;m not sure I want to see CLI applications continue going down this path. Maybe I&#39;m missing the point of this, but I like my terminal applications simple, small and easy to drop into the rest of the shell ecosystem. This means applictions willing to accept input from either the keyboard interactively or from a stdin input stream of bytes and lines. Output should be a simple, structured, human readable and machine consumable format for easy drop into pipelines and shells scripts."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While these are unarguably cool, I really don’t understand why would we want to force an ungodly hack onto a text-based, letter-displaying protocol to display arbitrary graphics. Especially when the people liking it - I assume - has quite a big intersection with those who prefer simplicity over anything else. Reusing Braille fonts and font styles and whatnot is exceedingly harder than.. putting a pixel onto a framebuffer. Especially when we pair it with event handling and the actually hard part of GUIs, they simply loose out on everything."</p>

On one hand, adding a button doesn&#39;t have to take 3 months despite all the necessary reviews etc., not if it&#39;s actually considered a priority. On the other hand, if the benefits were considered worth the fine/fee, you&#39;d expect a bigger delay."</p>

So please respect your users instead.Don&#39;t use shady practices that require you to bring up a cookie-banner in the first place. Just don&#39;t."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I still don&#39;t understand why this is a website thing and not an user-agent^W^W webbrowser thing.EU could have requested browser vendors to implement a mechanism to accept or reject cookies.

First-class regions allow us to skip a surprising amount of RC overhead. [0]2. There are entire new fields of static analysis coming out, such as in Lobster which does something like an automatic borrow checker. [1]3.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I agree with a lot of what he says.He gets something subtly wrong though: GC barriers are waaaaay cheaper than ARC, in the limit when you optimize them. Libauto had expensive barriers, but as Chris said, it’s not super interesting since it was overconstrained. But the production high-perf GCs tend to have barriers that are way cheaper than executing an atomic instruction. JSC’s GC has barriers that basically cost nothing, and that’s not unusual. It’s true that low latency GCs tend to have barrier overheads that are higher than high throughput GCs, but even then, the cost isn’t anything like atomic inc/dec. The barrier overhead in RTGCs is often around 5-15% except for the esoteric algorithms nobody uses.Also, GCs trivially give you safety even if you race to store to a pointer field. ARC doesn’t, unless you introduce additional overheads.Does what I say mean that ARC is bad? Heck no, ARC is super impressive. But it does mean that it’s a good idea to weigh ARC versus GC as a determinism versus speed decision, and accept that if you chose ARC, you lost some speed.Oh but ARC also let’s you do CoW better than what a GC could give you, so for some languages ARC is a speed win over any possible GC because it’ll let you do fewer copies. I think that’s true in Swift. But if you don’t have CoW then GCs are def faster."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find this whole conversation frustrating or somewhat confusing because it&#39;s a weird distinction: Reference counting is garbage collecting. It&#39;s not a mark &amp; sweep or generational tracing collector, but it&#39;s a collector. And in fact it even traces, though the tracing is explicit (in the form of the declaration or management of references.)My copy of the Jones/Lins Garbage Collection book I&#39;m looking at on my shelf makes this quite explicit, the chapter on reference counting makes it clear it&#39;s one form of garbage collection.When I was messing with this stuff 20 years ago, that was my understanding of it, anyways.There are advantages and disadvantages to reference counting. I think some of the confusion in terminology and some of the frustrations (or opposite) here comes from the rather awkward way that Objective-C implements reference counting as something you have to be explicitly aware of and careful about, even with ARC. My brief stint doing iOS dev made this clear to me.But I&#39;ve used (and written) programming languages that had transparent automatic garbage collection via reference counting, and the programmer need not be aware of it at all, esp if you have cycle detection &amp; collection (or alternatively, no cycles at all). And, there are compelling RC implementation that are capable of collecting cycles just fine (albeit through a limited local trace.)Anyways, he&#39;s right that RC can be better for things like database handles etc. Back in the day I/we used reference counting for persistent MUDs/MOOs, where the reference counts were tracked to disk and back, &#39;twas nice and slick."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I had 10gb internet on what was essentially a shared connection when I lived in Zürich.That, along with a surplus server I literally housed in my shoe closet, gave me the firepower I needed to prototype out something that led to two research grants which now employ myself and a new PhD student.We discount technological investments like this as being “too much” and “unpractical”, but we forget that, even if it only one person in a hundred or a thousand take advantage of them, the impact can be enough to launch careers or start businesses with sizeable positive externalities."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Firstly … 25Gbit symmetrical … WOW.Secondly - as a person living my whole life in IT - both passion and professionally - I have no idea what would 25Gbit be good for. I’m currently paying about $80 for symmetrical 1Gbit fiber and have the option to upgrade to 5Gbit for about $180 but it seems so pointless.Here is the reasoning behind my grumpy opinion:1. Living in a home with Cat5 throughout so the best I can do is to route 1Gbit. Running cables in multilevel (American) homes is a major PITA.2. My Wi-Fi (802.11ax) is heavily affected by homes around me so only one AP can run with 80MHz channel width and the rest is 20-40MHz. Throughput ends up being somewhere between 150Mbit-500Mbit, depending on where you are.3. I have a few smaller servers running ..stuff. The trouble is not about server performance or bandwidth.. it’s about reliability. Running any business on consumer line (in the USA) is just signing up for trouble. (Eg. “Is your line down because your modem received a fault firmware? No worries, the tech is going to be there within next 4 days to check your cables…”).4. Things like game downloads on PS5 .. yes, they are amazingly fast (even on 1Gbit. They install faster from internet than from the built-in BD-ROM). But many games need to also “install” (whatever that means on PS5) and that takes 2x the time of download anyway. I can live with that once a month.5. Big fan of streaming services, however many providers limit bitrate on their side so I am still watching the sometimes blurry 4k …Back to original question and with genuine curiosity - what is 25Gbit for???"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On behalf of all tech-minded Americans, I would like to say... I hate you.I just got a notice in the mail that my ISP is &#34;upgrading&#34; their network so now I can pay $200 USD/month to get a whopping 2gbps, which I actually thought was pretty amazing until I read your post. So, thanks.In all seriousness, congrats! You made a good case for why one would need that much bandwidth. Also, we need to catch up here. :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This has happened to me also (indie game dev) a few years ago.The number is about 20 or so games that have been removed by Apple because they hadn&#39;t been updated in two years. The worked perfectly fine on all the new hardware/software and even work today.On top of that, I know that there is another 30 or so apps I was involved in with clients that have also been removed.These weren&#39;t the biggest apps/games in the world, but they were all high quality finished products that had nothing wrong with them.   Its just the cost of re-publishing each one out-weighed the return, so I didn&#39;t have much of a choice sadly. I do have plans to re-publish some of them, however they have to take a back seat for current work.All that to say, I have a large part of my portfolio of work that is no longer available to the public, which just sucks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Similar to the author of the tweet, Apple removed a working version of my FlickType Keyboard that catered specifically to the visually impaired community, just because I hadn&#39;t updated it in 2 years.Meanwhile, games like Pocket God have not been updated for 7 years now: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pocket-god/id301387274"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am having trouble summoning the outrage I see in the other comment threads here. The App Store is stuffed full of abandonware. Apple should be more aggressive with this, not less. If you can&#39;t recompile your app and patch up support for recent OSes and recent devices on an ongoing basis, then your business model is not sustainable. I know, I used to sell iOS apps.The market right now is absolutely flooded with indie games, some light pruning is probably for the best."</p>

Your experience and personality already lend itself to this effort.You say “the math is insufficient” show us the math!  Show us how it’s insufficient using numerical examples.Scientific outreach has a real “draw the rest of the owl” problem and I think Sabine is perfectly poised to fill the gap.There’s a George Carlin quote I’ll paraphrase ~“never talk down to your audience, they’ll catch up eventually.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you change assumptions to solve a big problem, you don’t necessarily need to measure the big problem to check the assumptions. General Relativity itself was first confirmed with a relatively simple measurement of star displacement during a solar eclipse.The “real solution” to the black hole information paradox will be one that solves the paradox AND provides a “small” way to test the change in assumptions that creates the big solution. This is definitely worth looking for IMO."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve never understood. From an outside perspective the black hole will evaporate before the thing falls in. Thus a thing can never fall in. From its perspective the hole will emit more and more intense radiation and finally evaporate just before it hits the horizon.If true, I think you can go even further and say no black hole can completely form; the collapsing matter just gets exponentially closer to being fully black until the effect of the Hawking radiation outweighs the gravitation, but it all evaporates before going fully black. No?(This latter part assumes there&#39;s some Hawking radiation or equivalent from pre-black holes as well).Now, I assume the pre-Hawking radiation would be unitary, since the only reason Hawking radiation is not unitary is because BHs don&#39;t have information, but pre-black holes are not black holes. So doesn&#39;t that solve the info paradox? Without resorting to holographs and whatnot? Where&#39;s the error?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Blockchain has no use other than to store tokens for speculative gambling. 
Take a look at this presentation - https://bit.ly/3OB5G18Proof-of-work - the USP of blockchain makes it slow and expensive and planet destroying at scale. But it&#39;s not a bug, it&#39;s a feature. You take it out and the blockchain is neither public not permission-less. A private, trusted, permissioned blockchain is pointless.The whole blockchain, web3, crypto, NFT, DeFi, DAO ecosystem is a massive ponzi scheme. The proponents keep cooking up new buzzwords to keep the pot boiling and to attract new starry eyed idiots who will bring in real money into the system to keep the ponzi going.Blockchain is a hammer in search of nail. A solution for problems that do not exist."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Blockchains are excellent for logging that uses trustable peer participation, distributed append, and tamper resistance. For example, each peer can add their own chain links, and also see all the chain links added by other peers, and also be sure that the log hasn&#39;t been corrupted by any of the peers.Some examples IMHO are logs of participation (e.g. voting), agreements (e.g. contracts), exchange (e.g. payments), and auditing (e.g. compliance).A blockchain can be public or protected i.e. private just to the participants. A blockchain can store plain text information or access-controlled information i.e. encrypted information or links to sign in systems.All of these capabilities provide massive trust advantages over a traditional database as managed by a central administrative entity, which requires the participants must trust the central administrative entity to be truthful, unbiased, secure, and with sufficient high availability and disaster recoverability."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What many may not realize is that there&#39;s a thriving industry in sending passengers on planes for the sole purpose of them taking things from A to B.Years ago, you could get discounted flights to Europe where you couldn&#39;t check in any luggage. Why? That allowance was taken up by documents for various clients. This was usually quicker than any courier services at the time.I&#39;ve had friends who worked in the oil and gas industry. One story I was told was where parts were desperately needed to repair a drill bit on a gas platform. The best option? Someone would fly halfway around the world, drive to a particular factory, wait for the parts and then fly back. This was cheaper and faster than any courier service, even if you spent $10,000+ on the ticket.This was exacerbated because a person with 200lb of machine parts could walk through customs where a shipment might get stuck in customs for weeks. And each day of non-operation cost hundreds of thousands of dollars."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While the tweet is correct (&#34;It is physically impossible to exceed the 70-pound domestic weight limit for a small flat rate box&#34;) the shortened title here which omits the word &#34;small&#34; is very misleading.  The USPS offers a variety of sizes of flat rate boxes (https://www.usps.com/ship/priority-mail.htm#flatrate), all of which have the same 70 lb weight limit.  It&#39;s only the &#34;small&#34; that cannot be overweight.  The two mediums and the large can exceed the limit with dense contents.  Perhaps the title could be changed to omit &#34;physical&#34; and add back &#34;small&#34;?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"After one year, I-bonds are pretty similar to savings accounts and they are indexed to inflation. Your money won&#39;t grow, but it won&#39;t shrink either -- and as Treasury bonds they are the lowest-risk investment that exists. If you buy some today, they will pay 7.12% for the next 6 months. After that they will probably be adjusted to pay even more, based on the current inflation rate.There are two major catches: you have to wait at least 1 year before you cash them out, and a person can only buy 10k in I-bonds per year.After the first year is over, selling I-bonds and getting access to the cash takes a few business days.I&#39;ve been tiering my emergency savings based on how many redeemable I-bonds I have. I have enough money in the bank to cover emergencies I might need to pay for very quickly -- things like plumbing problems, car repair, etc. The rest of my emergency fund is going into I-bonds. If I have a longer-term need for savings, like losing my job, I don&#39;t need all of my savings right away and I can wait for the amount of time it takes to cash out I-bonds."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The issue is that there is no incentive for banks to increase interest rates on accounts as they are already sitting on too much cash.

I don’t see this changing in the near future."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I spent the last few years developing software on AWS. I honestly cannot imagine not using it. Once you get good at infrastructure as code (CDK), microservices, and how everything wires together, any other technical stack is just painful. I still believe that engineers are completely underestimating productivity gains in people that are good at AWS. There is just so much less BS in terms of systems working, everything clicks together, you arent stitching a million open source libraries to build a stack. Billions of dollars of effort are behind making it as seamless as possible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I agree that there is weird cult-like thinking around AWS, when the reality is their base services like EC2 or s3 are pretty great but most of them are just mediocre. Yet, people will insist on using services just because AWS built it, mostly just brand mentality.Running things on prem or on something like Hetzner cloud can be much simpler in some cases, and with Kubernetes now you can provide a great platform anywhere. It just isn&#39;t the solution for every use case."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The first half of the post is like blaming the barman because you drank a bottle of Michters Celebration and are stuck with a $30K bill. It’s not hard. Just don’t buy shit that may bankrupt you.And suggesting Hetzner dedicated servers as an alternative? Why not EC2 spot instances if you’re so budget conscious? It’s just Linux (or whatever you put on them).We spent big on dedicated hardware in the early days of our biz. Sure we bought bandwidth at 95th percentile which was cheaper. But as our people became our biggest cost we quickly moved into aws and haven’t looked back. Our bill is $500K per year and we happily pay it because payroll would be way more. However it’s the richness of the toolset and on demand scalability that is the real win.If you need to push a fuckton of bandwidth with little CPU usage you should buy your own metal, colo it and buy bandwidth at 95th percentile billing. We dug up a sidewalk and leased from Zayo to do just that for a specific thing. Most other applications belong in a cloud provider like aws."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Another way to put this is that for most pop music, you could often degrade gracefully to three triads of major or minor quality.But even for something discussed previously on HN-- the Beach Boys &#34;God Only Knows&#34;-- this doesn&#39;t work. Wilson really wants a half-diminished seventh chord at the high point of the melody. One could perhaps degrade to a diminished triad in the accompaniment, but he&#39;s literally singing the seventh of the chord so it&#39;s there regardless. Substituting a major or minor triad there is a qualitative change and sounds suspicious.If you&#39;re making your own instrument you might want to be aware that there&#39;s a &#34;suspicious&#34; sound that some types of consistent chord substitutions can have on certain classes of instruments.For example, a bagpiper can make severe simplifications to the harmony or even change melodic intervals to fit what they have available. Audiences generally accept this because the strictures of the instrument have made that a common practice. (Even if you&#39;re unaware of the strictures, you&#39;ve probably gotten used to hearing the result of the common practice.)However, if one consistently employs major/minor triad substitutions on the guitar people are eventually going to hear that as a lack of quality. As in the Beach Boys example, this will often happen during key points. The guitarist may get lucky if the singer happens to fill out the missing note of the chord-- e.g., guitarist plays a minor triad and the singer fills out the seventh at the beginning of the chorus of &#34;Last Dance with Mary Jane&#34;-- but eventually the audience will figure out that the guitarist is missing a vital skill.Anyway, unless your instrument is so novel it doesn&#39;t have any associations with extant instruments, make sure you have some kind of &#34;escape hatch&#34; so that skilled performers can play the chords they need. :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The obligatory video is of course &#34;Four Chords&#34; by Axis of Awesome:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pidokakU4IRick Beato has kind of the opposite video about &#34;the most complex song ever&#34;:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnRxTW8GxT8The song in question is Never Gonna Let You Go by Sergio Mendes; plenty of videos exist of it; here&#39;s one live:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPh3bTglak"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A couple notes&gt; While it&#39;s almost always I, IV, V, and vi, we have both II/ii and III/iii, differing on whether the third is major or minor.This might be a bit confusing as written, because the slash &#34;/&#34; is normally used in roman numerals to indicate secondary chords. For example, the II chord may be written as V/V. (V/V is always II, but not the other way around... the &#34;/&#34; notation indicates that the chord is functioning as a secondary chord, which is something you figure out from context.)The terminology &#34;open chords&#34; is also a bit unusual. The term &#34;open chords&#34; usually refers to chords that use open strings (strings that are not fingered). Chords without a third are often called &#34;power chords&#34;. You can do your entire song with power chords if you&#39;re playing rock music.I&#39;d also add that what chords you get as the three/four chords you need depends so heavily on genre. If you were playing blues, you might pick I7, IV7, and V7 for your first three, and then maybe bVII7 as the fourth. If you were playing jazz, you might pick something like I69, ii9, IVmaj7, V7."</p>

I&#39;m Clark, one of the maintainers of magic-trace.magic-trace was submitted before, our first announcement was this blog post: https://blog.janestreet.com/magic-trace/.Since then, we&#39;ve worked hard at making magic-trace more accessible to outside users. We&#39;ve heard stories of people thinking this was cool before but being unable to even find a download link.I&#39;m posting this here because we just released &#34;version 1.0&#34;, which is the first version that we think is sufficiently user-friendly for it to be worth your time to experiment with.And uhh... sorry in advance if you run into hiccups despite our best efforts. Going from dozens of internal users to anyone and everyone is bound to discover new corners we haven&#39;t considered yet. Let us know if you run into trouble!"</p>

See Signals and Threads podcast State Machine Replication, and Why You Should Care [0] posted 2 days ago.I came across the incr_dom library [1], which efficiently calculates the diff on the projected DOM based on a diff of the model data, sorta like React but more... mathematically grounded (?). incr_dom was then reformulated in Bonsai [2] which refactors and generalizes the idea to work with more than DOM.

So they have brilliant idea: the Code people use auto linters/formatters that we enable by default (hey gofmt) and everyone loves it, how about we do the same for the Prose people!Basically: &#34;All I write is corporate garbage, and all the writing I consume is corporate garbage, and all my coworkers only write corporate garbage, therefore everyone would love a corporate garbage-ifyer!&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing I&#39;ve wondered about are size savings for DEM tiles. Typically elevation values are encoded in RGB values giving a resolution down to fractions of an inch [1]. This seems like overkill. With an elevation range from 0 - 8848 meters (Mt everest), you can use just 2 bytes and get an accuracy down to .2 meters. That seems plenty for many uses. Does anybody know if there&#39;s a PNG16 format where you can reduce the file size by only using 2 bytes per pixel, instead of the typical 3-byte RGB or 4-byte RGBA?[1] https://docs.mapbox.com/data/tilesets/guides/access-elevatio..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Instead of serving a 256x256px image, you can serve a 1px image and tell the browser to scale it up. Of course, if you have to put width= &#34;256px&#34; height= &#34;256px&#34; into your HTML that adds 30 bytes to your HTML!CSS is a thing as well, could just use CSS to force all tiles to the same size, regardless of the image data in them. Something like:  .map img {
    width: 256px;
    height: 256px;

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My sense is that most responses here are only to the title of the submission (the actual article title is &#34;Gender discrimination in hiring: An experimental reexamination of the Swedish case&#34;).Skimming through said actual article, it looks like the &#34;against men&#34; hiring discrimination is ~completely driven by this:&#34;...In female-dominated occupations such as cleaner, childcare provider, preschool teacher, accounting clerk, and enrolled nurse, positive employer response rates were much higher for women than for men. This is in line with earlier findings in different countries...&#34;Which sure sounds to me like &#34;employers try to fill low-status, low-pay, often-crappy female-dominated jobs with yet more females&#34;.It takes a certain sort of mindset to react as if men were clearly the (sole) group being wronged by that.(Or do millions of men quietly aspire to jobs cleaning up dirty toilets, dirty diapers, and dirty bedpans, and I&#39;m just ignorant of their dreams?)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"During my career, I&#39;ve seen enough discrimination in the name of DEI as well. But what bothers me more is the ageism. The number of times an old person has been rejected from a job is too damn high. The reasons have always been &#34;he may not work well with young people&#34;, &#34;seniority complex&#34;, &#34;he is over qualified&#34; etc. Most of the times, they were more than qualified. I fear when I am into 40s or 50s, I will face the same discrimination."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Throwaway.I&#39;m happy to have more women in tech and hope it occurs or continues. However, virtually everyone recruiting in tech has observed some toxic diversity initiatives, I would venture. Some examples I have seen personally or one degree removed from me.- pressure on HMs to hire more women despite 95% of applicants being male- people in interview panels openly saying &#34;but he&#39;s a white 
man&#34; / &#34;do we want to hire more white men&#34; etc.- people championing all women teams as a win for diversity- women getting a salary premium to help companies boost DEI &#34;representation&#34;I think eventually this will be shown for what it is, but it will take a long time. Personally every tech founder I know thinks it&#39;s bullshit but won&#39;t say it in public."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"All the handwringing over Netflix subscriber loss seems to be overlooking the fact that they raised their prices - significantly. Of course they could lose subscribers from doing that. But 200k subscribers out of 150 million? Combined with the end of the pandemic and sky high inflation meaning many people have less opportunity to watch and less money to spend. The fact they raised their prices something like 20% and lost less than 1% of their subscriber base in that environment could almost be seen as a positive.The there is definitely a question whether, now that they have moved so solidly into content production, Netflix is actually a scalable / viable company any more. When they were just sending other people&#39;s content around and doing it much cheaper and better that was innovative and different. But content production is an expensive treadmill you can never get off and unless they find a way to innovate on that front, they are up against much more experienced and well established players with no differentiator at all.But reading the sky falling into the current reported figures seems a little over the top."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Honestly for me I just do not know all the content Netflix has because the browsing is so bad. I wish instead of pushing shows to me best on algorithms, it would just let me browse categories and recent additions etc in a simpler way. Maybe categorised by year."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting analysis.I find it interesting that so many people spend so much time watching tv in the first place. Growing up, I was one of those people but about a decade ago I lost interest in pretty much anything on television. There are certain shows that I will watch on occasion that get me hooked, but I usually struggle to find anything that is actually worth my time and end up just turning the tv off after surfing the streaming options for 10 minutes. It boggles my mind when I hear things like “golden age” of content.  Sure there is a ton of content, but it’s all so vapid."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The conclusion in the article:&gt; Why so angry?
I know I’ve taken this far too personally. I have no illusions that everything I read online should be correct, or about people’s susceptibility to a strong rhetoric cleverly bashing conventional science, even in great communities such as HN. But frankly, for the last few years, the world seems to be accelerating the rate at which it’s going crazy, and it feels to me a lot of that is related to people’s distrust in science (and statistics in particular). Something about the way the author conveniently swapped “purely random” with “null hypothesis” (when it’s inappropriate!) and happily went on to call the authors “unskilled and unaware of it”, and about the ease with which people jumped on to the “lies, damned lies, statistics” wagon but were very stubborn about getting off, got to me. Deeply. I couldn’t let this go.I am afraid I actually agree with the author&#39;s point.  The anti-intellectual, anti-scientific streak in many poor analyses claiming to debunk some scientific research is deeply concerning in our society.  If someone is trying to debunk some scientific research, at least he should learn some basic analytic tools.  This observation is independent of whether the original DK paper could have been better.That said, I give the benefit of doubt to the author of &#34;The DK Effect is Autocorrelation.&#34;  It is a human error to be overly zealous in some opinions without thinking it through."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Read the actual paper [1], there is so much more than those charts. They ask for an assessment of the own test score and an assessment of the ranking among the other participants to distinguish between misjudgments of the own abilities and the abilities of others. They give participants access to the tests of other participants and check how this affects self assessments - competent participants realize that they have overestimated the performance of other participants and now assess their own performance as better than before, incompetent participants do not learn from this and also assess their performance even better than before. They randomly split participants into two groups after a test, give one group additional training on the test task, and then ask all of them to reconsider their self assessments - incompetent participants that received additional training are now more competent and their self assessment becomes more accurate. This is not everything from the paper and probably also somewhat oversimplified, I just want to provide a better idea of what is actually in there.Everyone is free to question the results, but after actually reading the entire paper I can confidently say that poking a bit at the correlation in the charts falls way short of undermining the actual findings from the paper. The actual results are much more detailed and nuanced than two straight lines at an angle.[1] https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12688660_Unskilled_..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The plot to me always read &#34;People estimate themselves at 60-70% percentile - above average, but not the best&#34;. And then given this broad prior, people do place themselves accurately(because the plot is increasing).So it seems people are bad at doing global rankings. If I tried to rank myself amongst all programmers worldwide, that seems really hard and I could see myself picking some &#34;safe&#34; above-average value just because I don&#39;t know that many other people.There&#39;s also: If you take 1 class in piano 30 years ago and can only play 1 simple song, that might put you in the 90th percentile worldwide just because most people can&#39;t play at all. But you might be at the 10th percentile amongst people who&#39;ve taken at least 1 class. So doing a global ranking can be very difficult if you aren&#39;t exactly sure what the denominator set looks like.So I think it&#39;s an artifact of using &#34;ranking&#34; as an axis. If the metric was, &#34;predict the percentage of questions you got correct&#34; vs. &#34;predict your ranking&#34;, maybe people would be more accurate because it wouldn&#39;t involve estimating the denominator set."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The whole net neutrality saga just exposed the deep regulatory capture between ISPs and the FCC (the Republican Commissioners at least). Pai&#39;s argument for repealing net neutrality was that it wasn&#39;t a Federal government concern. That was originally what prompted California to institute these rules. But suddenly it wasn&#39;t a state issue either.Weird.The US has some of the most expensive Internet access in the world. In most places it&#39;s pretty crap too. Many places have no competition. Some providers are in clear breach of contract in not providing customers service as they promised to do.But apparently all that&#39;s not enough. We get the argument that the likes of Netflix are &#34;pushing&#34; their data at no cost onto &#34;their&#34; network. This is such a ridiculous argument and is nothing more than an effort to extort Netflix and other streaming services because it&#39;s eroding their cable TV services.No one is &#34;pushing&#34; data onto the network. Customers are pulling that data and those customers, by definition, are already paying for the bandwidth and the network access. But this doesn&#39;t stop lobbyists pushing this narrative onto Luddite elected officials. It&#39;s double-dipping. No more, no less.I really hope CAlifornia&#39;s net neutrality laws stand and get copied by other states."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; California&#39;s net neutrality law is similar to the federal rules repealed under former FCC Chairman Ajit Pai. California prohibits ISPs from blocking or throttling lawful traffic. It also prohibits requiring fees from websites or online services to deliver or prioritize their traffic to consumers, bans paid data cap exemptions (so-called &#34;zero-rating&#34;), and says that ISPs may not attempt to evade net neutrality protections by slowing down traffic at network interconnection points.I don&#39;t understand how anyone could oppose this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Net neutrality really highlights the ratchet effect that arises  wherever a  conflict of interest between the general public and special interests exists.They never stop. Legislative lobbying. Massive Legal efforts. Attempts at influencing the executive/government activities.Once they&#39;ve made a gain, they rarely lose it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For those who don&#39;t know web3 is the idea of building a web on a decentralized blockchain.  I think more specifically the idea is to replace the need for name servers with a blockchain protocol. Like anything blockchain there is no real solution for how to handle records becoming stale over time without a central authority that manages disputes.  I find it ridiculous that this idea even got to occupy the name as I think we&#39;d want to reserve it for the next generational change in web technology and not half-baked bs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Web3 makes a lot of sense to me.  The people that got into Bitcoin early are now out and ridiculously rich.  Other people also wanted to get rich, but that exact opportunity feels like it passed (still holding out for my $80 invested in Bitcoin to be worth &gt;$100,000, but I got in kind of late), so people started making their own coins in the hopes of repeating the process.  That had mixed success, Etherium (and maybe Dogecoin) did pretty well, but most didn&#39;t.  The SEC even started cracking down on ICOs.So, there is a legitimate need for some new business model where you print money and keep most of it for yourself.  Web3!  I guarantee you someone will get rich from it.  That means it worked.(I&#39;m being a little tongue-in-cheek here.  I get the actual idea for cryptocurrency and even NFTs if I squint a little bit, I just think that the hype is from people that think they&#39;re going to get rich without doing any actual work.  It does happen, but at the end of the day, doing actual work is probably going to be more profitable on average.  You&#39;re probably too late to the game if you start now intending to be a Web3 trillionaire, anyway.  The hype is to get you to buy some of the money you&#39;re printing with money that can actually be used to buy mansions.  So they can buy some mansions.)"</p>

There have been infinitely more interesting crypto conversation starters on this board than this - I don&#39;t care who the author is - I care about the content, of which this has none."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Honestly, I&#39;ve recently written a few 300-500 line programs in Python using type hints and I&#39;m never going back.  And I&#39;m not even using mypy often, if ever.My editor now has a fairly deep understanding of my code, and can tell me of all sorts of surprising errors I&#39;m making before I run the code.  There have been a few times where I found an error, went into the editor and saw I had missed a error message about that line.  Shout out: Using LunarVim with LSP and TreeSitter.The other thing I&#39;m enjoying is that libraries can use them to make things happen more automatically.  I believe it was Typer (the CLI argument parsing library) where if you declare an argument to a function as &#34;files: List[Path]&#34;, it understands that the argument will take one or more files, or &#34;-&#34; to mean stdin.  If you just say &#34;file: Path&#34;, it understands it is a singular file.I was curious about type hints when they first came out, wasn&#39;t really expecting to use them but they seemed cool, but now I&#39;m totally sold."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article is so hopelessly mis-informed, that it&#39;s practically hard to read without screaming &#34;that&#39;s not how any of this works!&#34; Most of their main arguments - type hints can be wrong, they can be ignored, and they don&#39;t inform you in a useful way about program state because of this - all evaporate as soon as you start using the correct tooling.My stack is pycharm, mypy, pydantic, sqlalchemy stub, several mypy plugins, black, isort, tabNine completion, and a bunch of custom scripts/Make to automate the common tasks. I&#39;m not even sure I&#39;m on the same planet as the author. I can practically spot incorrect type hints, mismatched types, weakly defined interfaces, from orbit, that&#39;s how well they are highlighted. Since every type is known, between pycharm and tabnine I can type 2-5 keys and spit out entire lines of code. And since it&#39;s all typed, automatic refactor is a breeze.I remember the dark ages, before type hints. It was rough. I lived in the REPL. Write 3 lines, run, Exception. Write 3 more lines, run, NoneType error. Ad nauseum. Now I write for hours on end and don&#39;t wince when I hit execute. And I don&#39;t have to go bug coworkers with questions like &#34;hey what keys are in this dict when we redirect from the oauth endpoint&#34;.Sure, I have my gripes, but it&#39;s mostly with the lack of power of the type system, like lack of higher kinded types. But I&#39;m confident it&#39;ll get there.Come to the typed side. We have less mental fatigue and screaming at neverending runtime oopsies."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Adding type hints to Python has increased my productivity by at least a factor of 10. They allow you to reason about code in a local function without having to track back up dozens of call sites to ensure you&#39;re getting what you think you&#39;re getting. That alone is worth the price of admission. Both when editing code or reviewing someone else&#39;s. It&#39;s fantastic, particularly in a very large code base.The editor experience only increases that factor as you can navigate a lot more freely. Even for small code bases type hints are a revelation. Knowing if something is nullable or not, alone, has caught 100&#39;s of bugs in waiting.Most of the complaints here feel like attacking a strawman, particularly the ones arguing what&#39;s the point if you&#39;re not running mypy. Run mypy! It&#39;s like saying what&#39;s the point of writing unit tests if you don&#39;t run the test suite. For any sufficiently large code base you absolutely should be running mypy with any plugins for your framework of choice added.For heterogeneous dictionaries use `dict[str, object]` and then you&#39;re forced to use the existing duck-typing mechanisms you&#39;re used to. Or, you refactor into better types and/or structures.Is there friction? Sometimes. You don&#39;t have to annotate everything. If the cost is too prohibitive for a particular structure or function, ignore it. Sometimes there are mypy bugs that make writing correct code impossible. # type: ignore[reason] that sucker. Don&#39;t throw the baby out with the bath water.We use a flake8 linter to enforce that all new or modified functions at least annotate their return type which makes interacting with functions quite a bit nicer, and encourages all devs to at least do the minimum. Usually you find that most args are appropriately typed at the same time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Congratulations on the launch! I wonder if this kind of business model, where it looks like there is basically &#34;one really rich guy self-funding&#34; for a couple of years, is going to be more common.That is, just looking at the site, my guess is that building everything from the ground up (core banking stack, acquiring the chartered bank, then all the APIs and tech on top of that) must have taken many years and many, many millions of dollars. And kudos, because the first thing that struck out at me is the documentation looks excellent. Overall, it looks like something where the the team had all the luxury to &#34;do things right from the ground floor&#34;, instead of scrambling and making shortcuts before their runway ran out. I just think it would have been very hard to find a VC willing to be patient enough to wait that long with no revenue or customer feedback (&#34;where&#39;s your MVP???&#34;)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Create account numbers that point to a single bank account and create specific permissions and limits for each one.I love that; there are so many places that give a 6% discount for using ACH but I don&#39;t want to give out my bank account details willy-nilly---If you have influence over it, I wouldn&#39;t recommend having https://status.column.com/uptime default to &#34;Sandbox&#34; since I doubt seriously that&#39;s what anyone would care about when going to an uptime page, and can also mislead a reader in a hurry if the Sandbox environment is having woes but Production is finenit: I would guess you meant &#34;sweep&#34; not &#34;sweet&#34; on https://column.com/bank-accounts&gt; We support FBO, sweet, clearing and custom account types — all FDIC insured."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Having worked on this in Skia (and so Chrome, Android) for a good while, I can vouch this is an issue browser/phone developers would have liked to fix a long time ago, but have kept by default for compatibility with old expectations.  A lot (~all) of web/app design was and still is done with this broken interpolation in mind, which then all breaks when math is done in a way that more accurately models light.It’s a bit of a chicken and egg problem that we can really only fix by allowing content to explicitly opt-in to linear working color profiles.  And sadly that’s not going to solve everything either: while a linear profile is good for color interpolation, sRGB encoding is ideal for brightness interpolation.  You’re stuck choosing between ugly red-green interpolation and nice white-black (sRGB) or between nice red-green and ugly white-black (linear).  There are some more complex color spaces that do try to be the best of everything here, but I’m not aware of any browser or OS providing support for working with these perceptual color spaces.A similar problem comes up when trying to manage color gamut on screens and systems that are intentionally blown out to look vivid, vibrant, shiny… looking at you Samsung phones.  Any properly color-managed image there looks incredibly dull compared to the bright defaults you’ve grown accustomed to.  If we take 0xff red to mean “full sRGB red”, that’s much less bright these days than if we just assume it means “as red as the screen will go.”  It’s much like how TVs are (hopefully were?) set in the store in bright shiny mode to induce you to buy them, not set to reproduce colors accurately."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Web color is somehow still a garbage fire.About a decade ago I was hearing that web-safe color was effectively obsolete. Today Firefox chokes on P3 color, and Chrome doesn&#39;t appear to care at all about display color profiles.I recently launched a website that had a fire-engine red background and was expected to have a rotating animation above the fold (https://worldparkinsonsday.com). Even once we got the animation synced perfectly between Chrome and Safari, it turned out that iOS Safari was rendering the video differently. Eventually I gave up and replaced a 128kb mp4 video with a 5mb transparent animated GIF. Shameful.And I had this lil&#39; fellah on my desk smiling at me the whole time

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The gradient mixing example is broken.&#34;Color gradients are supposed to be equally bright around the midpoint&#34;This is false. Nobody mandates this.There is no &#34;correct&#34; way to do it, every one of them is arbitrary (although some do look better than others and the suggested method is better than the default linear interpolation).It is completely analogous to smoothing curve in animation - it&#39;s about what sort of interpolation mechanism you use.If there would be a standard for specific perceptually pleasing gradient, then one could claim &#34;does not follow standard X&#34;.The point of the article is usually abslutely correct, though:
&#34;The correct way to process sRGB data is to convert it to linear RGB values first, then process it, then convert it back to sRGB if required.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It is hard to say one couldn&#39;t see this coming. Of the few features left in Server, the only one I remained interested in was Profile Manager, and that hasn&#39;t worked right for a bit now. I&#39;m fine with an Apple that wants to do hardware and operating systems more than software, but I wish they&#39;d make Profile Manager-like features more available for regular people, not just Education or Business users. It would be infinitely useful to have such features for iPhones of family members who aren&#39;t so good with tech and could use a heavier hand in making sure the device is up to date and findable when lost. But I digress. I&#39;m glad it&#39;s just ending, even if it&#39;s barely a surprise."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked at a company that used the phrase &#34;getting jamf&#39;d&#34; as a verb to describe when the management system broke things on your macbook.E.g., &#34;I&#39;ll be able to test that code change in a bit, I got Jamf&#39;d pretty hard this morning and now my build is broken...&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In the mid 2000s, it looked like there was good hope that Apple would finally make inroads into corporate IT. In addition to their professional software suites (Shake, Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, Aperture, Motion, etc.), they had already released XServe, which was really good by those days&#39; standards, as well as XSan -- these products solved many of the needs of small professional creative groups. Mac OS X server&#39;s abilities to handle small offices&#39; needs seemed like a prelude to larger things.Sadly, those hopes never really panned out. Apple is historically reticent to entering a market they aren&#39;t confident they have a good chance of dominating if they execute well, and their own growing internal use of Linux servers (and maybe other 3rd-party corporate domain/directory services, like Active Directory?) probably persuaded them to scale back their efforts around 2010."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Actually, if you know what you are talking about, this filing actually shows Elon is about 21 billion dollars short. This is because 21 billion dollars of the commitment is coming from him and not from any financial institution. He is a very rich man but almost his entire wealth is tied up in tesla shares which he cannot sell in such large amounts and ownership of spacex which is even harder to sell.If he tries to sell 21 billion dollars worth of tesla shares, the share price will collapse.So no, once again he does not have funding secured. And once again he is trying to bullshit his way around the issue, although this time the bullshitting is a little more sophisticated.It is still possible that he tries to sell a lot of tesla shares to get the cash to buy twitter, but it is unlikely."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Personally, I think Musk is having a bit of a laugh. This will never happen. *Twitter operating income for 12 m/e 31 Dec 2021 was negative. For the q/e 31 Dec 2021 it was $0.167B. Why he thinks Twitter is worth $45b is beyond me. What would Warren Buffett do?

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;Why is it so expensive?&#34; - commentary from someone who does this for a living at SequentialSmall Volume - each unit is more expensive than a large volume product, you don&#39;t get price breaks on any components or tooling costsDesign focused - Who is the product for? It isn&#39;t for people who want to spend 250$ on a Behringer mixer. It is for people who want something that is high quality and doesn&#39;t break. Reliable. For people that rely on their tools to be creative or appreciate design. You are paying a premium. See Apple for lots of examples. This is also one of the biggest strengths of the company, if you want something cheap you&#39;re looking in the wrong place.Complex - the amount of balance of various components here adds a lot to the design and development costs. Battery is an unusual feature but puts it in a different product category. Balancing that with the audio quality and reliability is not a trivial problem. Add in wireless, audio drivers (not trivial at ALL), Complexity increases development time and adds risk to the long term stability of the product, that is added into the cost.Most of the small features feel like somebody there thought it would be fun and/or easy to put in. It&#39;s a good way to iterate through design ideas, you have to see it in reality. That type of prototyping isn&#39;t easy. Most people don&#39;t use 90% of the features but when you are in a creative industry the 1% that does absolutely LOVES it and uses it in ways you never expected. It&#39;s difficult to balance the amount of development you put into fun things vs. business cases.If you are trying to figure out why you&#39;d pay for this you aren&#39;t their target market. It&#39;s far more interesting (to me) to think about why some people WOULD pay for this and what a market looks like that you are not a part of"</p>

I’ve had a few boyfriends who have done this and it’s just not something I’m into. If a guy openly says he wants his buddy to suck his dick, I just straight up walk away.

EDIT - you are the world&#39;s second richest man, tied with Bill Gates. Gates has a much higher net worth than you due to Microsoft stock, which is why you are second and he is first.&#34;
2. &#34;YTA. I would never have invested in a company without knowing who was behind it, and there are plenty of other opportunities out there for you to continue gaming the system.&#34;
3. &#34;YTA, but not for the reason you think. The reason the rules apply to you is because you are the one who broke the rules. You can&#39;t change the past and what you did was wrong. At best you can do is disclose your holdings on your next filings which you are doing. 
You are a criminal and should be ashamed of your actions.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;I think Go is the best programming language by far. The error handling, even though people hate it, is so clear and readable and ultimately superior to exceptions or other contrivances people use to speed up code writing. Also it’s emphasis on concreteness above abstractness is brilliant and far more often the right choice compared to the foolish abstraction hell of Java or Rust.Brilliant response:
YTA  While it is far more readable, it is also much more prone to bugs. The bugs will not be easy to find, because the errors won&#39;t give you much information about where to look. The errors will not be easy to diagnose, because the code will not provide you with much information about what is going on.  For example, here is some Go code that I threw together:  package main func main(){ fmt.Println(&#34;Hello, world!&#34;) }  And then I tried to run it:  $ go run Example.go hello, world! $  And I got:  $ go run Example.go hello, world! hello, world!  And I don&#39;t know what the hell is going on, and I don&#39;t know where to look to figure it out. And this is just one of many examples.  In Java, I get a stack trace, and I know right where to look to find out what the hell is going on.  In Go, I have no idea. I have to go look at the compiler output to see that the compiler got confused and ran my program multiple times in succession, jumped back and forth between"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hopefully this piece gets a lot more views, because this is an issue that pretty much any rational technoligist should get involved with. Here in NC, our state legislature also caved to cableco and telecom pressure to make it nearly impossible for muni broadband to spread. That was after a single city&#39;s service succeeded so spectacularly that the incumbents had visions of Armageddon.That&#39;s because they knew that even in this relatively center-right leaning state, people will know a good deal when they see it: so job 1 was to make sure they never do. So far their efforts at blocking competition have been successful. Except for a few very limited areas where Google Fiber was able to pry its way in, there has been no competition to the incumbents from muni or private parties.At this point our best hope may be that changing demographics and the undeniable drift away from traditional programming will result in their financial collapse, finally allowing communities to serve themselves.The other option is for people to get out and pressure their political reps to make muni or community broadband easier to deploy, maybe even run for office themselves and replace those who have sold out. Broadband access isn&#39;t as important as homelessness or healthcare, but it is important. Maybe it&#39;s a good place to start reversing the crappification of everything many here have lived through their whole lives."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We’ve had gigabit municipal internet here in Chattanooga for 12 years now. It’s better than Comcast in every possible way—speed, price, reliability, customer service, install time, install windows, availability (within the state limited geographical area) etc…There was a question on a local Facebook group the other day from a person who just moved here asking which ISP she should use.The replies were nothing but pages and pages of EPB, EPB, EPB… (EPB is the name of the municipal power company and ISP). Along with glowing reviews about how better their customer service is than Comcast.EPB is so much better, I’d have a really hard time moving somewhere else that didn’t have something similar."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I live in one of the few Canadian cities who were progressive enough to install city-managed fiber in most areas zoned for high-rise buildings.  Actual internet service is provided by ISPs, but they deliberately excluded the large telcos.Similar to the author, I also get 1Gbps symmetric, no outages, no data caps and I pay only $32 (Canadian) a month.  The telcos charge four times as much for the same service (but less reliable) in the residential areas not covered by the city network."</p>

But, if you&#39;re in Canada, I just bought this: https://www.newegg.ca/p/N82E16834233446?Description=gigabyte...It&#39;s got a gorgeous 4K OLED screen, a quite decent CPU and GPU, and it&#39;s currently $350 off + a $300 mail in rebate (there was an additional $350 off over the easter weekend, too).  The track pad is not my favorite, but it&#39;s good enough, and the keyboard is very decent.  I haven&#39;t had it very long and mostly it&#39;s plugged in so I can&#39;t comment too much about battery life.My biggest complaint is that the screen is too good.  When I&#39;m done with the laptop and come up to my desktop, my IPS screens look washed out and sad.  :PEdit: I didn&#39;t buy the X1, I bought a Gigabyte Aero 15."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Recent and related:Go will use pdqsort in next release - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31106157 - April 2022 (112 comments)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hi all, I&#39;m the author of pdqsort that&#39;s credited in the post (to be clear: the authors acknowledged pdqsort at the bottom, I am not associated with the posted work directly). I recently held a talk at my institute on efficient in-memory sorting and the ideas in pdqsort, in case you&#39;re interested in hearing some of the theory behind it all: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jz-PBiWwNjcNext week I will hold another talk in the Dutch seminar on data systems design (https://dsdsd.da.cwi.nl/) on glidesort, a new stable sorting algorithm I&#39;ve been working on. It is a combination of adaptive quicksort (like pdqsort, fully adaptive for many equal elements) and an adaptive mergesort (like timsort, fully adaptive for long pre-sorted runs). It is the first practical implementation of an algorithm I&#39;m aware of that&#39;s fully adaptive for both. Like pdqsort it uses modern architecture aware branchless sorting, and it can use an arbitrary buffer size, becoming faster as you give it more memory (although if given a constant buffer size it will degrade to O(n (log n)^2) in theory, in practice for realistic workloads it&#39;s just a near-constant factor (c ~&lt;= 3-5) slower).The source code isn&#39;t publish-ready yet, I have to still do some extra correctness vetting and testing, and in particular exception-safety is still not yet fully implemented. This is important because I wrote it in Rust where we must always give back a valid initialized array, even if a comparison operator caused a panic. But I do have some performance numbers to quote, that won&#39;t significantly change.For sorting 2^24 randomly shuffled distinct u32s using a buffer of 2^23 elements (n/2), glidesort beats Rust&#39;s stdlib slice::sort (which is a classic timsort also using a buffer of n/2) by a factor of 3.5 times. When stably sorting the same numbers comparing only their least significant 4 bits, it beats stdlib slice::sort by 12.5 times using 6.5 times fewer comparisons, both numbers on my Apple M1 Macbook. All of this is just using single-threaded code with a generic comparison function. No SIMD, no threads, no type-specific optimizations.Finally, glidesort with a buffer size of &gt;= n/2 is faster than pdqsort."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fun safety problems.Towards the end of this post, the author mentions a bunch of places where std::sort() blows up if your data or your sort rule doesn&#39;t exhibit strict weak ordering. In some cases you get a bad sort, which feels fair enough since you violated the rules the sort algorithm is relying on, but in others it literally has Undefined Behaviour in C++.Notably Rust&#39;s sort() and unstable_sort() do not have this problem, because of course these are safe Rust, and safe Rust doesn&#39;t have Undefined Behaviour. But why can this work?First up, one bullet which gets dodged is that Rust&#39;s floating point types (f32 and f64) are not Ord. Rust acknowledges that NaN != NaN and therefore we can&#39;t expect to go around sorting a slice of floating point values. In C++ that&#39;s on the programmer, in C++ the fact you can write a &lt; b means that type counts as ordered, even though it trivially isn&#39;t for several built-in types. So if you simply naively try to sort an [f32] Rust says you can&#39;t because it isn&#39;t Ord, you will need to write a lambda or whatever to Order these f32s and then if some of them are NaN your lambda is responsible for deciding what to do about that.But even if we insist on getting in harm&#39;s way, safe Rust promises to protect us anyway. For example if I make an array of a thousand misfortunate::OnewayGreater&lt;u8&gt;s they&#39;re only one byte each, yet they all insist they&#39;re Ordered greater than each other and even than themselves, Rust&#39;s sort() doesn&#39;t cause Undefined Behaviour on this input. It may never succeed, since all the elements to be &#34;sorted&#34; insist they&#39;re greater than each other, but it definitely won&#39;t segfault, trash unrelated memory or cause chaos."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a good lesson about the benefit of time when it comes to software development.  Mario 64 could have been a much much better game on the same hardware, but the time cost would have resulted in a release late enough that the entire game might have been considered irrelevant.Game consoles have had the benefit of the platform freezing for a few years allowing improvements to accumulate and later titles utilizing knowledge gained from the earlier titles.Much of the software we use every day could benefit from this level of scrutiny but the pressure to deliver on time means we won&#39;t get to see such benefits unless it becomes a crazy persons labour of love."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Now that&#39;s a 10x programmer if I ever saw one. I&#39;m sure the compiler helped too. The generated code of C compilers from the 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s versus the generated code created by something like modern GCC -- it&#39;s like night and day. We&#39;re able to build faster tinier software than we ever have before, and it really helps to illuminate the impact modern tools have had when we apply that advantage to something old we already know."</p>

This might be unpopular among the HN crowd, but I think you can monetize this further by bundling this with an advising service.This idea of FIRE has been spreading beyond techies/Internet nerds and into other highly paid professionals like doctors. [0]. The main difference is that non-programmer professionals generally don&#39;t get a thrill out of min/max-ing financial projections.Such people might be willing to pay a few hundred dollars a year for someone to generate this kind of analysis with them and simply execute on it each year. Similar to how people pay for CPAs. My employer actually pays Goldman Sachs to provide a similar service for its employees (no commission, fiduciary advisors) but their tools suck compared to this.[0] For example https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/, https://www.physicianonfire.com/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is great, I took some time to get a fairly in depth plan together. There are two things that stuck out:1. You&#39;ve got RSU&#39;s (at first it wasn&#39;t clear  to me where this would be addressed, but I think it made sense once I came across it) but I don&#39;t see a dedicated strategy for dealing with ISO/NSO&#39;s. That&#39;d be helpful for the tech community especially.2. I spent the 10-15 minutes working on a plan knowing that I&#39;d need to upgrade to pro for every feature, but it seems like I need to upgrade to save my plan. I ended up not paying because I don&#39;t have enough time right now to fully evaluate this, but I might look back later. It would have been great if I could have entered my email and saved my plan without paying, and then had to later pay to access it. This gives you the benefit of getting my email address, and then sending me an email to access my plan so that I&#39;ve got a second touchpoint to your product when I check my email in the future.Looking forward to using this more in depth in the future!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It is amazing how many large-scale applications run on a single or a few large RDBMS. It seems like a bad idea at first: surely a single point of failure must be bad for availability and scalability? But it turns out you can achieve excellent availability using simple replication and failover, and you can get huge database instances from the cloud providers. You can basically serve the entire world with a single supercomputer running Postgres and a small army of stateless app servers talking to it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; To resolve this, we ended up choosing to leave foreign key constraints unenforced on a few large tables.&gt; We reasoned this was likely safe, as Retool’s product logic performs its own consistency checks, and also doesn’t delete from the referenced tables, meaning it was unlikely we’d be left with a dangling reference.I was holding my breath here and I&#39;m glad these were eventually turned back on.Nobody should ever rely on their own product logic to ensure consistency of the database.The database has features (constraints, transactions, etc) for this purpose which are guaranteed to work correctly and atomically in all situations such as database initiated rollbacks that your application will never have control over."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hey folks—I wrote the post! This was my biggest Postgres project to date, and it proved quite tricky since I didn&#39;t rehearse with a test database of the same size.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Their math seems off.  I really don&#39;t see how you get to 97% renewable when the state was burning natural gas to generate 2.8 GW of non-renewable power and had about 1.1 GW of nuclear at the time.  There might be some funny math here where they assign all of the &#34;dirty&#34; power generated in the state to exports and can claim that that California is running on renewable power.Source:  https://www.caiso.com/TodaysOutlook/Pages/supply.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The grid operator cited is the California Independent System Operator.  How much of CA&#39;s electricity consumption is fed by that operator?In the article they mention 23GW from wind and solar.  A quick search says in 2018 CA&#39;s electrical generation capacity was 80GW (which I assume has only gone up).  So this 97% is a bit misleading, no?  It doesn&#39;t represent 97% of total CA electricity usage... it&#39;s less than 30%?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a cool milestone, but it belies the current state of CA renewables, shown here at a very fine grain (data not current, need to go back a week): http://www.caiso.com/TodaysOutlook/Pages/supply.htmlTo summarize, CA has to burn a lot of natural gas and import a lot of (mostly non-renewable) electricity from other states at night, and even more in the shoulder periods at morning and evening. Only untold billions in new batteries at the expense of ratepayers, and (barring storage breakthroughs) new nuclear or geothermal generation will fundamentally change this situation.A cool thing is that you can see grid demand drop hard during the days when behind-the-meter rooftop solar is on."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Under U.S. law, are there circumstances in which it could be acceptable to deliberately crash a plane?In this case, it clearly wasn&#39;t (crashing on public lands with risk of starting a wildfire and polluting them), but if you wanted to crash a plane for a scene in a movie, could you do so? Maybe crashing on private property in a predetermined location with appropriate fire department support and prior notification to air traffic control about your intentions?Can manufacturers perform genuine crashes (from controlled flight) on private property for safety tests, the way car manufacturers perform tests with crash test dummies?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There are cases when server-side rendering (without SPA) is easier and faster. For example: documentation sites, blog-like sites, internet stores, sites like Hacker News. In all these cases, you can save on development time by writing just one application instead of two (server and client), and improve performance (no need to load multimegabyte JS applications and make multiple AJAX requests to display a page).Of course, there are cases when SPA-style application is better, for example: (graphic/circuit/text) editors, IDEs, mobile newsfeed-based apps - everything that resembles an app rather than a page with text, menus and images. But in these cases you usually don&#39;t need server-side rendering. And sometimes you cannot even use it - for example, if your code needs to know browser windows size to arrange objects on the page.So I think that SSR (running JS on server) is rarely useful."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been saying it for years - the hard part is not &#34;server side&#34; vs &#34;client side&#34;, it&#39;s making sure the state stays consistent between those 2 buckets.If you want to remove the hell from your life, you need to be all in on one or the other.For us, we&#39;ve been keeping all state server-side using things like Blazor and hand-rolled js-over-websocket UI frameworks. We never have to worry about more than ~10k users, so this works out great for us.If we were webscale, we&#39;d have to consider client side options."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been using server-side rendering for many years now and I find it to be almost zero overhead at this point. Yes, I had to do some initial work to set things up, but these days I don&#39;t even remember it&#39;s there.Most people make an assumption that in order to have SSR you need to run JavaScript (e.g. Node most of the time) on your backend. That is not a valid assumption.I think the title of the article could benefit from adding &#34;using Node&#34;, because much of the complexity described is something I do not encounter at all. I&#39;m using Clojure and ClojureScript with Rum as a React interface. Much (if not most) of my code is in cljc files, which get compiled with Clojure (for JVM on the backend) or ClojureScript (for JavaScript on the frontend). And the ClojureScript advanced compilation takes care of only including what is strictly necessary in the frontend compiled JavaScript.I mean, sure, you need to be careful not to do stupid things like trying to read from files, but otherwise I just don&#39;t encounter much friction. And I reap the benefits of using a single language for both backend and frontend, with most of my data model (e.g. business logic) code written only once, with SSR being a nice cherry on top."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t have any kids, so I don&#39;t really feel comfortable telling folks how to raise theirs.But I will tell you my perspective.As someone who grew up in the &#34;be back home in time for supper&#34; 1970s, today&#39;s world seems completely foreign. When I started kindergarten, Mom walked me to school on the first day so that I&#39;d know the route. And after that I walked to school on my own until I learned to ride a bike.I rode to junior high, where there was parking for hundreds of bikes. Recently I drove by that school, and the bike racks were gone. This whole concept of waiting in traffic to pick up or drop off your kid wasn&#39;t even a thing.And I&#39;m so supremely grateful that I was raised that way. I&#39;m absolutely certain that early autonomy paid off later in life in countless ways.I&#39;d encourage you, if you&#39;re raising kids, to consider the upsides of so-called &#34;free range&#34;. Or, as we called it in the 70s, &#34;being a regular kid&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not in the US they can&#39;t.&#34;officials placed two brothers into foster care after one, 11, was found playing basketball alone in his own yard.&#34;He&#39;d gotten home early from school and his parents came 90 minutes later. He was in his own yard. The family lost their children to foster care. Ironically in foster care ACTUAL abuse rates are pretty darn high!&#34;When Cindy and Fred arrived home they were arrested for child neglect — then fingerprinted, strip searched, and held in jail overnight.Their kids, meanwhile, including their 4-year-old boy, were removed from the home and from their parents’ custody&#34;Mom worked in the school district ironically.&#34;We still do not have our children, we are fighting for our own freedom and due to the nature of my employment I am no longer employed,” she wrote. “My son was in his own yard playing basketball, not in the street or at the park. The authorities claim he had no access to water or shelter. We have an open shed in the back yard and 2 working sinks and 2 hoses. They said he had no food. He ate his snacks already. He had no bathroom, but the responding officer found our yard good enough to relieve himself in while our son sat in a police car alone.&#34;Being accused of child abuse / neglect is a career ender. The idea of my 4 year old being taken is beyond belief. What is so ironic is so many real / terrible things are happening (crime of all sorts / abuse in the traditional sense / financial fraud online) where nothing happens. But your kid shoots some hoops in their own yard, you lose custody. You are jailed and strip searched. You lose your job.I realize big government is here to protect us, I just wish they would focus on the harder problems."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a parent, none of the risks are as profound as that of some other member of the public calling the police to inform on your “dangerous parenting”.I’ve deliberately chosen to live in a walkable part of the Bay Area in the hopes that my kids can be more independent when they get older, but I’m more worried about the social pushback than I am about their safety."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m excited to see more profiling tools for Python!This sounds like it does peak memory, which is critical for batch jobs, since that&#39;s the bottleneck. Memory is fundamentally different than performance in that it&#39;s a limited resource, instead of cumulative cost; making any part of the program faster almost always helps speed up the program (at least a little, or at least reduces CPU load), but optimizing non-peak memory has no impact. You have to be able to identify the peak in order to reduce memory usage.If you want peak memory profiling for Python that also runs on macOS, check out https://pythonspeed.com/fil/ (ARM support has some issues, but once I unpack my new Mac Mini I plan to fix it.)Ways memray is better than Fil:- Native callstacks.- More kinds of reports, and ability to do custom post-processing of data.- Much lower overhead (but not always, see reply).- Subprocess support.Fil I suspect has better flamegraphs: https://pythonspeed.com/articles/a-better-flamegraph/And if you&#39;re running Python batch jobs, and want both peak memory and performance profiling in production, check out Sciagraph: https://pythonspeed.com/sciagraph/(You can probably cobble together something like Sciagraph with py-spy + memray, but you won&#39;t e.g. get timeline reports designed with batch jobs in mind.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Want to chime in to say it&#39;s awesome that Bloomberg is releasing this product to the world. I don&#39;t think many financial organizations would even consider releasing anything as open source, even if it is as general purpose as this tool. My current one (HFT,MM) wouldn&#39;t go for it.It also shows good engineering practices. I&#39;d venture a guess that they are probably one of the better ones in the space.Makes me want to work there! Maybe one day..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Why is no one questioning whether this is real?Reddit is full of far-fetched stories like this that ultimately turn up to be completely fabricated (obviously for the purpose of internet points). While this one isn&#39;t ridiculously far-fetched, it&#39;s definitely borderline.Also, the first thing that came to my mind when reading this was the movie Vivarium [1], where one of the main characters does almost exactly this.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"What&#39;s interesting about this to me is the way it sort of causes you to examine why certain things are acceptable hobbies and other things aren&#39;t. This particular hobby has three notable attributes:1. It&#39;s risky.2. The end product doesn&#39;t seem particularly useful if we set aside the mental/physical benefits. i.e.: it&#39;s done for it&#39;s own sake.3. It&#39;s novel.I would argue that 1 and 2 are attributes that a great number of hobbies share. Skiing, Mountain biking, football, kayaking, woodworking, sitting in a chair and playing video games all weekend. All these things carry some very specific and often non trivial risks to health or bodily harm over time.Of course because these hobbies aren&#39;t novel, the benefits of the hobby are well understood. Our understanding of the risks and how to mitigate them are also quite a bit more understood.It seems to me that the real &#39;problem&#39; with this tunnel digging hobby is how novel it is. Which consequently leads to a lack of knowledge about what the risks and benefits may be.Of course it&#39;s possible the poor guy is just dealing with a mental illness."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Second, AMP is bad for security. By design, AMP confuses users about what site they’re interacting with. Users think they’re interacting with the publisher, when in actuality the user is still within Google’s control. User-respecting browsers defend the site as the security and privacy boundary on the web, and systems like AMP intentionally confuse this boundary.They&#39;ve actually been pushing to confuse that boundary even more since 2019, with their Signed Exchanges specification[0][1]. In essence, when you (unintentionally) visit an AMP page from Google Search, the URL typically starts with google.com/amp/websiteyouwantedtogoto.com. Signed Exchanges is essentially a way to drop the &#34;google.com/amp/&#34; bit, as demonstrated by one of the animations on [0].Even Cloudflare supported this and rolled it out on their free tier[2].[0]: https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2019/04/instant-lo...[1]: https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/16/18402628/google-amp-url-p...[2]: https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-amp-real-url/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Kudos to Brave - they&#39;re a sometimes weird actor, but some of their initiatives are commendable, and they often do what Mozilla should have, but didn&#39;t.I rarely end up in AMP pages on my mobile, but when it happens I immediately feel like I stepped on a turd, and promptly backtrack / close the tab before it hijacks my back button, half the screen, standard controls (including doing something weird to scrolling) and other unpleasantries like banners whose &#34;x&#34; somehow overlaps my browser&#39;s bars, and are therefore out of reach (and said browser bars somehow do NOT autohide when scrolling, unlike on normal pages)Getting AMP results from Google search has been one of the drivers leading me to switch to DDG, so congrats Google, one less customer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Everything you need to know about AMP is in one very specific section of the spec:&#34;AMP HTML documents MUST...contain a &lt;script async src=&#34;https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; tag inside their head tag&#34; [1]Meaning, &#34;Your content must load and run some Google controlled javascript, that does who-knows-what to your content and end users&#34;.In the past, that&#39;s included injecting a big header that pushes your content down, hijacking swipe events on your page, an [X] button that looked like it would delete the AMP banner header, but instead navigated away from your page back to google, etc.[1] https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/spe..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"These are boogieman policies that have zero influence on the root cause.Foreign investors jump into the housing market because the current system ensures that the supply of housing is limited so it is an attractive way to park your wealth.But that is not the root cause.The root cause is the system that is geared to keep houses always appreciating via supply constraints: aggressive zoning, discretionary permitting, NIMBYism.Until we liberalize zoning, legalize building, and reject the idea that houses have to be appreciating assets, the issue will continue.As it is often the case, politicians go for the headline with the highest electoral ROI, rather than tackle the real issues."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a homeowner in Toronto and I don&#39;t think this will help. They&#39;ve eliminated a small number of buyers from the market but have added other incentives like a first home buyers tax credit that will only fuel the fire - Australia tried this with tragic results.&gt;&gt; working with provinces and territories to develop and implement a Home Buyers’ Bill of Rights and bring forward a national plan to end blind bidding.Blind bidding is where multiple parties submit a sealed bid on a property. The realtor and seller review these bids behind close doors and then often request subsequent rounds of bids from the bidders *without telling them the current winning bid, or who&#39;s bid is winning*. Bidders end up out-bidding themselves.IMHO blind bidding is an unethical practice that should be outlawed regardless of its impact on housing prices."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A quick look at the data suggests only about 2% of properties in Toronto and Vancouver are owned by overseas investors. Yes, housing is priced at the margin, but this won&#39;t do anything at all to prices over the long term.I&#39;m sure this will be wildly popular politically, because people LOVE the idea that some foreign boogieman is the reason their children can&#39;t afford homes anymore.It&#39;s much easier to outsource your problems to some outside &#34;other&#34; then deal with the much harder task of introspection over the poor housing policy that you and your neighbors have voted for over the last 60 years.Like all cities in areas with heavy-handed zoning regulations, abuse of historic preservation clauses, and filibuster-style city council meetings blocking new construction...the issue is one of supply.It&#39;s the same problem in literally every developed country on earth right now. The industrious, forward-looking people who originally built the cities during the major growth phase died...and then their kids grew up believing that the way things ended up was somehow divinely ordained. Never to be changed or built upon again."</p>

In the interest of moving swiftly, here are the actions we are going to take:(1) We have withdrawn the DMCA notice for sympy; Sent a note to senior leadership in Github to act on this quickly.(2) We have stopped the whole DMCA process for now and working on internal guidelines of what constitutes a real violation so that these kind of incidents don&#39;t happen. We are going to do this in-house(3) We are going to donate $25k to the sympy project.As a company we take a lot of pride in helping developers and it sucks to see this.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting concept. However there are a few issues that surface quickly (this is all assuming a feed through scanner and not a flatbed).#1 - It rotates AND scales to fit. It&#39;s not obvious until you rotate a stupid amount, but pages don&#39;t shrink when scanned for real.#2 - The scanning rotation is way too uniform. Most scans twist a bit, typically near the top when more of the page is in the scanner to straighten it out.#3 - With #2 there should be some stretching/skewing that isn&#39;t uniform.#4 - The noise is way too uniform as well. It looks like static. Typical scanned documents have noise that is much more variable. You also get other scanning artifacts like streaks for dirt on the scan head.#5 - The page ends often aren&#39;t even and introduce artifacting as well.#6 - Needs an option for chewed up staple corner and/or holepunch."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Ooh! I have a mockingbird in my yard that I can try this on! I counted 20 different songs the other night, and it was probably a lot more, I just stopped being able to distinguish. They can have a repertoire of over 200! I  was actually wondering if something like this project existed, or maybe just an app really, but then hadn&#39;t thought about it since (I&#39;m just an insomniac, not a bird watcher). Very cool.If you don&#39;t know about the North American mockingbird, they fly up to a high perch at night and claim a yard sized area of territory by reciting all the songs it knows, as loud as it can. Over and over again, until it is exhausted. The little psychos. Thus impressing all the lady mockingbirds in the area. Apparently they do a little dance as well, but given it&#39;s usually the middle of the night when this happens, I haven&#39;t seen it.They used to drive me nuts until I read up on them. Now I try to count how many songs they know."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"BirdNET and Pl@ntNet have to be my favorite uses of AI to date. A true use of technology for the greater good.I&#39;ve actually been thinking about automated bird recognition for a while now, I live underneath a flight corridor for migrating common cranes (near Berlin). I&#39;d love to be able to one day track their migration across the continent in real time using data from crowdsourced base stations.I wonder if migrating birds could be identified in flight using optical/radar/audio. If anybody else has had similar ideas I&#39;d really love to chat on this topic."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It would be very cool to have network of these listening to calls while birds are migrating at night. With a large enough network you&#39;d get an amazing way to visualise large scale movements which are generally completely invisible. Wiring up the eastern seaboard around Massachusetts, southern Spain, the vast steppes around the Caspian Sea or pretty much anywhere else would be incredible."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think there&#39;s a valid concern with this; a concern which is not necessarily distilled down to &#34;big brother&#34; or &#34;corporate overlords&#34;.Google is so large that any stance they take, no matter how minuscule, has immense influence.Case in point, from this article:
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/02/technology/google-maps-ne...&gt; For decades, the district south of downtown and alongside San Francisco Bay here was known as either Rincon Hill, South Beach or South of Market. This spring, it was suddenly rebranded on Google Maps to a name few had heard: the East Cut.&gt; The peculiar moniker immediately spread digitally, from hotel sites to dating apps to Uber, which all use Google’s map data. The name soon spilled over into the physical world, too. Real-estate listings beckoned prospective tenants to the East Cut. And news organizations referred to the vicinity by that term.My point is, it might seem like a small, inconspicuous change.  But at Google-scale, this actually has an impact on the real world, and personally I don&#39;t feel confident with Google deciding what words are the correct words."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s the announcement from Google: https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/03/more-assisti...You could think of it as Google wanting to police people, OR you could see it as Google seeing that a ton of people use Grammarly and clearly want this feature.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Me: 20 years in the defense space business. Stating my own opinion.This is basically right. The problem with space imagery is that almost everyone who wants it has a niche use case, and those few organizations without a niche use case (the US Weather Service, various militaries, etc) generally want imagery that&#39;s so specialized to their own problem that they have to spec, buy, and operate their own orbital assets.Take Ukraine as an example. Leaving aside the moral question of whether a satellite imagery company should be profiting off the Ukrainian war, Ukraine appears to be using commercial orbital imagery providers to figure out Russian troop movements. That use case is not one any commercial provider anywhere is going to build an ML model for. But analysts working on behalf of Ukraine can absolutely either use raw pixels or develop their own ML algorithms that run on top of the raw pixels to find Russian tanks.And almost every other potential user is similar. They&#39;re all looking for something different. Oil companies want to pre-screen drilling locations. NGOs want to look at deforestation in Brazil or methane leaks in Saudi Arabia. You could even go all the way down to individuals -- at the right price, individual farms might want to look at relative growth rates of corn in their fields, or soil moisture levels, etc. Or they might want to count heads of cattle or sheep, or... or... or.The point being, outside of weather, which we already know how to get to end users without having them subscribe to an orbital imagery provider service, every customer is different, and what they want from the pixels is different. It&#39;s basically the long-tail problem. In order to be profitable you have to fill an enormous number of niche use cases."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Allow me to put it more succinctly: selling derived data as a subscription product does. not. work. I don’t care what it is. The juice is never worth the squeeze.¹ Count cars. Count airplanes. Count ships. Segment land cover. Track oil inventories. Estimate biofuels. Measure water levels. Etc. Etc. Etc.I see that he outlined a few exceptions at the footnote… I&#39;ll also add Plaid. I think this guy is making some huge generalizations that don&#39;t hold up beyond his industry.But that said, I recently downgraded two potential startups based on data feeds to personal projects because I realized that nobody really pays for data, and if there is any value then the providers will figure that out inevitably…Another recent example: I&#39;ve been using Deliveries for Mac and iOS for over fifteen years, a very simple, perfectly-designed, laser focused app. Both Amazon (not surprising) and Fed Ex (quite surprising) have decided that freely providing delivery dates to consumers is too valuable to leave to third parties, so the beloved app is shuttering sometime this year.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I was an agronomist I used satellite imagery a lot for monitoring farm crops for our customers.  Started in the early eighties going up in a Cessna laying on my belly where the passenger seat was sticking a 35mm camera out a repair port.But that got old and started researching satellite options.  Problems was our company entire sales area was three West Michigan counties.  All the companies wanted to sell me, I forget the term but say a tract (scene?), that was half the state.I didn&#39;t have a problem with the price per acre but wanted to buy by the section or 640 acres.  It didn&#39;t make a lot of sense to buy the township but they wouldn&#39;t even sell me by the county.  At the time probably 5% of my customers wanted this service and only wanted to buy just part of their acreage.I asked all these vendors why they couldn&#39;t sell me by the township.  They routinely answered they&#39;d lose money because they couldn&#39;t sell the rest of the tract.  I said now you understand my problem, at a certain point you&#39;ve got to break up a tract or give up on the market.  Most of the company&#39;s ended up leaving ag.I eventually found a company that would sell by the section at a higher but still manageable price.  Course then I discovered that in four flyovers a season the majority had clouds over the field and you couldn&#39;t see anything ;&lt;(.  Such is the pain of being an early user in any field.FYI The military has satellites using radar to see through the clouds, but in thirty years that tech hasn&#39;t made it to the commercial operators.The answer I think is automated drones that fly a circuit.  The tech has been available for a few years but the government won&#39;t approve it for that use.  In fact the FAA won&#39;t even let a Detroit company demonstrate they could successfully evade objects, they ran out of funding and shut their doors ;&lt;(."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting, the separate compute and storage tiers is another system going that direction which I think is becoming almost the standard at this point, especially for &#34;cloud-native&#34; things designed to run on k8s. From what I can tell (it isn&#39;t very explicit on this point) they are avoiding a distributed consensus at the storage layer and instead relying on a single writer/multiple reader model with the single writer being enforced by assignment of the tablets in the compute tier, with the tablet being responsible for writing to multiple storage nodes for durability? (But I might be wrong)Assuming yes this approach, I think, is under utilized and is pretty similar to how Apache Pulsar works (my day job),but I am not sure how many distributed RDBMS have tried it out, will be cool to see how it evolves! It isn&#39;t clear how they ensure the assignment of a tablet to only a single compute node, but I think that is an easier problem relative to distributed consensus at the storage tier."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Seems random developers were targeted as well as European Parliament members (and more):&gt; Jordi Baylina is the technology lead at Polygon, a popular decentralised Ethereum scaling platform. He is also an advisor on projects related to digital voting and decentralisation, and has built a widely-used privacy toolkit. He was extensively targeted with Pegasus, receiving at least 26 infection attempts. Ultimately, he was infected at least eight times between October 2019 and July 2020.&gt; Baylina received a text message masquerading as a boarding pass link for a Swiss International Air Lines flight he had purchased. Targeting in this case indicates that the Pegasus operator may have had access to Baylina’s Passenger Name Record (PNR) or other information collected from the carrier.Scare stuff that not just random text messages can infect you (we knew this) but combined with harvesting other data (like PNR), they can time to exploit messages with other actions you do (like buying an flight ticket) and get you that way.I was scared of receiving random text messages already, but easy to just ignore them as they have nothing to do with me. But if I buy a flight ticket and receive a text message that looks relevant to me, I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d be able to guess it was actually malicious. Scary stuff.Edit: The more I read, the worse it gets:&gt; Another common mode of targeting was to masquerade as official notifications from Spanish government entities, including the Tax and Social Security authorities.The messages also used SMS Sender IDs to masquerade as official agency accounts.&gt; Notably, fake official messages were sometimes highly personalized. For example, a message sent to Jordi Baylina included a portion of his actual official tax identification number, suggesting that the Pegasus operator had access to this information.Seems clear at this point that the official Spanish government was behind these attacks, or the official registries got hacked (together with various delivery companies). Both are bad, but that signs are pointing to the earlier makes it even worse.It seems that the Spanish government can&#39;t help itself to give more fuel to the fire that is the fight for Catalan independence. Who&#39;d want to belong to a state that constantly suppresses and surveillance you?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"CEOs, executives, members of parliaments, journalists, researchers at industrial labs, those working in defense/military, etc are at elevated risk of being hacked by governments and hacking companies such as NSO.I wonder how these people protect their digital assets?
Are there guidelines?For example, if I am Microsoft CEO, would it be okay if I use the closed source iPhone from a competing company? Or perhaps these people use special hardened devices?Because even Apple CEO uses iPhone, and Pegasus apparently could hack any iPhone with zero click. So what prevents acquisition of highly valuable inside information by NSO or its customers (sensitive data about the company, iOS source code, implanting malware by infecting Apple engineers for the next exploit, etc)?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;On LinkedIn, our members trust us with their information, which is why we prohibit unauthorized scraping on our platform.&#34;This is an unpersuasive argument because it ignores all the computer users who are not &#34;members&#34;.  Whether or not &#34;members&#34; trust LinkedIn should have no bearning on whether other computer users who may or may not be &#34;members&#34; can retrieve others&#39; public information.Even more, this statement does not decry so-called scraping only &#34;unauthorised&#34; scraping.  Who provides &#34;authorisation&#34;.  Surely not the LinkedIn members.It is presumptuous if not ridiculous for &#34;tech&#34; companies to claim computer users &#34;trust&#34; them.   Most of these companies recieve no feedback from the majority of their &#34;members&#34;.  Tech companies generally have no &#34;customer service&#34; for the members they target with data collection.Further, there is an absence of meaningful choice.  It is like saying people &#34;trust&#34; credit bureaus with their information.  History shows these data collection intermediaries could not be trusted and that is why Americans have the Fair Credit Reporting Act."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Web scraping is legal&#34; seems to be an overbroad interpretation - the Ninth Circuit is merely reaffirming a preliminary injunction in light of a recent and separate ruling by the Supreme Court.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"While I have sympathy for what the scrapers are trying to do in many cases, it bothers me that this doesn&#39;t seem to address what happens when badly-behaved scrapers cause, in effect, a DOS on the site.For the family of sites I&#39;m responsible for, bot traffic comprises a majority of traffic - that is, to a first approximation, the lion&#39;s share of our operational costs are from needing to scale to handle the huge amount of bot traffic. Even when it&#39;s not as big as a DOS, it doesn&#39;t seem right to me that I can&#39;t tell people they&#39;re not welcome to cause this additional system load.Or even if there was some standardized way that we could provide a dumb API, just giving them raw data so we don&#39;t need to incur the additional expense of the processing for creature comforts on the page designed to make our users happier but the bots won&#39;t notice."</p>

I saw the exact same one pop up at least 2-3 times.The one that really aggravated me though was the one at the end: after you FILE your taxes, they present this damned progress-bar looking thing as if you are somehow “not done” yet, as if this totally optional product sale is a required step!!  No, no, no, that is just misleading garbage, and it is so annoying to have to constantly hunt around the page for the magic text to get around these things.  I mean, I couldn’t even reach the page that lets me download my forms as PDF until I skipped this upsell.What’s more, the product itself is getting more expensive but worse.  On desktop, the whole thing is just a blown-up mobile UI (are that many people doing taxes on their phones!?) with all kinds of things unnecessarily hidden.  On page after page, there is more than enough space to show everything but instead it’s giant white space everywhere; they HIDE things behind disclosure arrows, and with no logic whatsoever; e.g. on one page it shows the 2020 numbers by default but hides all the 2021 numbers behind arrows!?Guess what isn’t an insultingly-small, truncated experience on desktop?  The ads, the upsells.  THOSE are full-page, taking full advantage of screen space and even scrolling off the edges.Really shows their priorities."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve done my taxes on Turbotax for a few years, and didn&#39;t even check alternate options because I had the perception they were clunky.I&#39;ve tried for the first time FreeTaxUSA to prepare my mother&#39;s tax return. Guess what? It&#39;s even better than Turbotax in some aspects(the UI is similar, but doesn&#39;t waste your time with animations), and way cheaper. It only charges you to file state but, if you come from the Free File IRS website (and are under the income requirements), it doesn&#39;t even charge you that. There&#39;s one upsell for their tax consultants or whatever, but it&#39;s only done once.It does not automatically import W2s though, but that saves you maybe 5 minutes per W2. Not sure about stock transactions import either, it seems they can&#39;t import from brokers. I will have to check next year. They do seem to have spreadsheet import, so maybe that&#39;s something we (as in, HN community) could fix until they have the feature.The competition seems to have improved as well, although I don&#39;t have first hand knowledge (but watched some youtube reviews where they walk through the filing with every software).It&#39;s time we ditch Intuit. If we can&#39;t have free IRS software, then we should at least bleed Intuit dry.EDIT: it&#39;s particularly egregious that Intuit came up with the Free File program as a compromise so that IRS wouldn&#39;t have their own tax software, only to leave the program."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In Spain I log onto the tax agency website using my digital certificate. It tells me what I have been paid during the year, what I own, how big my mortgage is, etc. If I agree I click a button and pay whatever I owe. If I don&#39;t agree, or some info is missing, I add it in and then click the button.It&#39;s astronomically easier than filing the same tax information in the US and takes far less time even though the tax code is less clearly written and user support is almost totally nonexistent.The nonexistence of a national ID system makes digital identification unnecessarily difficult. The idea that an individual has to redeclare to the IRS what has already been declared to the IRS on W2s and 1099s is just stupid.The US tax filing system is simply primitive."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Over the years, I have become convinced that much of the observed age-correlated cognitive decline in people younger than ~70 results from voluntary life choices, such as settling into fixed behavioural patterns (e.g. doing the same thing over and over for decades) and lack of exposure to new stimuli.It&#39;s the case for some physical activities as well: almost all people&#39;s actual performance degrades way, way faster, than their potential peak performance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m 53 and recently embarked on a complex self-guided mini-medical education to try to understand my son&#39;s rare condition.I&#39;ve pushed my way through a 400 page nursing textbook, dozens of scientific papers and a 900 page freshman neuroscience textbook (currently at page 90).I never took any bioscience class after high school software chem.There have been ups and downs. Mentally comparing myself to when I was in school and reading comparable material, I feel my ability to master it was at or above that - at its best. However the amount of time I spend &#34;at my best&#34; in general is MUCH lower than when I was that age.Today I have trouble sleeping many nights. An old hip injury and also anxiety.A night I don&#39;t sleep well is definitely not going to be followed by a day where I gain understanding of neuronal membrane chemistry.Didn&#39;t have those issues when I was 17 - any time was study time.So I guess this goes along with the thesis of the story. Mental powers are there, but other body systems aren&#39;t able to support the brain&#39;s demands at quite the same level."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"AbstractResponse speeds in simple decision-making tasks begin to decline from early and middle adulthood.However, response times are not pure measures of mental speed but instead represent the sum of multiple processes.Here we apply a Bayesian diffusion model to extract interpretable cognitive components from raw response time data. We apply our model to cross-sectional data from 1.2 million participants to examine age differences in cognitive parameters.To efficiently parse this large dataset, we apply a Bayesian inference method for efficient parameter estimation using specialized neural networks.Our results indicate that response time slowing begins as early as age 20, but this slowing was attributable to increases in decision caution and to slower non-decisional processes, rather than to differences in mental speed.Slowing of mental speed was observed only after approximately age 60.Our research thus challenges widespread beliefs about the relationship between age and mental speed."</p>

Having a discussion with someone that has additional information external to the narrative seems to be in short supply and stands out, probably more than it should.I&#39;m curious if anyone else on HN has experienced similar and/or can provide some further insight to this phenomena.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From reading the other comments here, I understand that it&#39;s easy to pick something RMS said and say &#34;Yeah, right...&#34;But you have to keep in mind that RMS advocates the free software philosophy - the complete left end of the software spectrum - the white angel on your shoulder (not the red devil on the other).And while I find some of his points too radical to implement practically in my own situation, I believe it&#39;s very important that we have someone like him in the tech world. As a result, whenever there is a RMS talk, I listen to it. And each time I gain new and valuable perspectives about free software that help guide future decisions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Now, more free games? It doesn&#39;t satisfy an urgent practical need, obviously... But the crucial thing is, free ones might make it easier for some people to say, &#39;Let&#39;s move off this non-free thing, and play a game that is free. So we can have the same pleasure, but without paying freedom as the price.&#39;“i&#39;m sorry but i just can&#39;t read this without laughing. what does stallman think gamers are like?i can only imagine the average teenage gamer trying to get their friends to stop playing virtually every game on the market and instead play some obscure game and trying to teach them how to install gcc and git to get it running"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Around the 8 and 9 min mark RMS talks about old hardware losing software support, like 32 bit systems. I am a kernel developer and the kernel removes code for a lot of older systems all the time (often lesser known 32bit ARM systems).Phoronix reported that 5.18 removed the Andes NDS32 CPU arch code. https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;item=linux-51...The reason they do this is because a lot of these systems can break as the internal kAPIs change all the time and the users will not know since the embedded custom distro of software + kernel is not upgraded. Support can be broken for these arches for years until someone gets these systems second hand and posts about them, but may not care to fix it or it is cheaper to replace it.RMS calls this a major issue, specifically 32-bit support in Ubuntu. I do not agree. My last 32 bit computer died a long time ago after the battery died years ago. It was a Gateway so getting replacement parts would be difficult. I also was never able to get it to run Linux. Aside from my brother-in-law finding his old laptop no one I know uses 32 bit computers (well except for myself with my Pi Zero: ARM v6, which I used once).It just feels like the wrong battle to pick when Linux&#39;s biggest competitor is forcing practically all PCs to use a bootloader signed with their key. Major vendors can choose to refuse to allow users to install their own key. They are already locking CPUs (Ryzens) to their brand of motherboards with a builtin fuse provided by AMD. He of course talks about it-it just feels like the 32 bit part distracts from it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not to tone police that much but I really don&#39;t get people like Casey. Like his whole thing is spending a billion years writing his game engine, and then whining about all these &#34;bloated&#34; tools. Just completely dismissive of everything that doesn&#39;t align directly with his values (which don&#39;t include actually shipping game!)I like people who write their own engines and make bespoke things for fun. Just really dislike people who lack the imagination to wonder why some people just want to make games rather than spend their life writing engine code, and actively shitting on stuff that exists. Just so much negative energy to put out in the world.Of course in practice Unity _is_ a major pain in the butt but UE has the nice aspect of actually working for very large projects and shipping stuff. Yeah there&#39;s obtuse stuff, but in practice what happens is you join a team and then you actually learn to use it. In exchange you have releases.The one thing that really is rough for me with _both_ UE and Unity is that they&#39;re both very oriented towards teams with dedicated art people who can put out assets to use. BSP-based workflows where you can quickly greybox out levels to playtest (basically giving level designers without art sense a fighting chance) are much nicer with older engines.There&#39;s a nice missing middle that Valve kinda fills with Source, except everyone that has worked with Source seems to dislike it for other reasons. But I&#39;m sure we could make 3D engines with nicer usability for people who, for lack of a better word, can&#39;t 3D model too great."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a software developer I&#39;ve worked with Unity and Unreal in a professional capacity for many years, and shipped quite a few games on both engines. Unreal is powerful, but really shows its game development studio and FPS game roots. Unity has limitations, I won&#39;t deny that. And both engines have their own issues and different frustrations in using and deploying them. I have also shipped games on internal, custom built engines too. From a business perspective, hiring Unity developers, i.e. people who can code in C#, is a lot easier. Unreal developers are plentiful, but their knowledge of the guts of Unreal usually stops at the surface level, barely dipping below Blueprints, at least from my experience.Personally, I prefer Unity over Unreal, but am not averse to using either, in the right context."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In this critique of unity they say that the back half of making a game is the half of suffering. In my experience, it highlights something else that is a massive problem in the game dev space. The game dev community is stuck in software practices of 2005, leading to naive implementation patterns.As a hobbyist game developer of ~1year, one thing that struck me was how I have not found many good sources of teaching that explains how to make a maintainable game. How does one make a code base for a video game that has desirable the non-functional qualities like maintainability? That question doesn&#39;t really have an answer...I think it doesn&#39;t have an answer because those teaching game development haven&#39;t really asked. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s due to many factors.For anecdotal, I&#39;ve asked about testing and CI/CD for unity in online spaces. There isn&#39;t much content on these critical subjects in the video game education space. I usually get a mix of responses but one that stuck out to me is that video games aren&#39;t appropriate for tests and it just slows down game creation.I think that thought process more than anything is what leads to back half issues. I think that the video game industry has lagged behind the rest of the software industry and there is a huge opportunity for disruption.In 5-10 years people should think it&#39;s absolutely outlandish to start a complex software project such as a video game project without a CI/CD engine running a suite of sensible tests. I think today that is true for most software projects, although as a community were still wrapping our heads around &#34;what is a good test?&#34;My 2cents"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My key takeaways:1. Uber is actually a higher cost/less efficient producer of urban car services than the taxi companies it has driven out of business2. Individual Uber drivers with limited capital cannot acquire, finance, maintain and insure vehicles more economically than Yellow Cab3. Expenses other than drivers, vehicles, and fuel account for 15 percent of traditional taxi costs but Uber charges drivers 25-30 percent without coming close to covering their actual costs4. Uber’s surge pricing does not improve efficiency, it simply prices those night shift workers out of the market5. And as Uber has demonstrated, unlimited taxi market entry can lead to ruinous overcapacity and can allow part-timers to cherry-pick the peak revenue that full-time drivers depend on to cover their costs6. Uber’s investors knew that it needed raw political power to accelerate growth, and to maintain its hoped-for dominance7. Uber’s major strategic breakthrough was to treat business development as an entirely political process, using techniques that had proven successful in partisan political settings8. All of Uber’s early popularity and rapid revenue and valuation growth are explained by the billions in predatory investor subsidies needed to drive those more efficient (but poorly capitalized) incumbents into bankruptcy9. That [early popularity] allowed [Uber] to pursue more stratospheric valuations by exploiting anticompetitive market power and rent-extraction and buying out any potential competitive threats"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel this entire thread has quite missed the point of the question
the way a neutrino passes through a solid object and interacts with
nothing but empty space.People have talked about microeconomics, gig economies, labour
shifting, bad old days, safety, subsidies, licenses.... but we&#39;ve
gotten no closer to understanding;&#34;Why Is a Company That Lost Billions Claimed to Be Successful?&#34;To answer this one must ask &#34;What is financialisation?&#34; The short
answer is; a system in which the success or failure of a company is of
no relevance to its &#34;value&#34;. Under financialised logic it is
absolutely immaterial whether Twitter, Uber or whatever make a
penny. Ever. Or whether any of the stakeholders are served. The rules
of traditional business go out the window. All that matters is the
stock price of a tradable financial entity (a company) based on brand
confidence/perception.Under that system, Uber is successful so long as the financial market
says it is. When it decides it&#39;s not successful, it&#39;s not. One has to
realise that a total detachment of political economics and power has
