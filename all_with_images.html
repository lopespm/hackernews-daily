								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hello hello, PM for the feature checking in here. amf12&#39;s reply is quite on-point. Web and App Activity is designed to store search activity across all Google services, and we&#39;re splitting Workspace data out since it&#39;s governed by strict data handling guarantees, with the hope that more people will feel comfortable getting the benefits of better search in Workspace without having to opt-into search history being tracked for all Google services.Search history can be immensely useful for our users, since a lot of them re-run prior searches or want search experiences built on top of prior ones. Today, for the Workspace paid offering admins who choose to disable the somewhat confusingly named Web and App Activity admin console control, users in the domain have no ability to get relevant and historical search suggestions in Drive or Gmail that can help them save time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Note: this seems to be about their paid &#34;Workspaces&#34; offering. I have a private paid domain email on Google Workspaces. I received their email and checked out their FAQs to see how it would affect me in terms of privacy.Workspaces data is inherently said to be private under contract and not used for advertising or other Google purposes. Here are relevant snippets from their new FAQ:- &#34;Google never uses your data in Google Workspace core services for advertising.&#34;- &#34;Google Workspace search history includes search activity in Google Workspace services such as Gmail and Drive and is subject to the data protections that Google Workspace provides for users’ data.&#34;Seems to me that other non-core services are not covered by it, which may be the reason for this split?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What crazy to me is how hard to parse the email was. I could hardly make heads or tails of it, and I&#39;m no dummy. It almost seemed intentional, and now it makes sense.Even manually setting this feature once you understand it I can&#39;t do either!So first you might land here:https://support.google.com/a/answer/11194328#zippy=%2Chow-do...Then the instructions say:&gt; You can enable or disable Google Workspace search history:&gt;   * Go to the My Activity page.&gt;   * Click Other Google activity and then Google Workspace search history.&gt;   * Click On or Off.But this is wrong! When you follow the link the &#34;Google workspace search history&#34; is hidden in a hamburger menu in the top left. You have to click that to open the menu, THEN you can click on &#34;Other Google Activity&#34;. But on THAT page there is no setting called &#34;Google Workspace Search History&#34;.  Just the old &#34;Web &amp; App Activity&#34;So what, I have to set a reminder for after 3/29/22 to come back to this screen? Madness!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I sometimes read these and wonder if I need to retrain. At my age, I’ll struggle to get a job at a similar level in a new industry.And then I remember that the thing I bring to the table is the ability to turn domain knowledge into code.Being able to do competitive coding challenges is impressive, but a very large segment of software engineering is about eliciting what the squishy humans in management actually want, putting it into code, and discovering as quickly as possible that it’s not what they really wanted after all.It’s going to take a sufficiently long time for AI to take over management that I don’t think oldies like me need to worry too much."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It never ceases to amaze me what you can do with these transformer models. They created millions of potential solutions for each problem, used the provided examples for the problems to filter out 99% of incorrect solutions and then applied some more heuristics and the 10 available submissions to try to find a solution.All these approaches just seem like brute-force approaches: Let&#39;s just throw our transformer on this problem and see if we can get anything useful out of this.Whatever it is, you can&#39;t deny that these unsupervised models learn some semantic representations, but we have no clue at all what that actually is and how these model learn that. But I&#39;m also very sceptical that you can actually get anywhere close to human (expert) capability in any sufficiently complex domain by using this approach."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is extremely impressive, but I do think it’s worth noting that these two things were provided:- a very well defined problem.  (One of the things I like about competitive programming and the like is just getting to implement a clearly articulated problem, not something I experience on most days.)
- existing test data.This is definitely a great accomplishment, but I think those two features of competitive programming are notably different than my experience of daily programming.  I don’t mean to suggest these will always be limitations of this kind of technology, though."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Underlying study is here. [1] Full disclosure, I co-wrote the piece for The Daily Beast [2] that originally suggested that Tesla&#39;s methodology was seriously flawed. I am not a Tesla-hater though — I just thought it was odd that the company was playing quite so fast and loose with their safety claims.1: https://engrxiv.org/preprint/view/1973/39862: https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-tesla-and-elon-musk-exagge..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have felt since day 1 that &#34;autopilot is better than the average driver!&#34; is the most misleading fact/statistic in the industry.The &#34;average driver&#34; involved in an accident includes drunk drivers, road ragers, habitual speeders, teenagers, people driving in bad conditions (rain, snow), people driving without sleep and several other risky groups that most people buying Teslas aren&#39;t part of. To be worth it, the car has to reduce my personal accident risk under the conditions I usually drive, otherwise I prefer to keep my own hands behind the wheel over handing over control to an algorithm."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, adjusted for driver age the difference vanishes.That&#39;s quite an interesting observation, and it shows the importance of proper statistics. It also raises questions about companies producing their own stats, it&#39;s often only when someone takes the time to dig into it that we discover this kind of thing.I am not holding my breath waiting for the common consumer to understand statistical critical thinking though. I sometimes catch myself forgetting the due diligence even after many years of forcing myself to think about stats.Perhaps some sort of ombudsman could do this, pointing out when stats are lying to people."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This headline and article is a gross misrepresentation of the ruling. The ruling is that the TCF consent string contains personal data and that the IAB is the data controller for this bit of data. This ruling has no impact what so ever on consent popups. It basically &#34;just&#34; trashes the industry standard that is used to pass consent signals. There are plenty of custom or non TCF implementations (all equally awful) of consent dialogs.This ruling puts Google and FB in a much more powerful position - because they do not have to rely on standards like TCF to pass consent signals.Instead of going after publishers and website owners who integrate these popups in the first place - they went after the inventor of the spec."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It was obvious to anyone technical they didn&#39;t work as they presented themselves to work, but it takes time for the courts to deal with such things.They are also totally annoying and I suspect there primary purpose was to annoy users and not actually comply with the GDPR.  It was a way for these companies to fight the GDPR with a war of attrition.  I&#39;m glad you see with this round hasn&#39;t worked... Yet.I suspect that based on this ruling, things will not get better, as in providing a less annoying user experience and more compliance with the GDPR.  Instead I predict another round of pseudo compliance and a more annoying user experience.  Eventually they&#39;ll start a policy campaign in earnest stating that the GDPR is unworkable."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is from Mark Zuckerberg&#39;s post. I think it&#39;s a decent explanation of their performance. Historically Facebook always made these longer-term bets and they&#39;ve typically paid off.&#34;Before I get to that, I want to briefly touch on our Q4 results, which I know Sheryl and Dave are going to go deeper on. I&#39;m proud of the work our teams did here. We shipped products, our community continued to grow, and businesses of all sizes turned to us to help them reach people. But there are two things that I want to call out that are having an impact on our business.The first is competition. People have a lot of choices for how they want to spend their time and apps like TikTok are growing very quickly. And this is why our focus on Reels is so important over the long-term. As is our work to make sure our apps are the best services out there for young adults, which I spoke about on our last call.The second area, and related to this, is that we&#39;re in the middle of a transition on our own services towards short-form video like Reels. So as more activity shifts towards this medium, we&#39;re replacing some time in News Feed and other higher monetizing surfaces. So as a result of both competition and this shift to short-form video as well as our focus on serving young adults over optimizing overall engagement, we&#39;re going to continue to see pressure on impression growth in the near term. Now I&#39;m confident that leaning harder into these trends is the right short-term tradeoff to make in order to get long-term gains. We&#39;ve made these types of transitions before with mobile feed and Stories, where we took on headwinds in the near-term to align with important trends over the long term. And while video has historically been slower to monetize, we believe that over time short-form video is going to monetize more like feed or Stories than like Watch – so I&#39;m optimistic that we&#39;ll get to where we need to be with Reels too.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Facebook’s core business model appears to be in decline. They don’t have a very diversified revenue stream despite trying various side businesses. This is the market worried that Facebook’s best days are behind it.Facebook is betting the farm on the metaverse stuff but without meaningful financial results that’s not going to placate market concerns over what looks like a downhill future for the core businesses. Facebook’s less than fantastic record at making money on its other businesses doesn’t have the market terribly optimistic about about the future prospects metaverse stuff either. Net net stock down 20%."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I would have advised him to stay quiet about this. Not out of fear of the North Koreans, but out of fear of our own security agencies seeing the activity as interfering in international relations. Also the vagueness of our hacking laws probably make what he did a crime.But I also am immensely proud that we have people willing to take things into their own hands when needed.Also, I feel like the 2nd amendment should be interpreted to include the right to bear digital arms (strong encryption for a start). This will probably take another decade to figure out what that would really mean."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I see comments saying that he may be interfering with actual operations against NK or that now that he has done this they are more likely to patch their systems and be more secure, contradicting his own intentions.It&#39;s also entirely possible that this action, including the WIRED article and it&#39;s high visibility, is part of a broader effort and strategy.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It seems like many journalists are failing in their primary responsibilities to keep the public informed. Fact checking liars or misleading statements is tedious, and some politicians lie or mislead.Journalists should be doing investigations and creating reports that put social and political issues in context. Yet so often these issues, real issues that affect lives, are treated as political theater or a public sport.I can&#39;t blame journalists for the politicians lying or misleading, but I can blame them for so often going for the easy stories that they are fed, instead of the hard ones they have to look for or put together.As a result, when I read the news I pay special attention to stories that are based on original investigations, public records requests, whistleblowers, or stories in which actual context is provided from multiple viewpoints that are informed by the facts, rather than merely by self interest."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This conversation isn&#39;t formal enough to be meaningful.If you want to talk meaningfully about how &#34;facts&#34; are used, you need to be able to invoke any notion at all of propositions and implications. It doesn&#39;t matter if your implications are mathematical in nature or scientific in nature or just correlation, facts exist in the structure imposed by implication. And facts without an implication structure are useless.In order to mislead with a &#34;true&#34; fact A, it needs to already be the case that there is a false fact of the form A implies B already sitting in there. The combination of a belief in A implies B (false) with this newly introduced belief A (true) yields a belief in B (false).The essence of &#34;lying by telling the truth&#34; is then just finding these false implications, and exploiting them.Fortunately, It&#39;s much easier to fact check implications. If A implies B is false, then you just need to come up with an example of A and not B.Unfortunately changes to belief do not always propagate reliably, and the combinatorial game is against the implication checkers. For any given true fact A there are as many potential false beliefs of the form A implies B as there are propositions B.Fortunately, most humans make do with as few (quantified) implications as they can. Rules are hard to remember. Getting rid of false implications is much easier when you can replace them with &#34;true&#34; implications.I suppose I am arguing then that the solution to all of this is education that doesn&#39;t teach facts, but rather implications (which are themselves just higher order facts)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From that article:Our task is to create new processes for determining what counts as a shared, socially meaningful, mutually understood “truth.” Obviously, this requires more than making sure that every fact is checked.It&#39;s recognizing with double quotes &#34;truth&#34; as a different thing than Truth. Hence it&#39;s a confession that their task is to &#34;create a new process for determining what counts as &#39;truth&#39;&#34; and not genuine fidelity to reality. This means that the process they claim to desire will have, by design, the backdoor of the shared illusion effect. In other words they want to be marketeers of a shared feeling of truth. That&#39;s not science, not professional journalism, that&#39;s Propaganda. They accuse people of using facts to manipulate the public imaginary and they propose to solve that problem by becoming that people themselves imposing their own manipulation of facts.Here is an idea: You can have your own opinions but you can&#39;t have your own facts. Let reality show you Truth regardless of how that makes you feel and restrain yourself from wanting to impose worldviews on anybody. Nature is infinitely wiser than you (and all of us)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As I have also been frustrated with the direction Postman has taken, I have a great alternative to suggest, if the only thing you want to do is fire requests on demand easily and do not need automated testing.The VS Code Rest Client extension https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.re... is great for testing and debugging APIs.You create a &#34;my_request.http&#34; file that contains something like  POST https://example.com/comments HTTP/1.1
  content-type: application/json

  {
    &#34;name&#34;: &#34;sample&#34;,
    &#34;time&#34;: &#34;Wed, 21 Oct 2015 18:27:50 GMT&#34;
  }

First line is the method and url, then headers, then a newline, then the request body.Hit ctrl+alt+p, the request is sent and you see the response in a side pane. Everything is encoded and decoded properly.You can organize your tests under multiple files and folders.I cannot recommend this extension enough, it has made my life so much easier."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Postman founder here. Thank you HN community for highlighting this feature. We have been seeing gRPC usage exploding especially in microservices driven architectures and we are looking forward to the feedback we get on the feature.A few other observations on comments that I read through:1. Postman leans towards adding UI affordances instead of hiding them. This can irritate experienced developers at times who already know the complexities of HTTP or other protocols but that is really how new developers find their way around. So while it is attractive to have 1000 options hidden behind a command line interface, nobody uses 995 of those features. We are getting better at building experiences for both experienced and new developers. Also, I don’t believe reading man pages of git or curl is a better experience.2. Performance is a huge area for improvement. More to come in subsequent releases this year.3. Our roadmap is community driven: https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-app-support/issues. Raising more investment helps us do more. We have built a business model around doing the maximum for every developer on the planet while also providing value to companies so we can charge for it and continue development. I find it fair that companies spend hundreds of millions of dollars on salaries can pay some money for improving their productivity by spending in developer tools.4. API Development is a huge and growing area and developers are spending more and more time working with APIs rather than their IDEs. API Design, documentation, and testing are areas that a large number of developers tell us they wish they had better tooling for. Most of their time is spend pointlessly in trying to figure out how an API works (in some cases whether an API even exists). We decided to take Postman in those areas even though paradoxically it might lead to “less” Postman usage. (The faster people figure out an API the fewer number of calls they have to send)5. Finally, it is good to see here a call for fewer features which we insist internally as well. Unfortunately at some point some part of the community is upset that we are NOT adding features (just see the gRPC thread on our issue tracker!). We don’t see issues to remove features as much as we have requests to fulfill. We do remove features consciously but it is a hard problem, so we default to adding them slowly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Postman is so incredibly bloated and slow these days. All I want is a REST client, but it feels like every time I want to perform a basic task now, I have to dig past all of their confusing platform and cloud stuff that I have no interest in."</p>

Are they supported too now?I&#39;m not a web developer so I had a very hard time understanding why there are so many different type of imports in JavaScript like require, import, umd, amd, etc and which one works in browser and which one works in node?Also why do so many libraries have this strange 5 line header code for this umd, amd, business. Is that to make their packages work with nodejs?Does anyone who knows enough JavaScript point me in the right direction about it. I find all this very confusing."</p>

This position will need to exceed all 3 by at least 20% before I even consider it.  Does that sound doable?

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Based on this image:https://images.ctfassets.net/95kuvdv8zn1v/6h1C7lPC79OLOlddEE...They and their VC backers are clearly betting on the concept that radars + lidar + imaging will be the ultimate successful solution in full self driving cars, as a completely opposite design and engineering philosophy from Tesla attempting to do &#34;full self driving&#34; with camera sensors and categorical rejection of lidar.It is interesting to me that right now this is sitting on the HN homepage directly adjacent to: &#34;Tesla to recall vehicles that may disobey stop signs (reuters.com)&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Disappointing the amount of ragging people are doing towards Tesla here, Tesla is far ahead and I can&#39;t believe people are falling for this promotional video and assuming they are farther ahead.Tesla&#39;s vehicles are in the consumers hands and have many many thousands of drivers using their system every day. Also the VERY first comment here mentions a misleading article &#34;Tesla to recall vehicles&#34;. This is misleading since Tesla probably didn&#39;t recall even a single vehicle, they probably all got an over the air update within a couple days of the problem being spotted. When a problem comes up Tesla is quick to send out an update and the news loves to write misleading articles every damn time because bad news about Tesla sells, there are so many wrong articles out there it&#39;s insane.So disappointing that even the people I assumed would be smarter (Hacker News), are falling for this shit. Also this debate of cameras vs lidar is so old and outdated because LIDAR IS NOT GOD DAMN MAGICAL it has it&#39;s problems too. Tesla has also dropped radar because they don&#39;t see it being beneficial enough.In reality talking about lidar vs cameras is not too important especially in the long ron, how far the tech is underneath is the most important thing currently and over time the amount of compute power you have in each car will be the most important factor."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m concerned about the timing  of this.  Former CEO Dan Ammann, fired in December, was a big champion of the robotaxi business model.  It is speculated he was fired because GM CEO Mary Barra disagrees with this strategy and wants them to focus more on integration with existing GM vehicles.I am afraid that the robotaxi timeline was pulled in so that the rest of the believers inside Cruise can get supporting data to prove it’s a viable model and to make it harder for Mary to change its course.  This may come at the expense of safety."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Refusing service when the user does not consent to non-essential data sharing is illegal in the EU, and it also breaches Google Play&#39;s developer agreement. WiFi scanning is not essential to navigate with an app, and the least they could do to follow the law is to gracefully degrade the service if the user does not consent to share data about nearby devices, such as disabling traffic predictions.Of course Google&#39;s lawyers will argue that this data is in fact required for navigation, the same way some banks in the EU now claim &#34;legitimate interest&#34; when they send you a message about their credit card promotions with winnable prizes, after you&#39;ve explicitly opted out from all marketing communications."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not related to Google maps, but just today I got tired of the Amazon app sending me &#34;you might like this deal&#34; notifications and dug into whether it&#39;s possible to disable them.You can, but if you do, Amazon will no longer send Amazon &#34;Smile&#34; micro-donations to whatever charity you&#39;ve selected: https://i.imgur.com/wNAkUAT.jpeg .I can&#39;t say that this is underhanded, but it does cast into sharp relief the fact that Amazon is a $1.5 trillion dollar company that generates upwards of $3B in yearly profit, and they&#39;re jerking you around, dangling the pennies they would otherwise send to a charity, unless you let them feed you product recommendations in OS notifications.  (If you just disallow the entire Amazon app from sending notifications, as far as I can tell they still give the charity whatever 0.5% cut.)So I have to choose between 1) allowing them to send me product recommendations, 2) a poor UX because I don&#39;t get any notifications at all, or 3) just not sending the charity any of the scraps of my Amazon transactions.  I chose 3 and cut the charity a larger check than usual."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While I&#39;m not sure if this change to Google Maps has been or will be widely rolled out, you may want to look into what GrapheneOS is working on with their Google Play compatibility layer [1]. It basically lets people use Google&#39;s services inside Android&#39;s standard app sandbox. That means they don&#39;t get access to privileged system APIs and can only access what the user chooses. It can also be used without a Google account.GrapheneOS is working on a way to redirect the Play services location APIs to an open source implementation of those APIs which uses standard Android location APIs [2]. 
It&#39;s expected to be available in an upcoming release [3].[1] https://grapheneos.org/usage#sandboxed-google-play[2] https://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/Loc...[3] https://twitter.com/GrapheneOS/status/1486182874567122945"</p>

A given riddim, if popular, may be used in dozens—or even hundreds—of songs, not only in recordings but also in live performances.&#34;The actual riddim sounds completely uninteresting to my American ears.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Love my Framework. Barring Apple&#39;s recent move away from the touchbar it&#39;s honestly the first machine I&#39;ve been excited about in 6 or so years. The build quality is great, love the simplicity and design of the expansion ports, and the repair/upgrade-ability is huge. It&#39;s gotten me back into using Linux as a daily driver.I really hope they stay true to their vision and that this means expanding it into other consumer product lines."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; We’re not ready to share what the next products are just yet, but this funding unlocks categories even more ambitious than our first one. We have a detailed plan in place for the next two years and napkin sketch ideas going out a couple of decades.It&#39;ll be really interesting to see where they go next. Given that they&#39;re already in computer and custom board space, I&#39;d make a guess that it&#39;s going to be routers - similarly embedded devices and they&#39;d make a great option for replaceable parts (i.e. WiFi, connection options etc)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Frameworks are really good. However, the chips inside are disappointing, IMO.I was considering the i5 1135g7 Framework with 16gb of RAM. A friend of mine bought it, and it&#39;s idle power draw is of 8-9W with Gnome 3 and Firefox open.I decided to get a laptop with a 5800H and an RTX 3070 instead. My power consumption as I&#39;m typing this comment right now is of 7W with a dozen tabs and an IDE, messaging, etc... open. That is despite a 46% larger screen, and a much faster, unlocked TDP, 8 core CPU.That&#39;s a real shame, IMO. Combined with a 55Wh battery, it&#39;s quite problematic, and was a deal-breaker for me."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My Tesla will allow me to engage autopilot in a school zone, obeying the adjustment I’d set on speed limit - while using, not the correct school zone speed limit, but the non-school time speed limit. It would allow me to go 30 mph over the school zone speed.How can Tesla claim self driving if the car can’t read a sign that says - speed limit 25 mph during school hours, and properly adjust? Humans just look around to determine if school is likely in session by the number of cars in the parking lot during normal school hours, or they know the school calendar.How does a self driving car make that determination? Query the school district website for the school, identifying their bell schedule and tacking on a buffer ahead and behind? Assume a school schedule that’s M-F? What if it’s a religious school that operates Sun-Thursday? Now the car has to determine which religious sects obey which calendar? Is it different in each country?Just another example of a massive hurdle self driving cars have……And another recall that should be issued."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was rear-ended in Colorado when I didn&#39;t do a rolling stop. Had a road-rage incident when the other driving was livid that I would stop under thoose circumstances.My dad (when gowing up) was pulled over for a cop for doing a california stop in Colorado. The police officer let us off, because we had california plates.When I got my Tesla, it was immediately evident that _no one_ travels the speed limit. They travel 5-10mph over it on anything other then a local road. or they drive way under it.This is the problem with our mental model - FSD/Autopilot has to co-exist with human drivers - and human drivers don&#39;t follow the law. FSD/Autopilot has to exist in a world where roads do not follow standards, lines are not marked, deer jump in front of cars, people do California stops (it&#39;s called that for a reason), cars have accidents.Computers, today, change none of that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The actual implementation is a little more nuanced than always roll or never roll, with seven conditions required to avoid coming to a complete stop:  1. The functionality must be enabled within the FSD Beta Profile settings; and

  2. The vehicle must be approaching an all-way stop intersection; and

  3. The vehicle must be traveling below 5.6mph; and

  4. No relevant moving cars are detected near the intersection; and

  5. No relevant pedestrians or bicyclists are detected near the intersection; and

  6. There is sufficient visibility for the vehicle while approaching the intersection; and

  7. All roads entering the intersection have a speed limit of 30 mph or less.

  If all the above conditions are met, only then will the vehicle travel through the all-way-stop intersection at a speed from 0.1 mph up to 5.6 mph without first coming to a complete stop. If any of the above conditions are not met, the functionality will not activate and the vehicle will come to a complete stop

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know a few upper-middle class small business owners (all non-retail sectors) whose businesses weren&#39;t substantially affected by the pandemic, but who basically got a free handout as part of the program.Two mentioned how they were initially hesitant to apply for money, but then worried that if they didn&#39;t, their business could take a downturn after it was too late. Then as long as they spent the money on payroll (which they had to pay for anyway), they didn&#39;t have to pay it back, even if their business didn&#39;t show any losses. I shudder to think of how much the bigger players yanked out of it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The US lacks the state capacity to tell who was going to have trouble with COVID-19 closures, and who wouldn&#39;t, so a whole lot of money just had to go to people that had no need for it whatsoever.Regarding PPP, every local tech staff augmentation company got a few months worth of payroll out of it. For those of you not in the know, their model involves hiring developers at $x an hour, and then placing them at large enterprises for $x+y, often for years at a time, as those companies would rather have contractors than employees.So where does the money go? Straight to the owner&#39;s pockets, as lockdowns only changed staffing needs in a very small number of companies. So if your sole proprietorship staffing company employs 25 of those developer-contractors for, say, 180k and a couple of HR staff, you could get million dollar &#34;loan&#34;, that would be forgiven in a few months, as you didn&#39;t fire any of them.Needless to say, the people in charge of that kind of company were very happy about the PPP program."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As I understand it, the reason an HIV vaccine has been so difficult to create is that HIV mutates so easily. I understand the basics behind how mRNA vaccines are generated, but I don&#39;t understand why this approach would be expected to have any more success in evading the high mutation potential of HIV than other vaccine types. After all, it was even a concern with new coronavirus variants that the original Moderna vaccine would be less effective against them (and, indeed, while the original vaccine is still highly effective against all variants, my understanding is that it is less so than the original variant). And SARS-COV-2 mutates much less easily than HIV.Can someone with more knowledge explain the thought process behind this?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember growing up being terrified of HIV/AIDS. The idea of something being permanent and transmissible via sex, and literally dismounting your immune defense to all other diseases on the planet...To this day it still terrifies me, even though the treatments have become so good.Each year it seems there are new stories about HIV research, and progress keeps being made. I pray for positive results and am really amazed. We have a lot to be thankful for."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wonder if we&#39;ll see HSV also addressed by this new wave of mRNA vaccines, or if it&#39;s just not top of mind for companies and researchers due to its &#34;mostly benign&#34; nature. At least until one&#39;s immune system starts to weaken with advanced age and it starts to cause all sorts of problems, but perhaps by then it gets swept under the &#34;problems of aging&#34; rug."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I once hired a guy who had no experience, but seemed like a good culture fit for our company and seemed very interested in learning.We interviewed him and made e-mail communication a large part of the interview, because it is a critical part of our business.  And his communication was great!After hiring, a recurring problem we had was his e-mail to us and to customers were terrible.  Bad grammar, bad spelling, uncorrected typos...  It got so bad that we had to have someone review all e-mails he sent to customers.We had regular &#34;improvement plan&#34; meetings with him, but after a year of paying him, we had to let him go.  As part of the exit interview we went back and looked at his interview e-mails, and compared them with his current e-mails.  So we asked him:&#34;During the interview, all your e-mails were great!  Why was that?&#34;&#34;My wife wrote all of those.&#34;I guess we should have hired his wife!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been a hiring manager for remote positions for a long time. If your recruiting channels are good, most of your candidates are going to be honest and good intentioned.But interview enough people, and you&#39;ll start encountering people trying to abuse remote work. They&#39;re not interested in contributing to your company. They&#39;re only interested in collecting paychecks while they do as little work as possible for as long as possible. They might already have a full-time job or other remote jobs, or maybe they&#39;re just trying to travel the world and do a &#34;four hour workweek&#34; thing where they answer e-mails once a day and phone in a couple hours of work at key times during the week.The common theme is that they aren&#39;t really interested in fighting too hard for the position. As soon as the interview or job turns out to be something they can&#39;t just talk and smile their way through, they&#39;re out, just like this:&gt; I think my last update for a while: as soon as HR got on the call with him, before they could get through their first question, John said the words “I quit” and hung up the calls. He has since been unreachable!!Always makes me wonder how many dysfunctional companies are out there letting deadbeat remote employees collect paychecks and do as little work as possible because nobody cares enough to press the issue."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Practices like this are hilariously common in the industry.Right out of college I accepted a job offer at a small consulting company on the east coast. They promised they would give me free housing at their luxury apartment for the first few months and give me all the training I need to excel in areas of my interest. I flew across the country and found out the whole thing is not as advertised. Their luxury apartment had piles of unwashed dishes and flies in the kitchen and piss on the bathroom floor. They had bunk beds in each room and I slept with three other dudes from wildly different backgrounds. My first night, this guy from Turkey assured me that everything is going to be fine, that he was shaking in fear for the first couple nights but he soon learned that if you work with them, they get you what you need. At the same time, another guy from Chicago was telling me how I need to look out for myself because the company likes to steal money from your paychecks.The next day, I learned that &#34;working with them&#34; meant going through their &#34;resume revision&#34; process. Turns out, there was a network of consulting companies like this one, each creating fake experiences for one another. Fresh grads who clearly have never coded anything of significance became senior engineers with 5 years of experience. The resulting resumes looked real stacked, filled with keywords that recruiters love. Furthermore, during live interviews, they actually placed someone with actual technical knowledge behind the laptop camera to basically write out all the answers on the whiteboard while the candidates read out the answers.Some of the people there loved talking about how so and so got placed at prestigious companies and became hugely successful in their career. Most of them knew what they were doing wasn&#39;t the most ethical thing to do, but not many complained given their visa status. Also, they were actually really grateful to get a developer job that pays ~$40k. They were just regular people.I personally didn&#39;t need visa support, and I had the luxury of being able to fall back on my parents. So about a week after I flew over, I gathered my things and left. It was an interesting experience overall, one I&#39;m glad I could experience.My 2c for interviewing: always look up key phrases you see on resumes and see if identical copies show up. It&#39;s usually a giveaway sign."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Looks like a Miele. That menu can be exited (the image where it says &#34;Software Update&#34;, the tiny bit on the right... that&#39;s a scroll bar of multiple options including the ability to exit this menu), but it does imply that the dishwasher is already connected to Wi-Fi and that it has determined that there is an update available.There are few times that a dishwasher is interacted with, if not when you go into the menu to start it then when? It&#39;s just asking &#34;Do you want to do this now?&#34; if not that is fine (the menu can be exited), but now you know to do it later.Alternatively as the dishwasher clearly is on Wi-Fi already (the only way it would know there&#39;s an update), one can use the Miele@Home app to perform the update at a more convenient time.I have a Miele dishwasher, it is connected to Wi-Fi (on a VLAN with other white goods, outbound connections to certain domains only). The Wi-Fi is useful... the dishwasher auto-doses the powder, rinse aid, salt, etc... and can let me know the levels of those. In addition it tells me when the cycle is done. Performs updates, etc. There&#39;s a Home Assistant integration too, but I&#39;ve not done that (my VLAN setup prevented it!).PS: If you&#39;re of the opinion that a dishwasher doesn&#39;t need to be on Wi-Fi and you wouldn&#39;t connect it... then great, that&#39;s another way not to be asked to do an update. This dishwasher isn&#39;t going to ask to connect to Wi-Fi, it&#39;s something you choose to do (something that takes a degree of determination I might add)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is it weird that the more tech becomes like this the more I feel checked out?I don’t want smart devices, nor do I want to be online 24/7. However it’s hard to escape this reality. My thermostat (in apartment) recently reset due to a power issue and I had to have maintenance over to do its configuration again. They had to come twice because after setting it up they have to figure out how to connect it to Wi-Fi for a software update.Before this apartment I lived in one where all the appliances were straight out of 1950/60. They were retro af but they worked without any issues for the time I lived there. Here I’ve had issues every month."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Smart devices are overly complex. The entire point should have been to make devices work for you, but now when you buy a ‘smart’ washing machine, it requires you 30min of setup. Downloading apps, connecting it to wifi, providing GPS location etc. why? What’s the point. We need devices that make life simpler. Straight out of the box."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I went car shopping this year in the new market and found that that if you want more a &#34;dumb&#34; car (UX occurs primarily outside of a touchscreen, no internet, no geolocation) you lose all potential for any nice non-smart features. So no heated/powered seats, no power windows, the material of the interior is refurbished from a spirit airlines airplane, etc.I think manufacturers are hoping that certain aspects of the modern auto become &#34;can&#39;t live withouts&#34;, e.g. bluetooth, which helps them smuggle all the other more marginally useful, security and ux intrusive features into your model. Now as others have mentioned, these unwanted smart features might actually be required by law/regulation/tax-credit/legal-dept, so it&#39;s not bad programming/design but &#34;design by committee&#34; that&#39;s dooming our chances of a good dumb car.I wonder how well my car will age when miscellaneous sensor all over the car start failing.

That means if you&#39;re backing out of the garage and the music is blaring -- you can&#39;t turn it off!The Volvo UI pops up an almost full-display warning when it can&#39;t connect to the phone over bluetooth on startup.  This UI takes priority over the rear camera.  So I guess it&#39;s better to hit Timmy and his puppy when I&#39;m backing out, so long as I know my phone&#39;s not connected!The Volvo&#39;s headlights have &#34;smart&#34; auto-adjustments.  That means I can&#39;t leave the high beams on, or force it to stay on low beams.  It will decide for me!  I think maybe I can disable this... somehow.So smart."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I hate about &#34;car discourse&#34; like this is the apparent blindness to public transportation. Trains, bikes, buses, and street cars solve almost every problem that the author complains about.The only outstanding problem, however, is that American infrastructure has been deliberately designed solely around the car. Those who suggest alternative modes of public transportation are immediately written off as &#34;impractical&#34;. Discourse ought to be centered around democratizing and diversifying the ways people can get around, not on how one ought to &#34;make dumb cars&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a good and thorough article. The author got down to brass tacks pretty quickly and brings up interesting hypothesis about $MSFT.That said, I do have one gripe:&gt; To oversimplify Notion to its demographics, it is Office 365 for people below age 35.I recognize this is an oversimplification, but even so, it seems like a stretch. Notion is a decent product, and I have used it for a few small-scale team projects in uni (mainly for Kanban-related stuff) - but to call it a replacement for O365 is an exaggeration at best.Yes, you can have pretty, nested documents in Notion and that&#39;s great, but a tabular database in Notion is by no means a replacement for Excel or even Google Sheets. The velocity that is afforded by Excel in terms of formulas is unmatched and there&#39;s a reason it has yet to be unseated as the kingpin of modern finance.Most young people I know use a combination of Discord + Google Suite to collaborate. I am aware this is slightly anecdotal, but I am also having a hard time imagining myself as a founder and then asking my CFO to use Notion to prepare investor pitches.Source: Am 23 :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like the elephant in the room is culture.* Facebook seems to be a bunch of smart people working on pet projects. Monopoly profits drive a political empire where people at the top think up something random, and it gets built.* Google has customer contempt. They started with brilliant people who were used to being smarter than everyone else. They also started in algorithm-driven markets like search and ad-words, where everything was statistical and individuals didn&#39;t matter. They&#39;ve lost the smarts and the ethics, and they&#39;re in a bit of a hole. I think they&#39;ve reached the end of the growth line.* I know nothing about Apple. Too secretive.* Microsoft has a bunch of cut-throat teams, competing with each other. Their technology is middling. However, they&#39;re the only one of the bunch you&#39;d want to partner with for B2B.* ... except for Amazon, which is hyper-customer-focused, and has a track record of successful forward-looking projects. AWS has been rock solid. On the other hand, I&#39;d never want to work there; they treat employees like crap. But it somehow works out for them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For me, as a developer, Microsoft is a company with deep roots in compilers and operating systems. All of the business empire started from these two foundations. 
Since its inception till today, Microsoft has been producing some global products every decade. And then making these products unbeatable in the global marketes. 
Be it Windows, Office, Exchange, Developer tools &amp; Compilers, Web Servers, XBox, Azure, Teams etc. You just name it and Microsoft is right there in almost every field with profitable products. 
A lot of people don&#39;t like the traditional Microsoft products but all of the products just work and are being used for tens of millions of customers around the globe every day. 
Any Software company with ability to create profitable products every decade is a killer company. That is the secret souce Microsoft has.As a developer just imagine about a company which gives you a developer tool to make a web application, using the company&#39;s provided compiler, which then can be deployed on a company&#39;s provided webserver and can store some data on company&#39;s provided database which is running on company&#39;s provided operating system.The company also happens to provide end-to-end tools for running a company of a 5 people to a company of 500,000 people.This is Microsoft."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Similar things happen surprisingly often in companies.  Many intense arguments can be diffused by first being specific about what we agree upon.Just to add to this, one strategy from the rationalist community that I rarely see practiced is to &#39;taboo&#39; certain words.  For example if two engineers are arguing about a solution not being scalable, taboo the word scalable.  They both re-explain their POV without using the word scalable at all.  It often works like magic and they quickly reach a shared understanding."</p>

We would go look at it once in a while.   Really eerie that out in this peaceful prairie was a horrific weapon just sleeping and waiting.  Ready to go at all times.  Pointed at folks on the other side of the planet nobody in the prairie knew or would likely ever meet.After the Cold War they were decommissioning them.  While driving out there I was waved down my an APC and some soldiers.   I pulled over, they asked me to wait with them.A couple convoys of more soldiers drove by, trucks, then a big convoy with a big white truck.I asked “Was that the real thing?”   The soldier said “They don’t bring us ALL out here unless it is.”They thanked me for waiting and told me I could go after one more group when by."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The full version of Brin and Page&#39;s classic paper &#34;The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine&#34; [1], which describes the early architect of Google and is an interested read in its own right, literally has &#34;Appendix A: Advertising and Mixed Motives.&#34; Highlights include:-&#34;We believe the issue of advertising causes enough mixed incentives that it is crucial to have a
competitive search engine that is transparent and in the academic realm. &#34;- &#34;We expect that advertising
funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers.&#34;- &#34;A better search engine would not have required this
ad, and possibly resulted in the loss of the revenue from the airline to the search engine. In general, it
could be argued from the consumer point of view that the better the search engine is, the fewer
advertisements will be needed for the consumer to find what they want. This of course erodes the
advertising supported business model of the existing search engines.&#34;To be clear: the &#34;we&#34; in these quotes are the founders of Google.[1] https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-...As an aside, I&#39;ve been reading a bunch of academic papers about early web crawlers and search engines. It&#39;s a fun and interesting subject. Mercator [2] (which became Alta Vista) is another early search engine and one of the few that discusses its architecture in detail.[2] https://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/Compaq-DEC/SRC-RR-173.pdf"</p>

Nowhere in the text does it actually talk about &#34;above&#34; and &#34;sidebar&#34;, that is just an interpretation that the author made up about what &#34;buying a better position in the search results&#34; would mean. Given the context of the times, it was clearly not a statement about layout but about actually reordering the &#34;organic&#34; search results based on payments and without marking those boosted results as ads."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m usually a defender of the single screen on the Model 3/Y, but on this, the author is right: the new UI (v11) is terrible compared to the previous one (v10).Not only does it hide commonly-used safety-relevant functions behind extra taps in sub-menus (as detailed), it was apparently done to free up space to offer a &#39;dock&#39; of app buttons - three permanant and three &#39;recently used&#39;.  I struggled to choose three apps I needed enough to fill the permanant spaces - and certainly don&#39;t need quick access (when I&#39;m driving!) to Netflix, or games, or whatever is popping up in &#39;recently used&#39; today.  I would like the driver profile menu to be quickly available, but alas that&#39;s been hidden too.It&#39;s a total cluster-f*ck that makes no logical sense when considering the need of drivers, and I hope they listen and revert at least this aspect of the UI."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; &#34;The problem isn’t really that complicated: originally the defroster icon was visible on the bottom. With the latest December 2021 update it is now hidden behind the temperature indicator. Tapping the temperature brings up a sub-window with the defroster icon.&#34;Even after reading that, I had to look at the pictures again, and read the paragraph again to find where you are supposed to tap. When they simplified the UI, they also removed the degrees symbol and the fan.Seeing as how 60-70 are both reasonable temperatures in Fahrenheit and speeds in miles per hour, it is not at all clear at a glance what that number means.(Disclosure, I work for GM)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The manufacturer changing the UI of a car after you bought it should be illegal or at least highly restricted.I think many of us have been incensed by UI changes in software we use for our daily work, and that&#39;s already bad enough; but IMHO this really crosses a line.There were jokes when Apple changed the scroll direction, comparing it to the steering wheel of a car suddenly working opposite to what everyone is used to; I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s possible to do that with a Tesla or other modern car, but it&#39;s disturbing that we seem to be headed down that path. What an absurd reality.The icons-only UI is also a huge regression; would it really take much extra effort to add a text label? I know people often mention localisation when it&#39;s brought up, but much of the world knows English, this is an American car sold in English-speaking regions, and changing the text in software is much easier than a separate part with different printing.(I drive a 50-year-old land yacht that&#39;s received many upgrades, but all under my control; so my perspective may be slightly biased...)"</p>

You should almost never transfer ERC-20 to a smart contract. You instead use approve to give the smart contract permission to withdraw, then call the function you want to receive and tell it to make the withdraw (the contract will internally call transferFrom)."</p>

Confirm at the receiving end before moving big sums.- If you&#39;re calling a contract, try it with a small amount first. Verify the parameters multiple times, and verify the return values multiple times.- If you&#39;re doing something with a huge sum of money, do it in steps instead of all-at-once. Fees won&#39;t be as big since you&#39;re already dealing with a huge sum of money anyways- Verify verify and verify that everything went alright with the small sum before trying to do something with a big sum- If you&#39;re tired, don&#39;t do it. Wait until you got some sleep- If you&#39;re rushed, don&#39;t do it. Wait until you&#39;re not rushed, have a tea and think about it- When in doubt, verify it and don&#39;t be tired- If you&#39;re not an expert, have someone who is do verification above for you"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Based. Nullius in verba [1]. The whitewashing of censorship is accelerating the erosion of trust in the institutions, and it&#39;s refreshing to see a long-standing institution take a bold stance.[1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nullius_in_verba"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I see the root cause of all this debate as a failure in scientific communication.When it comes to complex scientific decisions with significant impacts on the public, nuanced and detailed justifications are required. Instead, we often get simple declarations written by PR departments at juvenile reading level. This spawns chaotic and poorly conducted debate in all walks of life.What is required is a robust and transparent framework for honest analyses of topics. 
For example, if the CDC has a specific recommendation, They should provide an outline of the arguments, counter-arguments, assumptions, and supporting data for each part.It seems that the status quo is to completely ignore any arguments against a given recommendation. This suffocates any honest discussion in the crib. It also suggests to some that the justifications are not robust enough to survive the light of day. If you cant show your work, people will be skeptical that you did it all.This is applicable to any science based public policy, but especially obvious to covid policy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The issue that plagues us is a lack of trust in long-standing societal authorities.We can&#39;t follow the entire scientific proof chain for every piece of information we encounter, because we don&#39;t have time.So we rely on authority to some extent, whether that be peer review, government, independent bodies, etc.We need to be able to trust that these bodies are telling us the truth and aren&#39;t seeking to mislead us. Because when we start to doubt them, we then inevitably elect alternative bodies, simply due to limited thinking capacity/time - as explained above it&#39;s impossible to do otherwise, no-one derives from first principles every opinion they hold.The best way, _overall_, to convince someone to do something, is by clearly explaining to them the positives and negatives and letting them come to their own conclusion.It doesn&#39;t always work, and there are specific situations (e.g. someone is holding a gun to your face) in which the cost/benefit analysis is very different - in such a situation, the short term is all that exists, the long term effect of misplaced trust is irrelevant - you simply have to neutralize them.But in general, I&#39;m absolutely sure that education over coercion is the correct approach for society.Because if you force them, sure, you&#39;ve got a short term win, at the long term cost of trust. What is the long term cost of lost trust?"</p>

Not even the slightest bit interchangeable with 622mm. Usually, you can&#39;t even switch to 622mm rims on frame built for 630mm because the brakes won&#39;t reach 4mm closer to the axle. Easily mistaken for 622mm if you aren&#39;t paying attention.584mm is the &#34;27.5 inch&#34; mountain bike standard that splits the difference between 26&#34; and 29&#34;. If you have this, you probably know already.Once you&#39;ve got the rim diameter right, the tire width is pretty straightforward: if it looks right, it is right. It&#39;ll be pretty obvious that a &#34;29 inch&#34; mountain bike tire doesn&#39;t go on a road rim, even if the diameter on both is 622mm. If you have needs under which that doesn&#39;t apply, you&#39;re probably already aware of them.You can put hooked tires on straight sided rims safely (I have), but likely not the other way even if you could find dedicated straight sided tires.Tubulars are a while &#39;nother animal, about which I know nothing :-)ETRTO made it much, much simpler to get the rim size right when all of the various standards had different names to different people."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Heh. Even in bicycle-rich countries like Germany and the Netherlands, these numbers are somehow still tricky. I guess it doesn&#39;t help that they are often hard to read and a lot of the numbers are actually redundant.So yeah, useful! And my compliments for the neatness in your data privacy approach.At one point I just took the old tyre into a bicycle repair shop and asked for the proper replacement, and the person who sold me one even managed to get the wrong one (they replaced it for the proper one afterwards of course). It used to be that most normal use bicycles all had the same tyre, and only racing bikes had those weird French style ones, but newer bicycles tend to have fatter tyres (which is not a bad development for sturdy day-to-day bicycles laden with groceries, an adult cyclist, and a child in front or behind the cyclist)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is extremely common. In their 30s, people get married, have kids, and move to the suburbs. Finding and keeping friends in your 30s is quite a challenge.Some tips:- move to a city - things are much much easier in a city as people are more transient, groups aren&#39;t as established, and new people arrive all the time- it sounds like you have some friends - ask them if they have any friends in your area you should meet platonically- the easiest way to make friends is an activity: you mentioned a hobby, but it can be anything - a running group, the gym, board games, etc. The more non-nerdy, the more likely you are to find non-nerdy people- if you&#39;re like me, you struggle to make friends because it&#39;s not &#34;easy&#34; like it was in college. Friends in your 30s take work: reaching out, texting, scheduling, planning, etc.- it sounds like you&#39;re not in therapy. So let me be the first to tell you that you&#39;re depressed (that &#34;apathy&#34; you&#39;re feeling is depression). Which is fine, it happens us all. But go to therapy because that&#39;s how you solve that. Just try it for a month, no pressure."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;they&#39;re all full of lonely developers and other socially awkward people - short guys looking for girlfriends, unattractive/aging women looking for husbands, etc.&#34;So...people like you?
you sound really judgemental man.Since you have no friends(so nothing to hold you where you are, right?), and apparently a good source of income, I&#39;d advise you to go remote, travel, try digital nomadism, go to meetups, meet other travelers, maybe try coworking spaces? hacker houses/airbnbs with people from lots of different places?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have often been told im good at making friends and I think you can make them anytime, anywhere, anyhow, the first thing to focus on is your personal mindset and build from there:  1. Just say yes. When someone asks for anything, say yes, no matter how big or small (help them move out, look after their dog) This will put you into novel situations.
  2. Show genuine interest in things. Ask why, learn more, dig deeper, keep conversations going by trying to share anything you think is slightly relevant.
  3. Dress up. Wear things that stick out, even just a bit, a funky shirt, a nice bright pair of socks, use these to add flare to a standard dark blue and grey world, people will reflect back and be interested in you.
  4. Pick one new thing you want to master (not online) my advice here for all round great friend activities - Rockclimbing, Pub Quizes, Boardgame nights, Cycling, Pottery. Each of these almost always need another person to make them work and that helps you grow your confidence.
  5. Don&#39;t work so hard. Tell your boss you wanna slow it down, try and do 4 day weeks, give back some commitments, take a pay cut. Don&#39;t quit just slow it down and give your head some space.

I&#39;m 35, I just quit my /Director of Product role at a successful startup because I wasn&#39;t happy. I&#39;m about to go to Thailand to learn how to become a yoga teacher, not for a career but for a disciplined adventure that will deeply enrich me and is nowhere near a computer! You can do it! Put a plan in motion.HN Believes in you! :D"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Most of the comments here are focused on the question of why you would prefer an app to calling. The author&#39;s point is a great one though, and something I&#39;ve wondered a lot. Why should I create an account to order a pizza? The app should reduce friction even from the very first order. Instead it adds, and adds for every order... Got to go look up coupon codes! On the phone I just ask the guy what their best deal is in a large cheese and garlic knots and he gives it to me. The app or website should make my life better but instead it&#39;s harder.Worse, the app pretends to be an unrelated party when something goes wrong. &#34;Sorry, you need to call the store. Look up their number, it&#39;s on the website.&#34; For me it doesn&#39;t add anything to the transaction, it only takes away.The literal only reason I use the pizza app at all is for chains where I have no idea which store delivers to me. Rest of the time I&#39;ve gone back to calling. Much faster that way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My local pizza place in Seattle has moved the technology the other way. Here’s the dialog when I call.  “Pagliacci Pizza, how can I help you?”
“I’d like to order a pizza”
“Sure thing. Is this John Smith?”
“Yes”
“Do you still live at 1234 Main Street”
“Yes”
“Would you like to order the same thing you did last time?”
“Yes”
“Ok, it’ll be there in 20 minutes”Even better, while you talk to the store you called, the order goes into some sort of pizza load balancer and gives the order to the least busy store with a good drive time to your house.I’d seriously like to buy/have a beer for/with whoever designed it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That is the happy path. It has a lot more possible sources of error/time consumption than the app and there are many benefits to the app.1. The line is busy. The app is next to never busy.2. The line has static and you are not heard correctly. Especially problematic for delivery or complicated orders. Or they may get your name wrong. My first name is common and my last isn&#39;t great over the telephone.3. You have to remember what you ordered each time. Apps let me quickly re-order.4. You cannot easily pre-pay (irrelevant if you have cash, but if you are like me and wish to never use cash again, having to pull out the card is annoying rather than just grabbing the pizza).5. Most places now seem to be on DoorDash, so you can just order from there and avoid the additional friction. You also know you can get excellent customer service from DoorDash while a new restaurant is an unknown."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I agree with your general point that the search quality has gone down, quotes doesn&#39;t even always work anymore to get exact results.Looking into your suggested example: That turned out to be interesting and unexpected.So, the exact string you put here was &#34;David, we have been expecting you - this is what you have been searching for - this place, David, is where dreams are born&#34;, which is what you get when you copy the text from the website. It&#39;s correct that it doesn&#39;t work on Google searching for verbatim.The actual DOM of the snippet looks like this:    “David, we have been &lt;br&gt;expecting you - this is what you have
                           been searching for - this place, &lt;br&gt;David, is where dreams are born.”

If you take any snippet of text that doesn&#39;t do a line-break, it seems exact searches do work, like &#34;expecting you - this is what you have been searching for - this place&#34; or &#34;deep and melodious when it spoke&#34;.If you do take a snippet that does a line-break, then it cannot find anything, like &#34;David, we have been expecting you&#34; or &#34;this place, David, is where &#34;It seems that Google as unlearned how to treat different type of whitespaces, especially when the author/software has introduced manual line-breaks via the &lt;br/&gt; HTML tag.I&#39;m sure they have at one point introduced some &#34;quality filter&#34; that gives higher score based on how well the markup is made by the websites, for one reason or another, and eventually it got so &#34;improved&#34; or established that even if it&#39;s the only relevant hit for a human, the computer simply ignores the result for low scoring, since the markup is not 100% correct."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have an Intel Realsense camera, which sometimes reports the error &#34;Failed to recconect&#34; (there being a typo in the drivers) [1] - that&#39;s a pretty unique error, so in combination with the product name that should be a very easy keyword search, right? Especially if I throw in some quotation marks, to make it clear I want a literal match?Yet when I search for realsense &#34;failed to recconect&#34; Google, in its infinite wisdom, returns pages that contain neither realsense nor recconect [2]. They offer me a supreme court opinion, a review of a car dealership, and a facebook church service.Correcting the spelling of a query is one thing - but also completely ignoring other keywords? Even when there are pages available that match the query? [1][1] https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/blob/5ff27fca... [2] https://imgur.com/a/okYV5V2"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was looking for a specific person recently and searched:
&lt;name of person&gt; CanadaI guess they were pretty obscure so Google in all their wisdom displayed the results for Canada, with the entire name struck through. Fantastic. Defaulting to the most generic term in a query to the point of absolute uselessness."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the past maintainers of minikube here. Minikube, while targeted towards Kubernetes developers, also provides all the features you&#39;d want here. It also takes away most of the pain from virtual machine management w/ native hypervisors.If you&#39;re looking for customizability (boot image, docker version, container runtime), minikube is probably your best bet. It even comes with some rudimentary file-sharing and port-forwarding primitives, but it isn&#39;t as batteries-included as Docker desktop. On the other hand, you have full ssh access to the VM to do whatever you want (+startup scripts, etc.)Awhile back, I wrote up a comparison of all the Docker Desktop Alternatives.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been exploring 2 alternatives (podman and colima) to replace my normal docker workflow, which is just building and running containers locally, sometimes with docker-compose. I started with podman but had issues with 2 main pieces of my workflow: docker-compose (or podman-compose) and shared volumes (with `run -v`). Switched over to colima and those worked out of the box for me (&#34;brew install docker; brew install docker-compose; brew install colima; colima start; docker run ...&#34;)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; This is strange, in a way, since the series does not present an obviously alluring portrait of creative collaboration. Its principal locations are drab and unglamorous: a vast and featureless film studio, followed by a messy, windowless basement. The catering consists of flaccid toast, mugs of tea, biscuits and cigarettes. The participants, pale and scruffy, seem bored, tired, and unhappy much of the time. None of them seem to know why they are there, what they are working on, or whether they have anything worth working on. As we watch them hack away at the same songs over and over again, we can start to feel a little dispirited too.Are you kidding me?? This is probably the most inspiring part of the whole show! This is how you create things. It&#39;s a long, &#34;unglamorous&#34; slog full of dead ends, muck &amp; mire, and discovery. This is what gets an artist excited - the oeuvre in gestation, the birthing pains, the grim determination depsite not knowing whether you&#39;re pursuing genius or madness! Gets me fired up every time.The completed creation is usually a bit of a downer, like when you finish a good book."</p>

Even if you weren&#39;t in a band, but in some other kind of a team of peers, you&#39;ll enjoy how group dynamics plays out. I still didn&#39;t manage to watch part 3, but first two are pure gold."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Beatles fan since 1963 here. Easily the best thing I&#39;ve ever read about them. All the mind-reading, which I generally hate in profiles like this, is pretty well justified by context. For anyone creative, Peter Jackson&#39;s &#34;Get Back&#34; can be both heartening and devastating: the former because it reminds you that a lot of creativity is sweat equity, and the latter because holy shit, they just had it like no one else."</p>

Just to reiterate, these laws are over 40 years old, predating any kind of social media or internet-based communication - and they&#39;re still 100% valid.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiio%27s_laws"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As another example, Amazon teams communicate product launch requirements via a future press releases including a FAQ (per description in the book &#34;Working Backwards&#34;). Its a communication intended for the masses with a built-in disambiguation addendum.Our natural languages uses incremental inquiry to disambiguate context as opposed to using strong protocol. In &#34;Working Backwards&#34;, it&#39;s the communicator&#39;s job to solicit questions from co-workers via pain-staking detailed reviews in meetings (&#34;Bezos scrutinizes every single sentence&#34;). I think of it like constructing a representative survey of ambiguity, and then putting answers in the FAQ that help increase clarity. The more detailed and representative your survey, the more helpful your questions/answers will be to communicate nuance.With regard to disambiguating through protocol, Organizations evolve jargon to increment protocol, which probably increases semantic alignment somewhat as group size scales. If you read about the history of language, the Rebus principle created protocols of formal alphabets; protocols like grammar gave us formal writing rules. Protocols like TCPIP let our computers talk. Protocol creates more rigid commitments for communication, but also increases potential semantic alignment. As a thought experiment, if we learned to dynamically and deliberately develop jargons en masse, it might create the channels to disambiguate context and communicate nuance at scale."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’ve been reading some variant of this, for many years.One of the reasons that I hated being a manager, was because the job involved a lot of sitting around, waiting for stuff to happen.I couldn’t work on my own projects (because I was on paid work time), and it would have been irresponsible, in the extreme, to put myself into the critical path (because it was no guarantee that I would be able to reliably work). I sometimes tasked myself with projects for work, but they were almost always ignored by my company, and that hurt.I’ve heard that being a soldier in a combat zone is long hours of idleness, punctuated by short periods of terror and stress.That pretty much describes my time as a manager, without the “terror” part (and the bullets and explosions).It sucked.I now work at home, on my own technical tasks. I get a lot done. My personal productivity is through the roof.I take a lot of breaks. Sometimes, I even nap.But I don’t have a time clock. I will often start coding, at 6AM (sometimes, before I even get in the shower, after my morning exercise), and will continue to code, until I hit the sack. I often test my software, while I’m sitting in bed, and will enter issues, from my iPad.When I have a problem that I’m chasing, or I am in the middle of a big implementation phase, I can work for many hours, straight. I will barely come up for air, and I feel absolutely exhausted, when I finally step back (nap time!).I’m not particularly concerned about a measured life. I get a lot done; far more than I ever did, when I was being paid.And I’m having a blast."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Valuable prospective, but (as is the gist of half my comments here): People are even more different than you think.RescueTime wrote a similar post, but +100 data:https://rescuetime.wpengine.com/work-life-balance-study-2019...Look at the second histogram. The average is roughly aligned with OP’s summary, but there is huge variance. These comments have already devolved into people telling each other they are lying, or about to burn out - all I ask is humility in the face of our messy shared reality.Thank you for listening to my TED Talk, I guess"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article resonated with my experience as as software developer.At my first place, a small outsourcing shop, employees were required to log daily activities so hours per day roughly fit to 8 and 40 per week. From the beginning and unlike most of coworkers, I measured my time precisely with https://github.com/Klaster1/timer-5 and soon understood that doing 8 hours per day doesn&#39;t happen much and often involves staying late, so instead I simply adjusted the reported numbers to look plausible. In four years, I only received positive feedback on my productivity. What was the management thinking, I have no idea, just like the article says, this was a farce all around.When I changed the company, the habit to measure productivity stuck. Nowadays, I start working somewhere at 9 and finish at 18, and result is still the same - honest 8 hours of work activity per day happen at best once a month, the average week sums to 30-34 hours. Code-related activities never take more than 3-4 hours per day, that includes both coding and reviews. I get the impression that some of my colleagues might spend more time on the job, but low productivity was never a topic of my performance reviews, management seems content with what they get."</p>

This allows us to evolve Black&#39;s style without too much disruption to users that want consistency. The default style is updated yearly.Thanks to our maintainers for orchestrating the efforts, especially to our most recent reinforcement Batuhan (@isidentical) who was responsible for our match statement support!

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So True !
After 25+ years of coding, I know one thing. I STILL don&#39;t know how to &#34;code correctly&#34;.And apart from a few gifted individuals (Rob Pike, Fabrice Bellard Bobby Bingham [ffMpeg team] etc) I&#39;m HIGHLY suspicious of ppl and programmers who claim &#34;they can program correctly&#34; and that &#34;this xyz is the correct way/stack/method/arch&#34;.Background:CS grad, start coding at around 13 (thank you dad !) I am well versed in C,C++,PHP,Go,TypeScript and to a lesser degree Java and a few bits and bobs in between F#,Haskell,LISP...The above is not to brag (not that it&#39;s brag worthy after 25 years you bound to pick up a few tools) just to put it in perspective.On Code quality:
I&#39;ve noticed it&#39;s easy to agree/identify the &#34;extreme cases&#34; the VERY VERY BAD CODING and the very very GOOD CODING. But most of the coders and codebases falls somewhere in between where the code-quality-water quickly gets murky.PS2. Oh and on &#39;code reviews&#39;: It would be cool if code-reviews were done &#34;anonymously&#34; i.e I should not know until the very end WHO wrote the code. Helps to keep any personal biases at bay - my 2cents.The best thus far advise I&#39;ve seen on code-quality guidelines is from a comment on HN:&gt;I try to optimize my code around reducing state, coupling, complexity and code, in that order. I&#39;m willing to add increased coupling if it makes my code more stateless. I&#39;m willing to make it more complex if it reduces coupling. And I&#39;m willing to duplicate code if it makes the code less complex. Only if it doesn&#39;t increase state, coupling or complexity do I dedup code.Source: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11042400Sure I might just be a dumb idiot or completely not gifted in the &#34;art or science&#34; of coding. :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Coding is a highly subjective and creative endeavor. &#34;Clean code&#34; is akin to &#34;well written&#34; for writers. Sure, you can analyze and even be able to define some good practices, but because we are always creating something new that has never done before, and the field is infinitely complex, no rules can be set in stone and applied across everything.In my opinion there&#39;s nothing wrong with calling code clean, we don&#39;t have to analyze every line of code we write. There&#39;s just too many things to consider and viewpoints to take, we&#39;d be trapped in analysis paralysis forever, as you can continue it to no end. There&#39;s never a point where the analysis will be &#34;done&#34;. You just have to be able to recognize when the analysis reaches a point of diminishing returns, and when moving on is the better option. Sometimes just calling it &#34;clean&#34; is enough."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Uncle Bob Martin definition of &#34;clean code&#34; from his book &#34;Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship&#34; is a set of rules that absolutely are not at odds with one another. If you follow them you will end up with code that&#39;s really nice to read and easier to maintain, and, most importantly, that you can confidently change.There&#39;s a decent summary here - https://gist.github.com/wojteklu/73c6914cc446146b8b533c0988c..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Commenters in this thread are making a lot of generalizations about tax structures and so on, but it important to keep in mind this is a special case at a number of levels.  Pittsburgh has an unusually large number of bridges.  These bridges were built during times of relative wealth when the local steel and related industries were doing well.  Since the decline of American industry Pittsburgh has scaled way back and had to rebuild itself as a medical and technology center.  This recovery is mostly a success story, but the infrastructure cannot be maintained.  For example, the greater Pittsburgh area has some of the first suburban areas to be completely abandoned with services withdrawn, Penn Hills being a poignant example of this.  Obviously no bridges should be coming down, but there is a real problem here of how to build and maintain a modern city that is smaller than the older one that it replaces."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Its stuff like this that scares me. Pittsburgh claims to have more bridges than any other city in the world.[0] You&#39;re driving around here, and you cross little ones without noticing. I hope I&#39;m not ever near (or using) a collapsing one. The rivers are big here.[0] https://www.bbc.com/news/av/magazine-30187252Edit: not bridge related, but a sinkhole opened downtown over 2 years ago, also swallowing a bus: https://www.post-gazette.com/news/transportation/2019/10/28/..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lot of talk about the Federal government need to step into a city and manage the bridges.Cities have (often highly) paid inspectors to do just that, inspect bridges and make recommendations, and issue warnings.  As noted by PascLeRasc et al. the degradation of the bridge has been reported to the city.As for funding through Federal government, my experience has always been:The resident pays their Federal tax.  The Fed takes their administrative cut.Fed allocates remaining funds to the State. The State takes their administrative cut.State allocates remaining funds to the City (or county).  The city takes their administrative cut.City allocates remaining funds to contractors to fix the bridges.Put it in an other way, humans value things exponentially more when their own sweat went into the things, than if it was just given to them.  By coming at State level, residents have a closer connection and understanding where the money came from, and would demand higher accountability.Just my opinion."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is nice initiative and any attempt to make mathematics more accessible is a  value added to society in my book. However, saying you will learn &#34;mathematical thinking&#34; by watching 1.5 hours of passively watching, even Professor Tao, is quite an overpromise. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a subject that requires more hands on practice and thinking than math, especially higher level math, so this is more along the lines of edutainment. So in my mind, how valuable this course is depends on what this content replaces for you. If watching this series replaces something distracting then its great, but if it replaces actually doing problems and working out proofs, then it&#39;s not worth it.Finally there&#39;s a celebrity aspect to Masterclass that&#39;s a bit strange. Like these guys are famous, and because they&#39;re famous, they are the most worthy to teach you something.Some series you should check out that are free and IMO provide much better value for time:Academy of Achievement: https://achievement.org/
* Some good lessons with Eric Lander, Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos and Demis Hassabis3B1B: https://www.3blue1brown.com/Numberphile: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoxcjq-8xIDTYp3uz647V5A"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Watching the trailer, makes me think that people who may enjoy this series will also enjoy a book called &#34;Aha&#34; by Martin Gardner (from probably 40 years ago)[0].It has a lot of amusingly illustrated insight problems that show you how thinking about a problem differently simplifies getting to the answer a lot.  It&#39;s probably aimed at advanced teenagers, but in fact the lessons there are some that even many adults probably have not come across before.  I mean, I haven&#39;t watched the Masterclass, but I imagine Terrence Tao isn&#39;t teaching multimanifold group theory or something anyway, so this is the kind of insightful more daily-math problems he&#39;s helping people to understand how to think about.[0] search your favorite, ahem, LIBrary GENeric source of books to find it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My first reaction to this blog post was kind of negative because Master Class is not free. I watched the teaser video and it&#39;s actually pretty inspiring. As someone who has done undergraduate Computer Science level Math, but completely forgotten most things about Math except for simple Algebra, I am going to try this.The cost is €16/month which is cheaper than Netflix. I just cancelled my Spotify recently so this is affordable for me right now.EDIT: The problem I see with Master Class as a subcription service is... if you watch Master classes on everything you are getting a broad education rather than a deep dive. I guess it&#39;s more for entertainment though."</p>

Reddit’s login pop-ups are more aggressive than Twitter’s for me.&gt; Now you can perhaps read ten tweets or replies to a linked tweet without an account before the same thing occursPerhaps an unpopular opinion, but I don’t think any company is obligated to provide unlimited access for free without an account. If you’re trying to scroll deep into conversations or someone’s Tweets, it’s reasonable to expect that you’d need to become a user of the website.The only login-wall that doesn’t make sense to me is Medium’s, as the site is primarily designed as a publishing platform rather than a community platform.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recently quit Twitter (almost[0]) and have been much happier ever since.It seems (to me) that the way Twitter increases &#34;engagement&#34; is to show you the tweets that will upset you the most, so that you can either reply with an angry thing of your own, or furiously &#34;like&#34; other angry responses.I tried to unfollow a lot of people who tend to post about controversial topics but Twitter keeps showing me their tweets or similar ones from other people. It also insists on showing me things that are popular but that don&#39;t concern me (such as sports).There doesn&#39;t seem to be a way to see only the tweets of the people you follow. And even if there was... random thoughts and bits from people I don&#39;t know are seldom interesting, and very unnecessary.At some point I thought I was addicted to Twitter; but it turned out it&#39;s the easiest addiction to get rid of.[0] &#34;Almost&#34;: I didn&#39;t delete the account: I just logged out and stopped using Twitter completely."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Finally! I’m a big fan of Python, but I hope they remove ALL Python from the OS itself. I’ve spent many hours over the years messing with setups to resolve bugs caused by python scripts picking up the Mac OS python install rather than the user-installed version. They really shouldn’t be bundling any Python version with the OS - the user should choose the versions installed. It’s much cleaner that way."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I remember walking around a trade show in the early 80&#39;s and doing something similar.  It was a &#34;HP Microwave Symposium&#34; and aside from lots of good talks and papers, the exhibit hall had lots of high dollar HP (later Agilent/Keysight) RF test equipment.  One of the items on display was a HP8566 spectrum analyzer which had a (primitive by today&#39;s standards, but) &#34;smart&#34; display capable of drawing vector graphics, time-linear graphs, and text.  After using one on my own for a while, I had become curious about the display so I had learned everything that I could about it.  So down on the exhibit hall floor, I walked up to the instrument while the sales guy was proclaiming how great it was (which was true) and I entered eight lines of code (about 30 keystrokes).  Then I pressed the button to view trace C (which most people still don&#39;t know about) and up popped a rolling blinking text display of my name.  Most of the people nearby were impressed, but since the instrument was no longer displaying the RF spectrum that the sales guy was talking about, he said; &#34;I know how to fix that.&#34; Then he walked over and pressed the green &#34;Instrument Preset&#34; button, which the HP documentation said would always restore the instrument to a known starting point.  When the display did not change, the sales guy yelled at me; &#34;WHAT DID YOU DO?!?!?&#34;  (My program was in Trace C of display memory, which is not initialized by the Instrument Preset function.)  So after watching him panic for a moment, I walked over and swapped traces B&amp;C (shift-key followed by the swap A&amp;B button).  Now my program was in trace B (and blanked) so the screen returned to normal.  Everyone was relieved!  So just before walking away, I swapped my program back into trace C, viewed trace C, and hit the green preset button again.  As I walked to the next exhibit, I saw him cycle the AC power to the instrument in frustration."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My FBI file was for hacking into my school district&#39;s AS/400 that handled my school&#39;s attendance and grading system.  Somehow using a public IP address with no access restrictions allowed a clear telnet path in from home.  Compounding username and passwords that were all the same for every employee.  I didn&#39;t change a thing, just LOLed and told someone.  Bad mistake. 
This was the late 90s.Oh well, 2 week suspension and kicked off the computers for less than a year.  A nice conference with FBI, police, my parents, IT and school administration.  Fun times.I learned my lesson to not talk about such things because their egoes were too fragile.When they decided to give students in their website design class ftp accounts on the district wide web/email server running an ancient version of Debian, they didn&#39;t disable the shell, just added a login script to a menu for pine, etc. for people who telnetted in, which I&#39;m sure the sysadmin was proud of.  However, a few fast CTRL-C&#39;s broke out of his script menu loop and got me a shell, and they didn&#39;t shadow protect their password files.  Ran it through john the ripper and had half the district&#39;s e-mail passwords in a default dictionary file including the root pw in a few minutes.  LOLed and never told anyone about that.Good times, the 90s...."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A person I know studied in East Germany in the early 80s via a very limited exchange program. After the wall came down, she requested her Stasi file.It was fascinating what was in the file - lots of misunderstandings and misinterpretations. For example, she was upset when the Challenger exploded, and this mystified the Stasi informers who had previously identified her as a pacifist (in their minds, the Shuttle was 100% military).Similarly, she was trying to research what happened to a relative who had remained in Germany in the late 30s, and whether she had died of natural causes or been sent to the camps. The Stasi file was filled with speculations on the details of this &#34;sleeper agent&#34; with whom she was trying to establish contact.All this to say that from the mindset of a spy, everything is spy-craft. Everyone&#39;s world-view shapes their interpretation of events and reality itself. Was the shuttle a military venture? Partly. Was it also a tool for science? Yup. But the functionaries who looked at her data in the heat of the cold war certainly couldn&#39;t see those distinctions.For what it&#39;s worth, she was able to get her Stasi file, but has never been able to get a copy of her FBI file."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This story (assuming it&#39;s true) should serve as an excellent example of why you need privacy even if you think that you don&#39;t. In peace time the NSA is only looking for &#34;terrorist&#34; and leaves everyone alone, but in case of war they would start creating lists for any and everything. All it takes is one &#34;tough&#34; agent trusting their gut feeling/algorithm based on your browsing history and shopping habits to put a target on your back and you are done.EDIT: Replacing &#34;if there&#39;s any truth to it&#34; by &#34;assuming it&#39;s true&#34;. I did not mean to imply that the author made up the whole story and thought both expressions were equivalent."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have over 20 years of Linux/FreeBSD sysadmin experience ranging from universities to major silicon valley companies in both cloud and on-prem.When it comes to companies I mostly support cloud these days but when it comes to me and my family I accept every downside and host as almost all of our digital lives in a 42u rack in a gutted closet in our house with static IPs and business fiber.I know where our data lives and no one can access it without a warrant and my explicit knowledge. I also save myself several hundred a month in third party cloud provider fees to host the same services and can reboot upgrade or repair anything whenever I want, but in general no more maintenance than cloud servers . I also never end up with exciting bills when experiments are forgotten about.You pretty much get all the pros and cons of home ownership. For me it is mostly pros. Also keeps me dogfooding all the same practices I recommend to my clients."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A very weird thread that degenerated into: &#34;PaaS vs self-hosted/self-owned hardware&#34;.I&#39;m pretty sure most people sysadmin&#39;ing their Linux servers are actually doing it with rented dedicated servers.  TFA btw specifically mentions: &#34;don&#39;t manage physical hardware&#34;.  Big companies like Hetzner and OVH have hundreds of thousands of servers and they&#39;re not the only players in that space.They don&#39;t take care of &#34;everything&#34; but they take care of hardware failure, redundant power sources, Internet connectivity, etc.Just to give an idea: 200 EUR / month gets you an EPYC 3rd gen (Milan) with shitloads of cores and shitloads of ECC RAM and a fat bandwith.And even then, it&#39;s not &#34;dedicated server vs the cloud&#34;: you can have very well have a dedicated server and slap a CDN like CloudFlare on your webapp.  It&#39;s not as if CloudFlare was somehow only available to people using an &#34;entire cloud stack&#34; (whatever that means).  It&#39;s the same for cloud storage / cloud backups etc.I guess my point is: being a sysadmin for your own server(s) doesn&#39;t imply owning your own hardware and it doesn&#39;t imply either &#34;using zero cloud services&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When my SaaS app started scaling, I saw how badly cloud can be priced if you have even slightly unusual use-cases. It occurred to me that instead of spending ~$600/mo on GCP, I can invest in a $3000 PowerEdge server with much better hardware, run it out of my home office, and it pays for itself in less than a year.Running your own server is an investment that doesn&#39;t make sense for everyone. If you can get it, it is better than you might imagine. Being in full control--the master of your own destiny--is so liberating and empowering. It feels the difference between constantly ordering Lyft/Uber/riding with friends, vs. owning your own car.Not to mention, again, my hardware resources are so much better. This one server can run multiple profitable SaaS apps / businesses and still have room for experimental projects and market tests. Couldn&#39;t be happier with my decision to get off the cloud."</p>

The revenue comes from hardware sales.  You&#39;re usually offering the driver to the public for free on your website anyway.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There are a lot of fancier note taking tools but I keep going back to Zim. Been using it for years for private offline note-taking for work. I use quick notes and journal shortcuts many times a day to quickly jot down a followup note/idea/question in meetings. It&#39;s also my GTD system with tasks plugin. Love that it&#39;s just text files so I can manually edit them, version control, sync in private cloud service, etc. Never worry about losing my data.There are a few quirks I&#39;ve gotten used to over the years though:- Pasting code will be garbled or auto-create tags unless you use the source view plugin or paste verbatim.- Takes a little configuration out of the box to get just right, system dependencies, links opening in right browser, plugins, shortcuts, fonts. But once you get streamlined it just works.- The syntax feels a little strange to me but I rarely need to edit raw files. I could also export to Markdown if I ever wanted to migrate.My last tip, templates are awesome. I have ones for all kinds of things, like interviewing, 1-1s, and architecture design outline."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It is time to give a shout out to my favorite note taking app: Trilium https://github.com/zadam/triliumPros:  1. Data is saved in SQlite. I am at 33k notes and it springs open instantaneously.    
  2. Notes can be arranged into arbitrarily deep tree. Single note can be placed into multiple places in the tree. (Think soft-links)     
  3. WYSIWYG support (CKEditor)   
  4. Tags, advanced scripting features    
  5. Other ususal wiki stuff like backlinks, note-map etc

Cons:  1. Electron.    
  2. Data is saved in SQlite, not plain text."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Let me add something here; Zim feels the most personally extensible (except for, of course, org-mode, I must admit)I see a bunch of people here with laundry lists of requirements, and when I see them, I&#39;m like -- yes, a lot of those seem reasonable, but I&#39;ve also had the same, and I&#39;ve just built them myself, with some very hacky Bash. But any language will work.Examples..lets see.  I add todo items from anywhere (including phone) with email. I use Blitzmail on the phone and an IMAP script on the computer to send myself a tagged email, then I have another script to check and parse and add them to Zims &#34;Journal&#34;My personal website is in Zim. I have a short one-liner to update it to my server; but I also teach at a college. I learned just enough of the Canvas API to also update certain pages of it to my class webpages. Also another one to update the Slides I make in Zim as well.Etc."</p>

Humans are the AGI, and we&#39;re going to happily use more and more energy to play this stupid game for as long as it looks like there&#39;s a profit to be made, even if the global outcome is to our own detriment.If we want this mess to go away, we need to find a way to change the incentives globally."</p>

For example, he talks about how terrible Tether is and then completely ignores USDC. He also claims that none of the popular blockchains can scale, but Solana is frequently in the top 5 most popular cryptocurrencies.It seems to me that people that do an hour of research are polarized hard. Either love it or hate it. The more time you spend understanding the space the more nuanced it becomes. Many are using the technology to facilitate scams and overpromising, but that doesn&#39;t make the technology fundamentally useless or bad."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Also read Florian Mueller’s excellent analysis here: http://www.fosspatents.com/2022/01/35-us-states-and-microsof...&gt; Epic&#39;s appeal is very much alive. Apple will use its market power and money to get support from all sorts of &#34;friends of the court&#34; as well, possibly even ridiculous astroturfing organizations. But it won&#39;t be able to counterbalance the support Epic received from 35 states, Microsoft, the EFF, and America&#39;s most cited and most authoritative antitrust law professor. It will probably be easy to see for the Ninth Circuit that those who support Epic do so because it&#39;s the right and necessary thing to do, while those who will support Apple are just going to have reasons to do Apple a favor.Update: The U.S. federal government has now filed a brief as well:&gt; The United States enforces the federal antitrust laws and has a strong interest in their correct interpretation. The United States files this brief, pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 29(a)(2), to address errors in the district court’s analysis of the Sherman Act, which, if uncorrected, could significantly harm antitrust enforcement. The United States takes no position on the merits of the parties’ claims.Further analysis on the government’s brief specifically: http://www.fosspatents.com/2022/01/biden-administration-back..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t really care about Epic (because they are far from being a dream company you are likely to sympathize today - they hardly care about anybody&#39;s rights actually, just about their own revenue) but once I have an iPad/iPhone I want alternative browser engines, terminals, emulators/VMs and being able to write and run an app of my own without having to even inform (let alone pay) Apple about this. I also believe 30% is too much for an app developer to pay the device manufacturer anyway."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Apple&#39;s 30% revenue cut is absurd rent seeking behavior. Good on these states. Let&#39;s keep it going and continue to dismantle similar systems at other companies.Apple can continue to mandate Apple payment options are as an option in every app, but let&#39;s watch as that 30% drops to nothingness once they face real competition."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Sometimes company legal teams can be the most accessible way to draw attention to something like this, and I don&#39;t mean in a combative way. They&#39;re very risk conscious, they see a &#39;10+ years of building a heavy metal community, gone like a puff of smoke&#39; in terms of risks, both of bad publicity but also if you were to somehow litigate because of the damage to your business or project. Often they have an email address that is manned because they have to respond to legal requests of various types.You can potentially request all your data (and data about the hack) and let them know why, maybe reach out asking how you can get law enforcement involved and who you should contact after you&#39;ve made a police report. It&#39;s not a threat, but it get it on somebodies radar. If you express how devastated you are there is potential for them to help. They also have a lot more latitude than any kind of helpdesk (especially at the scale of Facebook, and the users/customers facebook has).They&#39;re also well connected with-in an organization because they have to sign-off on all kinds of projects and risks.I think `patio11` has amazing advice is a similar vein[1].[1]: https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1162561822248992768?lang=... (I think he has a longer version/reference, but I can&#39;t find it)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Probably not the advice you&#39;re looking for, but looks like you have a blog also and am assuming that some/many of your subscribers also look at your blog. So, you may want to use your blog to spread the word about losing your page so that your subscribers know what&#39;s happening and you don&#39;t lose many of them.In addition, while you should keep looking at ways to recover your FB page, but you may want to take this opportunity to create a more traditional forum of your own.You may want to look at AVSForum.com, Home-Barista.com and others for ideas on how to structure very successful traditional review/forum sites and while it may be more effort initially as you&#39;ll have to build it yourself, in the long run it may be more fruitful for you.Either ways, Good Luck!!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is pretty incredible. These aren&#39;t just good practices, they&#39;re the fairly bleeding edge best practices.1. No more SMS and TOTP. FIDO2 tokens only.2. No more unencrypted network traffic - including DNS, which is such a recent development and they&#39;re mandating it. Incredible.3. Context aware authorization. So not just &#34;can this user access this?&#34; but attestation about device state! That&#39;s extremely cutting edge - almost no one does that today.My hope is that this makes things more accessible. We do all of this today at my company, except where we can&#39;t - for example, a lot of our vendors don&#39;t offer FIDO2 2FA or webauthn, so we&#39;re stuck with TOTP."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The real crux of the issue is the long-tail of applications which were never conceived with anything but network-based trust. I&#39;m certain the DoD is absolutely packed with these, probably for nearly every workflow.The reason this was so &#34;easy&#34; for Google (and some other companies, like GitLab[1]) to realize most of these goals is that they are a web-based technology company - fundamentally the tooling and scalable systems needed to get started were web so the transition were &#34;free&#34;. Meaning, most of the internal apps were HTTP apps, built on internal systems, and the initial investment was just to make an existing proxied internal service, external and behind a context aware proxy [1].The hard part for most other companies (and the DoD) is figuring out what to do with protocols and workflows that aren&#39;t http or otherwise proxyable.[1] https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/cloud-iap-context-aware-ac...[2] https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2019/10/02/zero-trust-at-gitla..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Our corporate IT folks have a Zero Trust Manifesto in which there are enrolled devices (laptops that remote SREs can carry around), there are enterprise applications, and there&#39;s connectivity between these (e.g., tunnel pairs). SREs often need to write scripts that operate on sensitive production data from the enterprise applications, but must do this work directly on an enrolled device.Pre-Zero-Trust days seemed safer. Copying production data to a laptop wasn&#39;t allowed. Instead, each SRE had their own Linux VM in the data center, accessible from home and able to run the scripts (with connectivity to the enterprise application). This prevented a whole class of realistic attacks in which a laptop (while unlocked/decrypted) is taken by an adversary. Admittedly, in return, we&#39;re protected from a possible, but less likely, attack in which a Linux VM is compromised and used for lateral movement within one segment of the enterprise network. (An enrolled device has to be in the user&#39;s possession; it can&#39;t be any machine, Linux or Windows, in the data center or office.)The only people who love this are our enterprise application vendors. Our bosses are paying them a TON more money to implement new requirements where, in theory, all possible types of data analysis can be done directly within the enterprise application. No more scripts, no more copying of data. No more use of Open Source. And, of course, people from these same enterprise application vendors advise the government that Zero Trust must be a top priority mandate."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Naomi Wu seems to upset a lot of people. She makes things, and was accused by the publisher of &#34;Make&#34; magazine of being a fake, with some guy doing the actual work. She replied by posting long, detailed videos of her making stuff. An hour of cutting aluminum extrusions with a chop saw and putting together a frame. Soldering PC boards. Eventually, the guy apologized.One of the useful things she&#39;s done is to put up lots of videos of her running around Shenzhen. There aren&#39;t enough ground-level videos of the working parts of Chinese cities. There&#39;s extensive coverage of Tokyo, by comparison. It&#39;s interesting to see the high-density housing blocks and street-level activity. (The &#34;let&#39;s increase housing density&#34; crowd from Strong Towns should watch those videos.) People who&#39;ve met her report that she knows Shenzhen very well, down to the back alley level, where some unmarked door leads to an important factory. She&#39;s toured the electronics markets of Huaqiangbei. (I miss the days when Silicon Valley had electronics parts stores.)She&#39;s done some nice technical work. Her main thing is 3D printing, and she came up with the first angled 3D printer that worked reliably. The print head moves in a plane 45 degrees from vertical, and the base surface is a belt, which advances the workpiece one layer at a time. So it can produce objects continuously, or very long objects if you add support rollers. Others had made prototypes of such machines, but the properties of the belt and print head are touchy to make that work right. She got it all working, and it&#39;s now a product, with her picture on the box.At various times she&#39;s pushed on GPL compliance, mask quality, and other issues of interest to the tech community.She wears skimpy outfits sometimes. So what? That&#39;s most of Instagram. Unlike most Instagrammers, Wu has something original to say. Sometimes with a biting wit. I gather that it&#39;s more biting in Cantonese."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For any Westerners here who seem to have a hard time understanding why this is wrong:Look at an even more women-oppressing culture such as that of Afghanistan under the Taliban. Women are required to cover their faces in public. Why? For &#34;modesty.&#34; What it boils down to is that if women show their faces it could have a negative effect on men (sexual attraction).A lot of people where are shaming her for being essentially immodest in her quest for female empowerment. A face is not immodest. A boob is not immodest. It is not sexualized because it is just a body part. It takes a man to do the sexualization, so the sexualization isn&#39;t the boob, but a man&#39;s who is doing the sexualization. A baby does not sexualize the boob (it&#39;s food). They get conditioned to it by society and culture as they grow older (a culture that sexualizes it).Sub out face in Afghanistan with boob in America and you&#39;ll see it&#39;s the same picture. While we should pat ourselves on the back for being so progressive as to allow women to show their faces in public, we haven&#39;t quite gotten to the point where it&#39;s ok to show boobs in public. And yes, some women prefer to wear burkas, just as some women prefer to hide their boobs in public.The point is that those restrictions on women shouldn&#39;t be dictated by the actions or effects they have on men. Instead, men should either change their viewpoints or control their own sexualization so that women don&#39;t have to accommodate. These immodest views come from those who sexualize women, and because that&#39;s out of the control of women so they should not be forced to accommodate something out of their control."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sigh... while talented, she is constantly pushing the boundaries of taste and the YouTube TOS to gain subscribers.She pretends to be some women&#39;s rights activist when she&#39;s really just a purveyor of some weird type of titillation. Yes the algorithm is capricious, yes its arbitrary, and yes YouTube is evil. But she&#39;s clearly making a bust of herself naked. I&#39;m sure if I put my balls on YouTube they&#39;d be more than demonetized.I have no problem with her personally, I also don&#39;t find her interesting at all... but it is what it is. YouTube probably needs to classify videos more finely grained so that we can distinguish between types of videos and match tolerances for blue content to advertisers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"My first job out of school was at a dot-com in Vegas in the year 2000 initially as the network administrator. Susan was the Director of Marketing. My first interaction with her was typical assisting someone with some issue or another, but I noticed her book shelf was full of very technical books, and it turned out she was a Microsoft Certified Solutions Expert and I was just a simple MCP (I was new to Windows NT, my background was in Netware). I was about 22 and she was about 40, and it was very intimidating at the time, especially after I learned she was Susan Thunder.While the company was downsizing (dot-com bust) the CTO told me to batten down the hatches while Susan was being laid off. I told him that I&#39;m fairly confident she knows more about NT than I do and that I didn&#39;t think I could do enough to secure things, so we more or less shut things down for the night.I sort of remember the whole company being scared of her in general. I don&#39;t know why though, she was always very nice to me and seemed pleasant in general. It was an overreaction to shut down the network that night, Susan never attempted revenge. In hindsight, she was probably an adult that understood that companies fail and it wasn&#39;t personal."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"OSTEP by Remzi and Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau is a great read for anybody interested in operating systems (https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/). The projects in their class at the University of Wisconsin-Madison were mainly making edits to the xv6 OS."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I came across this course after going through the 6.824 from RTM last year and enjoying the hands on approach a lot! Teaching using the xv6 OS (https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2012/xv6.html) is super valuable. I do not consider myself an expert in operating systems or C, but digging through the xv6 source code is quite fun, the code is easily readable and very newby friendly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not familiar with xv6, but I remember using Pintos for my undergraduate level Operating Systems course around a dozen years ago.I still chuckle at another student&#39;s description of the class... &#34;a crash course in enabling and disabling interrupts in order to prevent segfaults and pagefaults."</p>

But you&#39;ve really got your head up your own ass if you convince yourself that you are protecting people by deciding the information that is appropriate for them to be exposed to. I just don&#39;t understand the shortsightedness, the naivete, or the willingness to discard the principle of free speech."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The funny thing is that everyone commenting here thinks that we&#39;re headed towards an authoritarian nightmare, but for different reasons.It&#39;s not until you sit with someone and nut out what they mean by &#34;authoritarian&#34; and &#34;censorship&#34; and so on that you realise you&#39;re completely morally and politically opposed to them.This shallow political take is what allows so many strange bedfellows to unite on the &#34;political right&#34; (which is no longer really a relevant tag).I&#39;m reminded of this amazing review by George Orwell:&#34;Yet each writer is convinced that the other’s policy leads directly to slavery, and the alarming thing is that they may both be right.&#34;https://maudestavern.com/2008/10/09/george-orwell-review/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I say Bah to the entire censorship debate!My critique of Substack is that our lesson from the last ten years is simple: speech should happen primarily on platforms that are prohibited from profit-seeking and run in the public interest. Censorship on these platforms should be prohibited, of course, but so should any form of profit seeking.Our problem isn&#39;t censorship. Our problem is that our political/economic/religious/public health discourse is entirely mediated by corporations that are helmed by clever and well-educated folks and funded by the tippy-top of the elite financier class, who expect exceptional ROI."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;&#34;&#34;
One could imagine a very imperative “cluster operating system,” like the above, which exposed primitives like “allocate 5 CPUs worth of compute” or “create a new virtual network,” which in turn backed onto configuration changes either in the system’s internal abstractions or into calls into the EC2 API (or other underlying cloud provider).
&#34;&#34;&#34;There is a name for this: Single System Image. There is no need to write the operating system layer - Linux works well.I built a SSI. Each grid can host several apps, &#39;gridapps&#39;. As priorities change during the day, an operator can rebalance resources using a bash-like shell. Each gridapp has (1) core nodes, which need to keep running, and (2) scale nodes which can be started and stopped. Nodes can be configured so they are taskset-bound to an individual processor, or sharing a processor between several nodes. There are equivalent primitives for memory and persistent storage. Commercial, 1000 cores.The author contrasts this with K8s by saying that K8s is declarative. This is not the important distinction. My system had declarative configuration, and did a fitting at startup.The key difference is motive. The design above is the natural choice when you build a grid computer from first-principles.K8s is designed to solve a different problem: scaling up the traditional model of programming. Here, a developer writes an algorithm on their workstation. The deployment circumstances and interactions with other systems are an afterthought. Often this developer does not deploy the code themselves, this is done by another team who don&#39;t understand the internals of the code."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"(Disclaimer: I have never used k8s, so cannot assess the factual accuracy of this piece.)If Kubernetes hasn’t yet incorporated this article into their documentation somewhere prominent, they should. This is an excellent, and crucial, piece of documentation: providing a mental model and explaining key design decisions. All complex systems should have a document like this one. As a newcomer, this is what I want to read first.Bravo, author. I hope you get rewarded."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not mentioned in this writeup, is the added complexity of not using IPv6 inside.IPv6 has an on-demand, probabalistic-unique unroutable address assignment model called ULA and it was made for something like this. Instead of NAT and the like, this framework could have been using semantic address models in the bits of the IPv6 address space, and delivered V6 to the edge.But they went v4 only, and acquired all the growing pains of making that work."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I generally enjoy my AirPods. They are occasionally quirky, but most of the time they really do “just work” for me. The annoyances are annoying when they happen, though.The strangest part is that the annoyances aren’t getting any better over time. At first I assumed that they were growing pains of an early product launch. Yet now we’re years into the AirPods experience and they continue to be just as quirky as when I first got them.Apple seems so hot or cold on fixing their own bugs. Certain bugs get rapidly patched in the next iOS or Mac software release. Other bugs languish for what feels like forever. Do Apple execs just not use AirPods? Are they using a different configuration or hardware combination that doesn’t have these bugs? Have they just trained themselves to overlook the bugs because the workarounds have become a reflex? I can’t imagine working at any tech company where one of the flagship products had such a high rate of annoyances without having a lot of engineers diverted to replicating, diagnosing, and fixing it ASAP."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s weird to me how many people are like &#34;yeah but every other bluetooth is worse&#34;. I have Airpod Pros and experienced every one of these issues and many more on the regular with them, but my several years old now Bose QC 35II never have any of these problems, still last like 5 times as long on battery after years of recharge cycles, interact better with two simultaneously connected devices, have better signal range before dropping out, and I can control the damned volume without trying a dozen times to get Siri to wake the fuck up because airpods have no built-in volume controls and Siri&#39;s voice activation is worse than terrible.The Airpods are set to connect automatically to my macbook when I wear them AND THEY DON&#39;T. EVER. And then calls on my iPhone will stupidly decide to connect and route audio to airpods that I&#39;m not even wearing while they are just sitting on my desk when the phone was literally moments before using the handset speaker for a video. Know what bluetooth device does not have these problems? You guessed it, the one not made by Apple. Like...come on.I really want to like airpods, but they&#39;re just not good."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s a few more:- Airpods sometimes do not charge when in the case. Usually need to pull it out and put back in again.- Knowing what airpod(s) and case are charging. The UI on the phone, the open the case sliding window, the widgets, and the case light itself are not very useful.- Spatial audio working on some apps but you&#39;re not usually aware if it&#39;s on until you tilt an ear one way to confirm.- Out of ear detection sometimes doesn&#39;t work well and will drain the respective airpod.- No preference list of what devices should have precedence over others. Especially when working on 2+ devices.- Hand-off calls is a weird UX. Why would I answer a phone on my iPhone by default when it&#39;s clear I have airpods connected and being used?- The transparency / noise cancelling dance. Not sure if there&#39;s a preference, but it feels random which one is on by default. Always do a double check at the gym or when running as outside noise sounds loud.Still the best headphones and experience in my opinion and have enabled me to achieve a hell of a lot more because of them. Easily worth the price for how much I use them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; It costs $10,000 USD to build one of these&gt; The ten thousandth one costs $15As a software engineer, I&#39;m used to being able to build essentially whatever I want, with the only cost being my time. I&#39;m often unpleasantly reminded that software is an outlier in that regard and as soon as physical items are concerned, especially hardware, it turns out that manufacturing even a simple thing is prohibitively expensive if it&#39;s done at a small scale."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is nice. This is a simple, straightforward design, and a reasonably convenient form factor.Two biggest limitations are RAM and wireless interfaces, or rather lack thereof. This thing has less RAM than my router (admittedly a $70 box), and has neither WiFi nor BT. It does not seem to have many GPIO pins, too.With the amount of RAM installed, it&#39;s mostly a handheld terminal, and maybe a handheld console with emulators for old games.While this is admirable as a proof of concept, I suspect that moving the price point up to, say, $30 could give a much more useful and hacker-friendly device.I greatly appreciate the split keyboard and the replaceable NiMH batteries, though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In China we buy second-hand Redmi 2 for 60RMB each (roughly $9.5). Can be bought in quantities. Fully functional with 2GB RAM+16GB eMMC, and battery, touchscreen, WiFi, Bluetooth, camera, and even 4G support. It&#39;s not built from scratch like this one, but if you are just looking for something cheap, then this price is insane."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have never understood people who mourn the death of the &#34;old&#34; internet because I do not feel I have lost it. Particular communities come and go, as they always have, but I have found that the I can find the same sorts of gathering places for the same kinds of people I always have - in about the same numbers too.The thing that has changed is that a huge swath of new people have come online and, though some of what brought them online is wider access to connectivity, a lot of what brought them online are new kinds of communities. They showed up for social media and most of them just aren&#39;t that interested in the things that made up the &#34;old&#34; internet.I put &#34;old&#34; in quotes because people have kept and maintained the parts they love. You can still play MUDs, you can still visit BBSes, people still run Hotline servers[1]! Many of these communities have changed because the world has changed: lots of people who played MUDs in 1990 have moved on to other online games, but lots have not! Critically - tools have continued to be developed. You can use IRCCloud (and be told it makes you a bad IRC&#39;er), you can play MUDs on your phone, etc. These communities have changed with the times and improved for it.My sense is that the absolute number of people who are involved in these communities has dropped, but not actually by that much? Maybe half as many people play MUDs now as they did at the peak - but it&#39;s a steady half. I think of it like the communities around vinyl or around film photography: less central than they once were, but healthy and vital.I am really glad that people who were not online at all during their peak are discovering these older forms. We have kept them for good reasons. But don&#39;t call it a comeback, they have been here for years.[1] https://hotline.fandom.com/wiki/Clients"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I sure hope that&#39;s right. It was the best feeling in the world to stand up an Apache server on my Amiga, and later my little FreeBSD server, and see my friends viewing the website I was hosting on my dialup connection. It wasn&#39;t pretty, it wasn&#39;t elegant, and it certainly wasn&#39;t fast, but it was mine. I made that. From installing the server to writing the HTML, I owned that service from end to end and had completely freedom to do whatever I wanted with it.That&#39;s what I want the Internet to look like for my younger family and friends. It&#39;ll probably never happen exactly this way, but I can picture someone running an IPv6-only service on their phone to impress their friends. I know what their smile would look like because that was once my smile, too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like this article doesn&#39;t address the reason why people moved away from the &#34;old&#34; Internet --- most people only care about their _content_ not the particular technology that backs it.In the old times, you could only host content if you were really good with the technology. The people who had websites were people who knew how to set up and run a web server, and to compose the HTML content that was being served. Similarly, communities who ran BBS forums, mailing lists, IRC, etc. all needed at least some people who could set up and manage the technology for them.Centralized services (Web 2.0) changed that. Now all of a sudden you didn&#39;t need to run your server --- you could just type some text and click some buttons to put up a blog on a shared service (myspace? blogger? wordpress.com?). You didn&#39;t need to run your own forum or mailing list or chat rooms, you could just put your community on an existing service that provided that (Google groups, FB/Whatsapp/&lt;insert your IM&gt; Chat). Need a forum? You have reddit. What is Twitter if not just a collection of mailing lists that you can openly subscribe to but not post on? Centralization allowed the vast majority of people to do what they wanted to do while &#34;outsourcing&#34; the technology part to somebody else, because most people don&#39;t care about the technology they care about their content.The problem with the modern decentralized web (3.0?) is that we haven&#39;t focused on solving the real problem --- making it easy to manipulate _content_. If anything, setting up a Web 3.0 presence is _harder_ than it was on a centralized service, and as long as it remains harder, the new &#34;old&#34; Internet will always be a niche."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; I feel like I&#39;m encountering more and more sites and articles where I can&#39;t seem to find the date.It seems to me that its become standard practice on marketing type blogs for corporate websites to remove the date from their posts. I think its because (from personal experience) the company will go though a burst of &#34;blog productivity&#34; create a load of content but then not touch it for years, they don&#39;t want that content to look out of date or their website to look stagnant.Removing the date from their posts, or any other content, hides how old it is and therefore obscures how active they are at crating new content.Most companies try to use their blogs to attract new customers, a new customer may visit their website once or twice and will never see the blog again, it&#39;s not important that they do. They don&#39;t want it to look stale.As a counter example, an interesting thread from yesterday [0] was about how CloudFlare use their blog not as a marketing tool but for technical content and attracting employees. They very regulally use their blog, and so keep the date on it showing how fresh it is.0: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30070422"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Anecdote: On of the best friends of my oldest daughter moved to a new rented flat recently. When I saw the address for a playdate, I recognised it and said to my daughter &#34;I think you went to a birthday party at this address when you were 3-5 years old when another of your friends must have lived here&#34;. To corroborate this, I looked up the calendar on my phone, where I&#39;m pretty organised about putting dates and locations of events. However, at that point I discovered that Google Calendar only keeps 2 years of history!So modern technology is literally erasing our pasts. Not just calendar entries, but messaging systems (people used to keep handwritten letters for decades), and possibly even photos (if we&#39;re not careful about preserving them).Edit: See my clarification of the 2 years in comment https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30084620 below. I still think the point remains - we do not own or value our digital data in the same way as physical objects, and there is a much heightened risk of that data disappearing as a result, either by the owners of the platforms the data is stored on archiving the data or by us not valuing it enough to preserve exports and backups through long periods of time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google&#39;s search quality has taken a serious nosedive in the last couple of years - the last 6 months in particular.I think they implemented some new form of search term widening which is far too strong, so the results you want are often buried among pages and pages of results for the general category of things that you searched for rather than close matches for your keywords. Combined with the recency bias that other people have talked about and you end up with a lot less useful search for precise searching.This coincides with a large increase in the number of surveys that my partner has been getting through the Google Rewards program that ask whether or not a recently used search term gave relevant results. Obviously that&#39;s just anecdotal, but it does feel like there are substantial changes in the algorithm, and not necessarily for the better."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Takeaway: to dramatically decrease the chance of Google rewriting your title, matching the H1 to the title tag seems to be an effective strategy.Of course it should be mentioned this wont last if it becomes popular. Historically every time an SEO trick gets popular, the rules are adjusted. Even having this article on the front page of HN might be enough to see Google react by rethinking how (or whether) tags in titles affect the title rewrites."</p>

That doesn&#39;t sound too much and is roughly about the same what people pay for cars today, maybe even more.The reason she thought about the car as a luxury and not a necessity is that then the society wasn&#39;t dependent on cars like we do today.

You had to pay it then and you have to pay it now.&#34;four bedrooms, two sitting rooms, and a “nice outlook on green.” The rent was £90 for a year.&#34;According to one CPI calculator (https://www.in2013dollars.com) &#34;£90 in 1919 is equivalent in purchasing power to about £4,951.54 today&#34; and &#34;£700 in 1919 is equivalent in purchasing power to about £38,511.97 today&#34;.Google search also reveals that average yearly wage in London in 1920 was £205 and average wage in London in 2021 was £53,700 so £700 income in 1919 was 3.5 times the average which in 2021 would be £187,950 (quite a bit more than &#34;equivalent in purchasing power to about £38,511.97 today&#34;).A quick web search for 4 bedroom apartment (not sure about sitting rooms) in London shows that rent is between £2,000 and £8,000 per month - let&#39;s say £5,000 for a nice one like what Christie&#39;s sounds like which is £60,000 per year.
They paid £90/£700 = 13% of their (3.5 the average) annual income for rent and now the equivalent rent would be £60,000/£187,950 = 32% of the 3.5 the average annual income.Even just comparing the plain average income, person in 1919 could rent the same apartment and still have £205 - £90 = £115 to live on for the year (which seems possible considering maid lived on £36 per year but in 2021 the average income leaves you £53,700 - £60,000 = £6,300 short on the rent alone.So ignoring the tvs, computers, holidays, cars, healthcare and all the things that we cannot compare and comparing what we can, it is obvious that just to live in 2021 we need more money that what we are making and so it is easy to see how most people feel that the living standards have gone down."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interestingly enough, I&#39;m typing this in Singapore, where in 2022 it&#39;s quite common to have a &#34;maid&#34; (helper/domestic worker, in the current local lingo), but no car.Singapore imports domestic workers for poor neighbouring countries like the Philippines and Myanmar, which keeps wages very low, on the order of US$450/month, not too far off Christie&#39;s inflation-adjusted US$220/month.  Even the fully loaded cost with government levies, insurance, food &amp; board etc is on the order of $1000/month, considerably cheaper than most other childcare options, particularly if like most Singaporeans both parents work longer hours.By comparison, Singapore strictly limits the number of cars on the road, auctioning permits called &#34;Certificates of Entitlement&#34; to the highest bidder and imposing around 100% taxes on the cars themselves.  As a result, a plain vanilla Toyota Corolla costs US$120,000 all in.  What&#39;s more, half of that is the COE cost, which is valid for only 10 years, meaning the value of the car depreciates by around $10,000 every year.  Add in petrol, servicing, parking etc, and having a live-in helper to run errands and drop off kids etc starts to look quite affordable in comparison."</p>

The contract isn&#39;t a wholesale deal, meaning if your widget doesn&#39;t sell, it&#39;s sitting on your balance sheet, not on Amazon&#39;s balance sheet. It would be like if Costco instead of buying 1000 legos, just stocked legos in it&#39;s warehouse, then paid Lego company everytime a single unit sold. 
Then they figured out how to make their own legos through a different supplier, they fixed the original Lego price $5 more expensive then the store brand legos. Now Legos sell for $30 a box and Kirkland Legos sell for $25 a box, same exact product, just a few bucks cheaper. Oh and lego couldn&#39;t drop the price from 30 to 20 to compete....That&#39;s what Amazon has done. Price fixing and control of the competitors inventory. Damn bastards."</p>

With SBA, Amazon prices your products and owns any transactions that take place. When an item sells, they pass the proceeds on to you for allowing them to sell your product.

    With FBA, you price your products and own the transactions. It is a service where Amazon handles the order fulfillment process for your products.&#34;

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m the author of esbuild. I think this is a very smart, practical choice and is one of the approaches that has the best chance of succeeding (the other being a semi-automated porting tool instead of a purely manual port). I&#39;m very excited to see someone take this approach. This is how I would do it if I were to do it. Web developers around the world are hoping this works out :)The hard part about this project isn&#39;t doing the port but keeping up with the constant changes from the TypeScript team, especially if the TypeScript team isn&#39;t invested in helping you out. Staying as close as possible to the source language like this will be a big win there.One of the big benefits of a native language like Go aside from lack of a JIT is the ability to easily add shared-memory parallelism. I haven&#39;t studied the TypeScript compiler internals so I&#39;m not sure how easy it is to parallelize their type checker. However, I assume that it would be relatively straightforward to parallelize the parsing of JavaScript files, so I&#39;d hope for at least be a big speedup there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of when people try to make a new Ruby implementation. They get the basics down and think &#34;this isn&#39;t so bad! I can do this!&#34;. Fast forward a few months and they&#39;re stuck on some nasty little edge case around eval and method_missing that they need to run Rails. Or some weird aspect of C extensions.TypeScript&#39;s compiler is an unholy, unsound mess, because JavaScript is an unholy, unsound mess. Sure the basics of type checking structs and variables is somewhat easy. But what about conditional types? What about weird generic constraints? What about indexing types? There&#39;s some really confusing stuff going on underneath the hood.It&#39;s also a mess that *does not have a spec*. Even if you somehow manage to  make a type checker that implements most of the features, there&#39;s no way to ensure it has 1 to 1 parity with TypeScript. Plus that parity can be broken at any point.The only way I could see this happening is if the author somehow convinced Anders Hejlsberg or a significant portion of the TypeScript team to work on this new implementation. I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s gonna happen."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; tsc depends on shared mutability and has a cyclical mutable reference.
 Rust is designed to prevent this behavior.
Having two references to the same data (shared mutability)
 is undefined behavior in Rust.This problem has numerous solutions in Rust - (A)Rc, RefCell etc. I don&#39;t understand how this caused the author of the article to stop considering Rust."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Something from the NYT mailing list yesterday:&gt; The Covid vaccines are remarkably effective at preventing serious illness. If you’re vaccinated, your chances of getting severely sick are extremely low. Even among people 65 and older, the combination of the vaccines’ effectiveness and the Omicron variant’s relative mildness means that Covid now appears to present less danger than a normal flu.&gt; For the unvaccinated, however, Covid is worse than any other common virus. It has killed more than 865,000 Americans, the vast majority unvaccinated. In the weeks before vaccines became widely available, Covid was the country’s No. 1 cause of death, above even cancer and heart disease.At this point if an adult in the US is unvaccinated it is (1) almost certainly by choice (there are some people who cannot get it for medical reasons but they make up only a very tiny fraction of the unvaccinated), and (2) it is very unlikely that any evidence or logical arguments will chance their minds.With COVID becoming endemic everyone is going to get antibodies, with the only choice being whether you get your first antibodies by vaccination or by getting COVID.The only question really then is how fast do we want the unvaccinated to do the getting antibodies by getting COVID thing. The faster they get it, the faster we can be as done with COVID as we are ever going to be.I&#39;d say the answer to that should be determined by the hospital capacity. If a region has sufficient hospital capacity that it would not be overwhelmed by the increase in COVID cases among the unvaccinated go ahead and lift most restrictions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The media&#39;s binary separation of populations into vax and unvax is a false dichotomy. More causal factors would be represented by:  1. Covid-recovered 
  2. Vaccinated
  3. Partly-vaccinated (&lt; 14 days after 2nd shot)
  4. Covid-naive + Unvaccinated

CDC reporting bundles #3 and #4.  UK reports all 4 categories separately.#1 was already a high percentage in 2021 and is now higher due to Omicron.Edit: CDC estimated pre-Omicron #1 as 146 million people (as of Oct 2021), https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/burd..."</p>

ARM is clearly less valuable as part of NVidia with all the conflicts of interest that entails than as an independent company.  NVidia talked about synergies but they could pursue all of those with an architectural license for far less money.  It&#39;s actually something of a pattern that most mergers fail to provide synergy and destroy value, it&#39;s just that they enlarge the empire of the CEO and so seem attractive from that standpoint."</p>

If the Nvidia deal is dead - which seems likely - then floating clearly seems unlikely to offer the prospect of the return that SoftBank was expecting when it paid a premium for Arm.The key question from an Arm user / customer’s perspective seems to be ‘Can Arm as a stand-alone company finance the investment it meets to stay competitive?’[1] https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/61d81a458fa8f..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wrote a thread[0] on Pixel 3 (trying to convince Google to extend the support) a few months before it went EoL[3] (Oct &#39;21). Here&#39;s the important bits:- 10M+ Pixel 3 devices that were sold worldwide- 72% of Pixel 3&#39;s estimated lifecycle emissions are from its manufacturing[1]. Using your phone is _not the source of most of the emissions during a phone&#39;s lifecycle_.- It has gotten worse over time, but Google hasn&#39;t offered better guaranttes. Pixel 5&#39;s emissions-over-lifetime are 30% higher than that of Pixel 3.The alleged reason Google can&#39;t offer support beyond 3 years is because of Google&#39;s dependence on Qualcomm for the support[2]. Apparently Qualcomm asks for a ridiculous amount of money to support any chip beyond a measly 2-3 years. Apple gets away with it by building their own chips, and Pixel 6 is guaranteed to be supported for 5 years as a result.However, the fact that Google - one of the world&#39;s richest corporation can&#39;t convince or pay Qualcomm to support a perfectly functional device in 2022 is astonishing.[0]: https://twitter.com/captn3m0/status/1427908406086553601[1]: https://storage.googleapis.com/mannequin/sustainability/repo...[2]: https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/03/the-fairphone-2-hits...[3]: https://endoflife.date/pixel"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Honestly, Google needs really needs to do better.  Samsung has raised the bar by supporting its devices with 4 years of patches: https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295639/samsung-galaxy-d....  And frankly, how hard/expensive would it be to support these devices for far longer? Google is a massive company, and I see little reason why that can&#39;t employ a team of devs backporting patches to older phones. Current versions of Windows and Linux run happily on decades-old hardware, so a phone should at least be able to get patches for known security issues for a decade.  Dev resources would be far better spent on this than yet another hamfisted attempt to build a messenger app that they&#39;ll kill in a couple years anyway."</p>

I think the JWST project is in good hands.Edit:
I guess Destin is not a &#39;random&#39; You-tuber, but someone that was well-placed to connect with Dr. Mather. Still, he&#39;s not CNN or BBC - he&#39;s a guy with a handheld camera that doesn&#39;t ask fluff question, but questions intended to help inform himself and his audience.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Me and the wife visited the RM in Nov 2019.  The painting is rather large, so 717 Giga pixels doesn&#39;t go as far as you would think but you get quite close to the textures that you would see close up.Whilst you are there, please note there is rather a lot more to see than the one picture.  The architecture is worth noting too.  My overriding impression of the piccies on display is: &#34;sumptuous&#34;.  That&#39;s probably not in the fine arts&#39;s lexicon of superlatives but my personal experience.The model boaty exhibition is not as jarring as it might sound, alongside some very serious artwork exhibitions and is great fun.  It doesn&#39;t seem to really belong there at first blush but I do understand that naval prowess is rather important to the Netherlander psyche, so perhaps that legitimises it.  It does give you a bit of relief after having rather a lot of important art thrown at you.All in all, I cannot recommend the Rijks&#39; highly enough.  If you go anywhere near the Low Countries, then slap it on your itinerary.  The coffee is quite reasonable in the entrance cafe, too."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The malware is a cherry on top, but the story before that is pretty awful already, and unfortunately seems to be representative of specialized software like that: proprietary (with constant risk of malware, indeed), awkward, poorly (if at all) documented, likely the protocols to speak to the hardware without it are kept in secret, and occasional shipment of Windows machines where just software would do (but probably it&#39;s written to just barely work on a given system, and won&#39;t run on others easily).I think the main and annoying problem is those general practices, not just a single instance of malware.Edit: Apparently some focus on the &#34;Chinese&#34; part, but I suspect that hardware being specialized and software being shipped by the hardware manufacturer are larger factors here: at least all the awkwardness before the malware part I&#39;ve observed to be approximately similar with hardware+software produced by Chinese, European, and US companies."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Given that Windows 7 _Ultimate_ was installed on what is essentially an OEM machine, it&#39;s very likely that it&#39;s a pirated copy with a &#34;home brewed&#34; license key.I think the most reasonable explanation is that either the OS was sourced already infected, or the crack tool they used was infected."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The story here is not the fact of the malware - it is the purpose of the malware: industrial espionage. China is well-known in industry for its sheer volume and brazenness of industrial espionage. A pick-and-place machine is especially well placed for this since it will, by necessity, have access to PCB designs and BOMs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m good at working on a team and looping in others. I also find it to be one of the most exhausting parts of software development. It&#39;s so difficult to constantly need to get feedback and buy-in from other people, and takes away a lot of the creativity and joy in programming (for me).Which isn&#39;t to say you shouldn&#39;t do it, just that it&#39;s one of the things that makes me dislike working on a team. I actually think this may be one of the factors in burnout for a lot of developers. Writing code as a team is almost like writing a novel with a few dozen other people, all of which have differing ideas on how the book should be written, or even what it should be about. It&#39;s hard to feel the joy in creating something when you&#39;re only a small cog in the development machine, and every decision needs a dozen voices of input.It&#39;s disempowering to feel like you&#39;re never able to make a decision yourself, despite supposedly being hired for your expertise in the field.&gt; Always encourage engineers to show their work as quickly as possible – an engineer on a project should never go more than a week without showing something, and usually it should be more like a day.&#34;usually it should be more like a day&#34; is bad advice in my opinion, and a likely source of micro management. Let professionals do their work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; &#34;the biggest mistake I see engineers make is doing too much work on their own before looping in others&#34;&gt; &#34;For more senior engineers, it can happen because they like to work on their own and may be overconfident in finding solutions.  It can also happen if the team culture is toxic and engineers fear getting criticism early in the design process.&#34;Not saying the above statement is incorrect but here is an alternative explanation that is also viable: Senior Engineers are often hired into large large projects so that the company has the capability to address emergencies or modify the existing system accurately as it is often more difficult to work on a large complex code base than to build a new one from scratch. Those engineers sometimes never get to work on greenfield projects and &#34;doing too much work on their own before looping in others&#34; is a way to scratch this itch without the opportunity being taken away prematurely. It also offers chance to produce memorable work as nobody remembers the set of 3 point tasks you completed ten sprints ago."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"At least two things happened here:- The pandemic gave most people an unusually-long period of time at home to help them realize all the things they could have been doing (e.g. spending more time with family, not being stuck in a commute), if only their work had not been sucking up all their time and energy.- Income vs. expenses changed to the point where people couldn’t hope to pay off their debts even if they worked.  Work has not been paying anywhere near enough.  At that point, what is there to lose: if you will be swamped and in debt with work, and you will also be swamped and in debt without work, at least the 2nd option means finally not having to put up with the crap from many workplaces.Also, it has just become clearer and clearer where all the lies were told.  Society did not treat “essential” workers that way at all.  There was all kinds of prioritization of bottom line over employee health, especially early on.  We all assumed that governments could/would do a lot more to help.  Heap on all the unfilled promises for promotions, raises, etc. and many workers just have no reason at all to give a crap anymore."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why is the central bank inflation target typically 2%?Well if you target 0% and any actual result below 0% happens, that&#39;s deflation which is a disaster for economies.If inflation is say 10%. Maximum employment is near certainly impossible. Debt will be expensive and the economy crawls to a halt. Who wants to pay 10% interest on their student debt?So where in between do you have a good price stability? It tends to be around 2%. It allows for error in measurement, it provides safe cushion.The USA is at 7% inflation. This means the central bank is not doing their job. They by mandate should have drastically increased interest rates. Inflation almost certainly is out of control now. Looking at central bank balance sheets that are very far from balance, and looking at money supply M2. There&#39;s a solid 40% inflation coming. Lets say it sticks to 7%, this inflation will last probably 4 years.When inflation is so high and interest rates are not. The people winning are those in debt. Which is the government and youngins. However, it also means you cant save money. You must spend money as soon as possible. Tourism is dead for many years.Flipside, what does this also do? It pressures salaries. You are making 7% less this year but you&#39;re making 115% less the next year. So anyone in demand will be in demand and be able to buck the inflation curve.The people most hurt by high inflation are those who just retired. They no longer can demand more $ for their productivity. Their &#39;safe&#39; investments are way below inflation. They don&#39;t realize yet they cant afford to be retired."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The Great Renegotiation is also a byproduct of inflation. Workers are seeking better pay to keep up with the rising cost of living.Keeping in mind small business is collectively the largest employer and contributor to US output... let&#39;s remember the coming rate hikes will greatly reduce available cash to small businesses that operate with credit lines, credit card debt or via home equity lines. That is a LOT of US businesses. Now add to this increased input costs due to inflation. Now add increased tax rates. You can also expect lending requirements will tighten.So, it&#39;s worth considering the odds of worker prosperity (vs) the odds of a wave of business failures and associated unemployment/underemployment in many (but by no means all) sectors.Personally, I think the Fed &amp; Treasury will continue fiscal stimulus and capitulate hard in the face of a deep recession. More of the same can kicking, and we&#39;ll see what seems like prosperity. In reality, it&#39;s a delay of an inevitable downturn unless some magical productivity innovation or goods/services advance emerges to rescue the US economy."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Yes. In the EU product &#34;denatured alcohol&#34; for most purposes is likewise treated with the same agent. This replaces the widespread use of methanol and similar products which are poisonous (yes even if you call the product &#34;meths&#34; it probably isn&#39;t methanol in the EU today). The rationale is that poisoning people is not an appropriate reaction to attempted tax avoidance. Alcohol is only &#34;denatured&#34; because booze is taxed, there&#39;s no technical reason to use poison, and so the EU took the poison out, for the same reason it doesn&#39;t execute or torture criminals."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I had Covid in December, I briefly lost my sense of smell and taste (only for a few days, thankfully). I decided I would see if the Switch cartridges tasted as bad as I remembered - purely in the interests of science, of course.I couldn&#39;t taste it at first, but then the wave of toxic unpleasantness slowly built up, even after I had moved the cartridge away from my tongue. It was different than I remembered it being, but then again it had been a few years since I tried it (probably spurred by this same headline). Really horrible. Good to know that this bitterant it still is a deterrent if you have anosmia!"</p>

With Cloudflare in front of AWS I paid $300 per month to AWS. With Linode in front of AWS and behind Cloudflare I paid $20 per month to Linode and about $12 per month to AWS.A Linode, Hetzner instance... or any other dumb cheap web server that comes with a healthy free tier of bandwidth is all you need to set up a simple nginx reverse proxy and have it cache things to disk https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/content-cache/conte..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ah the old cloud provider switcheroo. Yip this is the way they make money. They make it easy to setup some gigantic hugely scalable website then hit you with a gigantic scaled up bill. AWS would do this as well.Team I&#39;m in at the moment is in the early stages of cloud adoption but the company in total has fell hook line and sinker for AWS. When I mentioned the cost there is always an excuse.The main one being that you don&#39;t have to hire sysadmins anymore as that&#39;s taken care now by AWS. Ah yes but they have actually been replaced with a &#34;DevOps&#34; team plus just our department now spend &gt; £1 million per year to AWS in hosting costs. A 20% reduction in those fees could pay for a few sysadmin(s).The next one is that no other vendor would be able to supply the kit. You know StackOverflow is able to run on a single webserver (https://nickcraver.com/blog/2016/02/17/stack-overflow-the-ar...). Plus many of the other providers have loads of instances available.I mean I&#39;m not against cloud it&#39;s just not the cheapest option if you choose one of the big 3 providers. I use a company called scaleway (https://www.scaleway.com/en/) they have all the essential cloud services you need and everything else you can run yourself in docker or k8s."</p>

I had a large file with sequences of 9 digit numbers specific to our use-case, all tied to names of people (employees). Whelp, at one point the tool I was working on stopped working, and it was flagged as apparently containing social security numbers (which I suppose matched the character length).Whelp, on the admin panel, you can get a report of those files, and then mark it as a false positive. Which I did. But then nothing happened, and nothing changed. It was no use.The hilarious bit: It did, of course, allow me to make a copy of the file in question, and then just point the resource I was building to the new file, which was exactly the same. Weeks later... so far, so good."</p>

Starting around Win8, the designers had full control, and most crucially essentially none of the designers use Windows.I spent far too many years of my career sitting in conference rooms explaining to the newest designer (because they seem to rotate every 6-18 months) with a shiny Macbook why various ideas had been tried and failed in usability studies because our users want X, Y, and Z.https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30019307"</p>

If you need the Adobe tools, you can get them for Macs and, since M1, Macs offer a lot of bang for the buck while being a perfectly usable Unix machine, they are an excellent choice.If you don&#39;t need tools that aren&#39;t available on Linux, then Linux is a really good option. Hardware support may be an issue, so I always recommend the most boring machines possible - Intel, with integrated graphics - and only get components you know will work well with Linux."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been using Nix and NixOS for a while and I&#39;ve seen four core advantages:1. Nix store: what the article covers: multiple versions of the same package, &#34;virtualenv for everything&#34;... etc2. Reproducibility: because package definitions are self-contained, I can pin and reliably reproduce everything for my packages. And I do mean everything.3. Flexibility: Nix works for system packages on NixOS as well as user packages on any Linux or macOS. I&#39;ve been sharing like 70% of my system config between Linux and macOS, and I don&#39;t know of any other tool that can do that.4. Programmability: package definitions and config are extensible and composable. Yes, learning an ad hoc language to do this is a pain, but once I learned it I got a higher-level and better-abstracted way to define and combine packages than any other tool I&#39;ve used. It&#39;s like going from C to OCaml. At this point I&#39;ve started hating Dockerfiles because they can&#39;t easily be composed and don&#39;t provide any real facilities for abstraction.Ultimately, Nix took system management from feeling like an operational activity—maintaining and changing a bunch of mutable state to run the system—to declarative programming. Learning curve aside, making system management a reproducible programming activity with no system state to worry about has been a massive improvement."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I tried using NixOS on a laptop for a month and switched back to Arch a couple of months ago. It was an interesting experience - I never used functional programming language before, but nix was pretty ok as a configuration language. It looks like funny version of JSON with functions.Debugging it was a real pain though - I was trying to write (or copy from someone else config) a function to recursively import all modules from a folder and the error messages were hard to understand with stacktraces ending somewhere deep in standard library.The other problem was with nixpkgs, i.e. I haven&#39;t found a clear list of packages that were going to be updated. Jetbrains IDEA was updating very slowly and when I wanted to pin a version of it simply overriding version variable in the overlay was not enough - there were also some other linked variables. Emacs package from custom overlay constantly tried to compile itself, requiring me to check build status on hydra build system.In the end I decided that it&#39;s not really worth it. I don&#39;t have many systems and services to manage and for a raspberry pi and a vps multiple docker-compose.yaml files in git repo is enough. 
I think Henrik Lissner (author of Doom Emacs) wrote a really good piece about why someone should choose to use NixOS - https://github.com/hlissner/dotfiles#frequently-asked-questi..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;&#34;&#34;The first is relatively simple: they developed their own programming language to do configuration, which is not very good and is extremely difficult to learn. The vast majority of people using NixOS do not understand the language, and simply copy/paste example configurations, which mostly works until you need to do something complicated, at which point you&#39;re completely high and dry.&#34;&#34;&#34;Maybe this is nitpicking, but: the Nix language is about as straightforward as &#34;JSON plus functions&#34;. Maybe that is difficult for people who haven&#39;t had an experience with pure/functional programming?Though, yes, the way Nix is used can be quite complicated/sophisticated. -- Even if all of Nixpkgs were translated to JavaScript, I think it&#39;d still be complicated to understand. (Though I suspect using a more general purpose language would allow for more footguns).+1 to the sentiment that most of the time you can get by just fine, but when you can&#39;t, NixOS is more difficult to make progress with compared to other Linux distributions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I like it, it&#39;s readable, unlike some SQL alternatives I&#39;ve seen it doesn&#39;t make me feel like I&#39;m dumb and don&#39;t understand what a query even is.I can&#39;t decide if it would be better or worse if it stuck more closely to SQL keywords. You use &#34;from&#34; and &#34;select&#34;, but not &#34;where&#34;, &#34;order by&#34;, &#34;group by&#34;. There&#39;s some danger of it being in an uncanny valley of SQLish, but I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;d prefer just using those terms verbatim (including the space in &#34;order by&#34;... that style is less common in modern languages but it&#39;s not really that much harder to parse).I&#39;d like to see more examples of joins and composing SQL. Does this language make it easier to make more general SQL queries? Can I take two queries and squash them together in a reliable way? I feel like I end up with a lot of theme and variation in my queries, often involving optional filters.I might even like a notion of encapsulation that could help this query language when it&#39;s embedded in other languages. Like if I could say, in the language itself, that a query has certain unbound variables (and not just ? or other placeholders). This language seems like it would be better for generating than SQL, and sometimes generation is just necessary (like in any application that supports data exploration), but for most common cases I&#39;d hope to avoid that. Defining inputs and then making whole filter sections or other statements conditional on those inputs would help here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like the flow direction compared to standard SQL.  SQL is supposed to read like a sentence I suppose but I have many times looked at it and really wanted things to be in a more logical order.My main suggestion would be to be a bit less terse and introduce a bit more firm formatting.  I&#39;m not a huge fan of the term &#34;split&#34; and feel like jazzing that up to &#34;split over&#34; or even just reviving &#34;group by&#34; would improve readability.  Additionally the aliasing could use work, I&#39;d suggest reversing the assignment to be something closer to `use salary + payroll_tax as gross salary`.  In terms of firm formatting, unless I&#39;m missing something there isn&#39;t any reason to allow a filter statement before any aliases - so you can force two fixed positions for filter clauses which would make it always legal to reference aliases in filters.On the brief topic of form vs. flexibility.  SQL is a thing that, when complex, is written by many people over the course of its lifetime - removing the ability to make bad decisions is better than enabling the ability to write simple things even simpler - those silly do nothing queries like &#34;SELECT * FROM customer WHERE deleted=&#39;f&#39;` are written once[1] in a moments time and never inspected again.  The complex queries are what you want to optimize for.1. If they even are - with ORMs available a lot of those dead simple queries just end up being done through an ORM."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Now this is actually nice, unlike the other suggestion posted today[1].Maybe I&#39;m just too used to non-standard extensions of our database but the SQL example could, at least for our db, be rewritten as    SELECT TOP 20
        title,
        country,
        AVG(salary) AS average_salary,
        SUM(salary) AS sum_salary,
        AVG(gross_salary) AS average_gross_salary,
        SUM(gross_salary) AS sum_gross_salary,
        AVG(gross_cost) AS average_gross_cost,
        SUM(gross_cost) AS sum_gross_cost,
        COUNT(*) as count
    FROM (
        SELECT
            title,
            country,
            salary,
            (salary + payroll_tax) AS gross_salary,
            (salary + payroll_tax + healthcare_cost) AS gross_cost
        FROM employees
        WHERE country = &#39;USA&#39;
    ) emp
    WHERE gross_cost &gt; 0
    GROUP BY title, country
    ORDER BY sum_gross_cost
    HAVING count &gt; 200

This cuts down the repetition a lot, and can also help the optimizer in certain cases. Could do another nesting to get rid of the HAVING if needed.Still, think the PRQL looks very nice, especially with a &#34;let&#34; keyword as mentioned in another thread here.[1]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30053860"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"His claims about HN are false. Short version: his post was 2+ hours later than Stripe&#39;s, not an hour earlier, and fell in rank because users flagged it, not because moderators did anything (which I suppose is what his mafia/mob language was intended to imply).The longer version is going to involve a tedious barrage of links, but I want this to be something that people can check for themselves if they care to.Quoting from https://twitter.com/theryanking/status/1485784877060349953 and https://twitter.com/theryanking/status/1485784882173255680:&gt; Both had organically made it up to #1 on Hacker News with 100s of upvotesTheir first post, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16215092, made it to #2 (http://hnrankings.info/16215092/) and got 171 upvotes. The second, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16870692, made it to #4 (http://hnrankings.info/16870692/) and got 70 upvotes.&gt; On April 18, 2018, we posted this: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16870692 [...] An ~hour later, this showed up: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16869290. Ours disappeared.Stripe&#39;s post (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16869290) was submitted at 17:41 UTC, and Bolt&#39;s post (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16870692) was submitted over 2 hours later, at 20:08 UTC. If you want external evidence for that, look at the hnrankings.info pages for the two posts (Stripe: http://hnrankings.info/16869290/, Bolt: http://hnrankings.info/16870692/). You&#39;ll see that they first pick up Stripe&#39;s post on the front page at 17:45 and Bolt&#39;s at 20:30. You&#39;ll also see that Stripe&#39;s post made it to #2, not #1 as he claims.Here&#39;s the HN front page at 19:09 that day: https://web.archive.org/web/20180418190904/https://news.ycom.... Stripe&#39;s post is already at #2. Bolt&#39;s hasn&#39;t been submitted yet. The first snapshot with Bolt on the front page is at 20:35: https://web.archive.org/web/20180418203508/https://news.ycom.... By 21:21, Bolt&#39;s briefly makes it higher than Stripe&#39;s: https://web.archive.org/web/20180418212112/https://news.ycom....&gt; Ours disappearedBolt&#39;s post fell in rank because it was flagged by users—that is the drop you can see in http://hnrankings.info/16870692/ and in this snapshot by 21:21: https://web.archive.org/web/20180418222105/https://news.ycom....I don&#39;t know why users flagged it. (Edit: generally, though, if you want to figure this out, the best place to look is in the comments. The top subthread in the Bolt thread is users complaining about non-transparent, enterprise-style pricing, which is a classic HN complaint. The same complaints had appeared in their earlier thread, for example https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16215604 and
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16215578. We actually downweighted both of those complaints. That&#39;s standard HN moderation when indignant comments are stuck at the top of a thread.)None of the flags came from YC founders or staff. (Edit: I looked into whether it might have been Stripe people doing the flagging here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30070445.) HN moderators did not make the post fall in rank, or moderate the post at all. I don&#39;t think I&#39;d ever heard of Bolt before today.The article no longer exists on bolt.com, but if you want to compare it to
the stripe.com article, the articles are here:https://web.archive.org/web/20180418201841/https://blog.bolt...https://web.archive.org/web/20180418171628/https://stripe.co...His insinuations about HN are false too. He&#39;s clearly insinuating that we use insider powers to favor stripe.com submissions with special treatment on HN. That&#39;s precisely what we don&#39;t do.Stripe succeeded on HN because they were favored by the community for many years. They are one of a small number of startups who have reached what you could call &#39;community darling&#39; status on HN. It&#39;s true that this is incredibly hard to do. Another startup that managed it, around the same time, was Cloudflare (not a YC startup). Startups achieve this by doing three things: producing products that the community considers good, producing articles that the community finds interesting, and mastering the art of interacting with the community. You need all three.I wish more startups would achieve this, YC or not. Whenever I run across one that&#39;s trying to succeed on HN, I try to help them do so (YC or not)—why? because it makes HN better if the community finds things it loves here. Among the startups of today, I can think of only two offhand who are showing signs of maybe reaching darling status—fly.io (YC), and Tailscale (not YC).All 4 of the startups I&#39;ve mentioned have the advantage that they were|are targeting programmers, which gives them a cultural fast track to developing rapport with this community—sort of a ladder in the snakes-and-ladders game. However, that&#39;s not a sufficient condition for getting a satisfying click with the community, and it isn&#39;t a necessary one either. The real problem is that so much of the content that startups produce to try to interest this community just isn&#39;t interesting enough (to this community), and often it gives off inadvertent signals of being uninteresting—things like seeming too enterprisey, or too slick in the marketing department.If the bolt.com people had asked us for help, I would have been just as happy to help them as anybody else. I would have told them that the opening of their article (https://web.archive.org/web/20180418201841/https://blog.bolt...) was too enterprisey to appeal to HN. The language is drawn from ecommerce retailing, which makes sense given the little bit we&#39;ve all learned about Bolt today, but is the kind of thing that comes across as boring on HN. The references to Gartner and Experian feel like reading an enterprise whitepaper, which actually detracts from credibility with the HN audience.This is the sort of thing I&#39;ve told countless startups over the years. It&#39;s dismayingly difficult to express this information in a way that people can actually absorb, but I have a set of notes that I&#39;ve sent to many startups in this position, which I plan to turn into an essay about how to write for HN. if anyone wants a copy, email hn@ycombinator.com and I&#39;ll be happy to send it to you.I had a bunch of other things I wanted to say here, but mercifully, I&#39;ve forgotten them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think if you get over the drama here and implied &#34;dirtiness&#34;, the main result is still a bit interesting.Even if you exclude the implied carteling and take everything he said with a grain of salt, the outcomes of this incentive structure are clear: once SV (i.e. the YC centered VC machine) gets into a space and has a main horse, SV can no longer incubate new innovation/competition in the space. It can also very likely become predatory to the potential innovators that SV is supposed to support.At a more macro scale, this means that YC will fade in the same way as everything else does because it won&#39;t be able to entertain a wave of innovators, and they will, as he did, seek and build the next SV."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Public fights can occasionally be net positive for one of the participants, but your arguments will be publicly scrutinized and they better be watertight. If the logic you presented is your best work, then I can easily see why you&#39;ve experienced some trouble in getting people to support you.Let&#39;s start with the very first argument you presented: getting rejected by YC is a clear proof of collusion.Getting rejected by YC happens to tens of thousands of applicants each batch. Your chances of getting accepted increase disproportionally if you can show progress since the rejection. To react the way you did is a contrarian move. And it kind of fits the pattern - to publicly insult every VC on Stripe&#39;s cap table is also a contrarian move. Not to mention that you also made it clear to all your future potential talent that there&#39;s this thing about you not being liked by the VC community in Silicon Valley.I will skip all the little jumps to conclusions that you also presented throughout your thread, and will instead focus on the big picture here. The whole time I was reading your thread, I was waiting for the triumphant finish (eg: today we&#39;re announcing that we stole Stripe&#39;s biggest customer). Instead, all I heard was that Stripe is unbeatable, which sounded quite depressing from your company&#39;s point of view. I wonder how this will make future fundraising or deal closing any easier. Another contrarian move.I am not in a position to criticize you because clearly you&#39;ve gotten very far and something that you&#39;re doing must be working. But whatever it is, it&#39;s super contrarian. So rather than presenting the Stripe-Bolt competition in the light of a mobster movie, I think a Rambo analogy would be more appropriate - a traumatized but highly skilled fighter declaring war on everyone and their grandmother."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Funny enough, I decided to play with FreeBSD for personal projects in 2020. I gave up and I am reverting all my servers to Linux in 2022, for the opposite of the reasons mentioned in this article.* Lack of systemd. Managing services through shell scripts is outdated to me. It feels very hacky, there is no way to specify dependencies, and auto-restarts in case of crashes. Many FreeBSD devs praise launchd, well... systemd is a clone of launchd.* FreeBSD jail are sub-optimal compared to systemd-nspawn. There are tons of tools to create freebsd jails (manually, ezjail, bastillebsd, etc…) half of them are deprecated. At the end all of your jails end up on the same loopback interface, making it hard to firewall. I couldn&#39;t find a way to have one network interface per jail. With Linux, debootstrap + machinectl and you&#39;re good to go.* Lack of security modules (such as SELinux) -- Edit: I should have written &#34;Lack of good security module&#34;* nftables is way easier to grasp than pf, and as fast as pf, and has atomic reloads."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The reasons are, for a large part, not on the technical side. I was surprised, because this this a lot of work for little visible gain. Here are the reasons, slightly abbreviated:&gt; The whole system is managed by the same teamMostly philosophical.&gt; FreeBSD development is less driven by commercial interests.Mostly philosophical.&gt; Linux has Docker but FreeBSD has jails!IMO, this comparison is a mistake. In the Linux world, systemd&#39;s nspawn is very similar to Jails. It&#39;s a glorified chroot, with security and resource management. All the systemd tools work seemlessly with nspawn machines (e.g. `systemctl status`). Containers à la Docker are a different thing.BTW, I thought the last sentence about security issues with Docker images was strange. If you care about unmaintained images, build them yourself. On the other side, the FreeBSD official documentation about Jails has a big warning that starts with &#34;Important: the official Jails are a powerful tool, but they are not a security panacea.&#34;&gt; Linux has no official support for zfs and suchFair point, though I&#39;ve heard about production systems with zfs on Linux.&gt; The FreeBSD boot procedure is better than grub.YMMV&gt; FreeBSD&#39;s network is more performant.Is there some conclusive recent benchmark about this. The post uses a 2014 post about ipv6 at Facebook, which I think is far from definitive today. Especially more since it &#34;forgot&#34; to mention that Facebook intended to enhance the &#34;Linux kernel network stack to rival or exceed that of FreeBSD.&#34; Did they succeed over these 8 years ?&gt; Straightforward system performance analysisThe point is not about the quality of the tools, but the way each distribution packages them. Seems very very low impact to me.&gt; FreeBSD&#39;s Bhyve against Linux&#39;s KVMThe author reluctantly admits that KVM is more mature."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Some time ago we started a complex, continuous and not always linear operation, that is to migrate, where possible, most of the servers (ours and of our customers) from Linux to FreeBSD.&#34;I don&#39;t really disagree with any of the stated reasons, but I also didn&#39;t see a reason that would make me even consider making the move with our servers, or even bother with some small number of servers. At least for me, I&#39;d need a bunch of REALLY GOOD reasons to consider a move like that. A huge cost savings AND some huge time savings in the future might do it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"GitHub Actions with act to test stuff locally is actually pretty usable. We use on-prem k8s-hosted runners to get access to servers/clusters with limited internet access, works great.But as always with “”gitops”” themed tools I think it’s pretty awkward to handle rollbacks. Either you take the stance that master is the source of truth and let the CI/CD tooling revert commits if deployment fails, or you store that state elsewhere and allow e.g manifests to diverge from git.I would be curious to hear how other people do it"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"YAML was intended to be a superset, but it isn&#39;t quite, which is about the worst case scenario. See https://metacpan.org/pod/JSON::XS#JSON-and-YAML , for instance.(I am an absolutist on this matter. To be a superset, all, that&#39;s A L L valid JSON strings must also be valid YAML to be a superset. A single failure makes it not a superset. At scale, any difference will eventually occur, which is why even small deviations matter.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Are people not even reading about what they are using?Always read documentation or you will get burned by something completely innocuous. For example, that’s how you get Norway missing in your config file with YAML:  NI: Nicaragua
  NL: Netherlands
  NO: Norway

Oops, “NO” evaluates to false like 10 other reserve words."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a love-hate relationship with YAML.Hate:- human-wise ambiguity of its syntax (If I understand correctly, you &#34;can&#34; indent array items, but you don&#39;t have to. And than one guys says &#34;OK, I&#39;m gonna indent&#34;, and another guy says &#34;Nah. I&#39;m not gonna indent&#34;)- still no support for datetime as a first class citizen- strings usually don&#39;t need quotes, until they do (I prefer to always quote)Note that two of the above points are about allowing inconsistent styles, which is a thing I hate.Love:- it supports comments whereas JSON does not. If the IETF ever officially updated JSON to support C-style inline (and maybe block) comments, I would absolutely ditch YAML."</p>
