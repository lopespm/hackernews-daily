								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"People are misunderstanding this and claiming it&#39;s not problematic. Ben Torrell (an OBS developer) notes later in the thread that there is indeed GPL code compiled into TikTok&#39;s executables; since source is not available and they have not got another license, it is unlicensed and hence illegal."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So people that have ripped off OBS so far and violated GPL include TikTok, StreamLabs (Logitech), and StreamElements. Any other people I missed?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In almost all cases, TikTok&#39;s offering would be considered a derived work because you cannot swap out the OBS part for another and still have it work. So they are likely in full violation unless they agree to open source all their code.Seems like a pretty open and shut case to be honest - that is, if they intend to pursue legal action and the powers that be rule appropriately."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In addition to the points raised by BMJ and in the comments below, there is a limit to what independent fact checking can accomplish. For example, are their fact checkers conducting their own scientific experiments validating claims and outcomes of a scientific paper? Are fact checkers reaching out to sources from a news article and verifying quoted information? When “breaking news” or “scoops” are reported presenting totally new information about the world, how can that be verified against other information that - by virtue of something being new - cannot be verified by other preexisting sources?If the fact checking process is limited to verification based on other information that is currently available, and if the fact checking process cannot distinguish between factual information and the opinions people hold as a result of that information, the outcome will be an inevitable echo chamber that reinforces currently dominant views or whatever preexisting biases are present.In short, fact checking is hard and there is a reason why reputable publishing outlets have their own internal fact verification processes before something gets published (including safeguards and retractions, because they make mistakes too), and why news is separated out from opinion-editorial pages... even if it is in style to add opinions (read: “perspective”) to every article."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This one is much trickier than it looks. Reposting user nojito&#39;s post (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29596111), but here in a top level comment:&gt; The fact check was correct in this instance though?&gt; https://leadstories.com/hoax-alert/2021/11/fact-check-britis...&gt; The conclusions in the original BMJ article make zero sense when actually scrutinized.&gt; https://www.bmj.com/content/375/bmj.n2635Please read both URLs before commenting in depth."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Both Facebook (now Meta) and Youtube bungled their fact checking by disabling posts and videos that were counter to some narrative, but not factually incorrect.  That places them in a bad position, and they need to be called out publicly, as no other mechanism so far has pushed them towards more accurate fact checking."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Praise, 2 suggestions and a question.Color coding OOM (order-of-magnitude) is smart, but the colors chosen seem quite hard to distinguish. Consider picking different default colors; also consider adding a redundant representation of scale, like an integer representing OOM scale.It is strange that a thoughtful design around OOM would also choose keep so many digits. If the goal is to summarize, then please throw those extra digits away. (e.g. 10.3992s is specifying the time down to the millisecond, but those extra ms are not meaningful at the second time scale.)What is this about the runtime polling tasks? Does that happen in Tokio? Why? I am only familiar with 2 async runtimes (node, vert.x) and I was under the impression that neither of these &#34;poll their threads&#34; in any meaningful way. Threads (or process or fiber or whatever you want to call it in this context) never initiate action on their own. They are ALWAYS waiting for something to happen to them, and that includes timeouts, which would be triggered by passing a thread a clock tick. The runtime&#39;s job is to centrally manage resources that must persist between thread behavior, so at most it is going to be polling external resources, and not it&#39;s own threads.Or maybe I don&#39;t understand what polling means here? I would interpret it as meaning &#34;keep checking a well-known place for changes, and then do something if a change is found&#34;. But since async threads can&#39;t initiate any change on their own, this is nonsensical."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Real wages have been flat since the 1970s (https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/08/07/for-most-us...). &#34;Okay, so people&#39;s living standards are about the same since 1970?&#34; Not even close. The problem with inflation is that its calculation is fraught with all kinds of selective weighting, bias, and politics. Take a look at the relative differences between the things which have decreased and increased in cost in real terms (https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/5/29/saupload_i...). Okay, so TVs and cellphones are cheaper, but necessities like college, childcare, and healthcare are up significantly.And when you drill in more, there are other issues. For example, the housing metric appears relatively flat in real terms, right? Except, that doesn&#39;t tell the story for the majority of Americans. Housing costs are WAY up in cities as Americans migrate to where the jobs are, while housing costs are down in all the areas where jobs are disappearing. In practise, housing costs are actually significantly up for most Americans, but because the CPI is calculated across the entire nation, the government can claim inflation is low. This allow them to keep the fed rate low, which keeps stock valuations high. This LOOKS great and generates great headlines, but the reality is that most Americans are significantly worse off since the 1970s.And then we come to the other elephant in the room: why are real wages flat? Given the incredible performance of the American economy since 1970, shouldn&#39;t real wages be significantly UP? This is yet another reminder that wealth is being squeezed from the bottom and funnelled straight up. As a non-American, it&#39;s heartbreaking to see efforts to unify the underclass completely derailed by this ridiculous race war. Poor people in America have FAR more in common with each other than the rich, no matter race. I really hope you all manage to set aside the obvious red herring of race and unite in tackling your staggering wealth inequality."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We had an all-hands meeting recently where we got to submit anonymous questions.  One of the questions was &#39;with inflation rising at 6%, will the company reconsider their &#39;standard&#39; 2% raise?&#39;  The lady answering looks dead in the camera and goes &#39;Honestly? No&#39; and goes on to talk about how we&#39;re reasonably competitive with the local market.  Hey, credit where credit is due, at least she was a refreshingly straight shooter.  It pretty much let everyone on the call know what they needed to do if they wanted a good raise."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who does OK, but lives in reality (not the bay area), I feel a revolution coming.  I hope it&#39;s not a violent one, but who knows at this point.  Hopefully it&#39;s just a politician with big policy changes.People feel completely disenfranchised.  You keep hanging housing over their head but just out of reach like some baby toy, then inflation spikes everything else.  What&#39;s the point of working even?I don&#39;t know the solution, but I don&#39;t have a good feeling about the next 10 years."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wish I could say I stopped buying things off Amazon for ethical reasons, but the truth is, I stopped buying because if you look closely at the reviews, you realize that almost everything for sale there is now a scam or a knock-off. This was a slow creep for awhile, but now the problem has grown exponentially. Amazon is what Canal Street was in the 90s - somewhere to buy fakes, stolen goods, and electronics that might catch fire.Amazon has no interest in fixing this problem, because they know that well over half their &#34;inventory&#34; is now from knockoffs, IP theft and/or bait-and-switch scams. it&#39;s almost impossible to find items there anymore that are not fake, whether it&#39;s re-packaged hard drives or &#34;pyrex&#34; bowls that explode in the microwave.One way to look at this, and the way I think Amazon must look at it, is that it&#39;s not any worse than a third world night market. The attitude of vendors in, e.g. Phnom Penh or Mexico City markets is that the very fact that stupid Americans think they&#39;re going to get &#34;real&#34; goods just proves how much they deserve to be scammed. Amazon is actually helping baffled Americans to finally understand what the third world has always known - unboxing is going to be disappointing. Everything you think is affordable is probably fake, and you can&#39;t trust the packaging. Only the rich get actual brand products. As America degrades, people will start to get more savvy and more cynical about this, but right now it&#39;s still a newish phenomenon and people are shocked, shocked! to find out the kids toys they bought are full of toxic chemicals that we ourselves shipped overseas for burial or &#34;recycling&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t understand what Amazon thinks it&#39;s doing with its legions of data scientists, analysts, product managers and engineers that they consider so much more important than solving this problem, which will destroy their reputation long-term and create space for a competitor.At this rate, Amazon will be on its way to becoming Yelp -- untrusted, irrelevant, ultimately deserted."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Personally experienced this. I bookmarked a keyboard I was interested in purchasing in a month or so.

Just today in fact, I was looking for an office chair seat cushion and found a very telling reddit comment from 3 years ago[1].I know Amazon has a bulletproof return policy for the most part but I don&#39;t want to be hassled with returning everything. This just results in me just not using Amazon. You may be able to justify it for large purchases because of Amazon&#39;s return policy but for something as mundane as a can opener or seat cushion? Just shop elsewhere.[1] https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/a72co8/seat_cushi..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a load of nonsense in the comments here today.* Drata is a vendor that helps a company navigate your SOC2 compliance process, by organizing all the controls and helping you gather evidence that you have done so. For instance, they&#39;ll connect with Github and make sure everyone with access to your repos is a company employee. If you don&#39;t use Drata you have to gather this evidence yourself, repeatedly over months, and it&#39;s a pain.* The Drata agent is a pretty innocuous thing. It checks you have done things like turn on disk encryption, have updates enabled, and that the screen locks if you walk away. It does NOT monitor employee&#39;s activities. These kind of security checks are incredibly common and are required for certifications like ISO27001 and SOC2. SOC2 is not really optional for large enough b2b SaaS.* The poster says &#34;Their business model (in my case) seems to be to take money from companies to spy on their employees/contractors, and then they sell the employees/contractors private information to &#34;targeted advertising&#34;.Do you have any evidence for this?? I&#39;ve just been involved in selecting Drata as a vendor for SOC2 compliance planning for our company. If this is true it&#39;s a huge deal and totally against my understanding of their business model. It honestly sounds like bullshit to me! But if you have evidence that they do this, please let us know.* As a freelancer, whether you are required to install security monitoring software is definitely an open question. If you&#39;re delivering work separately and not connected to company systems, then ok. If you&#39;re basically just acting like any other employee, and connected to the company systems, then you will probably have to do this. Because otherwise they would fail SOC2 and managing your legal status as &#34;Freelancer&#34; vs &#34;Employee&#34; (for tax reasons??) is not worth not being certified."</p>

You unplug your laptop from a wired connection, switch to wireless - we recovered in milliseconds. You heard barely a click.The encryption issue is fun - we had a rotate-key message in-band. The receiver loaded new keys and tried them in sequence to ease the turnover time - out-of-order packets etc could make it ambiguous for a short while which key to use. A cache and aging keys out made it work pretty well.Remixing on user stations proved to be problematic (mentioned elsewhere on this thread). You&#39;d think if 6 people at one site were conferencing with a dozen elsewhere, you could elect one at each site to mix-and-forward. But corporate networks made it hard to determine who was &#39;adjacent&#39; - they were often layered and without uPNP (is that what the router protocol is called?) you couldn&#39;t tell if somebody at the next desk was even in your company.We had up to 100 people in a conference, and our enter-the-conference time was on the order of 100ms. Click into an all-hands, and be able to hear everybody before you finger left the mouse button. It was wonderful.Sococo today is a sad shadow of that. They went open-source and lost all our IP instantly. Just another WebRTC client last I knew."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Do people regularly run into coworkers like me during their career and simply ignore it because they find it too awkward to criticize them? Have I just been incredibly lucky and every boss I have had is too incompetent to notice? Do I have imposter syndrome and I am actually a 10x developer whose laziness makes them a 1x developer?Lazy developers don&#39;t really bother me, if you do a couple hours of high-quality work a week I&#39;d have no complaint. (Many weeks I do as little, some weeks I do a decent amount of real work :) The problem is developers making negative progress, usually messes that need to be cleaned up ... and it&#39;s an awkward situation, no matter your relative authority. I&#39;m in the &#34;we should consider them lines spent, not lines produced&#34; camp.An old disputed quote:&gt; I divide my officers into four classes as follows: The clever, the industrious, the lazy, and the stupid. Each officer always possesses two of these qualities.&gt; Those who are clever and industrious I appoint to the General Staff. Use can under certain circumstances be made of those who are stupid and lazy. The man who is clever and lazy qualifies for the highest leadership posts. He has the requisite nerves and the mental clarity for difficult decisions. But whoever is stupid and industrious must be got rid of, for he is too dangerous."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think there&#39;s also something to be said for passive processing.Sometimes I&#39;ll know I need to write some code or some function and I&#39;ll just think about it in the back of my head while doing other things, sometimes for a whole day or two. Then I&#39;ll sit down and write it in like 20-30 minutes. Did I work 20-30 minutes, or have I been working for a day or two? I would say a day or two, and the 20-30 minutes was the time needed to produce the deliverable of that work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have never done what you describe, except perhaps in times of illness when it was understood that working less was a reasonable accommodation (in that particular case, I had leftover brain fog from general anesthesia).I&#39;ve never heard of any colleagues doing it either. I would never snitch if it happened, but I would certainly consider that person untrustworthy or think that they have an undisclosed condition that is between them and HR.As you covered in your post, we don&#39;t write code 8 hours a day. This is normal. Meetings, context switch and times when focus is unachievable are expected and mostly understood by my experienced management. So are times when we are monitoring technology advancement and keeping an eye on the industry and community (e.g. lurking at HN but not overly posting and commenting) and times of social activity between workers (e.g. talking about the weekend).Most of us take mental health breaks between meetings and need to take time to think through issues. Many also need to periodically break focus to think about personal life issues or hobbies. As long as you generally strive to work, this is not a problem either.But walking into a stand-up and then lying about your day? To me, that&#39;s unethical.The real question to me is:Do you do that on purpose or is this something that happens even if you are trying to focus? There are many conditions, from stress and anxiety to diagnosed mental health issues that can prevent you from focusing. Burn-outs and bore-outs also come to mind.In my eyes, the fact that you asked the community about it shows that you have some form of concern towards that behavior. Would you say it is negatively impacting your life?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wonder why no one ever talks about architectures in the middle between those two - modular monoliths.The point in time where you&#39;re splitting your codebase up in modules (or maybe are a proponent of hexagonal architecture and have designed it that way from the beginning), leading to being able to put functionality behind feature flags. That way, you can still run it either as a single instance monolith, or a set of horizontally scaled instances with a few particular feature flags enabled (e.g. multiple web API instances) and maybe some others as vertically scaled monoliths (e.g. scheduled report instance).I wrote more about that approach on my blog, as one of the first articles, &#34;Moduliths: because we need to scale, but we also cannot afford microservices&#34;: https://blog.kronis.dev/articles/modulith-because-we-need-to...In my eyes, the good part is that you can work with one codebase and do refactoring easily across all of it, have better scalability than just a monolith without all of the ops complexity from the outset, while also not having to worry as much about shared code, or perhaps approach the issue gently, by being able to extract code packages at first.The only serious negatives is that this approach is still more limited than microservices, for example, compilation times in static languages would suffer and depending on how big your project is, there will just be a bit of overhead everywhere, and not every framework supports that approach easily."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is a lot of talk about monoliths vs microservices lately.. I just want to throw into the ring that you can do both at the same time. easily. And noone is going to kill you for it either.maybe we are getting caught up in sematics because its christmas, but &#34;monorepo/monolith/microservices/etc&#34; is -just- the way you organize your code.Developing a montolith for years but now you have written a 15 line golang http api that converts pdfs to stardust and put it into on a dedicted server in your office? welp thats a microservice.Did you write a 150 repo application that can not be deployed seperatly anyway? welp thats a monolith.You can also build a microservice ecosystem without kubernetes on your local network. We have done it for years with virtual machines. Software defined networking just makes things more elegant.So dont stop using microservices because its &#34;hard&#34; or start writing monoliths because its &#34;easy&#34;, because none of that is true in the long run.What is true is that you have a group of people trying to code for a common goal. The way you reach that goal together defines how you organize your code."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unless you have a strong technical or organizational reason to use microservices, using microservices is just more work to achieve the same results.Organizational reason would be multiple people/teams who don&#39;t want or can&#39;t talk much to each other, so they develop pieces of a larger system as relatively independent projects, with clear API and responsibility boundaries. Frontend/backend style web development is an example of such approach, even though we don&#39;t typically call these parts &#34;microservices&#34;.A technical reason I can see is some component of a system actually having to be written in a different stack, or to be run in a separate location for business reasons (separate physical computer, separate VMs or containers don&#39;t count). Like a firmware running on an IoT system. Or most of the system uses python, but there&#39;s a really good library in java for solving some very specific problem, so let&#39;s use it.If neither of these reasons stands, you don&#39;t have a microservice architecture, you have a distributed monolith. You just replaced some function calls with RPC. RPC call which takes a much a longer time than a local one, and can randomly fail. Most of your microservices are written in a single stack, so you refactor common parts into a library, but then different services are stuck to use different versions of this library. You end up with a much slower and a much more fragile system which is harder to work on for no good reason."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The years when Rails monoliths were the de facto web stack were some of the best of my career. As I progressed in my career and the popular tech stack shifted to things like microservices, document DBs, serverless functions, Node, importing tiny nom packages for everything, docker containers, React, and GraphQL, the sheer cognitive overhead of getting a simple app up and running gradually took all the fun out of the job for me. The fast, satisfying feedback loop of writing a feature in Rails was replaced with weeks-long coordination efforts between independent microservices, constant discussions about tooling, and doubts over whether or not we had chosen the “right” flavor-of-the-week framework or library for our product. Every time I started a new project or a joined a new company, we had the reinvent the wheel for our bespoke Node/serverless stack and have the same tiring conversations about naming conventions, logging, data consistency, validation, build scripts, etc., all of which Rails gives you by default. I ended up spending more time on tooling setup than actual business logic.I eventually gave up and switched to a semi-technical product management role."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have spent a lot of time with node(express), Java(Spring) and rails. I see a lot of complaints about node, but node with typescript has been a joy to work with. It is lightweight and has a type system. I know where every piece of code is coming from, there is no magic involved. I either wrote the function in that file, I am importing it, or it is a method on a js object. I only have know one language for both front end and back end. A better standard library would be nice.Rails is nice in terms of getting the project set up, not bikeshedding about the tooling, and working with the db. But the actual coding has been painful for me. I really dislike working with a non typed language. I dislike optional parans in function calls and optional braces for hashes. I dislike all the magic of rails. I never know what is going on because there is some functionality that inherits from a rails class or some other part of the code base. I would rather write a bit more code for a bit more clarity. Maybe if python were typed I would like Django? But python has all of that nonsense around virtualenv.Spring has been ok, but not great. Too much bloated abstract factory creator nonsense. Dependency injection never really clicked for me. All of these annotations. I quite liked plain Java but Spring just felt like this monster.All in all node(express) has been the nicest for me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Prediction: the big move in the next few years is going to be &#34;back to hypermedia&#34;People are realizing that you can accomplish quite a bit more with hypermedia than you could in the past, and that the complexity of javascript stacks isn&#39;t worth it in many cases.Older, mature hypermedia-based technologies like rails, django, and even PHP, will experience a resurgence and a lot of older lessons and techniques in web development (caching, SQL tuning, etc.) will be rediscovered.I have a dog in this fight, w/ htmx, but I think we are increasingly seeing evidence for this move."</p>

Who the hell thought it was a great idea to couple all the commands like WiFi, power energy, etc under the same menu? On Windows 11 I needed to click the WiFi icon, select WiFi menu, select a WiFi to connect to. Whereas on windows 10 I just click on the WiFi symbol and choose the WiFi. I don&#39;t like my computer auto connecting to the Internet so I manually connect whenever I want and use this menu multiple times a day.3. Speaking of great ideas, now all the right click useful stuff is behind a second menu...

Free-market economies still take measures against insider trading, still place limits on how and when high-ranking executives can trade company stock. Placing restrictions on how congress members can trade, when they have access to material non-public information, is totally compatible with a free-market economy.This is not a defense, it&#39;s a dismissal."</p>

But there are people, like company executives (and high-ranking politicians) who have non-public information that does not belong to them. When congress uses insider knowledge, they are stealing from the ameria, and undermining any semblance of policy integrity.And for that reason, the SEC has 10b-5 plans, which can certainly be critiqued, but at least removes the low-hanging fruit like &#34;we are getting acquired so I&#39;ll buy as many shares and out of the money options as I can&#34;.Iirc her husband was basically buying fairly far-out (~16-18 months) calls at the onset of the pandemic, and they were expiring around the time of, was it an antitrust hearing?

But imo, they made real changes. They restricted a lot of individual trading, and anything they can still trade in, has to be requested 45 days in advance.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I worked for a finance adjacent firm, not even a firm that handled money, my compliance policy was super strict even by industry standards and I was a lowly Sr. SWE. 
The reasoning I was given was to not never even provide a hint of impropriety or using data ahead of our customers. Reputation was everything.The blanket company-wide policy was as follows. Certain departments had rules on top of this.1. Limited to general stocks, ETFs, mutual funds, etc. No derivatives allowed (options, etc.). Even private stock or private options from my prior require required a review from compliance when I started.
2. No selling for a gain within 30 days of the purchase date on ANY security. Selling for a loss was allowed at any time.
3. All brokerage accounts had to be linked to their compliance portal. An automated compliance check pulled your statements weekly and would open a ticket with compliance if anything looked to violate policy. If your brokerage was not supported electronically, you had to submit monthly paper statements.I don&#39;t see why Congress shouldn&#39;t be subject to similar rules, especially those on finance committees."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Good! I‘ll go long on them.Reddit is the ONLY place on the Internet where you can simultaneously watch garbage recycled content from TikTok and visit extremely-niche and highly knowledgeable communities in the same session. Heck, I get my HN updates from Reddit now.Facebook/Instagram/TikTok are nothing like this in that the info you get is wholly dependent on your social graph. Twitter has very high quality content, but it’s a firehose that is very difficult to curate and keep up with. Reddit is democratizing in a sense, like riding the NYC subway.An even wilder bet: Reddit can fit nicely into the metaverse (as a news outlet of sorts, on steroids) and even potentially minimize the need for Google Search.Anecdotally, a VERY LARGE percentage of my Google searches end in “site:reddit.com” these days. Reddit posts, especially from smaller subs, tend to be higher quality and don’t have ulterior motives (ad revenue). If Reddit’s Lucene cluster were better, between that and SO, I’d use Google a handful of times a week. Maybe this IPO can help fund that.If the ad revenue from the whale subs allow me to continue learning about interior design, supply chain logistics,  the inner workings of car sales, finance and tax strategies if I become high net worth, and more, I’m here for it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Reddit of 2006 where tutorials on generating HTML in Lisp rocket to the top of the homepage is long gone. I can&#39;t imagine investing in an ad company that is fueled by clickbait and outrage the way Reddit is. Plus, some percentage of the userbase will always run aggressive ad blockers and be impossible to effectvely monetize. However, my brain works very differently from other people&#39;s, so I could be wrong."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The larger subreddits have problems, but Reddit has done a remarkable job of collecting people with niche interests into one area.I wouldn&#39;t discount their success and future success (as much as I&#39;d like to).What&#39;s odd is they haven&#39;t stopped growing. It&#39;s just been linear user growth.They could literally do nothing and the site would still grow. It&#39;s closer to Wikipedia than a social network in some respects. And by that standard, we should try to judge it.I look forward to the next forum site as much as the next person. But I don&#39;t know what it would look like. If anyone does, I definitely urge you to build it if you can.Substack has every incentive to build a community. Discord as well. So there&#39;s definitely opportunities, but from where I sit, I don&#39;t have any insight as to what you could do to beat this behemoth."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"https://www.hackerfactor.com/blog/index.php?/archives/895-Co...&gt; on the first retina iPads, decoding PNGs was a huge portion of the total launch times for some apps, while one of the two cores sat completely idle.Could they distribute decoding PNG files to a thread pool, instead of making multithreaded PNG files? Or would this fail for single large PNG files?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is there a conjecture that says for a field with given a degree of complexity, a given string or function of a can be encoded equivalently in a number of different ways that is proportional to its size and maybe complexity class?Between this and project zero&#39;s analysis (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29568625) of NSO using compression encoding to create a virtual machine for calculating exploit offsets, while unrelated except at a very high level of abstraction, it reminds me conceptually of cryptographic hash collisions, where over a large enough search space or field / domain of complexity there are many equivalent encodings or homonyms/isomorphisms.The issue with the NSO exploit was they found that the compression encoding for a font was Turing complete, and then wrote a virtual architecture in it, and then ran programs on it that did the calculations necessary for their exploit.This png encoding issue is different, but if you abstract it upwards to find a general principle it may be the effect of, it&#39;s like there is fast rule where if if you know the size or definition of the field of possibilities, and then have a definition of a given string in it, the function that describes or defines that string will also yield all strings whose evaluation is the same. It&#39;s like Kolmolgorov complexity, but where instead of finding the smallest progam to compute something, it&#39;s: given the number of instructions to define programs over a field of inputs of a given size, there are N programs beneath length L that are equivalent.Sort of a showerthought, but it&#39;s interesting to think that our ideas of encodings and general isomorphisms may be instances of the same concept linked by a sort of &#34;imaginary&#34; function."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"That design is badly missing some registers (D-type flip-flops) -- the whole &#34;let&#39;s read/write multiple bytes and discard the first one because the ESP is not ready yet&#34; seems like a super hacky solution.A pair of something like 74574&#39;s would make this so much easier. When sending to ESP, register latches the last byte written and then ESP can read it at its leisure. When reading from ESP, ESP pre-loads the data into register, and then gameboy reads data from the register. This generates interrupt which ESP uses to load next byte into register.Moreover, there might be a right logical series which will be compatible with both 3.3 and 5V busses. Then one could replace the level converters with register, keeping the overall complexity about the same."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very cool project, and impressive he got it working!I feel like possibly a better way to deal with the communication though might be to put a dual-port RAM [e.g. 1] in-between the gameboy and the microcontroller, and load in a program to it so the Gameboy is just waiting for certain areas of memory to be updated (with flags that one side sets as &#39;new data&#39; and then the gameboy flips). Basically some kind of circular buffer of commands, and as long as there&#39;s enough space in there and you only fill it from the microcontroller slower than the Gameboy can process them, you wouldn&#39;t need to have careful synchronisation. The microcontroller just has to check that the next slot in the circular buffer has had its status bit flipped to &#39;processed&#39; (or hasn&#39;t been used yet) before putting the next command/data in.1. https://www.renesas.com/us/en/products/memory-logic/multi-po..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m pretty experienced in Node and React, and discovering Rails recently has been an absolute joy. I feel like I&#39;ve made the opposite journey from everyone else on HN, because I joined the programming community _after_ the big RoR hype and during the Node/React hype.Trying out rails, I understand how much magic is involved here. Because I&#39;ve had to build all this crap myself - many, many times over. Complicated things become simple, and tasks that usually make me sigh (add a new data point and add it right through Knex, Hapi models, routes, redux actions, redux store, dispatch/selector and template) turns into a SINGLE COMMAND. Sold :)Very excited about this new release!Edit: I wrote a blog about this a while ago btw, but there are many others pieces out there like it: https://nikodunk.com/a-node-js-developer-discovers-rails/ - using it to create https://electrade.app currently."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve played around with the new default frontend (no js build step at all!) and it&#39;s been an absolute joy. I was able to write basically babby&#39;s first Rails app and have it look, feel and behave like an SPA, and that&#39;s a wonderful thing for apps that need just a little bit of interactivity. While I&#39;ve mostly moved on to Phoenix for my personal &#34;weekend project&#34; web needs, Rails is still a wonderful framework for getting an app off the ground fast."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just today I was helping a junior (php) developer get setup &amp; started with ruby.RVM, gems, bundler. Then onto rails. Upon first attempt to launch rails it choked on yarn requiring to install packages.And then I had to go through node, npm/yarn, webpacker, rails is primarily the backend, webpacker manages the front end. And it all seemed needlessly complicated.I love that rails have doubled down on the low-js direction.  Progressive enhancement, the whole js ecosystem is there if/when you need. But until then KISS."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"They really need to stop requiring SVPs or higher to show non-green status on the status page, as other HNers have revealed in last week&#39;s AWS post. It&#39;s effectively not a status page, and they could probably be sued if it can be demonstrated that X service was down but the status page showed green (since the SLA is based on status page). Should be automated and based on sample deployments running in every region and every service. And they should use non-AWS instances to do the sampling, so they can actually sample when, say, we experience the obligatory black friday us-east-1 outage every year."</p>

One for nelson.lily6.messwithdns.com as expected, but also one for _.lily6.messwithdns.com.Any guesses what that naked underscore query is for? Not every nameserver does it (Cloudflare, Google, Quad9, and Adguard all don&#39;t). But Sonic isn&#39;t the only one that does.I&#39;ve asked on Twitter and the best guess right now is it has something to do with RFC2782 or RFC 8552.

IMO you shouldn&#39;t have to learn DNS and TLS in order to securely use a domain name. If I want to sign up to have Fastmail host my email, why do I have to manually copy and paste a bunch of DNS records? Fastmail already knows exactly what records need to be set. I should be able to OAuth redirect over to my domain registrar and approve giving Fastmail control over a subdomain of my choosing, and Fastmail should be able to use a simple open protocol to update the records."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From the top of the article:&gt; We want to thank Citizen Lab for sharing a sample of the FORCEDENTRY exploit with us, and Apple’s Security Engineering and Architecture (SEAR) group for collaborating with us on the technical analysis.This reminded me that NSO went after Citizen Lab on multiple fronts. They even tried to use a spy to talk to JSR (https://www.johnscottrailton.com) and make him say controversial things, which could be later used to malign Citizen Lab. Darknet Diaries covered this incident recently: https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/99/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is mind boggling. NSO used a compression format&#39;s instructions to create logic gates and then from there &#34;a small computer architecture with features such as registers and a full 64-bit adder and comparator which they use to search memory and perform arithmetic operations&#34;, all within a single pass of decompression. Combine this with a buffer overflow and you&#39;ve got your sploit."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a real shame that the people who came up with this exploit are working for NSO and not on solving P = NP or something.

  - using systemd? use journalctl
  - using docker/kubernetes? capture automatically the stdout/stderr of your containers and pipe them through logstash or something

Real question: why would an application need to know where its logs go? This is not in the business perimeter, but the ops perimeter. Am I wrong?EDIT:Most responses are about configuring logging level, output format, etc... This can be done with a print-based approach without sending a request to an external service (which would need to trust you and your inputs).Example: Python&#39;s default logging module.Still, thank you for your insightful answers :)"</p>

However, in the future I would pick a different visualization I think :)The benchmarking has also come under fire. My goal was to just to put the same site/assets on three different continents and retrieve them a bunch of times.  No more, no less.  I think the results are still interesting, personally.  Clean room benchmarks are cool, but so are real world tests, imo.Finally, there was no agenda with this post to push HTTP/3 over HTTP/2.  I was actually skeptical that HTTP/3 made any kind of difference based on my experience with 1.1 to 2.  I expected to write a post about &#34;HTTP/3 is not any better than HTTP/2&#34; and was frankly surprised that it was so much faster in my tests."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What’s great about HTTP 1.1 is it’s simplicity. I mean, you can explain it to a complete newby and have that person write a functioning implementation in a few lines of shell script, all in one afternoon.In fact, you can probably figure it out by yourself just by looking at what goes across the wire.And yet, it runs the whole modern world. That’s beautiful. I think simplicity is underrated and it’s something I really value when choosing the tools I use."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am a little confused about the test methodology.The post clearly explains that the big advantage of HTTP/3 is that it deals much better with IP packet loss. But then the tests are done without inducing (or at least measuring) packet loss?I guess the measured performance improvements here are mostly for the zero round-trip stuff then. But unless you understand how to analyze the security vs performance trade-off (I for one don&#39;t), that probably shouldn&#39;t be enabled."</p>

This is how I want front-end coding to be:
  Rattle off what I need, semantically,
and then by default it will be styled and presented in a sensible way.
  Then later, if our company stylist want our apps to 
look a particular kind of fancy, he can configure some styling
that will apply to all.This is also why I hate Windows WPF so much:
If you just add a label, a field, and two OK/Cancel buttons to a form,
it will look horrendous by default.
  Only if you manually or deliberately set up some styling for it,
will it start to look sensible.I want gui frameworks to look sensible out-of-the-box,
without cluttering everything with piles of boilerplate crap."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s incredibly disturbing to me how little much of the HN crowd seems to understand how these systems like CSAM actually work.  I&#39;m not talking about the tech or programming.This is a fast track tool to putting anyone in jail for the most despised crime a person can commit.  The tool has no oversight, no transparency, no counter, no clear your name, no real usage definitions other than relentless spying on the &#34;protect the children&#34; fallacy.Most people don&#39;t understand how life destroying a false accusation is once the government paperwork is started.  At that point like it or not you are basically considered guilty by all the agents of the governement by default.  Their jobs are to prosecute not eliminate false positives.  Once you have been on their radar your life will never ever be the same.  And since it is CP related you will not even get helpful people willing to touch it with a 10ft pole cause of fear they may be implicated.  CSAM is a dastardly and effective way to establish a totalitarian rule by fear of life in jail, nothing more."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This case reminds me a bit of the big stink with the Daraprim price hikes and Martin Shkreli being dumb enough to be the public face of it. That worked out pretty bad for him but also bad for everyone else, because now we had a guy to blame for it, instead of asking the harder questions like &#34;why aren&#39;t drug prices regulated?&#34; Utilities must go to the public utility commission to raise rates so why is the same not done for drugs? The federal government stockpiles oil in case of shortages, why is it not responsible for ensuring that drug production is continued?The maddening thing about the Apple CSAM scanning controversy is that I still have no idea which legislation Apple is complying with, and it&#39;s difficult to find out any reporting on that aspect. US? UK? EU? Clearly there is/are some government organization(s) with teeth long enough that Apple is not willing to go to court again as was the case with the San Bernandino shooter. Point is, whether or not Apple has been dishonest about this whole thing, they are still just a distraction."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So far all the comments are predictably negative and imply that Apple will at some time in the future attempt to covertly implement the feature in secret.Another take would be that they took on-board the extensive public criticism, and changed their minds."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I built multiple systems using vector search, one of them demoed in a search engine for non-commercial content at http://teclis.comRunning vector search (also sometimes referred to as semantic search, or a part of semantic search stack) is a trivial matter with open-source libraries like Faiss https://github.com/facebookresearch/faissIt takes 5 minutes to set up. You can search billion vectors on common hardware. For low-latency (up to couple of hundred milliseconds) use cases, it is highly unlikely that any cloud solution like this would be a better choice than something deployed on premise because of the network overhead.(worth noting is that there are about two dozen vector search libraries, all benchmarked at http://ann-benchmarks.com/ and most of them open-source)A much more interesting (and harder) problem is creating good vectors to begin with. This refers to the process of converting a text or an image to a multidimensional vector, usually done by a machine learning model such as BERT (for text) or ImageNet (for images).Try entering a query like &#39;gpt3&#39; or &#39;2019&#39; into the news search demo linked in the Google&#39;s PR:https://matchit.magellanic-clouds.com/The results are nonsensical. Not because the vector search didn&#39;t do its job well, but because generated vectors were suboptimal to begin with. Having good vectors is 99% of the semantic search problem.A nice demo of what semantic search can do is Google&#39;s Talk to Books https://books.google.com/talktobooks/This area of research s fascinating. For those who want to play with this more, an interesting end-to-end (including both vector generation and search) open-source solution is Haystack https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"People say google search is terrible these days, but I find the opposite.I can vaguely describe in a sentence the gist of an article I&#39;ve read, or an image, and the proper result will usually be in the first page.Of course, it doesn&#39;t always work, sometimes there are &#34;hash collisions&#34; so to speak, but I don&#39;t think the old algorithm would have been more successfully either, since if I knew the exact keywords to use, I wouldn&#39;t need to start with a vague description in the first place."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Marshall McLuhan would have appreciated this. Most everyone is familiar with his “The medium is the message” phrase, but if you dig a little deeper, you’ll come to appreciate his fascination with “Technology as extension of the human body.”That brio pen; the light bulb illuminating your workspace; the words you write; they’re all extensions of your body — from transcribing your internal thoughts, through your extremities, through transmission and distribution.If the author is reading this, I hope you’ll consider connecting with a few reputable online stationary retailers to offer a curated collection of reasonably-priced premium notebooks and pens. Additionally, consider expanding your original scope to include tags, which would open up your platform to paper-based automation opportunities.If you’ve made it this far and are just looking for the best cross-platform handwriting recognition, check out the Nebo app. It requires a stylus, but it’s the best I’ve come across and it reads PDFs, too."</p>

There&#39;s a workflow from sequencing a virus to generating a candidate vaccine. It only took two days to generate the original COVID-19 vaccine. It&#39;s the clinical testing in small, then large groups that&#39;s the time consuming part.Also, the inhaled vaccines are entering clinical testing.[2] It&#39;s not like we&#39;re stuck with the original vaccines.[1] https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/28/moderna-says-an-omicron-vari...[2] https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/e1637976-5c3f-11ec-90d0-c..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are a few important bits here:First: &#34;The study by Discovery Health, South Africa’s largest health insurer, of 211,000 positive coronavirus cases, of which 78,000 were attributed to omicron, showed that risk of hospital admissions among adults who contracted covid-19 was 29 percent lower than in the initial pandemic wave that emerged in March 2020.&#34;and second: &#34;At the same time, the vaccine may offer 70 percent protection against being hospitalized with omicron, the study found, describing that level of protection as “very good.”&#34;Yes the vaccine does improve outcomes BUT the hospitalization rate for unvaccinated people is still lower with Omicron than previous variants."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Did anyone notice the comparison of vaccine-based immunity to natural immunity in the findings within the source PR [0]? With a little work, you can compare them.If we convert the measure used in finding 2 (relative risk of reinfection) to finding 1&#39;s (relative protection), then the study found that natural immunity from Delta variant gives 60% protection against Omicron; roughly double the vaccine&#39;s protection.Unfortunately, no stat was given for natural immunity&#39;s protection against hospitalization.From finding 1: individuals who received two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine had 33% protection against infection, relative to the unvaccinatedFrom finding 2: People who were infected with COVID-19 in South Africa’s third (Delta) wave face a 40% relative risk of reinfection with OmicronAm I reading this right?

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The inimitable Hans Rosling[1] used to call himself a &#34;possibilist&#34;:People often call me an optimist, because I show them the enormous progress they didn&#39;t know about. That makes me angry. I&#39;m not an optimist. That makes me sound naive. I&#39;m a very serious “possibilist”. That&#39;s something I made up. It means someone who neither hopes without reason, nor fears without reason, someone who constantly resists the overdramatic worldview. As a possibilist, I see all this progress, and it fills me with conviction and hope that further progress is possible. This is not optimistic. It is having a clear and reasonable idea about how things are. It is having a worldview that is constructive and useful.           • • •

In his book &#39;Factfulness&#39; (definitely read it), he talks about &#34;bad and better&#34;:Think of the world as a premature baby in an incubator.  The baby’s health status is extremely bad and her breathing, heart rate, and other important signs are tracked constantly so that changes for better or worse can quickly be seen. After a week, she is getting a lot better. On all the main measures, she is improving, but she still has to stay in the incubator because her health is still critical.Does it make sense to say that the infant’s situation is improving? Yes. Absolutely. Does it make sense to say it is bad? Yes, absolutely. Does saying “things are improving” imply that everything is fine, and we should all relax and not worry? No, not at all. Is it helpful to have to choose between bad and improving? Definitely not. It’s both. It’s both bad and better. Better, and bad, at the same time. That is how we must think about the current state of the world.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Rosling"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another good quote for the OP is Miguel De Cervantes, author if Don Quixote: &#34;there is madness in too much sanity, and the greatest madness of all is to see things as they are instead of as they should be&#34;.He would know: Cervantes killed a rival on a duel at 17 and fled to sea.  They were attacked by pirates and he fought well before getting his hand blown off and taken prisoner.  He lived in captivity but befriended his captor, who taught him chess and literacy.  Then he was &#34;rescued&#34; by monks who bought his freedom but placed him on indentured servitude through debt, which he finally escaped by writing one of the early great novels.The point of this story is not that cynics were wrong but that one never would have survived his ordeal.  In a world fit for cynics, you have to be ready for things to go right if you want to escape."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m pretty sure I fall into the definition of a cynic given in the piece&#34;according to cynics, the world operates in a certain way, the elites are always the same, and will always be the same. The cynics think we are always playing the same game that has always been played. For example, a cynic may think that media’s only purpose is to sells your attention to advertisers - like I did here. And often they might be right.&#34;but I too be honest don&#39;t really see the problem with that kind of worldview. I&#39;m not chronically depressed or antagonistic because of it, but I think I&#39;d rather have what I&#39;d consider a realistic and true view of the world as it is rather than anything else.&#34;One of the strongest medicines against cynical mindset which I’ve tried is to do a “no-complain challenge”. I find its effects to be enormous and durable for years. In this challenge, you move a bracelet from one wrist to the other when you catch yourself complaining. The goal is to make it 21 days without having move the wrist. &#34;Before you start prescribing medicine we need to agree that cynicism is an illness first, which is not so easily done. I think the author conflates people who are sort of angry or pessimistic because of their lot in life with his definition of a cynic. I take the cynical view because of what I perceive are fundamental aspects of human nature collectively, not my mood personally. I can beat that challenge without a problem because I rarely complain, or win the lottery tomorrow and it wouldn&#39;t really have an impact of my views on the way the world operates overall."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve found that there&#39;s a weird internal psychology I have with any news relating to Webb.  I&#39;m just as excited and hopeful as everyone else.  But somehow the whole story underscores the perils of singular hope.  It also seems to underscore the inherent issues with massive, carefully planned, &#34;vertically&#34; scaled science projects a la 20th century NASA.  I&#39;ve carved out a little nook in my psyche to cope with the outcome that something goes wrong during the Webb&#39;s incredibly complicated launch process and all those years of effort come to nothing.It&#39;s also made me wonder if there&#39;s a way for humanity to pivot to more &#34;horizontally&#34; scaled science.  I&#39;m imagining a kind of science conducted by aggregating the data collected by many cheap, easily produced instruments instead of a few incredibly fragile, extremely difficult to build contraptions.  I have an intuition that we&#39;ll increasingly run up against practical limitations in undertaking ever more complex projects of this kind in the coming years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Talking about Ariane 5, it&#39;s been interesting reading parts of its history. Particularly:&#34;Ariane 5&#39;s first test flight (Ariane 5 Flight 501) on 4 June 1996 failed, with the rocket self-destructing 37 seconds after launch because of a malfunction in the control software. A data conversion from 64-bit floating point value to 16-bit signed integer value to be stored in a variable representing horizontal bias caused a processor trap (operand error)because the floating point value was too large to be represented by a 16-bit signed integer. The software was originally written for the Ariane 4 where efficiency considerations (the computer running the software had an 80% maximum workload requirement) led to four variables being protected with a handler while three others, including the horizontal bias variable, were left unprotected because it was thought that they were &#34;physically limited or that there was a large margin of safety&#34;. The software, written in Ada, was included in the Ariane 5 through the reuse of an entire Ariane 4 subsystem despite the fact that the particular software containing the bug, which was just a part of the subsystem, was not required by the Ariane 5 because it has a different preparation sequence than the Ariane 4&#34;I wouldn&#39;t want any part on something as mission critical as getting a rocket to deliver something into orbit."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is cool but if we&#39;re not bound to static paper maps isn&#39;t the ultimate adaptive projection an interactive 3D perspective rendering of the globe? I suppose the downside is that you can&#39;t see both hemispheres at the same time.Then we can use our built-in spatial reasoning to compare how big some areas are by changing the perspective (as in real life), and shapes are only distorted by perspective which is very familiar."</p>

I&#39;m also somewhat surprised that I don&#39;t even get a pop-up from Firefox asking me if I want to allow the video elements to be played.(although I personally prefer my videos with controls enabling me to pause playback, instead of automatically looping fast-moving &#34;gifs&#34;, which can get very disorienting while reading, but that&#39;s a different discussion)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This hurts.RSS is the only way I know, without having to scrap things by hand, to get an aggregate of &#34;news/articles&#34; from the sites and blogs I follow, and I consider to be of good quality.I prefer to filter my information like this, instead of having to rely on some algorithm, or endlessly scrolling in a &#34;social medial wall&#34; full or clickbait articles, immortal/vintage memes or exuberant rants.If RSS dies, what is the alternative then? I understand that technically speaking it&#39;s not a good solution, but let&#39;s have something else before killing this.PS: I&#39;ve clicked on this link from a RSS reader (just a simple browser extension... that keeps me posted every morning)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a very happy daily RSS user, but we ought to be upfront about its ginormous deficiencies:- every day I deal with broken links and broken images because my feed reader doesn&#39;t know from which URL it should resolve relative links- there&#39;s no pagination mechanism, or way for a client to ask for &#34;all posts since last Friday&#34;. If you want your feed to always have all posts available, you need to include the entirety of your archive in every feed response.- if I want to follow any link I get kicked back out to a bloated web page- lots of posts include iframes, or content that only makes sense with JS enabled- XMLDespite this, I still love RSS. It&#39;s what we&#39;ve got and we should continue to make the most of it. But it also sucks, and it&#39;s not any surprise that mostly only technical people use it. I think feeds are pretty much doomed to keep breaking and disappearing. Many of the replacements or pseudo-replacements that people come up with seem fine, but the problem - as always - is getting people to actually use it, which mostly never happens."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The whole (non-Spotify, ugh) podcast ecosystem would like a word about RSS being obsolete.Patreon (and to a greater extent, the podcasters I support) keep making real money out of me and millions of others every month for personalised RSS feeds for content. That RSS feed is the delivery vehicle. It&#39;s very reliable, I can use it in any app, much good, so benefit, wow."</p>

No more coins; nothing. &#34;I&#39;ll pay you tomorrow,&#34; he told the door. Again he tried the knob. Again it remained locked tight. &#34;What I pay you,&#34; he informed it, &#34;is in the nature of a gratuity; I don&#39;t have to pay you.&#34; &#34;I think otherwise,&#34; the door said. &#34;Look in the purchase contract you signed when you bought this conapt.&#34; In his desk drawer he found the contract; since signing it he had found it necessary to refer to the document many times. Sure enough; payment to his door for opening and shutting constituted a mandatory fee. Not a tip. &#34;You discover I&#39;m right,&#34; the door said. It sounded smug.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"That is just bullshit.A $8/mo charge for a app based remote start? I could live with that. Servers need power, the app needs updates etc.A $8/mo charge for something which does not incur costs for Toyota? Hell no.It seems like bit by bit - every single industry is going down a fucked up route. TVs with built in ads? Cars with pay-by-month features? DRM locked coffee machines? I really hope, there is some sort of evil-bullshit-corp ranking homepage."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"And the toxic trend of corporate short-term-ism continues...This is clearly set up as a gotcha with a 3 year/10 year &#34;trial&#34; included, then suddenly $80(!) a year. The irony is that both periods are right around the time different demographics start to consider a new vehicle, and Toyota has just pulled this nonsense.You may be thinking $80/year isn&#39;t so bad if it includes breakdown coverage/SOS button, but you&#39;d be mistaken. The $80/year is ONLY for their &#34;Remote Connect&#34; service (app stuff, remote lock/unlock/start and notifications), you also need to pay another $80/year for &#34;Safety Connect&#34; (breakdown, SOS, stolen vehicle location), &#34;Wi-Fi Connect&#34; starting at $420/year for 2GB, and &#34;Destination Assist&#34; for $80/year.So you could be paying $660 per year OR MORE for your Toyota vehicle subscriptions alone.edited/fixed: &#34;per year&#34; now, instead of a confusing mix of per month and per year. Also, originally miscalculated the per year total and mislabelled it on top (was &#34;$275 per month&#34; which is double-wrong)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I work solely in marketing/advertising and have no clue how to code. I generally enjoy technology, which is why I&#39;m on HN.I think marketers and developers need a stronger culture between ourselves. The tools of marketers (data mining, consumer behavior analysis, surveys, market testing, etc) aren&#39;t just a veneer to be applied at the completion of a development project. Marketing, when done correctly, informs UX. Marketing can provide developers with insights into the problems they should try to solve.From what I can tell, many developers view the development process as a sacred protected space for creation. This is not the optimal means to delivering a high-impact product. Developers should be asking themselves during the development process: &#34;Is this feature going to excite a group of users, and do we have some statistical mechanism to predict that excitement?&#34;When you create something that you already know will excite people, the product launch becomes much simpler."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s the thing. Developers are generally perfectionists and marketers are realists. As a Developer, I am naturally uncomfortable with marketing because my default view is that I don&#39;t want to lie or over-promise and I don&#39;t like fluffy claims.Marketers and sales people can be less bothered about facts but I think much of the time, we just think that, the truth is that there can be a lot of fact-based marketing but also you just have to remember that your product will never be a perfect fit and neither are any of your competitors but you can sell anyway because you are making your customer&#39;s life better, not perfect!Imagine you are selling something like a Toyota SUV. Is it perfect? No. Is it the best price-point? Possibly not; the best MPG? Probably not but I am selling a package, a vehicle that ticks a lot of boxes for someone and ultimately something that is better than the competitors in some ways and worse in others.If I am uncomfortable selling the Toyota because the MPG isn&#39;t the best it could be, I am not saving the customer from disappointing MPG, I am pushing them to a competitor and taking away the benefits that they would get from a Toyota.If your product solves a problem, assuming it isn&#39;t garbage, then it will be better than competitors in some ways and worse in others. You can market it accordingly!Good luck."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I struggle with marketing so much. I built an amazing product, existing customers love it, but spending any time on doing marketing feels like either wasting development time or spending time to try to force people into buying something they might not want.Most ads are trying to trick you into buying stuff you don&#39;t really need. I know there are cases in which you actually see a relevant ad for something you really want to buy and that will bring value to your life, but that&#39;s usually an edge case.What I am working on doing now is to combine development + marketing. Instead of creating marketing material to sell, I am creating marketing material to educate: create how-to instructional videos, technical blog posts, improve the documentation, etc. If you sell a tool I think this is the best way to go, instead of advertising how cool your tool is, teach people how to use your tool and what they can do with it (eg. if you sell a hammer don&#39;t show people how to drive nails and give a 50% limited time discount code; teach them how to build a chair and let them decide themselves if they need a hammer or not)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The coloring, fonts, monsters, sets, and UIs of NGE are so pleasing to look at.I hold NGE in much higher regard than other similar IPs, and would continue to do so even without the excellent art direction. Like many other stories, NGE asks &#34;what would happen if a young boy with an unusual ability was entrusted with the saving of humanity?&#34; However, unlike many other stories, the show answers &#34;he would fail, be driven insane in the process, and humanity would fall.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Typeface work in NGE it&#39;s amazing. Despite using the most common typefaces, you can recognize the card titles as the &#34;Evangelion Art Style&#34; despite only using fonts, copywriting and layout as design elements.Plus I love how Evangelion falls into a middle of exaggerated UIs to have the &#34;hacker look&#34; of /r/itsaunixsystem/, and at the same an amazing level of detail that make sense in their own world.Like when MAGI it&#39;s being hacked by the Computer Angel or SEELE, you can see they use a form of assembly and a Unix System to fight it.And then, the MAGI system by itself it&#39;s an amazing use of redundant architecture with 3 computers that should have the same output. That a system that it&#39;s resistant to data corruption, but at the same time working as an GAN AI.Amazing to think this it&#39;s from the 90s, and the most amazing part that those details are just 1% of what makes evangelion interesting."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"NGE has always been a favorite of me because of the UIs that are represented throughout the series. The new(ish?) movies are just gorgeous, I highly suggest you give them a try if you haven&#39;t already.If you like this, you may as well enjoy: https://scifiinterfaces.com/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Something I’d like to see, in browsers, Cloudflare Workers, Deno, etc: explicit network firewall in the software stack.An example with Workers, one script might only need to fetch from Backblaze. I’d like to set their host as a whitelisted address, and so even if a log4j type vuln happens, it can’t go anywhere except Backblaze.I think this could even work in browser-land? If you don’t need to pull in any resources outside the original host, deny any fetch made unless it’s added to a whitelist. For browsers this would need to be opt-in for backwards compatibility, but an ideal state would be opt-out (to allow all)."</p>

In fact one of the projects I haven&#39;t gotten around to finishing is to patch the memory init code for an old Atom processor embedded motherboard to make it recognise more combinations of RAM modules; analysis of the BIOS and leaked sources shows that it was stupidly written as &#34;if(512MB in slot 1 and 512MB in slot 2) ... else if(1GB in slot 1 and empty slot 2) else if(1GB in slot 1 and 1GB in slot 2) ...&#34;, when the memory controller can actually be set up generally to work with many more different configurations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was looking to Hackintosh an older Dell desktop I had squirreled away and in the process of gathering all the hardware every piece of documentation I found insisted that it topped out at 4GB. This was a late-era Core 2 so that seemed completely nonsensical to me (I don&#39;t think I ever owned a Core 2 that had less than 8) and, wouldn&#39;t you know it, 8GB worked perfectly fine.Funnily enough, like the article&#39;s author I also encountered a DSDT-related problem on that same system: if you were to dump the tables and recompile them with the standard Intel utility it straight up wouldn&#39;t work. Came to find out that there are apparently two compilers, one from Intel and another from MS and the MS one is super-lenient about accepting garbage. Eventually worked out that the logic in the stock tables was such that several features (HPET and sleep, iirc) just straight up don&#39;t work unless the OS identifies itself to ACPI as Vista (and not like Vista+, Vista exclusively). Such a pain."</p>

how many there are.   
It is like playing endless whack a mole.I recently have had the need download some Windows software and all the top links from Google are scam sites. By that I mean they pretend to look like the legitimate / real site and they can be damn good at it.No wonder my dad for one has downloaded stuff from those kinda sites.I started blocking them, but there seemed to be an endless supply.I am hoping users can work together to create smart blacklists, and
there are already some subscription feeds for it.I do worry about performance as the lists grows."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Of course they&#39;re scared. Even if Intel is able to close performance gaps, cloud computing is often an easy sell for ARM and Amazon is likely going to be able to get the chips cheaper given that they&#39;re looking for markup on the service end while Intel needs markup on the chip.If I&#39;m writing new software using Java, C#, Python, JavaScript, etc. it&#39;s easy to deploy to ARM. With Apple moving to ARM and 25% of developers using Macs (41-45% using Windows)*, there&#39;s going to be good ARM support for what developers need. Sure, some things might might run better on Intel and some things might not easily port, but that feels like it isn&#39;t the case for the majority of stuff that developers are going to be doing.It seems likely that Microsoft and Google will introduce ARM-based instances. We know Google has dipped its toe in with its Tensor processor for the Pixel. We&#39;ve seen reports that Microsoft has been working on ARM processors for servers. Qualcomm is gearing up for a major push into better ARM processors to compete with Apple on the desktop/laptop, but presumably they&#39;d be happy to get cloud workloads as well. Oracle, while not a major cloud provider, has ARM-based instances already.Intel has had a virtual monopoly for 20 years. Now they&#39;re facing a resurgent AMD stealing x86 marketshare and ARM processors that are quickly becoming a better price/performance option - and Apple is ensuring that everything developers need will be ARM compatible. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s an existential threat, but there&#39;s a huge difference between the margins you get as a virtual monopoly and the margins you get when you have to compete against strong competitors.Plus, I&#39;d guess that AWS is probably making sweet margins off those Graviton instances. Let&#39;s say that their margin on Intel instances is X and that margin on Graviton is 2X. That leaves AWS a lot of room to start pushing Intel out of their datacenters as old hardware is replaced. Let&#39;s say you&#39;re a company spending $100M/year with AWS and you&#39;re renewing your contract. Maybe Amazon suggests that they could give you a 20% discount off Intel boxes and a 40% discount off Graviton boxes - which they say are already 20% better price/performance so it&#39;s basically 52% off!It also gives AWS negotiating power with Intel. If 20% of AWS customers move to Graviton, you can go to Intel and say, &#34;we&#39;re finding Graviton processors really cheap to make and operate and customers are loving them...more and more they&#39;re realizing they don&#39;t need your Intel processors...if we don&#39;t get cheaper Intel processors, we might have to accelerate our incentives to get people onto Graviton boxes...the more we accelerate that, the more Google Cloud and Azure will likely want to prioritize ARM boxes...&#34;They&#39;re scared because it&#39;s the type of thing that snowballs until their lock-in is near meaningless. If ARM becomes 50% of the server market, there goes Intel&#39;s ability to demand high margins. 5-10 years from now, most deployments could use Intel or ARM based on price/performance rather than instruction set - and that makes life a lot harder for Intel.The problem with this ad/page is that the ship has already sailed. Once Apple introduced its M1 MacBooks, we were getting first-class ARM support for everything developers would need going forward. It didn&#39;t happen overnight, but with Apple going all-in on ARM chips and with Macs being such a big player in developer usage, the war was lost that day. Now it&#39;s just a matter of time. Once all your devs are running and testing their stuff on an M1 MacBook, why not deploy it to an ARM instance?* From StackOverflow&#39;s 2021 developer survey"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This ad reminds me of the way it felt to work at Sun Microsystems around 2002, when all the engineers  knew that cheap GNU Linux boxes were the future. The marketing people had similar FUD-based ads about how the TCO of Linux was higher, how certain HPC jobs wouldn’t run well etc. super similar to this Intel ad today."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"25 years ago I was excited to learn that the Quake editor (and Doom before that) was written on NeXT. I figured with my rudimentary Linux and C skills I could get it working, but of course it was a little harder than installing everything and running makeFrom JohnC:&#34;This is a NEXTSTEP application, so hardly anyone is going to be able to use the code as is. This is not an OPENSTEP application. It doesn&#39;t even use the foundation kit, so porting to gnustep or openstep-solaris/mach/nt would not be trivial.&#34;&#34;This application was really not a very good fit for NEXTSTEP. The display postscript model fundamentally doesn&#39;t fit very well with what we need here -- if you run in an 8 bit color mode, the line drawing runs at an ok speed, but the texture view goes half the speed it should as it dithers from 24 bit color down to 8 bit. If you run in 24 bit color mode, you get less screen real estate and significantly slower line drawing as a 3 megabyte XY view is flushed. Sigh. If anyone does actually run this on NEXTSTEP be advised that you want a fast machine.&#34;&#34;QuakeEd is written for NEXTSTEP 3.3, while GnuStep is an implementation of the OPENSTEP spec. I haven&#39;t had time to port it to openstep yet, but it looks like it will take a little effort. NeXT has tools in NS 4.0 to help, but it still isn&#39;t automatic.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So I use GNUstep and I really like it.It is not an Apple emulator—it is an OPENstep emulator and so it implements the amazing Cocoa API and many mac/iOS frameworks can be used server side with minimal porting.This makes it easy for what I intend to keep as a one person project forever or as long as Apple continues to support Objective-C.You want to know an unpopular opinion?? I love Objective-C and I think it is better—way better than Swift. And—if you have discipline, the preprocessor is excellent.So while many might say GNUstep is buggy, it is working for several of us—and happily so.I do agree that the homepage is terrible and that what should be done is put some installer scripts so you can start using it immediately. An Ubuntu installation following the corresponding script here is foolproof: https://github.com/plaurent/gnustep-buildCheck it out!!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It was nice endevour to port NeXTSTEP development stack.Nowadays with it being several releases behind macOS tooling, and the whole issue of what from Objective-C v-latest is actually supported, it is more of a curiosity and nostalgic experience."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"*Technically*, this is very cool, impressive, and generally an elegant work of art.*Pragmatically*, I see 2 flaws in their thesis (as explained on the about page):&gt;&gt; &#34;The entire network already consumes 10% of global electricity production with traffic doubling roughly every 2 years&#34;I think the implication is electricity consumption will also double roughly every 2 years, but Moore&#39;s law actually operates on approx. same timeline, so traffic can continue doubling at this rate without an increase in energy consumption. *This is why technology is brilliant.* It allows us to do much much more with the same resources. We should want more technological innovation.&gt;&gt; &#34; These black-and-white images are then coloured according to the pertaining content category via the browser’s native image manipulation capacities&#34;This essentially shifts some of the burden of computation from the server (PNG compression) to the browser (dithering interpretation). This may save some energy, or it may increase energy as most personal computer processors are much less efficient than server processors, and don&#39;t benefit from energy savings from caching. I&#39;m not sure where it nets out, but just solely focusing on reducing server compute time isn&#39;t necessarily a path toward sustainability if it shifts more computation to the client.Very happy to hear if I&#39;ve misinterpreted the thesis. Again, I commend the technical work itself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Small technical nit: I love the dithered images and the retro feel, but their CSS should specify `image-rendering: pixelated` to make sure browsers don&#39;t interpolate the pixels."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this also shows how inefficient modern website hosting is. The fact that this person was able to get a raspberry pi to host the #1 website on HN powered by a small 50 watt solar panel is very cool (meaning maybe 10w average power budget), but also shouldn&#39;t be as uncommon as it is today. To put this in perspective, a modern server uses 50-100 watts idle doing nothing, and many more under load. To handle the top of HN, the developer probably would use load balancing and other tech, multiplying the power usage accordingly.
Edit: fixing typos."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I thought this was such a fantastic response, particularly the sections where he talks about how he responds to companies demanding he reply as if he has a contract with them.The main point being that, with the log4j issue (and others before that), the thing that&#39;s struck me when maintainers complain about not being appreciated or that they are working as hard as they can, unpaid, is that maintainers are under no obligation to respond at all, and that you can&#39;t control how other people will react.As someone who&#39;s dealt with anxiety for a long time (and as a former opensource primary maintainer), I can most definitely commiserate with feeling burdened by the expectations of others, but one of the best things I learned from therapy is that you can&#39;t control others emotions, you can only attempt to understand why you react as you do in certain situations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Someone I know met Simon one day and thought I’d like his autograph, since I was working in security at the time. I had in fact introduced that team to PuTTY, though this friend didn’t know that.So I own a postcard that says words to the effect, “nobody has ever asked me for an autograph before”. It is framed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"1. Removing senescent cells extends life by 30-40% with huge quality of life improvements in the last 25% of the life (relative to control), in mice. This isn&#39;t an elimination of all aging, but quite a valuable thing regardless. Eventually, other causes of aging would kick in and still cause death, without a single senescent cell in your body (e.g. DNA methylation).2. I believe all governments should create Warpspeed for this approach. At the depths of covid lockdowns, GDP was down 20%. Imagine the massive GDP creation from making every 65+ year old feel 40 again. They&#39;d work, consume, and generally flourish. Even if it&#39;s only 10 more years of quality life, this is the  greatest good that could be done for humanity. To avoid another 10 years of my parents death is something I&#39;d do a lot for. Economically and ethically, we should prioritize this research above most else.3. This approach is scientifically sound. Certain aspects of aging cures are approaching engineering levels of work rather than pure science. We simply know that many diseases are caused or amplified by senescent cells. And we have ample evidence that elimination of these cells reverses diseases in complex mammals, as long as you don&#39;t remove too many, too quickly. The rest, is the engineering problem of how to remove the right cells at the right cadence.4. This is the kind of thing biohackers should hack on. Find an aging part of your skin, and attempt to convince your body to kill the senescent cells. If you succeed, you will have benefited humanity, become beautiful, become wealthy, and be remembered forever (is there any other fundamental need humans have, not covered)?Let the race begin!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The team, including Juntendo University professor Toru Minamino, confirmed that mice administered with the vaccine showed decreases in the zombie cells, medically known as senescent cells, and in areas affected by arterial stiffening.By now this has become a trope. &#34;Researchers develop new treatment for {UNTREATED_DISEASE}&#34; ... in mice.Mouse models of human disease are very limited in their predictive ability. There&#39;s a lot of research that needs to follow this before there&#39;s even a hope of a human trial, let alone vaccine. And the failure rate for treatments at the mouse stage is quite high.Some of the comments on this thread treat this research paper as the announcement of an an imminent anti-aging vaccine. It&#39;s not."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Note that these mice were fed a high fat diet (HFD), essentially toxic fat overload to generate disease phenotypes that one can demonstrate an improvement in. Mice normally eat a mainly grain based diet, so getting 45% of calories from fat is as you can imagine pretty bad for them.This is a common theme in anti-ageing research. When you administer some cariacature of poor lifestyle, it is much easier to find ways to improve things. The long running calorie restriction experiements in monkeys illustrate this well [1,2] - in monkeys being fed a bad diet, calorie restriction works great. In monkeys eating a kinda normal monkey diet, calorie restriction doesn&#39;t do much (and the unrestricted healthy eating monkeys live longer than the calorie restricted junky monkeys). Peter Attia had a good podcast with Steve Austad where they discuss this, albeit paywalled.Unfortunately the style of experiment in the OP is good for publishing papers but hardly advances knowledge or helps us to explain anything.It is much more difficult to demonstrate improvements in healthspan in animals that are living well. The ITP experiments have shown a few drugs can do this, with rapamycin being the most broadly effective.[1] Junky monkey: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2812811/

They&#39;re supposed to be super annoying because the people which need them do things which have been deemed unacceptable from the legislature. Instead of complying, they choose this obnoxious practice so they could continue with what they&#39;ve been doing for years, which is monitoring every action a visitor does.You don&#39;t need a cookie banner to be allowed to create Cookies. You only need them if you&#39;re using them for something like tracking.A session cookie, selected theme etc is all fine without that banner"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There already is a better solution and always has been, it&#39;s called setting cookie preferences at the browser level and then leaving it.Trying to regulate the option for cookie preferences at the individual site level was always a stupid idea. The average person visits thousands of websites every year. Of course nobody is going to take the time to do that.If the lawmakers in the EU were intelligent, they would have created a law that forced all web browsers to provide &#34;X&#34; privacy setting features for EU-domiciled users (where X is what they were aiming to achieve).In addition to not burdening the entire world with time wasting popups all day, this option would have also had the bonus of not burdening millions of small businesses around the globe with complex regulation and legal liability.Not to mention the total lack of enforceability of the current law when it comes to websites operated outside of the EU.If done at the browser-level you really only have to police &lt;10 companies."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Laws that require software companies to implement a user choice should really contain some wording against dark patterns. EU lawmakers could have been warned: A similar thing happened back when Microsoft was forced to give users in the EU a choice of browsers, when they created the most confusing dialog possible and hoped that users would just click OK to Internet Explorer out of desperation.For me personally, when those data protection laws where implemented, seeing the extent of the market for user tracking was a shock to me. The respect that I lost for actually quite a lot of companies as a consequence has informed some purchasing decisions. And I don’t think anybody would mind those banners if the opt-out option you want to click is reachable with a single, easily visible button.Edit: Responses suggest that the GDPR already contains something to that effect. Glad to know. If that’s true, then I guess it’s time for court cases to sort this out."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The library that I first used which got me stuck to Python was Tkinter. It was a welcome relief from building GUIs using GTK in C. The documentation which I used was from effbot (which seems to be offline now) http://web.archive.org/web/20180802131839/http://effbot.org/.... That led me to making Python my &#34;primary language&#34; when it still wasn&#39;t very popular and shaped my career.I think it&#39;s hard, if not impossible, to overestimate how many lives Mr. Lundh&#39;s work has touched and improved over the course of his career. RIP."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The effbot was an early mentor me.  He had a brusque style, an excellent sense of design, and a wry wit.  He thought deeply about programming problems and did not shy away from non-trivial tasks such as regular expressions.  His ElementTree library humanized XML parsing and generation in Python."</p>

Zip up the resulting folder and ta-da you have an application. Just unzip and run the .exe.If you want a single-file exe (as in completely statically compiled without self-extraction) that&#39;s a bit more advanced and requires a few properties in the csproj to configure how to handle native assemblies that expect to exist on disk.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unpopular opinion: native GUI app development on most platforms is a shitshow. Huge toolkits, copious amounts of boilerplate, and a huge amount of dev effort thrown at the platform just to get it working.Meanwhile, say what you will about the web ecosystem, I&#39;ve given interns/jr devs tickets like: see if you can get this webapp running in electron, and maybe figure out how to do push notifications and save data locally. Two days later the project is done. A week later, the app is ready to install.I think the real reason I quit doing meaningful amount of native GUI development a decade ago was velocity. The developer experience with iOS is probably about the best of the major GUI platforms, but even that is rife with tarpits of tribal knowledge and gets really complicated to release an app due to the whole App Store experience."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a lot to untangle here.Point 1 is largely true, Microsoft builds too many competing UI toolkits.Point 3: You can slim down Visual Studio&#39;s install a lot if you&#39;re more selective during installation. For example if I only wanted to do .Net desktop application development it is closer to 4 GB and under 10 GB on disk.Point 4: Is actually the end of the original synopsis on the topic and after it veers off. You successfully built the application.Now it goes a little off the rails:Point 5: &#34;The app is extremely resource heavy and way too over-featured.&#34; Ok? You didn&#39;t say which toolkit, guide, or similar you used nor what you define as resource heavy or in what way it was &#34;over-featured.&#34; This is too vague to discuss meaningfully (e.g. Win32 applications built in C++ definitely aren&#39;t resource heavy or over-featured for example, and since you didn&#39;t clarify even what tech stack was used let alone guide/template this isn&#39;t constructive at all).Point 6: I&#39;ve read this sentence several times but seemingly you opened an executable in a text editor and that somehow broke your build process? Or something? Was it write-locked by the editor?Point 7-10: You had a working build pipeline, you broke the pipeline, then decided to start again from scratch in an editor that doesn&#39;t have native desktop development support on Windows (because the old editor was &#34;bloated&#34;). You found this process problematic.So in answer to:&gt; Why is building Windows apps so complicatedYou made it complicated by using unsupported workflows and introducing arbitrary limitations on what was a successful outcome. There&#39;s a lot you can legitimately criticize Windows and even its desktop application development workflow for, but this isn&#39;t that."</p>

If I leave the garage door open and unattended, they&#39;re in in a flash and setting up shop. The only way to get rid of them is the traps, and you have to get rid of them.Peanut butter bait is irresistible. I used to use gloves to bait them cuz the books say they mice are deterred by human smell. They aren&#39;t. They aren&#39;t deterred by The Cat, either, as they know The Cat prefers human flesh.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Readers who are interested in the actionable aspects of this topic should probably read the last instalment in this series: https://commoncog.com/blog/accelerated-expertise/The basic idea is this:1. Deliberate practice only works for skills with a history of good pedagogical development. If no such pedagogical development exists, you can’t do DP. Source: read Peak, or any of Ericsson’s original papers. Don’t read third party or popsci accounts of DP.2. Once you realise this, then the next question you should ask is how can you learn effectively in a skill domain where no good pedagogical development exists? Well, it turns out a) the US military wanted answers to exactly this question, and b) a good subsection of the expertise research community wondered exactly the same thing.3. The trick is this: use cognitive task analysis to extract tacit knowledge from the heads of existing experts. These experts built their expertise through trial and error and luck, not DP. But you can extract their knowledge as a shortcut. After this, you use the extracted tacit knowledge to create a case library of simulations. Sort the simulations according to difficulty to use as training programs. Don’t bother with DP — the pedagogical development necessary for DP to be successful simply takes too long.Broadly speaking, DP and tacit knowledge extraction represent two different takes on expertise acquisition. For an overview of this, read the Oxford Handbook of Expertise and compare against the Cambridge Handbook of Expertise. The former represents the tacit knowledge extraction approach; the latter represents the DP approach. Both are legitimate approaches, but one is more tractable when you find yourself in a domain with underdeveloped training methods (like most of the skill domains necessary for success in one’s career)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"IMO Tacit knowledge is what we used to call judgement.Judgement is basically knowing a bunch of things but having a good idea of which things are more important than others, and especially knowing which things are worth spending time on any which aren&#39;t.It&#39;s like when I see someone talking about financial options and they put everything on the board at once: what are puts and calls, what&#39;s an iron butterfly and other strategies, do they need to know the payoff diagram, what about black scholes, what are the Greeks, when should I exercise, and so on. They are all things that a professional option trader knows, but when you&#39;re a pro you reduce your cognitive load because you know what actually matters and you are not juggling all these concepts at the same time.It&#39;s also the source of frustration when interviewing. Say you&#39;ve written CPP for many years, you&#39;re probably not prepared to answer questions on all corners of the language, even though you&#39;re an expert in some sense. Someone relatively newer might be better at that task, because they&#39;re thinking a lot about everything, including things they haven&#39;t decided are unimportant yet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m sorry, I was really into the whole Deliberate practice thing and then I read this and thought &#34;Oh no, did I have it all wrong?&#34;So I read the book he quoted - &#34;Source of Power&#34;. And you know what? It has a tremendous overlap with Deliberate Practice.The proponents of Deliberate Practice never claim to &#34;just do it over and over&#34; - you have to have background knowledge, a teacher/coach, etc... the tacit knowledge. Part of it is given to you and part of it is something that you&#39;re put into a position to experience for yourself.It seems the &#34;divide&#34; is overstated."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The people trying to point out that this falls short of photorealism are missing the point. This is a tech demo aiming to show off the next generation leap unreal engine 5 is making. There’s lots to be impressed about here and this was made using a ton of procedural generation using a team of just about 70 people.Here’s a great deep dive into some of the new technologies that highlights the strengths and weaknesses of some of the new engine tools: https://youtu.be/ib6_c6uliLgThis is extremely exciting this is possible on a year old console and not a 3090."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This writeup is unsubtle in being a puff piece. The demoed tech is very impressive! Individual stills taken from the video are pretty convincing.The motion version definitely still exhibits uncanny valley, though—lights that are too hard on flesh, tightness and sharpness where there should be softness. That I have to resort to hand-wavey descriptors is cool; they’re getting close! But crossing uncanny valley is HARD.What this demo convinces me of is not that we’re there; we are not. Claiming that we are is disingenuous, and makes me distrust the claimant. But it makes apparent that we will get there. And that’s impressive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thanks to HN, I checked it out on my PS5 tonight. Very impressive. The thing that immediately jumped out at me was the 24fps target. The demo has a cinematic feeling, and thus the 24fps framerate feels “correct.” Compared to 60fps, you can do a lot more when you have 2.5x as much time per frame.The first part is a CGI representation of Keanu and Carrie-Anne. I was shocked at the quality; it had “the demoscene feel,” if you know what I mean - “I did not know the hardware could do that.” Artists going full OCD, just because it was the right thing to do. Great work.Parts of it had that CGI feeling, but most of the first two minutes, I swear I was watching video and not CG.Part 2: the city tour. I am not sure if there’s a detailed YouTube video of same, but the artists used some clever tricks, as any good 3D artist would. You can fly around and peer into offices and apartments through their windows. There are a limited number of static rooms, and they use frosted glass to blur the details. Interiors are fully modeled and there is parallax through the glass. HVAC units on rooftops are robust, down to the warning messages. Great use of LOD.I saw Z-fighting and LOD “popping” when surveying the city from on high.I walked away from this (um, got up from the sofa) thinking Epic’s gambit is to push Unreal Engine 5 as a virtual movie set.They went all out on the character models in the first part, with Keanu and Carrie-Anne. There were a few uncanny valley shots (“dead eyes”) but very impressive overall. Some of the shots could be taken as a reference, or gold standard.Even more impressive is that it’s running on a (loss leader) $600 Sony PS5."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Our machine has W=UINT16_MAX words, of N=16 bits eachDid the seemingly-off-by-one-error catch anyone else? A 16-bit integer has 65536 values, so you&#39;ll be going one past the end of the virtual RAM if you attempt to access address FFFFh.With this simple trick, we can avoid writing a switch statement with 16 (+1) casesPersonally, I prefer having a switch since it&#39;s more obvious which opcode goes where. Probably makes the code a little shorter too (and is that another off-by-one, this time in the other direction?)Also, I understand the need to keep a &#34;learning architecture&#34; simple, but without byte-wide memory access, you&#39;ll quickly realise how annoying it is to work with actual bytes. For example, any string handling, unless you decide to use UTF-16 instead. I think a sweet spot is 16-bit address and 8-bit data, with register pairs for 16-bit operations, much like the popular Z80 and the 8080/8085 that preceded it.The DEC Alpha is a real architecture that made a similar mistake and later had to be extended to fix it: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEC_Alpha#Byte-Word_Extensions..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Really cool!I&#39;ve never understood why modern software projects use names like `mw` or `mr`? What&#39;s wrong with `memory_read` / `memory_write`? Or `opcode_execute_fn opcode_executers[NOPS]` is magnitudes clearer than `op_ex_f op_ex[NOPS]`, and the only advantage of the latter is less time to write.You will spend at least twice as much time reading your code as writing it, just take the extra time. Nobody needs another `vsnprintf_s`.ETA: I have to repeat this is an insanely cool project idea, and very good execution"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Granular control over requests is completely lost in Manifest V3.For example, with Manifest V2 we can initiate a request from a content script after we begin listening for it from the background script, pass a single-use token in the Accept header, identify the request from the background script based on the token, remove the token from the Accept header and edit other headers before the request is sent to the server, then manipulate the response for that single request and stop listening from the background script.I use this workflow in Search by Image to grab an image from the page context when no CSP headers are present for the asset, and the image is only served if a certain cookie and referrer is sent. This will no longer be possible to achieve with the current API of Manifest V3. Extensions used for page archival will also be impacted.Manifest V3 removes a robust toolset that content blockers can use the react to all evasion techniques ad companies implement, and the rest of the extension ecosystem will be part of the fallout."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the interesing things about this story is that there appears to be no consideration of not &#34;updating&#34; to a new Chrome version.  The idea of user choice in &#34;updating&#34; is completely absent.  Why cannot a user say, &#34;V3 sounds wonderful but I will stick with V2, thank you.&#34;  A user has a version of a program that works for that user (e.g., with uBlock Origin), and Google can apparently forcibly stop that user from using that working version, through a process of &#34;automatic updates&#34;.  Users must &#34;accept&#34; updates which makes one wonder Google can pull this off.  Does it not rely on user behaviour.  By accepting every &#34;update&#34; without question, the user is effectively consenting to being controlled.Perhaps users will someday &#34;wake up&#34; to realise that so-called updates are not necessarily being remotely installed for their benefit, but for the benefit of someone else.  No doubt Google has some parallel construction type explanation why users need V3, but how many folks cannot see that they are letting the fox guard the henhouse.Perhaps if ads can be blocked, so too can updates.  (IME, it&#39;s possible.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Now is the perfect time for Open Source maintainers to become legible to the big companies that depend on them—and that want to get more out of them—and send them five-to-six figure invoices.Well, this is exactly what I&#39;ve been doing around VideoLAN (VLC, x264) and FFmpeg for the last few years. In order to do that, I&#39;ve created 2 official companies Videolabs and FFlabs (besides the non-profit orgs) and I&#39;ve gone through all the hoops to get paid (PO, billing, invoices, registering to large companies is a lot of paperwork, tbh, but well..) and we try and bill small to large companies that depends on those projects.And FFmpeg and x264 are the core of the online video.So I did exactly what Filippo is saying we should do.But the result is really not impressive. Seriously, asking for money for support from those companies feels like we&#39;re pulling the nails, even if their full business depends on it. Getting 30-50k$ from those companies for support for one year can be very challenging, long or leading to nowhere at all.So, large SV companies and startup should also start agreeing to pay for open source, when it&#39;s the core of the tech."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m an open source author and maintainer of a somewhat-popular python package[0] (~1M downloads/month) that I&#39;ve maintained for over 10 years. I don&#39;t recall ever receiving a donation. I am still maintaining it, but I just don&#39;t have time to add the improvements that it needs to keep up with the ecosystem (asyncio, for example). If organizations who use it got together and chipped in some non-negligible amount, I would be much more serious about keeping up with it, but $0, or $5-20/month, is just not realistic incentive to compete with other priorities in my life.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Once upon a time, the best way to get a software job was to demonstrate your ability to build useful open source projects.  10 years ago the Principal Engineers I would work with had super sized open source portfolio&#39;s which leant them both credibility and experience building products people liked.  Junior devs would search (sometimes in vain) for issues where they could contribute a few PRsNow the best way to get a job is leet code, leet code, and more leet code.  Rather than spending  &lt;5 hours a week working with real code and producing real value on open source projects - most career minded engineers will simply focus on leetcode.Not many people patch esoteric software that&#39;s been around for 10+ years because it&#39;s particularly fun or because there is specific business value in it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a project I&#39;ve been working on to create decentralized, peer to peer, &#34;serverless&#34; websites using several technologies including webtorrent, dmt (mutable torrent BEP-46), and handshake decentralized domains.You can create either an immutable (uneditable) torrent site, or you can create a ed25519 keypair and create a mutable (updatable) torrent site.This is great for blogging, whistle blowing, and other things.  It also scales well since torrent technology is great although it had previous been pigeonholed to other use cases.Please give it a try and let me know your thoughts!  I don&#39;t take any credit for this since I just weaved the great technologies others already made together!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a fantastic work!The best part of Federalist is reading and displaying the websites from BitTorrent using BEP-46. The Handshake part is less impressive for me personally, since it basically reads Handshake values from a service (query.hdns.io/dns-query).If Federalist adds a Handshake daemon, it will be much more decentralized, but at the same time much heavier on resources.For historical perspective, decentralized websites (or p2p websites) are here since like 20 years. Here&#39;s a super concise list of what I recall off the top of my head.- Freenet is the first project I&#39;m aware of doing that- ENS+IPFS websites is a strong movement now (see esteroids.eth.limo, I&#39;m a co-creator of this)- ZeroNet was going strong like 5 years ago, and even though it&#39;s less popular now it&#39;s still functional and a nice project.- Agregor browser brings decentralized website the Hypercore (a successor of DAT protocol)- BitTorrent was supposed to have a project especially for decentralized websites (Maelstrom web browser), but it didn&#39;t took off eventually- Magnetico is a search engine built on top of BitTorrent, very similar to Federalists, but without the Handshake part.- Skynet is a project meant almost only for decentralized websites, based on Sia. They have integration with ENS, and afaik, also with Handshake (check it out!)- Swarm, Namecoin etc. could also be used for decentralized websites. I saw some people doing demos with it, but can&#39;t recall any links/names atm."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Ironically, on a previous team I had switched our log4j2 log formats over to %m{nolookups} like 8 months ago... I didn&#39;t realize the whole jndi issue, what we ran into was the O(n^2) behavior of its string substitution.While deploying an ancillary change, our jvms started locking up for minutes on end. What was happening was that we were logging customer input, and the change caused it to run certain things in parallel, which ended up logging the data multiple times. Normally the extra logging didn&#39;t matter but one customer had data like &#34;${foo} ${bar} ${baz} ...&#34;. Even when the ${foo} portion is replaced wothout modification, this triggers quadratic behavior. So we were already potentially vulnerable to the DOS but it was rare enough that we never got locked up until logging the string multiple times, which then overflowed log4js internal buffer and blocked worker threads.You can try this yourself by just logging a string like &#34;${}${}${}...&#34; And in fairly short order it starts taking forever. I&#39;m very glad the fix in 2.15 is to disable lookups by default.I hope that in the time after I left, the security org at the big tech company I worked at and reported this to (as I thought it was - a dos vector, not the complete pwnage it actually was) forced teams to switch to nolookups. Otherwise a lot of people had a bad week forcing updates through..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There seems to be a misunderstanding here. We have on the one side a garbage feature that should never have been implemented - but if you want to keep it for backwards compatibility, sure. But then we have log4j scanning all values instead of only format strings - I think it can be argued that this behavior is a critical bug and was never intended to begin with. It seems to have only come about because whoever implemented the JNDI stuff lost their bearing in the absurd class hierarchies and abstractions in log4j.Of course the last part holds the solution for our backwards compatibility issue. Remove the JNDI nonsense from the default package and move it into an extension package. Whoever wants to keep it can just add that to their dependencies and continue to enjoy logging functions that sometimes also make network connections and block your program."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; for a feature we all dislike yet needed to keep due to backward compatibility concerns.It&#39;s logging. While logging is extremely important, I think we could all tolerate removing a vulnerable feature. Or, just move the feature to a separate package.I have made bad decisions, we have all made bad decisions. Own them, improve, and celebrate the opportunity to learn and improve. Keeping this around, as a default, was a bad decision. If your enterprise contracts don&#39;t want to turn a flag on, then they can always skip upgrading (they generally do regardless)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"You need to speak with a qualified domain name attorney, not just any attorney or solicitor.As Director of a domain name protection company (and not an attorney) I can offer this:If you registered the domain name before the other party files for a trademark, then there is no way you would have known that they would file for the mark. So, in most cases you probably don’t have to give up the domain name. It comes down to whether or. Or you registered the domain “in bad faith” or not. And again, how would you know they would start their business and get a trademark? You wouldn’t.Are you in the same industry and compete with each other? If so, there might be an issue, but I’d your site offers different products and there would be no confusion between companies or websites, then there may not be an issue.The best way to handle this is to get a domain name attorney to respond to their letter to you, essentially telling them to go away, and that you plan on keeping the domain name.If you cannot afford an attorney, look for a company that offers domain name insurance or a domain name warranty, if you have an issue like this with your domain name, your legal fees to defend the domain are covered.As you have described the situation here, you bought the domain before they filed for their trademark, and you’re not pretending to be them. So you should be able to keep the domain. They are just trying to “ strong arm” the domain away from you with a threatening letter. If they do sue you or file a udrp, defend yourself with the help of a good domain name attorney."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had a 4 letter domain name. A stock photo company trademarked the name and then threatened to sue to force transfer. However, I registered the domain before they registered the trademark. I looked up the ICANN rules and saw I had priority. Pointed out the ICANN rule and told to go away. They did.IANAL; this is not legal advice."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While this is definitely a bunch a hot air, unfortunately they could frivolous sue you to simply win on financial grounds alone (in particular they could sue you in a location where the cost of travel would be expensive and if you ignored it they get a default judgement, or sue you in both state &amp; federal courts for slightly different things and drown you in legal costs).I&#39;d evaluate what your endgame is. If your endgame is to keep the domain then I&#39;d get a lawyer in order to make it clear that you will respond to legal challenges (and, yes, the bill is going to run up). If you were willing to sell, for a price, then you should try to figure out how much a legal challenge would cost them and set a price a bit higher than that.Is it fair? Absolutely not, but the US legal system is set up so that those with the deepest pockets often win. It isn&#39;t a fair fight for normal citizens, and even having the law on your side is often not enough because it is a financial battle more than a legal one.Either way may be wise to lawyer up today, either for a better selling price, cause them to back off entirely, or move it into the &#34;bury you with costs&#34; phase of bullying."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Craig Murray, friend of Julian Assange, was just released from a Scottish prison for the crime of jigsaw identification of some of the accusers in the trial of former First Minister, Alex Salmond despite the fact that many journalists from mainstream media had published information that allowed their readers to identify some of the accusers explicitly.So it&#39;s not just a problem of dictatorships in second or third world countries. But then again, maybe it is.https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article&#39;s framing of the problem (increased authoritarianism, decreased tolerance for reporting) leaves a lot to be desired without more evidence. The evidence is:- A small increase in total jailed journalists (roughly matching world population growth, and the delta is a small discrete count which would yield large error bounds)- Specific examples of horrific events (matching atrocities that governments have been more than willing to commit in 2020, 2019, 2018, ...)Without looking at longer time scales (e.g., over the last 10-20 years journalist jailings significantly outpace population growth) or providing some justification for why circumstances have changed and we would expect journalist jailings to not pace population growth (e.g., if there are significantly fewer journalists per capita (not sure if that&#39;s true, just hypothetically)), a story that matches the evidence better is that lots of countries were horrible to journalists in years past and they&#39;re repeating that bad behavior now.To be clear, that&#39;s not saying that the overall problem shouldn&#39;t be fixed or even that their framing isn&#39;t correct, but...it&#39;s not exactly hard to provide evidence that _actually_ backs up their claim; why wouldn&#39;t they?"</p>

It&#39;s a free event, held in either Gothenburg or Stockholm. On the 9th of December every year. But the great thing is that since the pandemic they have started to live  stream the event so everyone from around the world can join. I highly recommend everyone to check it out, it is not often that you can see 5 or more nobel prize winners in one place."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In case you have not seen it, there is a very interesting video series by Clickspring about building an Antikythera Mechanism with tools that were abailable at that time. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZioPDnFPNsHnyxfygxA0...The tl;dw is that it was possible to build it with tools that were probably available, but some tools are specialized enough to guess that they had already build other similar devices. The final IRL reconstructed device is very nice. It&#39;s a long serie (10 episodes of 15 minutes each + some additional videos with even more details in other playlist) but it&#39;s worth watching."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think we tend to underestimate what ancient technology could produce because we forget that in ancient times they often operated on longer timescales than we do.With our technology for example we could make all the parts for the Antikythera mechanism in a short time. The ancient Greeks definitely had no technology that would have allowed them to do that, so we see the existence of the Antikythera mechanism as a great mystery.But I don&#39;t see any reason to believe that the Greeks built it in a short time. It could easily be the lifework of the builder, or even the lifework of successive generations of a family of builders.If you need to make a very precise gear in a day you need our technology. If you need to make a very precise gear in 50 years you just need someone with an abrasive that is harder than the material you are making the gear from."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Previously on HN:  
https://hn.algolia.com/?q=Antikythera+mechanismI am curious, is this device as fascinating to the average person as it is to the average HN&#39;er? I suspect not, but I don&#39;t really understand why. I myself have read quite a few articles/posts and watched a few videos about it. Every time I re-encounter it, I get sucked back in.See also:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baghdad_Batteryhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_fire"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wonder at which point the fines will outgrow the &#34;cost of doing business&#34; and really start to hurt?Tech companies are getting fined so often in the EU recently that it seems we&#39;re seeing a new article about a 9+ digit fine every other week."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I get that emotions are high when we discuss Amazon, but the article seems to imply that they were fined for not adding the &#34;Prime&#34; badge to items that were not fulfilled by Amazon (i.e. that didn&#39;t use Amazon warehouses).Frankly I don&#39;t see why that&#39;s a problem, the Prime badge is for one-day or two day shipping item. If the seller is not using Amazon for their logistics then they simply can&#39;t guarantee the time window so they don&#39;t add a prime badge?From a customer point of view it would make for a worse shopping experience if Prime items weren&#39;t  fulfilled by Amazon"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Doesn&#39;t seem this will hold any ground if Amazon decides to fight it...FBA products have a clear competitive advantage: free shipping for Prime customers, fast and reliable shippings, easy returns, a networks of lockers so you don&#39;t have to wait for the package at home (in Italy packages have to be handed to a person, they can&#39;t be left in the front yard unattended).Marketplace products have longer and unreliable shippings, you need to pay extra even if you are Prime customer, customer services is usually subpar, customer protection is inferior and so on...There&#39;s not an abuse, they offer a better service, they get better business."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Advertising. I know this is an extreme view, but I think any advertising other than a spec sheet style ad (just facts) should be banned. I feel like it steals your attention and mindshare day after day. The ads I see on TV now (rarely, as I don&#39;t watch live TV much) are just so horrible. Dripping with emotions and trying to tug on your heartstrings to sell some toilet bowl cleaner or some other garbage.Social media. I feel like if it weren&#39;t for these algorithms that prioritize &#34;engagement&#34; over facts and polite content, my country would be a bit less polarized. I think that social media will turn out to be like cigarettes and someday we will discover that it has an extremely bad outcome; at least how it&#39;s implemented today. I have come to enjoy HN a bit more lately, as I just don&#39;t engage with the trolls or the horrible people that have opinions I disagree with vehemently. The people I think are horrible, at least, because it&#39;s a personal opinion, and other&#39;s might view me as a horrible person. I have also learned that it&#39;s best not to judge someone by one or two views overall, here, and that helps. I wish more social media could be like HN and allow a diverse set of opinions, but ban the name-calling and such that really take things into a bad place.Most products today are less durable and are generally worse than &#34;yesterday&#34;, in my opinion. Perhaps it&#39;s the old man in me coming out, with a rosy view of yesteryear, but I think that the quality of things are just lower, in general. I do think that things &#34;look nicer&#34; and are more consistent, but at a lower level of quality. 20 years ago, I had only 5 or so choices for any given product, maybe a curtain rod for example (because I just bought some). Today I can go down to several stores and pick from hundreds of curtain rod designs that look really nice, but half of them break after a few years or less. I still have some shitty looking but sturdy curtain rods from 20 years ago, no joke. Electronics are worse in some ways, but faster and more complex, so maybe that complexity is the source of the decrease in perceived quality. I can say that computers are way faster now, and it&#39;s easier to do many things, but I have less freedom than I had with older computers for sure.This is just about the end of my old man rant. Thanks for listening.&#34;The important thing was that I had an onion on my belt...&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think there is an &#39;optimum&#39; level for technology of all kinds, below that you really want more and it is clear that there is room for improvement. But once the optimum has been reached any further additions will degrade the experience.Examples:Car controls:  pre: direct taps and gauges plumbed into engine parts and such, real switches and levers. 
  optimum: does what it should, not more, not less, more reliable than the old stuff, easy to fix and relatively cheap to fabricate
  too much: touchscreens. For everything.

(ICE) Car electronics:  pre: carburettors, bad winter starts, bad fuel consumption, pollution
  optimum: EFI, highly reliable, aftermarket parts interchangeable between brands
  too much: DRM on everything, parts won&#39;t even fit same model a year older, are ridiculously expensive and unreliable to boot

TV:  pre: two channels, black and white, bad image quality, crappy small screens
  optimum: 20 channels or so, in a way already more than you can consume, good quality color image, fairly easy to see screens (say, up to 3&#39; across).
  too much: wall-to-wall screens that intrude on your privacy every chance they can, inability to build up your own collection of content (DRM), pay *for ever* for the same stuff
  way too much: youtube.

CPUs:  pre: 8 bits, too slow for many applications, nice and better than an abacus though
  optimum: 1990s OS, very little eye candy, just enough to take the edge off, fast, and enough horsepower to do meaningful work
  too much: 2020 OS, nothing but eye candy, reduced functionality, telemetry, spyware, forced updates that are just as likely to improve things as they are to leave you stranded

and so on, you get the idea.Technology has and always will have a place in my life. But my car is a 1997 model that doesn&#39;t phone home to the factory, has buttons instead of menus, my phone is a Nokia, and so on. Technology is my slave, not my master."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Algo-paranoia.Every time I interact with a remotely &#34;clever&#34; system, I keep thinking how my input will feed some machine. How fast do I scroll, what is in my viewport. What do I listen to and when. Is this an A/B test? Will something I do on a whim affect that machine to predict something incredibly stupid tomorrow?It only became obvious recently, as I was readying an actual, physical book. The relief to realise that the publisher won&#39;t optimise the font based on how fast I turn the pages. And the disgust at that aspect of tech.And to what end?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This should be a sobering view of how the world really works. Above a certain threshold, every veneer of civilization vanishes no matter what the country (some have a higher threshold than others).At this level, only power matters. And the first rule of power is: Don&#39;t embarrass the powerful unless you can call on a lot of power to defend yourself.Laws can&#39;t protect you; they can be thwarted and bent, and the legal process &#34;guided&#34; to the required outcome.International organizations can&#39;t protect you; they can only register complaints that will be duly ignored by everyone if the champion is important enough.Even countries can&#39;t protect you at this level; they&#39;re beholden to power themselves after a certain point.This is the message to would-be activists anywhere: Stay out of the big boy pool or we&#39;ll make you regret it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Surprisingly few technical people understand the extent to which the CFAA charges he faces are bullshit.It all goes back to a jabber log that they got from Manning. The gist of it is as follows:Manning: &lt;some bytes from a hexdump&gt;Manning: can you guys crack NTLM?Assange: we have rainbow tables. I’ll forward it onto someone on our team.Few days later,Manning: any update on NTLM?Assange: no luck so far.And this is computer conspiracy. No additional access to any machine was had, and there’s no real evidence that any cracking was attempted at all. He merely agreed to take a look and reported no progress on it. It’s been a while since I looked at the details but I seem to recall that the pcap hexdump manning sent wasn’t even the correct bytes to do an attack — it wasn’t even possible.There are so many explanations for why Assange could have said this while plausibly not attempting to crack the hash. Manning put him in a strange position to become complicit and he had to strike a balance between not saying to his source, “lol that’s illegal no way, you’re on your own dude” while simultaneously saying exactly that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Complex systems are really really hard. I&#39;m not a big fan of seeing all these folks bash AWS for this, and not really understanding the complexity or nastiness of situations like this. Running the kind of services they do for the kind of customers, this is a VERY hard problem.We ran into a very similar issue, but at the database layer in our company literally 2 weeks ago, where connections to our MySQL exploded and completely took down our data tier and caused a multi-hour outage, compounded by retries and thundering herds. Understanding this problem under the stressful scenario is extremely difficult and a harrowing experience. Anticipating this kind of issue is very very tricky.Naive responses to this include &#34;better testing&#34;, &#34;we should be able to do this&#34;, &#34;why is there no observability&#34; etc. The problem isn&#39;t testing. Complex systems behave in complex ways, and its difficult to model and predict, especially when the inputs to the system aren&#39;t entirely under your control. Individual components are easy to understand, but when integrating, things get out of whack. I can&#39;t stress how difficult it is to model or even think about these systems, they&#39;re very very hard. Combined with this knowledge being distributed among many people, you&#39;re dealing with not only distributed systems, but also distributed people, which adds more difficulty in wrapping this around your head.Outrage is the easy response. Empathy and learning is the valuable one. Hugs to the AWS team, and good learnings for everyone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; This resulted in a large surge of connection activity that overwhelmed the networking devices between the internal network and the main AWS network, resulting in delays for communication between these networks. These delays increased latency and errors for services communicating between these networks, resulting in even more connection attempts and retries. This led to persistent congestion and performance issues on the devices connecting the two networks.I remember my first experience realizing the client retry logic we had implemented was making our lives way worse. Not sure if it&#39;s heartening or disheartening that this was part of the issue here.Our mistake was resetting the exponential backoff delay whenever a client successfully connected and received a response. At the time a percentage but not all responses were degraded and extremely slow, and the request that checked the connection was not. So a client would time out, retry for a while, backing off exponentially, eventually successfully reconnect and then after a subsequent failure start aggressively trying again. System dynamics are hard."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Customers accessing Amazon S3 and DynamoDB were not impacted by this event.We&#39;ve seen plenty of S3 errors during that period. Kind of undermines credibility of this report."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wow. I didn’t know this, but I was actually able to observe this state on myself. When going to sleep, my mind is wandering. But at one point it drifts from real world thoughts to completely abstract concepts and wild imagination that sometimes makes no sense. It’s almost like a hallucination. What’s most interesting is that sometimes I am able to notice the transition to this state and consciously observe it. Usually it makes me happy because I know I’m about to fall asleep within the next few seconds (which I often have problem with, writing this comment at 1:26am again..). I am also able to consciously observe the images being generated. It’s very weird, because it feels like one brain looking into someone else’s brain to the extent that is impossible by any technology or in any other way. Sometimes I’m able to consciously wake up from this state, because I have weird “sleep phobias”. Sometimes I am fascinated by the idea generated at that stage. But unless I write them down or really get up, they are typically lost if I fall asleep within next 5 minutes - maybe I’d have a Nobel prize already, if only I kept a pen and paper ready next to my bed. Or apartment full of crappy kitch paintings.."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Anecdote: I distinctly remember being on the edge of sleep writing a song one night in 2019. I was about to fall asleep on the floor with a notebook in my hand, and just at that moment, the music came into my mind. For whatever reason, I was able to stay awake and flesh it out as a recording. After reflecting on it the next day I realised I had written an acoustic fingerstyle piece that moved across keys as if there were multiple voicings in the accompaniment all moving independently in polyphony. Far more harmonically complex than anything I had written before, or since.Three weeks later my partner and I played it for the first time in a pub, and the normally cosy and laugh-filled room fell silent. We had the exact same experience in another open mic night a couple of weeks afterwards, where we took the first-place prize before the competition even finished. It was as if people were moved by it without any effort or coercion, like we cast a spell over people.Now it makes sense! I’ve heard music play in my mind as I’ve fallen asleep before; this news explains this story almost perfectly. Unreal. Live on the edge of sleep and magic can happen. I wonder what health risks there are with prolonged use?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think I once got into this hypnagogic state by accident. I was having a nap and my dogs woke me up because it was time for their walk.I felt sleepy while walking the dogs but also had a clarity regarding anything I examined in my mind. It&#39;s as if my regular state of mind was like walking in a forest with limited visibility, and now I could see the territory from a bird&#39;s perspective.This lasted for about 15 mins maybe. I&#39;ve never been able to experience this again. Maybe I should try this technique :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I suspect this is to foreclose against a future option for Google to monetize ‘free’ content in the play store without compensating the developers much as they do people’s videos on Youtube.For those who aren’t aware, in the games industry the distributor has been in the role of adding DRM to games on the pretense that they are “protecting their interests and channels”. As the distributor, Google may feel empowered to make these sort of “protective” changes, and the one that would be most likely (in my estimation) would be wrapping the APK such that it played a pre-roll ad before your free game started.I could be completely off base here but to my way of thinking it would be consistent with Google’s moves in the past."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good?What&#39;s the alternative? Have a crappy, paid-for, add filled, bloated app promote itself as &#34;Cauliflower Cooker Lite - the #1 free cauliflower app. 100% ad-free&#34;.Metadata like file size, whether there are in-app ads or purchases, etc, should be part of the store&#39;s listing - not the title."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So, let&#39;s be clear here.  The problem is not that they&#39;ve prohibited people from putting this information in the app title.  The problem comes if they&#39;ve done so without introducing another way for the user to express their preference for ad-free apps.  E.g. it should even work better if, hypothetically, the search function prioritized ad-free apps anyway when the user puts &#34;no ads&#34; in the search box.I can&#39;t tell if this is the case right now because, well, the store is still full of apps with &#34;no ads&#34; in the title.  Those are still coming up first."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is the scientific meat of the press release where it claims a 25 times neutralizing antibody titers against the Omicron strain with a third dose of Pfizer-BionTech:The sera were collected from subjects 3 weeks after receiving the second dose or one month after receiving the third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Each serum was tested simultaneously for its neutralizing antibody titer against the wild-type SARS-Cov-2 spike protein, and the Omicron spike variant. The third dose significantly increased the neutralizing antibody titers against the Omicron strain spike by 25-fold. Neutralization against the Omicron variant after three doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was comparable to the neutralization against the wild-type strain observed in sera from individuals who received two doses of the companies’ COVID-19 vaccine: The geometric mean titer (GMT) of neutralizing antibody against the Omicron variant measured in the samples was 154 (after three doses), compared to 398 against the Delta variant (after three doses) and 155 against the ancestral strain (after two doses). Data on the persistence of neutralizing titers over time after a booster dose of BNT162b2 against the Omicron variant will be collected.---At the bottom of the press release it mentions that Pfizer is the marketing distribution partner for BionTech in many countries. Does anyone have a list where BionTech distributes directly?&#34;BioNTech is the Marketing Authorization Holder in the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada and other countries and the holder of emergency use authorizations or equivalents in the United States (jointly with Pfizer) and other countries.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If I&#39;m reading this correctly, this is &#34;protection against severe disease&#34; and has little to do with transmission. The National Airport Data from Israel seems to suggest &#34;the absolute number of infected individuals in the Vaccinated (boosted) group is likely to be at least as high as in the Unvaccinated&#34; [0]So it seems to me that as long as we all remain obsessed with case numbers and not actual hospitalizations and death, this isn&#39;t going away, at least not anytime soon. I personally find this beyond depressing.[0] https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3963606"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If there is an expert in immunology here I&#39;d really like to ask a question:Aren&#39;t antibody titers just one measure of immunity?Since ~everyone with just two shots get them a while ago, and people receiving the boosters are receiving them now, wouldn&#39;t we expect must higher levels of neutralizing antibodies in boosted people? I know the number of antibodies fades over time, (whether from vaccine or infection) but this doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t have lasting protection after this, right?Wouldn&#39;t it therefore be a mistake/misleading to conclude something specific about a level of protection from this titer data alone?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Based on my anecdotal experience this seems to very much understate inflation. 
How is housing up only 3.8%? This site says over 17% rent increase nationally over the last year: https://www.apartmentlist.com/research/national-rent-data which seems to be more accurate.  Anyone with a web browser knows that home prices have experienced a monumental increase.Also a trip to the grocery store appears to cost me 50% more now for essentially the same goods. Every trip to the store pre-covid cost me around $100, now its $150. I do buy primarily proteins so that is the source of the increase but to ignore that seems ill advised.Not generally a conspiracy theorist but unless the people that built this report are using some accepted formula that is very different than the real world this report seems to be intentionally underselling inflation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Fed was initially saying the inflation was transitory, but have recently dropped the &#34;transitory&#34; label.Back in July, Siegel pointed out that the M2 money supply is 30% over pre-pandemic levels and predicted that would translate into 20% cumulative inflation over the next 3 years.  Here are my talk notes / video links if you&#39;re interested: https://neapowers.com/investing/jeremy-siegel/In July Siegel said &#34;There is zero need for the Fed to be buying $120 billion in bonds every month given market conditions.&#34;  I don&#39;t know why the Fed is buying mortgage backed securities in the midst of an apparent housing bubble.Larry Summers was voicing inflation concerns back in March: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBnaahSe7JU&amp;ab_channel=Bloom...The main macroeconomists I follow (Siegel, Gundlach, Summers) are all puzzled by the Feds actions recently."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of this is due to fuel prices. The price of fuel affects the price of everything else. It&#39;s a benchmark since everything requires fuel. Manufacturing, transportation, agriculture, etc. It all requires fuel. It doesn&#39;t help that OPEC refuses to increase production in order to make up for their budget shortfalls last year. Also doesn&#39;t help that the US government is sending signals that it is no longer on board with fossil fuels. The shutting down of pipelines, ending of fossil fuel leasing, etc. sends a market signal to producers and traders that the US is hostile towards the industry, leading the producers to cut production and maintain their profits.Best option would be to have a diverse portfolio of energy production: oil, natural gas, solar, wind, hydroelectric, and nuclear. Don&#39;t go all in on one, that&#39;s how you arrive at the situation we are currently in."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I first encountered quaternions in the concept of abstract algebra. It&#39;s interesting to think of it as part of a spectrum starting with reals and continuing to octonions (and beyond). Interestingly with each extension we lose something:Complex numbers (2-dimensional): No more orderingQuaternions (4-dimensional): No more commutative multiplicationOctonions (8-dimensional): No more associative multiplicationSedenions (16-dimensional): We lose the alternative property, i.e., with octonions its still true that x(xy) = (xx)y but with sedenions it is not.We can continue this process indefinitely, although I know nothing of the characteristics of trigintaduonions or what comes later. I suspect that it might be the loss of the flexible identity next, a(ba) = (ab)a but I don&#39;t know for sure."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"W.R Hamilton&#39;s discovery of the Quaternions is semi-famous itself, with the story being that after the critical flash of insight he carved the equation describing quaternion multiplication into a bridge in Ireland with a penknife.A interesting read is this letter [0] written the following day, where he explains his ideas in his own words. It&#39;s a great (and accessible!) look into his thought process.[0] https://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/HistMath/People/Hamilton/QLette..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One interesting thing about quaternions that’s almost never mentioned anywhere on the internets, there’re two conventions for them.The convention in that article is known as “Hamilton&#39;s quaternions”. There’s another incompatible one usually called “JPL quaternions”, for some American Jet Propulsion Laboratory.Authors of 99% articles about the quaternions, and software libraries implementing quaternions, are assuming exactly one of these conventions, and almost never mention which one that is.More info there: https://fzheng.me/2017/11/12/quaternion_conventions_en/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I used the JIT version recently on a new landing page with code completion for class names in my IDE and found it great. The distance between what I&#39;m picturing in my head and what I have to type to see that on the screen felt so much shorter and less fatiguing than the standard CSS approach.With the regular way, to style something that&#39;s probably not going to appear elsewhere, I&#39;m having to: come up with class names, annotate the HTML with them, repeat some of this annotating in a CSS file, jump back and forth between files to tweak the styles, use the web inspector to figure out which CSS class is overriding another then jump to the right CSS file to fix it etc.Tailwind classes are also faster to type and flip between when you&#39;re experimenting (e.g. editing &#34;mt-5&#34; to &#34;pb-3&#34; vs &#34;margin-top: 4.25em&#34; to &#34;padding-bottom: 2.75em&#34;) and you get less distracted because it has sensible defaults and helpful guardrails (you rarely need all the possible attributes and range of parameter values CSS has available).I also rarely had the super irritating and common CSS scenario where you edit a style and it doesn&#39;t change and you have to go investigate to find out why e.g. something is overriding something, your selector is wrong, and even after all that maybe you undo the edit because it doesn&#39;t look good. Plus you no longer have the fear that tweaking a shared class to going to break some completely different page.I feel that beyond some building blocks, trying to create reusable CSS classes with cascading styles has similarities to using excessive abstraction and deep OOP class hierarchies in regular programming languages to avoid a little duplication.I also don&#39;t have a problem with styling stuff appearing in my HTML files either as long as the right HTML tags are used around the data. HTML files are already full of class annotations and divs that are only there for styling yet this doesn&#39;t cause a problem to e.g. browsers, screen readers or crawlers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I tried Tailwind (and a similar project Windi) on a few projects now and have some findings.Tailwind aggressively speeds up development time of components by allowing me to stay in the same cobtext when styling things. The brevity of class names also dramatically shortens the time spent writing styles. While working on the projects I&#39;d setup with Tailwind, I felt far more productive.However, those were new projects. After completing them and needing to go back and modify or maintain them, the experience has been horrible. The resulting style declarations (as class names) are completely unreadable and unmaintainable. I&#39;ve tried organizing them and splitting class names onto multiple lines, but it has only cluttered things.In my experience, Tailwind (and similar projects) produce styles that are effectively read only. They are superb when writing a new component and styling things from scratch, but maintenance is nonexistent.Because of this, I&#39;ve now switched to using a CSS-in-JS solution to gain the benefits of in-context styling and still have the ability to write CSS declarations in a structured and maintainable way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not sure I get Tailwind still. Doing everything with utility classes and OOCSS / BEM are things we stopped doing literally decades ago. CSS modules still seem to solve every problem Tailwind solves, and better. CSS modules combine the power of global utility classes with locally styled components/locally scoped classes, and compile to static stylesheets, a requirement for performance. I&#39;m not sure how Tailwind works, but any CSS that&#39;s built at runtime and JS and inserted into the DOM dynamically should be avoided, and is an example of favoring developer experience over end user experience. It&#39;s always surprising to me when the build process isn&#39;t front and center of any CSS framework, since that&#39;s the most important performance aspect. I&#39;m not concerned about Tailwinds verbose CSS use since that&#39;s gzipped away, but the static stylesheet compilation aspect worries me if it&#39;s not front and center of the framework.CSS modules let you use the full power and control of vanilla CSS, without having to worry about styles bleeding across components. Sprinkle in your global utility classes for your design system and you&#39;re good to go. Or sometimes even better, abstract design into components like `&lt;grid&gt;` `&lt;column&gt;` etc and not even worry about the classname implementation.I know I&#39;m missing part of the picture, because of the hype and joy that people report from Tailwind. What part(s) am I missing that move folks from the power, beauty, and simplicity of CSS modules, to all-utility-classes-all-the-time Tailwind?"</p>

Some time next year, Google will probably force that add-on out of Chrome, as they tighten their grip over what browsers are allowed to do.I did this as a technology demo, to demonstrate automated site background checking.

One reason is that the borrower can get lower interest rates because they assume the exchange rate risk themselves. If that bet goes sour, though, the borrower faces higher costs to service the debt.Of course the thing about dollar bonds is that even if the national government were to intervene, those dollars can&#39;t be printed by Beijing.The only way to service a dollar debt is to raise dollars. One path to doing that is to sell dollar-denominated assets. US Stocks and bonds in other words. So the pressures in China can spill over into the US economy through forced asset sales of dollar-denominated assets.This is another angle to the contagion idea. Organizations around the world have taken big short position on the US dollar. As those loans come due, dollar assets are sold. Which drives the dollar higher. Which makes the dollar loans even more unsustainable. And so on.It has been called the global dollar short squeeze:https://www.lynalden.com/global-dollar-short-squeeze/And if you&#39;re really adventurous, there&#39;s something called the &#34;dollar milkshake theory&#34; which predicts the uncontrollable rise of the dollar as (maybe counterintuitively) a wrecking ball for the world economy:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qTOWuL7Zco"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I use Dracula for pretty much everything. Code editors, terminals, browsers, Slack, and even CSS skins for Tailwind, Wordpress, and more, if I&#39;m installing an application, there&#39;s a pretty good chance there&#39;s already a theme for it.But there&#39;s an interesting side effect of having a theme repository with over 200 applications: app discovery! Whether it&#39;s learning about interesting projects (BetterDiscord, MatterMost, Obsidian) or blasts from the past (I hadn&#39;t thought about BBEdit in a long time! And does anyone remember Brackets?), it&#39;s kind of a cool spot to find and remember things.Good work and thank you to everyone who has worked on these themes, I use them every day for a lot of apps :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a hard time seeing why this is such a popular theme.. maybe it&#39;s just because it is available for so many different editors. On the other hand, would be cool to have an application / database that could convert any theme to another editor.Although that would take a lot of work to figure out the compatibilities, if somebody would do that well enough so that other people can configure input output configs for that, I bet that program could become very popular among developers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Dracula is a fine theme, however, I feel like it&#39;s more convenient than it is pretty. I admire Dracula, Nord, and Gruvbox and how committed they are to their own aesthetics - my personal favorite, similar to Gruvbox, is Alduin[0] but sadly it&#39;s for Vim only.I only wish popular themes didn&#39;t feel like they had to use every primary color for the text. I wish we took the popular themes and made them even more opinionated, fewer colors with greater emphasis. At the end of the day most themes nowadays are just different shades of all rainbow text over your choice of a light or dark background. Dark or light... It reminds me of that theory about how early humans, before having words for different colors, only had light and dark to describe things.Does anyone have any recommendations for opinionated color schemes with limited palettes with emphasis on particular colors instead of just dark/light?0. https://github.com/AlessandroYorba/Alduin"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"PACER should have been free from the beginning. Gatekeeping legal information for profit (even if only used to supplement appropriations) isn&#39;t only a problem at the federal level. In many states you need a commercial subscription to even read court opinions and statutes, let alone search. Localities in most places rely on commercial publishers to archive the text of ordinances, which only those with ridiculously expensive subscriptions can access. The digitization of everything had just begun when I retired, but the handwriting was already on the wall. The contrast with the widespread availability of technical doc is staggering: and reminds me of why I changed careers."</p>

There was a magic and sincerity in these consoles that is buried under layers of ads, in-game purchases, tracking, updates etc. in more recent devices and games.The NES and SNES still feel like the greatest consoles that ever existed. Thank you again!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To folks wondering what the issue is about, I&#39;ll give a short summary that I myself needed.Typically a logging library has one job to do: swallow the string as if it&#39;s some black box and spit it elsewhere as per provided configurations. Log4j though, doesn&#39;t treat strings as black boxes. It inspects its contents and checks if it contains any &#34;variables&#34; that need to be resolved before spitting out.Now there&#39;s a bunch of ways to interpolate &#34;variables&#34; into log content. For example something like &#34;Logging from ${java:vm}&#34; will print &#34;Logging from Oracle JVM&#34;. I&#39;m not sure but you get the idea.One way to resolve a variable using a custom Java resolver is by looking it up through a remote class hosted in some LDAP server, say &#34;${jndi:ldap://someremoteclass}&#34; (I&#39;m still not quite sure why LDAP comes into the picture). Turns out, by including &#34;.&#34; in some part of the URL to this remote class, Log4j lets off its guard &amp; simply looks up to that server and dynamically loads the class file.The fix has introduced ways to configure an allowed set of hosts/protocols/etc and forces Log4j to go through this configuration such that these dynamic resolutions don&#39;t land on an random/evil server."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This exploit is quite severe on Minecraft Java Edition. Anyone can send a chat message which exploits everyone on the server and the server itself, because every chat message is logged. It&#39;s been quite a rollercoaster over the past few hours, working out the details of how to protect members of servers, and informing players (many of whom uses modded clients that don&#39;t receive the automatic Mojang patches) of how to protect themselves. Some of the major servers like 2b2t and Mineplex have shut down, and larger servers that haven&#39;t shut down yet are pure chaos right now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On one hand I want to be more forgiving of this, because log4j is very old, and likely this feature was introduced well before we all had a collective understanding of how fiddly and difficult security can be, and how attackers will go to extreme effort to compromise our services.But at the same time... c&#39;mon.  A logging framework&#39;s job is to ship strings to stdout or files or something.  String interpolation should not be this complicated, flexible, whatever you want to call it.  The idea that a logging framework (!) could even have an RCE makes me want to scream... the feature set that leads us to that even being possible just weeps &#34;overengineered&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Daring Fireball [1] has another passage from the article which is illuminating with regards to any promises Apple makes about how it will resist governmental pressure to compromise its products, vis-à-vis Apple&#39;s CSAM scanning tool.&#34;Sometime in 2014 or early 2015, China’s State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping told members of the Apple Maps team to make the Diaoyu Islands, the objects of a long-running territorial dispute between China and Japan, appear large even when users zoomed out from them. Chinese regulators also threatened to withhold approval of the first Apple Watch, scheduled for release in 2015, if Apple didn’t comply with the unusual request, according to internal documents.Some members of the team back at Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., initially balked at the demand. But the Maps app had become a priority for Apple, so eventually the company complied. The Diaoyu Islands, when viewed in Apple Maps in mainland China, continue to appear on a larger scale than surrounding territories.&#34;Apple has, and will, fold to government pressure faster than a lawn chair.1. https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/12/08/the-information..."</p>

SimilarWeb publishes their data with a huge delay, so it is not of much use for me. From my experience, it is also less reliable.It is crazy how valuable internet properties get closed down when they are owned by giant companies. According to Alexa, Alexa is still a top-5000 site:https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/alexa.comIt seems insane to just close it down."</p>

Drivers especially have been targeted for a few reasons. First, drivers are isolated, with abstractions that don&#39;t require interaction with the rest of the system. Second, Linux is available on more systems than the Rust compiler has been ported to. Because drivers are inherently system-dependent, it is not an issue to introduce a dependency on rustc on compatible systems. Third, bugs tend to arise more in drivers than other parts of the codebase, so Rust can do the most good starting there.[1] https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/rb50yn/comment/hnmshs..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"You can raise hell about this.The FCC regulates 911 service.  Here&#39;s the form for filing a complaint about 911 service:https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us/requests/new?tic...States also regulate 911 service. Try your state&#39;s office of emergency services.There&#39;s something called &#34;Kari&#39;s Law&#34; that may apply here. This was passed in 2018 after someone was being attacked in a hotel room and their 9 year old daughter tried to call 911. She couldn&#39;t get through because the phone system required dialing 9 for an outside line. So, now, all business phone systems are required to recognize and pass through 911 to the main phone network. There are criminal penalties. (Microsoft might argue that &#34;Teams&#34; is not a &#34;multi-line telephone system&#34;. That probably wouldn&#39;t go far with a jury. The clear intent of the law is that if you interpose something between a phone handset and the 911 network, it has to pass through 911 calls.)The whole 911 area is heavily regulated, since it requires that so many things interoperate reliably."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is astonishing.&gt; We determined that the issue was being caused by unintended interaction between the Microsoft Teams app and the underlying Android operating system.As someone whose organizational policy signs my Teams client out after a couple hours of inactivity, I would love to know how on earth this is possible. I truly am at a loss, and I am furious at the thought that I have been unable to dial 911 for who knows how long.At least I know the ten digit number for my local emergency services, but the average person probably doesn&#39;t. This is unacceptable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My feeling is that Google is not capable of fixing fundamental problems of Android. Every year they change some colors and rounded edges (it&#39;s starting to get hilarious seeing the design of their apps being revamped over and over again), and add features invented by their designers nobody asked for. But the keyboard lag, the storage footprint (why must an ever so slightly older phone with 16GiB internal memory be discarded because His Majesty Android demands almost all of its space for itself?), those will only get worse every release. I think they simply don&#39;t care. It&#39;s all about futuristic colorful stuff that sells. Android will never be a humble, efficient, reliable platform.As for this issue. All I can think of is the tragedies it may cause. It&#39;s a cliché: software developers are not responsible, except when their PR forces them to take action."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is an excellent article, a good insight into the particularities of the hardware. I particularly admire the explanation of why the polygons snap to the pixel, and why that&#39;s not the fault of floating-point mathematics but rather the rasterizer itself. One thing the article approaches, but doesn&#39;t really quite get to the bottom however, and which is the crux of all the ps1&#39;s &#39;flaws&#39; is that its GPU was 2-dimensional fundamentally. That&#39;s why things snap to pixels, that&#39;s why the textures do not have a depth component and are thus not perspective-correct, that&#39;s why there is no z-buffer, because it had no z-coordinate. Essentially, every single PS1 game &#39;faked&#39; 3D by using the GTE (which was separate from the GPU) to project 3D points and polygons into a 2D rasterizer. And it worked quite well! For the time.Another thought - I also wrote a similar renderer under similar constraints a while back, just for funsies, and I&#39;m wondering what would have came if I thought &#34;I should write an article about this&#34;. I generally don&#39;t think to write articles over every side project I do, what&#39;s the impulse for when someone decides to detail their work to the internet?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Love these &#34;tiny&#34; 128x128 textures when meanwhile, anyone doing development for the contemporaneous Nintendo 64 gets something like 44x44@16bpp color, or 64x64@8bpp grayscale. The maximum texture size is 4 KB with some major caveats (e.g. it drops to 2 KB if you use indexed color).The N64 is, in a lot of ways, on paper, a more powerful system than the PS1. Better CPU, depth buffer / Z test, perspective-correct texturing, antialiasing, subpixel precision, etc. And yet the PS1 completely dominated the N64 in the marketplace and in terms of longetivity--a big part of that how cheap it is to manufacture CDs. And so people lovingly remember PS1-style graphics, but there isn&#39;t as much of a resurgence of N64-style graphics.Another cute thing to note about PS1 is how it renders dark clouds on-screen. You might be familiar with the &#34;add&#34; blend mode for things like lens flares. Well, the PS1 also had a subtract blend mode, which has some unusual effects... basically, anything partially obscured by a dark cloud gets darker but also more colorful."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As an aside, one thing that&#39;s interesting and sad to me about WebGL is that WebGL + modern browsers are significantly more powerful than the PS1 and Nintendo 64, but we haven&#39;t had _anything_ even _remotely_ close to the completeness of an N64 nor PS1 game. Lots of small experiments and impressive demoscenes, but nothing in WebGL that takes advantage of this potential power. Frankly even compared to the completeness of Flash games, there are very few WebGL projects that even come close to that.This article and output would make a great WebGL project, and they could embed real demos of it running right in the site.What&#39;s missing that prevents us from building these types of complete projects in WebGL?"</p>
