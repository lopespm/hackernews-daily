								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From the source:
&#34;The high rate of magnesium deficiency now postulated [5,6,7,8] can be attributed in part to a steady decline in general magnesium content in cultivated fruits and vegetables, a reflection of the observed depletion of magnesium in soil over the past 100 years [11,12,13]. A report to Congress was already sounding the alarm as far back as the 1930s, pointing out the paucity of magnesium, and other minerals, in certain produce [14].&#34;The easiest of those references to link to is https://journals.ashs.org/hortsci/view/journals/hortsci/44/1... :&#34;Three kinds of evidence point toward declines of some nutrients in fruits and vegetables available in the United States and the United Kingdom: 1) early studies of fertilization found inverse relationships between crop yield and mineral concentrations—the widely cited “dilution effect”; 2) three recent studies of historical food composition data found apparent median declines of 5% to 40% or more in some minerals in groups of vegetables and perhaps fruits; one study also evaluated vitamins and protein with similar results; and 3) recent side-by-side plantings of low- and high-yield cultivars of broccoli and grains found consistently negative correlations between yield and concentrations of minerals and protein, a newly recognized genetic dilution effect. &#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I understand this seems mostly to be about soil depletion. I&#39;m curious more generally if vegetables are also less nutritious because they are selectively bread for high water content and size. For example, its appeared to me for years that you vegetables you get on a Subway sandwich must have almost no nutritional content. They are all way paler than you&#39;d normally see, and super watery.Thinking about it, I suppose the vegetables may get that way from growing in poor soil, and Subway et al just buy those ones because they&#39;re cheaper"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The BBC more or less episode with James Wong is making me wonder if this is true (shorter summary of what James said on the podcast: https://mobile.twitter.com/Botanygeek/status/984708381507276... )Anyway, from the paper here:&gt;&gt; with estimates that vegetables have dropped magnesium levels by 80–90% in the U.S. (Figure 2) and the UK [11,12,13,32,33]Reference 11 doesn’t support this claim.Ref 12 doesn’t directly mention Mg but does say some nutrients have dropped between 5-40% which is NOT 80-90%Ref 13 does mention mg specifically on page 3 but states under 20%.…I think i’m being fleeced by this paper."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This post for info purposes only having worked with the Amazon app store team and does not reflect my opinions at all, I haven&#39;t spent time thinking about if it&#39;s good or bad:The resigning stuff is because they alter the apps to fix dependence on Google play apis and gsuite apis. Developers were not interested in rebuilding their apps for fire and other devices without those apis baked in and this was a good solution to ease uptake for fire/Amazon app store.Also note that ms will control this android os, so they already control the signature verification method. They could do this without you knowing very easily by just with something like carrying a second sig and hash of what they modified and the original partial sums from the original app. Google and amazon or any os supplier can.Signature verification is only as strong as the verifier code.Glad to burn karma to put data out there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While this is indeed worrisome, I’m not really sure Microsoft is any better than Amazon from a pure end-user point of view.Microsoft has been a telemetry champion and has been collecting troves of personal data through Windows 10, all the while making it almost impossible for the average user to disable it (and re-enabling it with every major update).So if Microsoft goes the same route as Amazon (resigning every app), it’s just a matter of choice between a rock and a hard place.  
On the other hand, even if they allow for the app developer to keep its signature, Microsoft is still probably very capable of gathering data and telemetry through their Android implementation.Either way, and until it becomes illegal to collect data without explicit consent, I’m pretty sure we’re screwed…"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As an American Jew who grew up with a distorted and racist world view in regard to Palestine this just feels like history repeating itself. The troubles that face Israelis have always been amplified over those of Palestinians in my experience. That control of the narrative led me to be actively racist for most of my life while thinking I was not and also morally superior. This kind of censorship has a body count, and it lets war crimes happen in clear view while the on lookers think they are doing the right thing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A few years ago, criticism of Israel&#39;s policies started being called anti-antisemitism.[1] That made it OK to censor criticism of Israel.
Israel&#39;s policies got more divisive under 12 years of Netanyahu, and there&#39;s more reason to be critical of them.  Those two trends are in collision.[1] https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/criticism-of-israel-is-anti-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have some Arab friends who are very active on social media. It doesn&#39;t surprise me that the sheer volume of their political posts triggers all kinds of anti-spam mechanisms.I have also occasionally tried researching the background of the claims made in some of the posts. Most were highly misleading or completely made up. So Facebook&#39;s campaign against misinformation might have something to do with the described removals. That being said, I still see tons of posts every day and don&#39;t have the impression that the platforms are hiding many of them. Even open calls for violence usually stay up.The issue of alleged censorship aside, I am not convinced that this type of social media activism is beneficial for society. It would be great to have an open discussion on the many issues in the Middle East, but this doesn&#39;t really happen there. Most posts are straight up propaganda and and it appears to be taboo among Arabs on social media to even consider the Israeli point of view. Like the author of TFA, they even reject the term &#34;conflict&#34; because it might be thought to imply that both Israelis and Palestinians can have legitimate interests."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The Aha moment for me came when I was watching Chef Jean-Pierre&#39;s video on the topic. His terminology is unfortunate, he uses &#39;caramelizing&#39; to refer to what we call &#39;browning&#39;, but otherwise he&#39;s taught me more about cooking than any other YouTube chef.There are two steps to caramelizing onions. Cooking, and browning. Cooking, that is, making them soft enough to eat, is what takes the most time. Most of the time when you use onions in a dish, they&#39;re browned first, then they finish cooking with the rest of the dish.But when you make caramelized onions by themselves, if you don&#39;t spend the time to cook them properly, they won&#39;t have the right texture, even if the flavor is close. Since texture carries flavor, browned onions just don&#39;t taste the same as caramelized ones.So Jean-Pierre separates the process of making caramelized onions into two steps. Cook the onions by leaving them tightly covered in a pot on very low heat, they poach in their own liquid. Leave them at least 45 minutes but since the heat is so low it&#39;s almost like sous vide where you can cook them as long as you need.Finally, you brown them in a skillet to desired color.Video for the interested: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o-u7zjlShQ"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"After reading a lot of recipes and watching pictures/videos from same authors I learned that the description of browning is very subjective to the author.Very few recipes actually required onions browned through (as in entire volume) and if they actually do, the author will for sure mention it. Onions that are completely browned have very overpowering sweet aroma that is undesirable in most recipes except the ones that are built around it (like, famously, french onion soup or various caramelized onion dips).Vast majority of recipes actually require the onion to just get little hints of being gold in places or some gold just on the surface of it. That is enough to add flavor that will distribute once you add some liquid to it.From my experience most cooking book authors seem to be testing their recipes. Many times I have been frustrated by being unable to get the desired effect only to find some missing technique that the author very likely did not think important enough to mention or maybe difference in ingredients or measuring methodology.I have learned to prefer books that describe the methodology used by the author (for example how they measure things, how they make broth if they use one in recipe, etc.)I have also learned to search the book for a recipe that I already know and figure out if it agrees with my experience and if I would be able to make the recipe from that description.Another important point is that usually you need to understand particular cuisine from which the recipe comes to be able to make it faithfully. Every cuisine is a little small system of thinking about how to choose, process and combine ingredients. Recipes tend to be silent on a lot of stuff that is completely trivial to natives of particular cuisine.For example, I have been practicing Italian, Indian and Thai cuisines for the past 20 years. I can make Italian, Indian or Thai dish on a pinch from whatever I can find in my fridge and pantry but I still can&#39;t make convincing Creole dish even if I tried.(edit)If you are asking for best books for beginners, I suggest to skip books and rather research the recipe on Youtube. Watch couple of people doing the same thing -- this is going to provide much more valuable information than you could ever read in a book. This mostly because having visual reference of how it actually looked when the person was cooking it will give you immediate feedback when you are getting something wrong.It is still my preferred way of learning new kinds of dishes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author points out that you can caramelize your onions properly over the course of 40 minutes while preparing other components, washing dishes, etc.But that doesn&#39;t make for a nice tight recipe the way &#34;Stir onions over medium heat until caramelized, about 10 minutes&#34; does. Some people are going to read &#34;Meanwhile, caramelize onions over medium-low, about 40 minutes&#34; and think &#34;Oh boy, what a complex and loooong recipe, forget it!&#34; Inexperienced cooks may not be comfortable leaving the onions unattended, and if you get caught up in the football game you could end up burning them and wasting half an hour&#39;s work.So if you lie and say ten minutes, people are going to do one of two things:* Cook the onions for ten minutes and use them however they turn out. The recipe might be kind of disappointing, but I bet if you did the rest right, it&#39;ll taste pretty decent in most cases. Lots of people are bad cooks, too, so properly caramelized onions may be the least of their worries anyway.* Keep cooking until the onions are done properly. I end up doing this sort of thing all the time anyway, when a recipe says things like &#34;cook chicken breasts to 165 degrees, about 3 minutes on a side&#34; and other nonsense (you&#39;d think boxed macaroni and cheese would at least get it right but even at sea level it comes out inedibly hard if you boil for the lower end of the recommended time). The recipe comes out right and if you know to do this, you&#39;re probably already used to the fact that recipes lie so you&#39;re not much bothered.In short: the incentives probably weigh more toward making the recipe look quick and easy. When your readers are skimming over half a dozen recipes online, you don&#39;t want to be the long and complicated-looking one."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Excellent news but there&#39;s a translation error or misunderstanding in this article.&gt; The scientists are using yeast as a receptor-binding domain.I think they must mean they&#39;re using yeast as the protein expression medium and encode the receptor binding domain of the spike protein (along with the rest of the spike?) with yeast-y promoters and base sequence preferences.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The Cuban vaccine is neither a vector vaccine nor does it work with mRNA technology.

https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/It also doubles as a very great introduction to C, if that something you&#39;re interested in. It&#39;s funny because both C and socket level programming are often a barrier, or at least they were for me. It&#39;s an attestant to the quality of Beej&#39;s guide that he introduces both simultaneously, and makes it very approachable.This is one of those sources that helped me disproportionately grow as a programmer in a short period of time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I strongly dislike Haskell&#39;s focus on theory. Just show me examples on how to get things done and then the concepts will become clear. The Haskell and mathematics communities too often act like ivory towers that humans have to become enlightened to understand, and that simply is not how my brain is wired. I&#39;m not sure of there have been any studies on the usability score of languages, but I think that Haskell would come out very, very poorly. There&#39;s a reason why python is so popular."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"After years of seeing people try to understand abstractions like a functor from the definition first, I’ve started to think it’s the wrong way to do it.This post helps on some of these points, like explaining that e.g. functors are not always containers.I’d love to see someone try taking it further: just hashing out lots and lots of substantially different examples, showing how they are similar to each other, and progressing into higher level transformations, before finally showing the definition of a functor, and how it maps to each of those cases. Forget monads. Can we just start with functors and see how far we get with that?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like these tutorials always fall apart when they start introducing Haskell syntax and say &#34;That&#39;s Monad, simple as that!&#34;  class Functor f where
    flip fmap :: f a -&gt; (a -&gt;   b) -&gt; f b
  class Monad m where
    (&gt;&gt;=) ::     m a -&gt; (a -&gt; m b) -&gt; m b

Sorry, that&#39;s not doing much for me! I am now going to look for a tutorial on Monads that&#39;s written in, say, Python, so at least I don&#39;t have to learn an abstract new language alongside the abstract new concept."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"5 years ago I hit a burnout point and took a year off work. It was a huge perspective shift. I realized that my day-to-day of a rushed commute to work, a stressful and distracting office, thimble-deep coworker relationships and a life completely orientated around doing the above was an insane waste of my short time on Planet Earth. I reoriented my life around family, remote work, flexibility and balance. My quality of life has hugely improved and there is no turning back the clock.When I saw what the pandemic was doing to nearly every professional office worker, I figured it was just a matter of time before the resignations started flooding in. Everyone had a whole year &#34;pause&#34; to reevaluate if their lives were organized around their goals, and for millions, the answer was no. There&#39;s no putting this genie back in the bottle."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The first guy in the article is a dev. There&#39;s never been a better time to find work as a dev. Jobs are handing out more money with more flexibility than ever seen before. On top of it all, if your firm wants people back in the office soon, now is the time to do loads of remote interviews so that you can keep being remote.I was interviewing recently and almost everyone is at least partly remote, with a huge number of 100% remote. Even people that I know don&#39;t like the idea are bending and giving two or three days remote.On the restaurant-type work, I&#39;d say a bunch of people have been given a breather from the treadmill, and they&#39;re using it to look around. I see this as mostly positive, but it does suggest that a lot of people are completely swamped, working all the time, spending everything. The little bit of credit they got from the pandemic payment has unlocked a great reckoning with the labor market. Previously if you didn&#39;t like your job, you were screwed. Somehow find time to interview/upskill, or somehow jump the gap with your savings."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m one of these. I&#39;m an allrounder software dev in his late fourties, &#34;lured&#34; into a non-software middle management position by the promise of money and stability a few years ago.In practice, the money has never materialized because our sector took a big hit and much of that promise was tied to incentives based on the company&#39;s success. I can&#39;t really blame anyone for this, but that&#39;s strike one as far as job satisfaction goes.Second strike, I love writing code, and I don&#39;t get to do that a lot anymore. I&#39;m listing these &#34;pre-existing conditions&#34; because I believe it&#39;s common for us quitters to have other areas of dissatisfaction that hadn&#39;t been enough to drive us over the edge by themselves.Third strike, while my company does not support WFH after Covid, I did get to experience at least a partial WFH program, and it was absolutely wonderful. There&#39;s a problem though: I would absolutely like to continue working from home, but I also want to work on my own projects, on my own terms, on my own schedule. A traditional full time job is not compatible with that.So I put in my notice for the end of this year, to allow current company projects to come to a conclusion and/or hand them off. I want to stress that for a man in my age group, with no significant savings or other safety net, this is extremely scary. It&#39;s just that this Angst is outweighed by the thought of staying on the treadmill hoping for an eventual reward that may never come and seeing the little time I have left drain away."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was the EM for Reddit&#39;s Growth team around this time. I am responsible for / contributed to a few features like the current signup flow, AMP pages, push notifications, email digests, app download interstitials, etc.There was a new product lead who joined with many good ideas, but some of them were dark patterns that I heavily protested. After a few months of this, it was obvious that I was going to be reigned in or let go[0]; I immediately transferred to a different org.Now let me explain the other side of the story. 4 years later, Reddit&#39;s DAU, MAU, and revenue have all grown at ridiculous rates[1]. Yes, power users complain—and still continue using the site—but the casual user does not. These dark patterns have been normalized on other websites.These practices are done because it works._____0: They changed it so I would report to the product lead, which is odd for an EM to report into a product chain and the only instance within the company ever.1: Many friends are startup founders and I&#39;ve been at a few startups myself—a byproduct of being in the Bay Area—and Reddit&#39;s growth numbers are impressive. As a former employee, I am quite happy about my equity growth."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It constantly amazes me how bad Reddit&#39;s interface is, videos either don&#39;t play or randomly start playing despite them not being in the viewport. They run random A|B experiments which add unnecessary components such as avatars next to peoples comments. Random acts of monetization are shoved down my throat at every turn. I honestly think the Reddit team are on a purpose built mission to design the most user hostile forum.I&#39;ve tried browsing Reddit in incognito on my phone before and it wouldn&#39;t let me without installing their app, thankfully old.reddit.com exists. From clicking on a search result to viewing an image post took ~8 clicks. The flow was analogous to:    -&gt; Click on search result 

    -&gt; ending on an AMP page and clicking the bottom sheet exit button to view the post in the browser rather than the app

    -&gt; clicking on the title to view the actual post in the non AMP format

    -&gt; ending up on the actual post and being told I need to view it in the app (which completely removes the point of using incognito)

    -&gt; changing the URL to old.reddit.com which is tedious with a phone keyboard 

    -&gt; finally load the page and click on the image"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve long thought about making a thread like this so I&#39;m happy to see it. Fed up with this actively user-hostile web experience to try and drive people to the app.My main gripe is definitely expanding comments -&gt; First of all, only the top comment will be shown. Then you can tap view more which will load another two. But you cannot open all the comments.Because the &#34;create an account to continue&#34; toast pictured is unclosable on my phone. Meaning not only can I not expand any more comments, but I can&#39;t even go back see other un-expanded comments. I need to refresh.Just an absolute rancid experience all around."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I ran into this last week on my nvidia shield. Here&#39;s a summary of the workaround I found (apologies for not having the specific package names offhand):1. Install a new launcher from play store (I found one called &#34;Basic Launcher&#34; that matches the aesthetics of the default one). This doesn&#39;t solve the problem though, because Google disabled changing the default launcher for some user hostile reason, until you delete the existing launcher.2. Enable development mode by tapping on the build number in settings3. Connect an adb shell to your device4. Remove the built in launcher5. Reboot, select basic launcher when promptedI own a few android TV devices, have recommended them to people in the past, and won&#39;t be purchasing another. I think what happened here should be illegal and shame on whoever worked on this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am hopeful that now that the FTC has a pro-consumer Chair that some of these anti-consumer acts will be curtailed.I would also argue that some of these bad acts could be considered to be false / deceptive trade practices under the various state laws (in the U.S. at least). For example, some people would never have bought a FireTV cube for streaming video if Amazon had revealed that they would be adding advertisements to the consumer&#39;s video-viewing experience.But: how much incentive is there for individuals to file a small claims suit against Amazon for a $79 device? Generally speaking you might get treble damages but not much more unless you&#39;ve had actual damages.And although class action suits are frustrating and should be &#34;fixed&#34; so that those harmed get the bulk of the proceeds (i.e. it&#39;s not okay that consumers receive discount coupons or $10 checks while plaintiff&#39;s counsel receives a disproportionally huge payday) this is one thing we&#39;ve lost by generally not allowing class actions.David v. Goliath is not as effective as 15,000 Davids v. Goliath.Not to even mention the mandatory arbitration imposed on consumers (which do sometimes carve out the ability to file in small claims court).We have cultivated, or at least allowed, a very anti-consumer bias to take hold in U.S. law."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hate to be that guy, but this is exactly why I happily paid for an Apple TV. Yes, it’s $100 more than basic streaming sticks, but I have never had to worry about ads suddenly appearing after an update. This whole space is a race to the bottom with sticks being sold at or below cost because you are the product. For example, Vizio revealing in their first quarterly report as a public company that they get nearly as much revenue from selling ads and viewer usage data than from selling physical televisions.https://www.engadget.com/vizio-q1-earnings-inscape-013937337...A smooth, clean ad-free experience is certainly worth the extra price if you can afford it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In the era when system research is dying [1], the only saving graces are the Nix/Guix for OS management improvement and perhaps eBPF for OS performance enhancement. The Winix OS is a breath of fresh air in term of potential OS directions.Like they have always said, timing is everything and probably this is the project similar to Apple&#39;s Newton project that have many goods in it but just born several years too early.Winix targets RISC architecture and with RISC-V taking off exponentially at the very moment, having RISC biased OS will definitely provide edges and advantages for the platform, similar to x86 quirks to Linux, and Linux taking advantages when x86-32 and x86-64 took off.This year when Linus was asked for the best Linux achievement compared to other OS, Linus has pointed out the innovative Linux based lock-free filesystem [2]. Winix has built-in innovative POSIX compatible in-memory file-system (IMFS) by default.  Imagine an OS with IMFS that&#39;s also natively compatible with the increasingly popular Arrow and TileDB in-memory format.  With Terabyte (TB) RAM computers becoming the norm in the near future this can easily be the fastest OS with the state-of-the-art filesystem around. Fuschia is another latest OS on-the-block but by focusing on the mobile rather than desktop it will probably optimized for the former, unlike Winix.[1]https://tianyin.github.io/misc/irrelevant.pdf[2]https://www.tag1consulting.com/blog/interview-linus-torvalds..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m curious about the hardware it runs on, and didn&#39;t immediately find answers on Google. Could you talk about what hardware is on a usual system and what device drivers need to do for screen, serial port, disk drives, etc.? Does the CPU use floating point?The reason I ask: for the past six months I&#39;ve been dipping my toes in OS development for x86 with BIOS, SVGA and ATA interfaces: https://github.com/akkartik/mu And I&#39;m way out of my depth. I have this suspicion that x86 might be one of the more difficult environments for device drivers, so I&#39;m curious to hear what other hardware looks like."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I shared a co-working space with a guy who had written a distributed OS for rendering; it was quite neat - but about 1000 man years from being usable.I felt sad for him - he&#39;d poured his heart into it for more than 10 years (he said) and had no idea of how to turn it into anything other than a hobby project. He hadn&#39;t open sourced it, his aspiration was that &#34;Facebook will buy it&#34;. I haven&#39;t seen him since the pandemic kicked in."</p>

Both Youtube and Google (Youtube&#39;s parent company) are blocked in China; those revenue streams were cut off a long time ago.  What does Google have to lose by letting Youtube keep the videos up?I&#39;m sure the exposure exists; I recognize that Googlers aren&#39;t stupid.  I honestly am just curious what that risk is.  Having lived in Shanghai for 5 years, I don&#39;t see China reversing their ban on either company anytime soon, so I&#39;m curious what carrot and/or stick China has left.So far, the one thing I can think of is their physical office presence in Beijing / Guangzhou / Hong Kong [0].  That risk is non-trivial- China could simply swoop in and arrest employees, either specific individuals or en masse (neither would surprise me).

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This principle is how pydantic[0] utterly revolutionized my python development experience. I went from constantly having to test functions in repls, writing tons of validation boilerplate, and still getting TypeErrors and NoneTypeErrors and AttributeErrors left and right to like...just writing code. And it working! Like one time I wrote a few hundred lines of python over the course of a day and then just ran it... and it worked. I just sat there shocked, waiting for the inevitable crash and traceback to dive in and fix something, but it never came. In Python! Incredible.[0] https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a great post.  I come back to it frequently.There&#39;s beautiful clarity in the articulation, and the essence is easy to grasp yet powerful.  It reminds me a bit of Scott Wlaschin&#39;s Railway Oriented Programming (ROP) [0]. As a technique, ROP nicely complements &#34;parse don&#39;t validate&#34;.  As an explanation, it&#39;s similarly simple yet wonderfully effective.I&#39;ve a real admiration for people who can explain and present things so clearly.  With ROP, for example, the reader learns the basics of monads without even realising it.[0]: https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/rop/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This principle can be applied to dynamic languages as well if you have some mechanism such as type hinting, pre-conditions etc. that are checked by a linter during development, even if it isn&#39;t, you can still use it at runtime with sufficient error handling.The essential point of this blog post is to avoid &#34;shotgun parsing&#34;, where parsing/validating is done just from a procedural standpoint, where it matters when exactly it happens. In the paper &#34;Out of the Tar Pit&#34; it is asserted that this leads to &#34;accidental complexity&#34; (AKA &#34;pain and anxiety&#34;), which is something every programmer has experienced before, possibly many times.I&#39;ve become a fan of declarative schema to (json-schema/OpenApi, clojure spec etc.) to express this kind of thing. Usually this is used at the boundaries of an application (configuration, web requests etc.) but there are many more applications for this within the flow of data transformations. If you apply the &#34;parse don&#39;t validate&#34; principle you turn schema-validated (sic!) data into a new thing. Whether that is a &#34;ValidatedData&#34; type or meta data, a pre-condition or runtime check says more about the environment you program rather than the principle in discussion. The benefit however is clear: Your code asserts that it requires parsed/validated data where it is needed, instead of when it should happen."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The concepts in the article sound foreign to me - they are, since I live in the EU. In Central European countries, most houses are built to last 80-150+ years. People like to use bricks, aerated concrete or specially treated wood that will last for a very long time. There are other systems too, like walls filled with small clay pellets mixed with concrete. Houses built in such a way are quite expensive, usually €300k or more for a typical family home where I live. That leaves some room for prefab (Fertigteilhaus) to be cheaper, contrary to what OP wrote.There are small model cities you can visit where several dozen prefabbers exhibit their current model homes, and if you stick to their plan, you will usually pay less than building on your own. Those are often built on wood frames, but are still quite sturdy and supposed to last at least 100 years. Others are built with bricks or aerated concrete just like individually built homes. Savings are probably achieved by bulk orders, prefab, and a well coordinated team who has built the exact same house ten times already."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great essay. This is a much more sophisticated analysis of construction efficiency than you typically find; most of them basically imply that construction is inefficient because contractors are dumb.One minor comment: balloon framing is not a synonym for light wood framing, it&#39;s a (mostly archaic) version of it. Balloon framing features long exterior wall studs that extend up multiple stories, as opposed to modern &#34;platform framing&#34;, in which the studs stop at each floor."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recently read Gates’ book How To Avoid a Climate Disaster which left me with the impression that the overriding factor in building costs is the energy required (and CO2 produced) for construction, heating, and cooling.Unfortunately I didn’t see any mention of energy or carbon in this post.Seems like the biggest breakthrough would be a pre-construction estimate of energy costs over, say, 30 years.  Similar to the Energy Star sticker on appliances sold in the US which tell you the cost to run a given appliance with typical usage compared to the range for other models.This would allow you justify spending more upfront for better insulation, HVAC, air sealing, etc. and recoup that over time.  At scale this would allow our civilization to be more energy efficient and reduce the need to build more power plants.This suggestion stood out:
  ”...move to resistance heating and thermoelectric cooling“Unless I’m missing something, this would be a step backward. Modern heat pumps are 3-4x more efficient than resistance heating, since they aren’t creating heat but moving it from one place to another.  For cooling, if the author is referring to Peltier type thermoelectric cooling, the same applies: heat pumps are many times more efficient.The building revolution we need is one that cheaply produces extremely energy-efficient homes, IMO."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is one of those medical revolutions that I am waiting dearly for.Facilities that are not hospitals(to avoid the risk of  occupying medical devices that sick people need) built to _regulary_ check up otherwise healthy people for preventive care.Heck, I have so many alerts defined on my monitoring setup for servers to watch for signals of failure before they get too big. But, my own body is not observed until something bad needs treatment. Why can’t we observe ourselves medically and analyze that record for early signs of trouble before it becomes serious?!All the advancement in technology in recent years, this ought to happen sooner than later."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"0.5% false positive rate is actually quite high. I don&#39;t have the numbers, but I&#39;d be surprised if more than 1% of the people that would receive such a screening actually already have cancer, which would mean that it produces about as many false positives as false negatives.Picture a population of a million people, all receiving the test. 1% of them have cancer (unknown to them) - half of those people get a negative screening result and half get a positive one (51% successful identification), and 0.5% of the full population get a negative screening result. Those numbers are roughly equal.That doesn&#39;t make it useless by any means, but it&#39;s not nearly as &#39;specific&#39; as it sounds on paper."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those interested in reading the actual paper, this appears to be it (open access too):https://www.annalsofoncology.org/article/S0923-7534(21)02046...I’ve only skimmed it, but seen quite a few limitations, notably those with “non-malignant conditions at enrolment” (it would be nice to know more what that means), previous cancer or recent corticosteroids use were excluded. Additionally, it’s a case controlled trial which don’t always translate to screening tools (as mentioned in their own discussion).The problem with screening is that you are doing something on healthy patients, so particularly for rare cancers even a small risk of a false positive is significant. In this case it’s 99.5%. So if you test 1,000,000 people, 5000 (*correction from 500) people will come up positive. This is great for common diseases, but if it’s rare and only 1 in a million has it then you have got 5000 false positive for every 1 positive.I think this will likely be a useful test (if it translates well to a wider screening population), but it’s not as good as it first seems."</p>

We built a UX that was ideal for consumers - a couple of clicks, no &#34;Here&#39;s what you&#39;ll be missing...&#34; screens. It was awesome.Before this feature was released you had to call Xbox support to cancel.Once word spread that you could do it on the web, huge numbers of customers, that had been stuck paying for an Xbox Live Gold subscription they weren&#39;t using, began cancelling.So our PM got a call from a VP. We were instructed to remove it from the site immediately. We fantasized about telling the VP to stick it and quitting en masse, but we knew it wouldn&#39;t change anything.

Let me get this straight, not only is our tax system so complex and error prone i have to pay money to a third party to figure out how much I should be paying to our government, but the software company I pay then turns around and sells my data?

Because in the very end almost nobody sees the amount of value that a company creates for Linux users. What everybody is looking at is that &#34;Company X is nth on the list of biggest kernel contributors&#34;.So &#34;KPI grabbing&#34; is meant to mean the practice of not caring for the value or quality of your contributions but rather for the count of the commits or LoC you can get accepted.This is damaging to Linux kernel developer community because it just creates work for maintainers without creating much or any value at all.These maintainers are absolutely critical resource for the project and their number and availability translates directly to how much stuff can actually be done.

Setting it up was almost as easy as your old one. Plug it in, enter your wi-fi password, and a credit card to start your free pro trial of the monthly subscription service that tweets at you when the toast is done. It says you can cancel at anytime but it requires a 5 day waiting period. It also requires access to your contacts.Tired and just wanting your toast you agree. You insert two slices of white bread and press the big red GO button on the touch screen. An electrical motor whines from inside the toaster at it begins to retract the toast into itself. There&#39;s a few seconds of silence as the toaster slowly heat ups. While awkwardly standing there you notice the touch screen flickers and begins to display a buffering icon. An ad for I Can&#39;t Believe it&#39;s Not Butter begins to play. To make matters worse you can&#39;t even ignore it by looking away due to a small tinny sounding speaker playing the company&#39;s jingle.This is your new morning routine.Welcome to the future."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I do not blame cooler screen for selling this technology to anyone. But I want everyone to consider how much it takes to bring about a technology like this to a grocery store.If this is any of the big chain groceries, the manager doesn&#39;t even have the authority to put a sticker on the glass door. This was vetted by hundreds of people and none of them thought... glass?Business class tickets were purchased, hotels were booked, months of back and forth, daily meetings. Hundreds of thousands were spent on pilot programs like this one. Still no one thought... glass?In my opinion, it&#39;s a silly idea. But I applaud the person who had this silly idea, built a company around it, got deals with screens, door, glass, and cameras manufacturing companies, and then convinced a grocery chain to buy this for their store.I would really, really love to have been in that sales pitch meeting.Edit: What bothers me the most about this, is that it will actually work. Any surface where eyes may fall on, will be replaced with an ad."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Everyone here who’s worked for some moderately large corporation knows exactly why this was done: it’s a flashy pet project for some “labs” team in an otherwise boring retailer and maybe they’ll recoup some of the cost in ads, minus whatever they lose for it being an awful idea. Some charismatic product manager sold it to execs as “being the future of connected retail” or some other BS. In a few months they’ll be removed because it’s a stupid idea.When the company that made these was analyzing their market, I have no doubt they were targeting this exact scenario knowing that even the stupidest products have a place to make a boring brick and mortar retailer think they’re doing technology."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve built robots. I&#39;ve built greenhouses. I like software and the occasional bit of farming. Thirs looks cute and fun, and I hope they iterate, but it&#39;s not really solving the right problems, and introduces its own.1 - there are no straight lines on a farm. Maybe in a hydro setup built on concrete slab, in which case, why robot?2 - needs a way to cover more ground. If it&#39;s not able to travel linearly indefinitely in one direction along a bed, there&#39;s no way to scale.3 - grit. Precision CnC mechanisms and dirt do not mix. You can&#39;t keep farm things clean (unless hydro, and even then, things get wet and caked with fertilizer salt)Ditch the linear ways for something like bike tires. There&#39;s an open source solar farm robot which rolls around weeding (can&#39;t find at the moment, maybe was a video). Not limited by a box. They need robust mechanisms which can stand up to farm abuse and are easy to service, grease, and replace (unless you hermetically seal the components, which is harder than it sounds).Weeds are actually pretty easy to manage.If someone wants to make an impact in the farm tech space, come up with a cheaper alternative for scooping and dumping dirt. A ride-on tractor can be had used for $500-800. But as soon as you start talking loaders, it&#39;s $2-3000 used, and tens of thousands for new. Also the smallest tend to be a 4 foot wide bucket and a few hundred pounds lift. I want something half or a quarter of that. Able to scoop 50 lbs of dirt, repeatedly, and dig holes/trenches. That would have a massive impact in agrarian communities around the world."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know cnc and farming, and I really don&#39;t see this product surviving. I can&#39;t find a shovel that lasts more than a few months on my small farm, I don&#39;t know how a big 3d printer is going to cut it in anything like real agricultural conditions. I would love to be wrong though, garden robots would be great, especially if they had lasers for slugs. Actually, forget the rest of the robot, all I really want is a slug laser."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oh hey this is my industry (robots in agriculture).I don&#39;t like this. It feels way too &#34;Juicero&#34; to me. Too cute, to inconsequential. It feels likely one would spend more time on building and maintaining this thing than work it actually saves and a significant amount the benefit of having a garden is working it with you hands and watching that work grow in fruition.Bots in the farm though, they are the real deal. Reducing herbicide use by 80% or more, allowing the use of non-GMO crop while maintaining strong weed control and healthy crop, treating and optimizing every individual plant in a field, all things that will happen in the next 10 years due to robotics in the farm."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I published my first Steam game on Linux as well as Windows and MacOS, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll do it again because for a single person developer (as indie as it gets) the time spent supporting Linux doesn&#39;t pay off. Within days of publishing my game I had support request emails that said &#34;so I&#39;m on this specific Red Hat version, with this oddball graphics driver and three monitors and full-screen doesn&#39;t work with your game properly&#34;. As I only officially supported Ubuntu I couldn&#39;t really help each exotic (to me) setup that came into my email inbox, and there was more than a few. Which I still think is a shame.But that was five years ago. I&#39;m pretty sure Photon supports my Windows builds on Linux better than I was ever able to do with the native executables, and at least there&#39;s that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At a Steam Dev Days event I hit up a dev from a popular flight sim that ran on Win/Mac/Linux and asked him to rank the support costs for different platforms. I was surprised by his answer. He said:Mac users were effectively the most expensive because his team was (then) spending a lot of time porting their graphics code to Metal.Linux users were the least expensive because they tended to be sophisticated users who were accustomed to solving their own problems. He cited a particular customer who he said had a solid track record of finding graphical glitches in the game, then opening bugs against Intel GPU drivers and getting them fixed.Windows users were somewhere in between.Of course we didn&#39;t discuss the opportunity cost of supporting Linux (financially probably not worth it), I&#39;m not sure how much his view was a function of (maybe) not having to personally answer support requests, or whether his experience could be generalized beyond his particular customer demographic, but I learned quite a bit from his response.==========If I ever ship my own game I hope to support Linux not because I think it&#39;s the right financial move, but because I think offering cross-platform compatibility is just part of being a good digital citizen. A lot of us lived through a time where Windows was about the only game in town, and I don&#39;t want to ever go back there. (Plus there&#39;s a selfish element: I develop on Linux, so I want to play on Linux!)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I shipped a tiny game on Steam developed entirely in GNU/Linux with Windows/MacOS/Linux builds all produced from within GNU/Linux without virtualization of other OSes.MINGW covered the Windows build, clang/osxcross for the MacOS build, and plain old gcc for Linux.  It&#39;s all oldschool autotools+pkg-config dances for the cross-compilation.  Plain C and SDL2+OpenGL under the hood, no engine.It&#39;s nice being able to do it all from my preferred GNU/Linux environment, and I was able to at least smoke test the windows builds successfully via WINE.  The main shortcoming currently is there&#39;s no MacOS WINE-equivalent that&#39;s mature enough to run a graphical GPU-accelerated video game AFAIK."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you&#39;re interested in buying and/or selling small projects, you can typically expect to pay more than $5k for something that&#39;s making any consistent amount of money.You&#39;re also unlikely to find a great deal on a really special project on a marketplace. People who post on marketplaces like Flippa or MicroAcquire or SideProjectors (there&#39;re dozens of them) have either:1. Realized the time it takes to maintain is not worth the revenues/profits2. Realized the income is not sustainable and are trying to cash out at the end of a great run3. Realized that some folks are willing to pay very high multiples and will list their projects at prices most (but not all) people will balk at.If you&#39;re really interested in taking over a project that&#39;s profitable, network with people, do cold emailing, and find opportunities to take over projects that the owners are simply not interested in any more.In other words, look for the elderly couple who is ready to move on from owning their profitable, outdated shop."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My hair started graying pretty much as soon as I graduated from college. It makes a lot of sense now. Around the same time, I:- bought a house (in 2007, yeesh)- got married- started my first job (which at the time felt like drinking out of a fire hose)Shortly after, my wife and I went through the stress of trying and failing to get pregnant. Then infertility treatments for several months. Then my wife had surgery. Infertility treatments no longer an option, we turned to adoption. 6 weeks later (seriously), we brought home our first child.After that, it was like kids fell into our laps every couple of years. After the second child, I struggled with a pretty severe addiction that nearly claimed my marriage. Since then we&#39;ve adopted two more. We now have kids aged 12, 9, 6 and 4.Has it been all stress all the time? Not at all. I feel incredibly blessed to be living this life. But the hair (mostly on the sides) hasn&#39;t gone back to its normal color either, so I guess either it&#39;s genetic or there&#39;s an undercurrent of stress I&#39;ve just become accustomed to.Edit: formatting"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Maybe it was a coincidence but at my last job I was so insanely stressed and burnt out. My manager was terrible, treated me like an idiot, and my ideas were stifled day in and day out.I woke up one day and seemingly overnight my beard had a grey patch - almost white, in fact. It fell out in the week after.Almost a year and a half later, after leaving that job, I took the pandemic to really focus on my stress levels and be happier (I am). The grey patch is starting to fade away and some color is beginning to return. Certainly not the stark white that was there before, and definitely not grey either.Idk if I believe it, maybe something else was happening. But it sure seemed stress related at the time.EDIT: I&#39;m &lt; 30 and my family doesn&#39;t have a history of grey hair - quite the opposite. Forgot to mention this"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Stress is terrible.Work overloaded me and caused so much stress that I had stress-induced alopecia. My beard fell out in patches, and I had random patches of hair fall out on the back of my head, almost like perfect circles. Besides that, I couldn&#39;t really enjoy myself anymore, and I would often spend my non-work time vegetating.Then there&#39;s the teeth grinding and all the damage that comes with that.The hair came back, but the damage done to my teeth is not reversible.These are just the physical damages, the damages to mental health are either still on the mend or scarred."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Google&#39;s Knowledge Graph info boxes are automatically-generated and littered with errors. I&#39;ve been burned twice on operating hours, once for my local bank and once for a convenience store, driving over each time only to find the place closed. In both cases, the correct hours were posted on the business&#39;s website. I&#39;ve also seen bad KG results for medical conditions, listing the wrong symptoms or describing easily-treatable maladies as &#34;Incurable&#34;. Now I actively ignore the info box and intentionally click through to an authoritative non-Google website.To a non-technical user, I&#39;m sure the box looks like a human-curated result which they&#39;re more likely to trust. Maybe that&#39;s the goal of Google&#39;s UI choices. Couldn&#39;t be further from the truth."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You should seriously consider suing for defamation if this isn&#39;t fixed within a few days.  This is an egregious error, especially if it was done by an automated system (and this could be a systemic issue affecting many others).I think you have a decent chance of getting a five figure+ settlement from this. Talk to a lawyer about your options.EDIT: When I search &#34;Hristo Georgiev&#34; (from US IP) there is no longer an image in the infobox. (As of 21:55:10 UTC, June 24, 2021)I think a google engineer saw this HN post :-D(You could still talk to a lawyer - remedying it now does not alter the fact that you were previously defamed.  But Google has a stronger position having now remedied it)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; It turns out that Google&#39;s knowledge graph algorithm somehow falsely associated my photo with the Wikipedia article about the serial killer. Which is also surprisingly strange because my name isn&#39;t special or unique at all; there are literally hundreds of other people with my name, and despite of all that, my personal photo ended up being associated with a serial killer. I can&#39;t really explain to myself how this happened, but it&#39;s weird. In any case, I am now in the process of reporting this Knowledge Graph bug to Google.I believe that there is a simpler explanation.The Wikipedia article is there in that side box because it is the top hit for &#34;hristo georgiev&#34; on Google&#39;s main search page. The picture is there because it is the top hit for &#34;hristo georgiev&#34; on Google&#39;s image search page."</p>

Apparently this works via the Amazon App Store although I am not sure what this actually means in a practical sense?* A new widgets fly out for weather, news, etc. (appears this will require you login with a Microsoft Account)* Improved windows snapping with a dynamic (based on your screen(s) size and layout) UI built into the maximize button* DirectX 12 improvements (unsure if limited to Windows 11 only?)* Auto HDR for games* Improved experience when switching between tablet and desktop modes* Apparently there will be &#34;Windows 11 ready&#34; PCs for sale &#34;today&#34;?* Microsoft say they have been working with AMD, Intel and Qualcomm to optimise the silicon for Windows 11* 40% smaller Windows Updates* TPM 2.0 and UEFI are hardware requirements. No legacy BIOS compatibility at all?* A Microsoft account and internet connectivity is required for Windows 11 Home setup* 64-bit processor required (no 32-bit build at all?)* There is a universal mute button in the system tray so you can mute yourself system wide rather than in the appProbably some other things I have missed"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Utterly astounded and dismayed to see this much of HN&#39;s audience completely fail to comprehend what they&#39;ve read here and paint this as some sort of sinister theft.This is the law functioning as intended.  Thiel&#39;s case is a one-in-100-million+ event.  He may have the only Roth IRA in existence that&#39;s valued at over $5 billion.  But he didn&#39;t do it by exploiting some sort of &#34;loophole&#34; or paying high-priced accountants to shield his assets in foreign entities offshore.  He put his investments in a Roth IRA just like any of you can do.  The only difference is his investments were in the top 0.0001% in terms of performance.  That&#39;s generally how people get to be billionaires.And that&#39;s not even to mention that the assets in a Roth IRA are essentially worthless to him - he&#39;s not old enough to make withdrawals or take distributions tax-free and you can&#39;t borrow against a Roth IRA.  The funds are essentially unavailable to him for years to come unless he wants to pay taxes and penalties.Again - this isn&#39;t a tax dodge.  This is someone who used the law exactly as intended without any illegal or shady dealings and happened to be incredibly fortunate.The whole article is a hit piece designed to get whip people into a furor.  And lately I&#39;ve been noticing propublica publishing a lot of those."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"IANAL but this topic is of interest.Without commenting on whether this was legal at the time Thiel made this transaction, it appears it would not be permissible under current tax law. (Update: the relevant text in the statute appears to have been in effect as early as 1995: https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?hl=false&amp;edition=1994&amp;re...)
 Specifically, the law explicitly disqualifies anyone who is:&gt;an officer, director (or an individual having powers or responsibilities similar to those of officers or directors), a 10 percent or more shareholder, or a highly compensated employee (earning 10 percent or more of the yearly wages of an employer) of a person described in subparagraph (C), (D), (E), or (G)(Source: https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/4975)So the relatively plain language would almost certainly include anyone who&#39;s a co-founder involved in actively managing a company today.This kind of blatant tax avoidance is going to end badly for our tax regime, which is likely to overcorrect."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I don&#39;t understand about this whole maneuver is that Roth transactions must be made at arms length; ie, &#34;Transactions must be made at arm’s length and not involve the IRA owner or a member of his or her family.&#34;An example of this is that if you use a Roth to invest in property, you are not allowed to use it personally, not allowed to manage it or do maintenance yourself, etc.Prohibited transactions risk tainting (and thus exposing) the entire account.How is Thiel investing in his own company not considered a prohibited investment?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"NewsBlur&#39;s founder here. I&#39;ll attempt to explain what&#39;s happening.This situation is more of a script kiddie than a hacker. I&#39;m in the process of moving everything on NewsBlur over to Docker containers in prep for the big redesign launching next week. It&#39;s been a great year of maintenance and I&#39;ve enjoyed the fruits of Ansible + Docker for NewsBlur&#39;s 5 database servers (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Elasticsearch, and soon ML models).About two hours before this happened, I switched the MongoDB cluster over to the new servers. When I did that, I shut down the original primary in order to delete it in a few days when all was well. (Thank goodness I did that! It&#39;ll come in handy a few hours from now).Turns out the ufw firewall I enabled and diligently kept on a strict allowlist with only my internal servers didn&#39;t work on a new server because of Docker. When I containerized MongoDB, Docker helpfully inserted an allow rule into iptables, opening up MongoDB to the world. So while my firewall was &#34;active&#34;, doing a `sudo iptables -L | grep 27017` showed that MongoDB was open the world. More info on SO[1].To be honest, I&#39;m a bit surprised it took over 3 hours from when I flipped the switch to when a script kiddie dropped NewsBlur&#39;s MongoDB collections, and ransomed about 250GB of data. I am now running a snapshot on that old primary, just in case it reconnects to a network and deletes everything. Once done, I&#39;ll boot it up, secondary it out, and be back in business. Let&#39;s hope my assumptions hold.[1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30383845/what-is-the-bes..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From a quick skim through https://github.com/samuelclay/newsblur for models extending mongo.Document, it looks like the following private customer data has been breached:- all story content from all private feeds- any uploaded OPML files, including URLs for any private RSS feeds- User’s twitter/facebook account info and access tokens, if the user had linked those services with their newsblur account- all data that would be used to create a user profile page, including email address, whether the user had a public profile or notHowever most personal data, such as password hashes and billing info, was stored in postgres."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"10:35p ET: Looks like the snapshot will take 10 hours to make. Ordinarily this wouldn&#39;t be a problem becuase the service is running and a snapshot would be made on a secondary DB. But all of the Mongo DBs faithfully deleted their data, so I&#39;m taking a snapshot of a recent good backup. Once done, I can replicare the DB and we&#39;ll be back.9:54p ET: Holy moly, when I switched to a new Mongo DB server, a hacker deleted all of NewsBlur’s mongo data and is now holding NewsBlur’s data hostage. I’m dipping into a backup from a few hours ago and will keep you all updated.They&#39;ve also given some info on twitter https://twitter.com/NewsBlur that I haven&#39;t digested yet."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was sued in Germany by Axel Springer due to an ad blocker I wrote. The lower court of Hamburg ruled against me. They openly admitted they did not know what they were doing because the case was too technical for them. They were just happy to please the big corporation.Hamburg is a favourite for such cases because they just have no clue about technology. They are just old fashioned.As a small indie developer, I could not afford to keep on fighting. I gave up. I was a psychological wreck. And since it is not binding, big entities can afford to sue you non-stop.Hamburg was the second time I was in a court. I got sued by the same big corporation. I won the first one.Despite not being binding Sony will use this as a precedent and they will start going against the bigger DNS players, till all of them have to comply with their demands."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A lot of nitpicking here, as is typical on HN, but the Australian experience is instructive. We can vote for the Greens without &#34;throwing our left-of-centre&#34; vote away and still preferring Labor to Liberal. Ranking only up to 5 is reasonable - if you want the simplicity of the old system, and don&#39;t want to research beyond 3 candidates, don&#39;t!I can&#39;t see the weird complaining about having to learn more about candidates - there&#39;s usually only a few viable well-known candidates. You don&#39;t have to go research the Natural Law Party or Animal Justice or whoever.The only cautionary tale is the whole horse-trading element of preferences does lead to some weird candidates making it in at the margins. We had someone who was semi-famous for engaging in a Kangaroo poo fight get in this way:https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/it-was-people-play-w...But this &#34;preference whispering&#34; is more of a big deal when preferences were allocated by parties - we had an option where you could vote a single &#39;1&#39; for a given party and it was their preferences that wound up being automatically applied (if you didn&#39;t go through hand-numbering all the preferences). So minor party deals became a huge deal. It&#39;s not going to be so big if you only have to number 5 and don&#39;t even have to keep numbering."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This isn&#39;t very good reporting by NPR.  The downsides they list are just straw men easily dismissed by RCV proponents, and they give an appearance of fair-and-balanced coverage while making opponents of RCV sound like Luddites.  (It also seems like they got all their information from, say, chatting with people from FairVote and not by actually reading online discussions like this one here.)RCV does have some serious problems.  Eliminating the candidate with the least first-place votes at each round means a high probability of rejecting compromise candidates that may be a lot of voters&#39; second choice.  Also, placing your first-choice candidate first isn&#39;t always a safe choice.  RCV is non-monotonic, which means it&#39;s possible that ranking someone first might actually cause them to lose.  That&#39;s weird, and I think it&#39;s a good enough reason to investigate other options.I think we should use approval voting in single-winner state and national elections.  It&#39;s simple and it solves the problem of 3rd party candidates being spoilers (which is why most voting reform advocates dislike FPTP in the first place) without introducing any new problems.  STAR is also a pretty good system.Approval voting is currently used in Fargo ND and they recently adopted it in St. Louis as well.There&#39;s a lot at stake when we change our election systems.  I think one of the biggest risks is that we adopt RCV widely and then when people figure out that it&#39;s not actually all that great, they aren&#39;t going to want to try something different.  They&#39;ll either say &#34;democracy just doesn&#39;t work very well and there&#39;s nothing we can do about it&#34;, or they&#39;ll go back to FPTP because they were misled by a successful PR campaign that sounds like it has the backing of voting system experts.  Voting systems should be changed rarely, and when it happens we should use the best available system, not chase the latest fad."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I met John in an Atlanta airport lounge years ago[1]. I recognized him immediately as I&#39;ve always admired him, and I decided to go up to him and tell him as much. He invited me to sit down, and told him about when I was a teenager in the 90s learning about tech entrepreneurs at the time, I always thought he was pretty cool and had good ideas. I told him I respected him, and that I was sure he&#39;d lived an incredible life and thanked him for his contributions. He was clearly totally sloshed(inebriated) and insisted he called his wife so I could recount the story to her. I did. An hr later I had to leave to catch my flight, and i asked him where he was going - he said I&#39;d find out some &#34;pretty crazy shit&#34; about him next week, and that &#34;the doc was a bunch of BS&#34;. Two days later, I read Show Time had announced &#34;Gringo: The Dangerous Life of John McAfee&#34;.  In the brief time I spent with him, I have to say he had pretty positive energy for someone who was portrayed the way he was.[1] https://i.imgur.com/qThvR2S.jpg"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Was just reading about McAfee freebasing bath salts from old posts on an old Joe Rogan forum and not paying taxes seems like the absolute least he was up to:&gt;I&#39;ve processed 23 kilos of this stuff in the past year or so, and bump it myself every day - in fair quantities the hypersexuality... is beyond belief. I have had a number of acquaintances (both male and female) who have rubbed their genitals way past the point of bleeding and still couldn&#39;t stop.&gt;In all honesty, a first time user, or a user on a large dose, when presented with food, will simply figure out a way to include it in the ongoing sex play with their partner. If alone, they will figure out a way to fuck it, or shove it up their rectum. This is not a joke. Everything on the Tan becomes a sex partner or a sex aid. If only visually. I will not, anymore, let anyone on Tan be alone with my dogs for example.&gt;A local brothel owner (prostitution is legal in my country) talked me out of a large amount of Tan and provides it to his working girls and their customers. The idea was to simply increase business by having hornier customers and more authentic product. It worked for a while, and then girls started taking larger doses and giving customers larger doses. They began leaving and running off with customers - some after a single contact with the customer.&gt;If a person takes a large dose of the Tan and has the misfortune to have no partner at the time, then truly terrible things happen. A number of men, and women, have molested strangers after massive doses of the pure product (which is why I no longer provide it to anyone other than trusted friends - everything else is cut 50 to one). Twice, users on large doses have tried to molest my dogs.&gt;I have distributed over 3,000 doses exclusively in this country. They call it SPT (I named it) and it is a seriously hot underground topic here. I know of at least a dozen people who spend virtually full time playing with this, and hundreds trying to get samples, which I dole out with meticulous care. Anyone caught sharing this with another without my consent doesn&#39;t get any more.https://www.resetera.com/threads/john-mcafee-this-might-be-t..."</p>

I’d love for this to feel like a native app.Nominally:- The default title when adding to the Home Screen is “React App”.- The icon could be better by choosing something in 1:1 aspect ratio. Maybe just the click wheel?- When opened from the home screen it correctly loads without displaying the browsers nav bar, but the dimensions are slightly skewed so it doesn’t fill the screen."</p>

There are more blind people than trans people.  There are more people with Alzheimer&#39;s than trans people.  There are more people in the US who have lost a limb than trans people.I don&#39;t mean to downplay what is happening because it is happening but do you not think the amount of outrage this topic generates surpasses the level of impact we can have assuming we fix it?  It just feels like we&#39;re being distracted."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One shouldn&#39;t expect courage from The Economist, but it&#39;s always wise to bet on their prudence.I don&#39;t read The Economist for facts or details so much as to get a sense of what topics a current establishment can no longer afford to ignore. The details are secondary to the neccessity that a writer, a sub-editor, and a senior editor with tremendous personal stake in maintaining access to the circles that define establishment media, have collectively recognized that to remain relevant as a publication, the risk/reward on any ensuing controversy still means the magazine has to acknowledge which way the wind is blowing.When The Economist says something is just starting, it means it&#39;s been brewing for at least several years and they need to comment on it. I don&#39;t think direct discourse on the topic improves the discussion on gender because the participants use a critical theory in which the promise of  discourse is just bait to corner political targets for their mobs. However, we (and even The Economist) can recognize that popular tolerance for these tactics has finally reached an inflection point, and this change in attitude is what will finally allow real analysis and insight by thoughtful people into topics about gender."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Is there an easy answer as to why Costa Rica is doing so well? They seem to be a bit of an exception in Central/South America.EDIT: From Wikipedia &#34;It is known for its long-standing and stable democracy, and for its highly educated workforce, most of whom speak English. The country spends roughly 6.9% of its budget (2016) on education, compared to a global average of 4.4%. Its economy, once heavily dependent on agriculture, has diversified to include sectors such as finance, corporate services for foreign companies, pharmaceuticals, and ecotourism. Many foreign manufacturing and services companies operate in Costa Rica&#39;s Free Trade Zones (FTZ) where they benefit from investment and tax incentives.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We really need two words for renewables: one for types that scale but don&#39;t provide power on demand (wind, solar), and the other for types that provide power on demand but aren&#39;t available at scale everywhere (hydro, geothermal).Costa Rica is blessed with plenty of the second type and uses it. Because we lump it all into &#34;renewables,&#34; it sounds like it should be easy for everyone to follow their example, and that&#39;s not the case. No country has run on a high percentage of wind/solar/battery for a long period of time."</p>

Scoped/Nested labels are a godsend. For example, I can tag an issue with a label &#34;UI::App::Android&#34; and i should be able to filter on the basis of &#34;UI::App&#34; and get all issues.One of the things i still notice about the boards is that it is created on the basis of status. Gitlab&#39;s boards are created on milestones/status...or LABELS. https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issue_board.html#org...Most importantly, dragging tickets across boards will change the labels. This is far more powerful than just hardcoding them on statuses."</p>

This is why we moved away from Issues and none of these new visualizations make the product usable until they deliver multi-repo issues."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The title here is a bit misleading: the first few paragraphs of this are a really enlightened description of the challenges of engineering for a startup regardless of what framework you are using.Even if you have no interest in Django at all I recommend reading the start of this.&gt; I wrote this guide to explain how to write software in a way that maximizes the number of chances your startup has to succeed — by making it easy to maintain development velocity regardless of the inevitable-but-unknowable future changes to team size, developer competence and experience, product functionality, etc. The idea is that, given the inherent uncertainty, startups can massively increase their odds of success by putting some basic systems in place to help maximize the number of ideas, features, and hypotheses they can test; in other words, maximizing &#34;lead bullets,&#34; to borrow the phrase from this blog post by Ben Horowitz."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a big Django fan and a former (unsuccessful) startup founder. I only took a quick look at this but wanted to leave a comment for anyone else sifting through new. My initial impression:1. There&#39;s a bunch of things a I disagree with in here.2. This is very well written.3. It&#39;s well organized.4. It&#39;s both concrete and high-level.5. There&#39;s a ton of info here.I&#39;m so burnt out on shallow content, it&#39;s really refreshing to see something well argued, whether I agree with every conclusion or not."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not mentioned here but important, I strongly prefer and recommend an opinionated framework like django, rails, (possibly ember) over mix match frameworks (express, flask) because they have already thought more about most design decisions than you want to (or your engineers).  Especially for an early stage startup, the performance, scalability, or reliability of your stack isn&#39;t going to kill you.  A long time to market will kill you,  reinventing the wheel will kill you.  When I see django apps built and developed, a shockingly high amount of effort is dedicated to actually solving business problems vs other less opinionated frameworks."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; For fear of losing a job, or of losing an admission to school, or of losing the right to live in the country of your birth, or merely of social ostracism, many of today&#39;s best minds in so-called free, democratic states have stopped trying to say what they think and feel and have fallen silent.There are a lot of topics I won’t touch any more, more every year. Accounts - can’t stay anonymous, ml systems working around the clock to identify posters. My social justice focused friends have it worse, their online “friends” attack them publicly over every single little thing. They go quiet or form a tiny invite only groups to hide after an attempt to do something good that backfired because their skin is the wrong colour or they aren’t trans. They have panic attacks over the guilt and stress"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I very often type out comments on HN and then delete them. As Snowden alludes to, everything we submit to public forums is logged and stored. There is no doubt in my mind these comments are easily associated to my real identity with very little effort.Another side of censorship I consider often is signal to noise. There is no reason to prevent people from saying whatever they want if no one will ever see it. I recall a stat I heard that YouTube receives ~400 hours of content uploaded every minute to their site. Or the long-tail of Twitch streamers with 0 viewers.Finally, there is a threat of violence. We all know what happens to high-profile journalists because of their high profile. I often wonder how many nobodies disappear for some string of comments on some no-traffic forums/blogs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is possibly a unique angle, but by being in taboo art circles (erotic art specifically), I&#39;m struck at how much I see this topic resonating with my fellow artists.I know so many, too many, far more than I can count on my hands who have simply given up posting kink art because they keep getting mobbed, doxxed, slandered, and harassed simply by posting art (or seeing their friends getting shredded as well). I know so many that have forced to bounce from platform to platform from instagram to tumblr to twitter because either the algorithm censors you or the mob abuses the &#34;report user&#34; button if they simply don&#39;t care for your art.I know so many who have had to host on friend&#39;s servers because big-name hosts ban erotic art and kinks in tiny print in the TOS and it&#39;s just not worth it to fucking bounce from host to host unless if it&#39;s an actual friend who supports true artistic freedom.I know so many who are winding up in making zines as a last resort, because zines can be printed at the home computer, so they&#39;re one of the last truly uncensored artistic mediums in comparison to the internet. And yet - how many trailblazing artists have we lost from that crushing top-down censorship even with that one meager avenue open?So yes, this is relevant and urgent, and in more ways than it appears."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fun fact: similar things, but much more general, were in the HTTP/1.1 standard from 1997. However, HTTP frames relied on HTTP chunks, which were fundamentally broken in the Win-HTTP-stack implementation. (Third party browsers like Netscape Navigator or Opera implemented a HTTP-stack of their own, but IE relied on the built-in implementation.)(Because of this flaw, keep-alive was broken, as well, and requests stalled until they timed out. Which is, why everyone set the request timeout to just a short period and you couldn&#39;t type a HTTP request manually in a terminal anymore.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"All these mitigations should really be disablable. I have a computer which is not connected to the Internet I use to run number-crunching tasks and play relatively-old single-player games, but I still update it periodically. Obviously I don&#39;t need any such performance-killing mitigations there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We&#39;ve entered Inverse Moore&#39;s Law: every two years single core performance drops 20% as optimizations exploits are mitigated."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;I am not convinced that removing any optimization which can be used in a timing-based side channel is sustainable.&#34; basically boils down over two decades of JavaScript (now WebAssembly) API and language design, where one subset of the committees fervently argues against any feature or primitive that could possibly be used to acquire timing information, no matter how useful. It&#39;s tough, because they are ALSO trying to make sure any advertiser on the planet can run code on your PC without your permission, so it is pretty important to stop that code from using timing side channels to capture your credit card number or something. Once it was proven that JavaScript could trigger rowhammer (I remember having debates about this during wasm spec meetings at the time when it was still speculative), that kind of guaranteed that the side-channel people would remain in control, I think. SharedArrayBuffer is the biggest example - we basically had safe multithreaded memory access available in browsers but it got disabled due to spectre/meltdown, and we only started getting it back relatively recently with lots of additional constraints to try and make it &#34;safe&#34;. Want high-precision timestamps? Not anymore you don&#39;t, it&#39;s a side-channel!Similarly, when a new browser update goes out it may or may not make all the web apps you rely on slower (or break them), so any web benchmarking also needs to be re-run from scratch on a regular basis. New Chrome and Firefox releases &#34;ride the trains&#34; every 6 weeks or so, and they quietly push changes to the browser more frequently than that which can occasionally impact perf or behavior too."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Previous related discussion: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26328758If things go as planned, this may become a paid, ad-free, zero-tracking search engine. I can&#39;t express how exciting this is to me.Over the past few years, I have made several attempts to replace Google Search with DuckDuckGo. But they have all failed and I always ended up changing the default search engine back to Google. I mean, DDG worked fine for 95% of time, but the remaining 5% failure often led to some extreme frustration that I just couldn&#39;t stand. I would imagine Brave Search to have similar issues, at least in the beginning, but they did something smart to make it less painful:&gt; Brave Search beta is based on an independent index, the first of its kind. However, for some queries, Brave can anonymously check our search results against third-party results, and mix them on the results page.So, if I am not satisfied with Brave&#39;s result, Google&#39;s result is on the same page, or just one click away."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; On 6 June 2020, a Twitter user pointed out that Brave inserts affiliate referral codes when users type a URL of Binance into the address bar, which earns Brave money. Further research revealed that Brave redirects the URLs of other cryptocurrency exchange websites, too. In response to the backlash from the users, Brave&#39;s CEO apologized and called it a &#34;mistake&#34; and said &#34;we&#39;re correcting&#34;.Brave is just a &#34;pop-privacy&#34; company.  I will skip this one..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Apparently, they have their own search index, which they say covers ~95% of queries, and if the results aren&#39;t in the index, it will then get it from Google or Bing.I&#39;d love some more details on how this works. They probably aren&#39;t scraping the whole web. Are they just mirroring Bing and Google indexes? They seem to have their own page ranking algorithm that they&#39;re hoping to get trained."</p>

That &#39;hyperfocus&#39; that occurs either with deadlines or on a passion project is a symptom, as is the inability to get excited about projects you simply don&#39;t want to do - especially given your otherwise positive reviews and your ability to clear your mind and hyperfocus near a deadline, it&#39;s something to consider.I was diagnosed at 33, and it changed my life infinitely for the better. YMMV, and you may not have ADHD, but if you do, it is nothing to feel guilty about - it, in fact, gives you some insanely useful abilities that others simply don&#39;t have, as evidenced by the number of comments on this post explaining you have no guilt to feel, and your positive performance reviews.But being able to understand why we do these things, and being able to understand how to adjust for them (whether through medication or coping mechanisms) is, alone, insanely relieving.Consider picking up &#39;Driven to Distraction,&#39; or &#39;Delivered From Distraction,&#39; or check out these posts by Mark Suster which was what led me to get started on the path:* https://bothsidesofthetable.com/how-to-know-if-you-have-add-...* https://bothsidesofthetable.com/why-add-might-actually-benef...* https://bothsidesofthetable.com/developing-an-action-plan-fo..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This sounds like it might be good thing for the company. Having employees who have extra capacity is incredibly important for an organization that wants to get things done; if you&#39;re constantly hard at work on something important, when something else comes up (someone has a question, there&#39;s a bug or an outage, whatever), you either have to delay the thing you&#39;re already working on, or delay the thing that came up. This tends to have a cascade effect on most kinds of work, locking up all your people resources.Plus, those other things you&#39;re doing sound like they overall, in the long-term, probably give you a wider range of knowledge, improving your usefulness.Just wanted to add a voice against that sort of Taylorism perspective on work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is exactly why I&#39;ve concluded trying to go my own way is the best long-term plan for me. Before learning about YC and HN and such, the thought never really occurred to me.When I&#39;m working on a personal project I&#39;m really passionate about, my productivity is literally orders of magnitude higher than at any day job I&#39;ve had. Months or years are compressed into days.For any ambitious personal project that I&#39;m intrinsically motivated by, I&#39;m working on it and designing it pretty much every free moment I have. It&#39;s actually crazy to me how much I can get done if there&#39;s absolutely zero &#34;ugh field&#34; [1] inhibiting me. It doesn&#39;t feel like work at all. I&#39;d happily take 20% of my current salary if it meant I could do that all day instead.Even if it&#39;s stressful and even if I might fail miserably, I think life should be lived. If there&#39;s even the tiniest sliver of a chance that I could support myself just doing something like that, I know I&#39;d be much happier. And if turning such a thing into a job or organization sucks the fun out of it, then I&#39;ll just keep trying again and again until I can find a project with a sufficiently viable enjoyment:financial stability ratio.[1] https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/EFQ3F6kmt4WHXRqik/ugh-fields (Regarding the author&#39;s username: yes, it&#39;s that one.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Great work! Hacker News still seems to have a deeply skeptical culture with regard to machine learning - not sure why. There&#39;s always someone saying it&#39;s &#34;not novel&#34; and it&#39;s &#34;just doing x&#34;.Overfitting is a known issues in machine learning, people.  If you still think all neural networks are doing is memorizing the dataset completely in the year 2021 - you might want to revisit the topic. It is one of the first concerns anyone training a deep model will have and to assume this model is overfit _without_ providing specific examples is arguing in bad faith.Sentdex has shown his GAN is able to generalize various game logic like collision/friction with vehicles and also learns aspects of rendering such as a proper reflection of the sun on the back of the car.He also showed weak points where the model is incapable of handling some situations and even did the impossible task of &#34;splitting a car in two&#34; to try and solve a head-on collision. Even though this is a failure case; it should at least provide you with some intuition that the GAN isn&#39;t just spitting out frames memorized from the dataset because that never happens in the dataset.You will need to apply a little more rigor before outright dismissing these weights as merely overfit.@sentdex Have you considered a guided diffusion approach now that that&#39;s all the rage? It&#39;s all rather new still but I believe it could be applied to these concepts as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like your YouTube videos in general and think this content is a great benefit to the community.I wouldn’t take the few negative comments personally - I’ve seen many GAN architectures that heavily overfit (including my own bobross pix2pix) get a lot of praise, while ‘less violating’ models (like yours) get more skepticism.  Skepticism isn’t bad! But I’d wager in your case it may be because you’re a YouTuber, and other ml YouTubers are notorious for ripping off content (eg Siraj).Not really related to this, but I’d personally love to see the difference in training times it would take an RL agent to adequately learn to drive a car in gta versus adequately flying a helicopter."</p>

And they are well positioned to reap the products and techniques from the lab with their own manufacturing and engineering prowess and experience over the next decade.And it won&#39;t be walking dogs.It will be things like a little flexi-joint in a car that you buy without knowing (or caring) it&#39;s in there.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It bothers me that so many people use the fact that something wasn’t taught in school as an excuse for not knowing it, especially something as obviously necessary as personal finance.I was dumb in college and graduated with about $4k in credit card debt. It didn’t take a classroom lecture to realize that spending more money than I earned was not a sustainable practice. It’s also not that hard to keep track of how much you spend and make sure it’s less than how much you make.For almost anything personal finance related there is free information available all over the Internet if you care to spend a couple minutes googling for it.Likewise with taxes, if you have a regular W2 job, taxes are not hard, just read and follow the instructions. It doesn’t help that people keep repeating the dumb meme that if you make a typo on your tax return the IRS will immediately throw you in jail. They won’t, they just send a letter telling you they corrected it for you (guess how I know)."</p>

  * Saves your battery 
  * No unexpected mobile data charges

In my opinion, people have given up caring about privacy and expect to receive an inferior experience from products that proclaim this. Therefore, again imo, products that focus on privacy and such will remain niche.I suspect that the world is ready for paid services that provide a better Ux. I am thinking about how Netflix supposedly put a dent in piracy. People were willing to pay for content with a better Ux.Aside from saving battery and no surprised mobile data charges, the list many other benefits:  * No ads 
  * No annoying registration 
  * No mandatory tutorials 
  * No noisy email spam 
  * No push notifications 
  * No crapware

I wonder if a project could charge a small monthly fee if they focused on these user benefits that everyone cares about, and partially use that money to support OSM and partially use the money to support themselves?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am an IP litigator, and I have dealt with patent trolls repeatedly. I have taken these kinds of cases pro bono in the past for small companies (including through the EFF attorney referral list, https://www.eff.org/pages/legal-assistance), and I know that others have as well.There are definitely low-cost and pro bono (free) options out there for very small businesses. The EFF attorney referral list is a good place to start.I&#39;m also happy to talk it through with you if you&#39;d like more specific information - my contact information is here: https://shawkeller.com/attorneys/andrew-e-russell/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been through similar situations.  The &#34;find a lawyer&#34; comments are less than helpful, since you probably don&#39;t know where to begin and most lawyers will happily take your money without necessarily having an expedient path to resolution for a small one-person company.  So here&#39;s what you do:Write to each of your competitors, explain the situation and ask for a referral to their lawyers.  You&#39;d be surprised how many are more than willing to make a referral against a troll Also search around for any other attorneys who have filed against this troll and contact them as well.  They should all be willing to do an initial call for free.You are trying to find an attorney who has a successful blueprint for dealing with this particular troll, ideally this particular claim.  If the attorney is able to leverage their prior work or knowledge, your costs are greatly reduced.  Also, if the troll has unsuccessful experience with a particular attorney they may just give up.  Good luck!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You have to talk to a lawyer.  No one other than a IP attorney experienced in dealing with patent trolls will be able to give you accurate advice on this.Also you should add &#34;[ask HN]&#34; to the beginning of your post.edit: A good way to find a lawyer is to talk to good lawyers you have worked with in the past.  They will not be able to help you themself if they practice in a different area, but will likely have referrals for someone who does."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Damn, this is such a GREAT idea.
I&#39;ve messed up repos a few times, and it&#39;s never good.
It&#39;s always -- &#34;what&#39;s the magic want I have to wave now&#34;?The truth is, while we use git every day, most people really don&#39;t understand how it works.There I said it. And I&#39;m not ashamed.I don&#39;t really know how Git works. And I think I&#39;m not the only one.What does &#34;git reflog&#34; or &#34;git reset --hard ....&#34; do? What are the implications?We don&#39;t really know.I feel stupid. But hey, at least I&#39;m honest."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m sorry, but how many bits of git&#39;s UI do we have to force users to manually replace before we realize that the entire problem is git&#39;s UI?Between the tone deaf responses here about &#34;using a GUI client is the problem,&#34; to the tone deaf responses of &#34;you just have to learn it&#39;s internal architecture,&#34; it should be obvious what the problem is. The problem is not just being able to undo a mistake (though that&#39;s certainly one of the problems). Git is an incredibly user-hostile experience, and someone needs to fix or replace it. Can we just say it out loud and stop pretending that the problem is the literally thousands of users who have problems using it?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think Mercurial is way ahead of Git on this department by having repositories immutable by default, so even undo actions would have their commit. You never find yourself in an unrecoverable situation. Advanced mutable features can only be accessed by making configuration changes, and are still safe to use because public changesets are differentiated from draft changesets, so, you can only make changes on your own work, not anything else. I mean, you can force it, but that comes with its warnings.Mercurial has no staging area, and that can be inconvenient for some scenarios; but I think no-staging model is easier to grasp for beginners. I especially think many beginners would assume that modifying a file after it&#39;s been added to staging area would update staging area automatically too.Mercurial has high-level, scenario-oriented distinct &#34;undo&#34; commands like &#34;revert&#34;, &#34;forget&#34; and &#34;backout&#34; instead of overloading a single command (&#34;reset&#34;) for everything.I still like `git reflog` though."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"When the stock goes from 200 to 3500 in 10 years, and consistently goes up and to the right, you won’t find too many of the workers complaining no matter how bad the job conditions are. I have a friend up in Seattle who is suffering, to the point of being hospitalized for mental health issues, but refuses to leave.So HR and leadership believe that their system “works” but it’s really that their employees are willing to put up with straight up torture. They are deluded into thinking that their metrics and PIP plan work well because their best employees are staying but it’s really just the stock price.If the stock price starts to drop for whatever reason. All the best employees will leave in droves. That’s what I saw at Uber post IPO."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had joined Amazon as my first job out of school. I was super excited and would not mind working the long hours as the project was interesting. I enjoyed working with my team and manager. Just near the end of the year, my manager quit. The new manager ran my performance review and assessed that my performance didn’t meet expectations. I was not put on PIP. Instead, there would be a development plan that I had to complete. I was shocked and tried hard to not cry during my review. I had never been told earlier that there were any issues with my performance.This review crushed me. It destroyed my confidence in my programming abilities. To be fair, I had made some mistakes during my first year at Amazon - had fewer commits and SLOC compared to my teammates. Being on a work visa meant I could not quit immediately. I had to endure working there for almost a year before I got a new job.I took me quite some time to gain back my confidence. To this day, my time at Amazon makes me dread performance reviews."</p>

Unfortunately, for this to take off one needs a large network effect and should the technology take off it is easy for various three letter agencies to compromise, for example by inserting their own nodes.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a current Amazon employee I can confirm this is no longer the case or only applies to such a select few pieces of software that it doesn&#39;t actually mean what you think it does. The amount of day to day stuff that is relied upon that runs on greasemonkey scripts and web scraping is insane. API&#39;s for a ton of things don&#39;t exist or are have heavy gatekeeping. (eg. contact x to get onboarded to our API and they just ghost you). Of course you can get a high level leader to tell you to use a proper API in a mailing list email thread where you are trying to get help to solve a problem but they will not actually help you get working API access, all talk no action. A perfect example is there is this basic CRUD app that I rely upon and I see the current maintainer is working on all these feature requests, the problem for me is that the site has a ton of AJAX and takes like 20 mouse clicks to get retrieve basic information. So I  open a ticket / feature request just to get a basic REST API for the reads and they politely tell me I am an idiot and close the request. So much pointless work is created at Amazon from lack of API access."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"How far does this principle scale? I&#39;ve heard of this strategy and thought &#34;that&#39;s kinda cool.&#34; Amazon is obviously successful in its domain, so it would be easy to assume some causality.And yet, there&#39;s another big tech company, fruit symbol I think, that has played the long game of continually fine tuning the interaction points to make the integration of their parts more than the whole. They get credit for attention to detail, leveraging their integration and their ability to move in ways they do because of their thorough integration across their whole hardware/software stack. They&#39;ve recently been in the press because of just how much they were able to tune their integration to the problem with their first desktop computing chip. Again, we credit their success with some causality due to this strategy, which (to me) is very different than the Amazon strategy.Is it because Amazon is a cloud company and Apple is a hardware company that they have these different approaches to product development and each enjoy success? Or at the end of the day, are these &#34;do it this way&#34; less responsible than we&#39;d like to believe?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked at a company that read the Amazon memo virtually straight after it was published and decided to copy it. The CIO at the time predicated every system&#39;s teams&#39; bonus on it.No API, no bonus.What followed was 18mths of people building enterprise messaging systems and &#34;buses&#34; of various types. Hundreds of pages of documentation on APIs was prepared and released.I think 2 API&#39;s with maybe 40 methods actually went live.There were no bonusesMany people leftThe people who stayed were unhappyIt never happened, everyone quietly forgot about it after 18 mnths.The CIO stayed for another 3 or 4 years - he only left when a new CEO came in due to internal promotion. The new CEO used to run one of the P&amp;L&#39;s/business units and hated the CIO with a passion.So... it&#39;s not the API mandate that made the difference at Amazon."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think the biggest problem with Twitter is that we can’t determine a denominator. Twitter knows, but we don’t know.100 people tweeting about how this guy is bad might be indicative of a general consensus or might just be 100 people out of a billion Twitter users. People then interpret it as general consensus and pile on.We know the numerator but since we don’t know the denominator of people who didn’t comment, or disagree, or never saw, or don’t care. So we can’t figure out a ratio and many people assume the denominator is the numerator and the ratio is 1.“The world won’t do business with this guy, I better fire him” doesn’t make sense if it’s just a very small ratio as who cares if 100 people are upset and 1,000,000 customers don’t care.I wish Twitter had some ratio of who viewed vs who acted. Or had downvotes or something. Currently, people assuming that a few commenters is everyone is doing bad things.This coupled with there’s always someone or a small group who holds an opinion so putting too much weight into a few commenters is not smart. Yet frequently done."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve fortunately never been cancelled (I don&#39;t think I even have enough of a footprint or visibility for that to happen).From everything I&#39;ve observed, the absolute worst thing you can do is apologize to the people attempting to cancel you. It&#39;s just pouring gasoline on the fire.These people will never say &#34;oh, you learned from your mistakes, I guess I&#39;ll back off&#34;. Most of them don&#39;t really care about the truth, they care about signaling. So an apology only vindicates them.As far as I can tell, the thing to always keep in mind is if you wait a few days these things always pass pretty quickly. The internet has a very short attention span. As long as you never give those people a confirmation that you did something you regret, you&#39;re much better off in the future.Of course you should privately apologize and make amends for things you&#39;ve done wrong; but those things are always more effective privately and personally done anyway."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Former AWS engineer here.I worked on a pretty critical product in AWS (big AWS service with lots of traffic) and I can safely say that it&#39;s totally up to your manager and pre-existing conditions which make up the job. My manager was great as a person but would always lack in my career-oriented goals (bigger projects, promotions, etc)But what really sucked for me was the pre-existing conditions. Our on-call was pretty bad (40-60 tickets a week) and there was very little investment being put in to improve it. We had a lot of little scripts here and there which would solve extremely specific situations but no focus was ever put on in building a general framework or trying to reduce the ticket count. This often led to engineers taking the day off after their on-call due to the load and honestly it made people quite grumpy. And upper management was always much more interested in feature delivery since the focus was always on promotions and the more you delivered the better it looked for your manager. So now you have engineers with such a terrible on-call load along with pressure to deliver new features and projects within the atrocious tight deadlines that would be set. It was, to be blunt, a shit show.Code quality was atrocious. We had one enormous Java method (&gt;1000 lines) which would take care of nearly every single request coming into our service... With only about 7-8 unit tests. It was so difficult to get even basic things done to the point where any ticket that needed to be done would take a minimum of 4-5 days regardless of complexity. And of course managers and senior engineers would estimate small tickets to take around 1-2 days and then be shocked when 2 days later it&#39;s not even close to being finished. I will give Amazon credit that they do grill design reviews pretty harshly so those are done well in general. But code reviewers didn&#39;t care about quality or best practice. If it works then ship it.I&#39;m just not 100% sure about the whole PIP scene. Our service was extremely critical and we were extremely understaffed. So I don&#39;t think it applied to anyone in our org but I know of other teams who would have no issues in taking in a fresh college grad, making them do work for 6-12 months and then just randomly putting them on PIP. Sad but I&#39;ve seen it happen a few times in my time there.I&#39;m glad I got the Amazon stamp on my resume and left. When I left, more than half my team and my manager quit around the same time too. It was definitely a wild experience."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I interviewed with Amazon and Facebook in the Spring/Summer of 2020. The difference was night and day. Amazon felt like I was part of a huge cattle herd. The recruiter contacted me and told me they needed to hire a bunch of people in my area. I was immediately given a course of study, link to common LeetCode questions and told I had a couple of weeks. That fine. I enjoy solving puzzles. Facebook felt VERY different. The recruiter had a conversation about career goals, told me how wonderful it is to work at FB, and then quizzed me on some basic CS concepts. The ensuing rounds for each got even more divergent. The Facebook interviewers constantly made me feel like my success was a &#34;win&#34; for them. It felt like a team! Amazon felt like they were waiting for me to screw up so they could disqualify me. In the end, I dropped out of Amazon because it felt disgusting. And I could tell, if this is how they bring me in, I can&#39;t see any reason why it&#39;ll magically get any better once I was &#34;in&#34;.My feeling on those who use LeetCode as some sort of indicator. Great. You&#39;ve found the people that do the brain-teaser puzzles at Cracker-Barrel. I&#39;m one of those people. Some of the best people I&#39;ve worked with, would fail those tests immediately... yet, they&#39;ve built scalable, performant enterprise software. I now see those tests as nothing more than a way to reduce the number of applicants."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked at a company that hired several people out of Amazon. Amazon is a big company, so there is significant variation from team to team.However, several of the ex-Amazon employees were clearly scarred from their time working at Amazon. Whenever something went wrong (delays, outages, missed deadlines) one of them went so far as to spend hours or days preparing documents showing how it was actually someone else&#39;s fault, not his, because he thought it was necessary to avoid being fired. He said his experience at Amazon was basically one large game of &#34;not it&#34; whenever it came time to assign blame for the latest issue, and everyone had to become very good at blaming someone else. The worst was when he was actual at fault for something, because he would panic and scramble to distract from the issue he caused by raising concerns about everyone else around him. Easily the most toxic person I&#39;ve worked with in the past few years.On the other hand, I&#39;ve known other ex-Amazon people who said their work was nothing like this, so YMMV"</p>

In practice, using IIAB goes a little something like this:   1. find device (the more storage the better)
   2. install free software on device using IIAB scripts
   3. download free content (various content packs)
   4. deploy device anywhere in the world to enjoy
      all the FOSS and free content on local network

The IIAB scripts make installation and download setup fully automatable (battle-tested Ansible scripts https://github.com/iiab/iiab/tree/master/roles ), which is exciting because you can provision &#34;learning server&#34; devices very easily."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This really deserves more love.Who remembers Ken Thompson&#39;s &#34;Reflections on Trusting Trust&#34;?The norm today is auto-updating, pre-built software.This places a ton of trust in the publisher. Even for open-source, well-vetted software, we all collectively cross our fingers and hope that whoever is building these binaries and running the servers that disseminate them, is honest and good at security.So far this has mostly worked out due to altruism (for open source maintainers) and self interest (companies do not want to attack their own users). But the failure modes are very serious.I predict that everyone&#39;s imagination on this topic will expand once there&#39;s a big enough incident in the news. Say some package manager gets compromised, nobody finds out, and 6mo later every computer on earth running `postgres:latest` from docker hub gets ransomwared.There are only two ways around this:- Build from source. This will always be a deeply niche thing to do. It&#39;s slow, inconvenient, and inaccessible except to nerds.- Reproducible builds.Reproducible builds are way more important than is currently widely appreciated.I&#39;m grateful to the nixos team for being beating a trail thru the jungle here. Retrofitting reproducibility onto a big software project that grew without it, is hard work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a big deal. Congratulations to all involved.In Software, complexity naturally increases over time and dependencies and interactions between components become impossible to reason about. Eventually this complexity causes the Software to collapse under its own weight.Truly reproducible builds (such as NixOS and Nixpkgs) provides us with islands of &#34;determinism&#34; which can be taken as true invariants. This enables us to build more Systems and Software on top of deterministic foundations that can be reproduced by others.This reproducibility also enables powerful things like decentralized / distributed trust. Different third-parties can build the same software and compare the results. If they differ, it could indicate one of the sources has been compromised. See Trustix https://github.com/tweag/trustix"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t see a single comment doubting the value of reproducibility, so I&#39;ll be the resident skeptic :)I think build reproducibility is a cargo cult. The website says reproducibility can reduce the risk of developers being threatened or bribed to backdoor their software, but that is just ridiculous. Developers have a perfect method for making their own software malicious: bugdoors. A bugdoor (bug + backdoor) is a deliberately introduced &#34;vulnerability&#34; that the vendor can &#34;exploit&#34; when they want backdoor access. If the bug is ever discovered you simply issue a patch and say it was a mistake, it&#39;s perfectly deniable. It&#39;s not unusual for major vendors to patch critical vulnerabilities every month, there is zero penalty for doing this.The existence of bugdoors means you have to trust the vendor who provided the source code, there is no way around this.You have to trust the developer, but in theory, reproducible builds could be used to convince yourself their build server hasn&#39;t been hacked. This isn&#39;t really necessary or useful, you can already produce a trustworthy binary by just building the source code yourself. You still have to trust the vendor to keep hackers off everything else though!Okay, but building software is tedious, and for some reason you are particularly concerned about build servers being hacked. Perhaps you will nominate a dozen different organization that will all build the code, and make this a consensus system. If they all agree, then you can be sure enough the binaries were built with a trustworthy toolchain. A modest improvement in theory, but that introduces a whole bunch of new crazy problems.You can&#39;t just pick one or two consensus servers, because then an attacker can stop you getting updates by compromising any one of them. You will have to do something like choose a lot of servers, and only require 51% to agree.Now, imagine a contentious update like a adopting a cryptocurrency fork, or switching to systemd (haha). If the server operators rebel, they can effectively veto a change the vendor wants to make. Perhaps vendors will implement a killswitch that allows them to have the final say, or perhaps they operate all the consensus build servers themselves.The problem is now you&#39;ve either just replaced build servers with killswitches, or just replicated the same potentially-compromised buildserver.I wrote a blog post about this a while ago, although I should update it at some point.https://blog.cmpxchg8b.com/2020/07/you-dont-need-reproducibl..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think a lot of the replies in the thread so far have focused on tech (understandably, this is HN after all) but that&#39;s missing something obvious - the 4 day week would apply to everyone.In tech it&#39;s very likely someone going from 5 days to 4 days could still achieve the same amount of actual work. As other commenters have said, many tech workers don&#39;t do productive work all the time they&#39;re present. Retail workers, factory workers, people who fill in the holes in roads, telephone support people, etc aren&#39;t contending with pointless meetings and busy work though. They can&#39;t do 40 hours of work in 32 hours by removing some of the hours they&#39;re not really working. What they do doesn&#39;t compress like that.Consequently looking at this from the context of tech workers is far less interesting. The Japanese government isn&#39;t saying &#34;Let&#39;s get rid of pointless meetings and busy work!&#34; In tech removing the pointless nonsense isn&#39;t actually reducing the amount of real work people do. Instead, Japan is saying &#34;Our country is wealthy enough and advanced enough that our people can actually do less work.&#34; That&#39;s fascinating.If you see this as &#34;removing the wasteful time spent on things that aren&#39;t useful like meetinga&#34; then you&#39;ve missed the point. It is that, but it&#39;s much, much more than that too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s an open secret at least in the tech world that absolutely no one is putting in a productive 40 hours of work a week. This was true well before the pandemic and is more pronounced than ever now. Everyone needs to be &#34;present&#34; for 8 hours a day 5 days a week, but spends their time in pointless meetings, preparing documents and powerpoints that no one will read,  faux social/teambuilding events, hour long lunches, goofing off on the internet, all to maintain the pretense of office culture.Companies that shuffle things up to prioritize productivity over simply showing up will be set to succeed over the next generation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The social contract in Japan was that you’d give your life to your employer in exchange for a fair wage and stable employment until you retired. Neither of those things are true now. Wages are low and companies either ignore their legal obligations or hire people as contractors, who have less rights  than full time “employees”.Now, many people, especially women* and young people are finding that it’s possible to run a small business for 3-4 days a week and make more money than an entry or even mid-level full time office job.So, I think Japan finally enforcing rules against abusive behavior at the workplace and pushing for a 4-day week, if it really happens, is a reflection of where society is at right now.*Women have a low wage ceiling because they are expected to quit and have children at any time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"In the second half of the post he suggests remotely determining an iDevice passcode was possible with his rate limit bypass. Essentially a salted version of the devices passcode is uploaded to the apple server which he could then bypass the rate limit to brute force it.Isn&#39;t this a backdoor that would enable passcode bypass like was requested for the San Bernardino and Pensacola shooters phones?This vulnerability is a massive deal. With the passcode determined there&#39;s nothing stopping bad actors surreptitiously access your data.After all this a $2,180,000,000,000 market cap company offers a reward of $18,000. What a disgrace!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why are the Security Departments of ever company so unfriendly? I feel like every blog post of a disclosed vulnerability has had some form or another of:
- no replies
- delayed replies
- vague replies
- playing down the vulnerability
- reducing the bountyIt’s like they still treat a white hat hacker as a risk, instead o cooperating with them. I don’t get the corporations. The white hat hacker is in this case your best friend. They proved their ethics already by reporting it to them, and they know it already because they found it. There is literally no reason to try to keep the white hat hacker in the dark, not update them, etc. The white hat hacker could have exploited the vulnerability already!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is going to be an exciting area.I spent some time previously playing with Coq. It&#39;s very powerful, but even proving the simplest undergraduate maths statements (say, about group theory) can prove very challenging. I believe that part of this is that Coq uses different mathematical foundations than traditional mathematics, which mostly uses set theory (ZFC, although most people don&#39;t care about the specifics). So it can be hard or unnatural to express something like &#34;subgroup&#34;. I don&#39;t know if Lean fares better in that respect. Coq documentation is also IMHO almost impossible to understand unless you&#39;re already very deeply knowledgeable about the system.We will probably still need some more iterations, to get more user friendly assistants with better documentation and to get adequate teaching resources etc."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Things I have learned about SSDs:If you want to go fast &amp; save NAND lifetime, use append-only log structures.If you want to go even faster &amp; save even more NAND lifetime, batch your writes in software (i.e. some ring buffer with natural back-pressure mechanism) and then serialize them with a single writer into an append-only log structure. Many newer devices have something like this at the hardware level, but your block size is still a constraint when working in hardware. If you batch in software, you can hypothetically write multiple logical business transactions per block I/O. When you physical block size is 4k and your logical transactions are averaging 512b of data, you would be leaving a lot of throughput on the table.Going down 1 level of abstraction seems important if you want to extract the most performance from an SSD. Unsurprisingly, the above ideas also make ordinary magnetic disk drives more performant &amp; potentially last longer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This page tells me a lot about SSDs, but it doesn&#39;t tell me why I need to know these things.  It doesn&#39;t really give me any indication about how I should change my behavior if I know that I&#39;ll be running on SSD vs spinning disk.I&#39;ve always been told, &#34;just treat SSDs like slow, permanent memory&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My opinion is probably... not technically correct... until you have to deal with drive reliability and write guarantees, but I don&#39;t think programmers actually have to know anything about SSDs in the same way that developers had to know particular things about HDDs.This is out of pure speculation, but there had to be a period of time during the mass transition to SSDs that engineers said, OK, how do we get the hardware to be compatible with software that is, for the most part, expecting that hard disk drives are being used, and just behave like really fast HDDs.So, there&#39;s almost certainly some non-zero amount of code out there in the wild that is or was doing some very specific write optimized routine that one day was just performing 10 to 100 times faster, and maybe just because of the nature of software is still out there today doing that same routine.I don&#39;t know what that would look like, but my guess would be that it would have something to do with average sized write caches, and those caches look entirely different today or something.And today, there&#39;s probably some SSD specific code doing something out there now, too."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I heard about Ivermectin for the first time this week and was shocked how much it seemed that I had stepped into conspiracy theory land. There seemed to be an overwhelming amount of evidence over the last year that this repurposed drug is effective at treating Covid during a variety of stages (preventative, first positive test, ICU admittance, and even long haul). But since there hadn&#39;t been a randomized trial the drug had, not only been dismissed, but heavily censored over social media. I still cannot believe how much the discussion has been silenced in the same way people discuss &#34;covid vaxx causes magnetism&#34;. The fact the interview between Bret Weinstein and Pierre Kory was banned from youtube for non-WHO/CDC/NIH approved covid treatments is a tragedy. I truly hope in the coming years the censorship of this topic will be the catalyst for allowing free speech to prevail on social media."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s banned on YouTube because of multiple authoritative sources indicating it&#39;s not a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19.Here is the FDA&#39;s stance:
https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/why-you-shoul...Here is the European equivalent of the AMA advising against it&#39;s use:
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/ema-advises-against-use-iv...Here is an RCT in JAMA finding it ineffective:
https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2777389And here is Merck, that sells Ivermectin, but whose vaccine didn’t make it through clinical trials, discouraging the use of Ivermectin for COVID-19: https://www.merck.com/news/merck-statement-on-ivermectin-use...If Ivermectin worked on COVID-19, the manufacturer of Ivermectin that has made no money on vaccines for COVID-19 would probably be pushing it wouldn&#39;t they?There have been some studies that found it effective in vitro, but as noted in other comments, at several times the safe dosage in vivo."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For the curious, reasonably recent discussions from several TWiV episodes on Ivermectin. [3] is quite recent (Jun 9). [4] reviews a study which is mildly encouraging. I think it&#39;s fair to say that the jury is still out, and it does deserve more investigation.Fun fact: Vincent Racaniello&#39;s wife worked on Ivermectin at Merck, and on a recent livestream (the 6/16 one) he suggested it would be reasonable to take it, especially because it&#39;s known to be safe.[1]: https://youtu.be/4hGVeZGfEnU?t=5414[2]: https://youtu.be/N0-H28vzOps?t=1452[3]: https://youtu.be/teJ1wXyEf1Q?t=1905[4]: https://youtu.be/kz1Ja5zH1n8?t=1720"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a great initiative. The last time I remember setting up a mail server using Postfix or Dovecot was around 2015.It was a traumatizing experience. It rarely worked, all my email went to spam and I absolutely hated the amount of hackery and duct tape required to keep it working. Configuration files, missed emails...It was so unpleasant, to this day I avoid messing with mail on servers at all costs. I&#39;d much rather pay for Mailgun or some provider.Lately I&#39;ve been seeing an uptick of these apps making self-hosted email easier. Mail in a box, Maddy, etc. I will unconditionally support anything that makes doing this easier.I&#39;m not switching from GSuite, but I&#39;m happy to see progress in the space."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been using Maddy now for about a month for my email, and it&#39;s incredible. The dev says it&#39;s not caddy for email – but in my experience, it&#39;s certainly been that easy.I&#39;ve got to write a longer article about this, but self-hosting email is incredibly liberating. I now own my entire digital identity. I can work on open source projects with developers around the world completely while relying only on my own capabilities."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I see no one has mentioned Mailu (https://mailu.io/1.7/). It’s a self hosted mail server made up of a couple docker images.I would recommend it based on my use and experience.I’ve been using it for my personal email and for automated no-reply messages in a few projects with no delivery issues. I’m hosting on a Contabo VPS.It handles spam with rspamd, sets you up with DMARC, DKIM, has an admin interface, web mail interface."</p>

I turned off auto-updates in the Play store (Settings -&gt; Network preferences -&gt; Auto update apps -&gt; Don&#39;t auto update apps) and went to sleep. This morning I woke up with a cheerful notification that Google can help with COVID notifications and gov.ma.covid19.exposurenotifications.v3 installed -- the app was pushed overnight over explicit instructions NOT to update (sure, one can say auto-install != auto-update, but it is worrying that forced pushes can happen even with every single relevant UI switch turned off).adb logcat seems to have the following relevant lines:    06-19 09:27:54.481  1689  1990 I PackageManager: Integrity check passed for file:///data/app/vmdl1074248108.tmp

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It is obvious that we need better legislation to deal with all the new possibilities that technologies have opened.The installation of this app, even done with good intent, open a lot of questions on what should be possible or not to be done by government and corporations.When you get a device with pre-installed, uninstallable, or auto-installed apps. What are the rules?&gt; &#34;By enabling this service, you can be quickly notified if you’ve likely been exposed to the virus by another MassNotify user, allowing you to reduce risk to your loved ones, seek medical attention, and slow the spread in your community.&#34;In this case it seems that the same goal could have been better achieved by SMS that do not depend on the brand of your phone. The dependency on proprietary app stores and OSs seems a risk for the continuation of a free and reliable communications.The only thing that is impossible to achieve without an app is to allow the user to select contacts to whom send a notification. Corporations like Google, and Apple know the list of all your contacts. So, it seems that the intention of the app is to reduce friction and send notifications as easy and effortlessly as possible to avoid that procrastination causes people to delay the warning.But, instead of the silent install the government could have spend money in advertisement campaigns to assure a correct amount of installations. It costs money, but, people pay taxes so the government can engage on this type of initiative at a scale. This could have been a very good alternative, even if it means increasing the budged. Medical emergencies are worth the investing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fellow humans, there are alternatives! Your neck need not be under FAANG&#39;s boot! You don&#39;t even need to give up any functionality:CalyxOS: https://calyxos.org/
Privacy-respecting Android distribution that replaces Google spyware with MicroG, so you can have your cake and eat it too. Most everything will work as you&#39;re used to, but it does still talk to Google to make that happen.GrapheneOS: https://grapheneos.org/
Very much like Calyx, but extra-hardened and with no MicroG. No involvement with Google at all.LineageOS: https://lineageos.org/
The successor to CyanogenMod, will work with many different phones. More privacy and control than stock Android.There are also many others: Sailfish, Replicant, eHardware-wise: CalyxOS and GrapheneOS run best on Pixel 3, 3a, 3XL, 4, 4a, 4XL, 5. The path of least resistance is to get one of these phones and run CalyxOS (if there is an app you need to use that needs Google services like Firebase Cloud Messaging...note that many that can use FCM will run fine without), otherwise run GrapheneOS.You can also buy a Librem 5 https://puri.sm/products/librem-5/
If privacy and security and hacking are really important to you.Or a pinephone: https://www.pine64.org/pinephone/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Disclaimer: I work at Microsoft, but not on Windows (and I deal with a SaaS at MSFT). I am a FreeBSD committer and help maintain FreeBSD&#39;s GNOME packages and (very recently) the graphics drivers.The reason why Windows is full of UI inconsistencies is (largely) because of one thing: backwards compatibility.While backwards compatibility has it&#39;s perks, it also means having lots of old code in Windows that can&#39;t be touched very easily without breaking compatibility, And that means many old UI elements may stay, that&#39;s a side effect.While desktop Linux/BSD isn&#39;t exactly well known for it&#39;s UIs, I found GNOME 3/40 to be more consistent UI-wise than Windows 10, being a user of GNOME 3 on FreeBSD at home (which I am typing this comment from), and helping port GNOME 40, while (unsurprisingly) using Windows 10 at $DAYJOB.But then GNOME, KDE, Apple, et al. is more willing to break things than Windows is. They aren&#39;t as bound to legacy compatibility, so old UI elements can be shed easily."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like the Run dialog and the folder properties menu and others that have been untouched since the early days. Their utility has been proven and so much muscle memory has been built up. I can not possibly imagine a revision that could be done to them that would have more benefits than simply leaving them be.All of the Fluent/Metro designs have made things markedly worse. For example, check out the Metro control panel widget for selecting a default program for a file extension. It&#39;s a list view with 5 file extensions visible at a time, with no search. That&#39;s what I think of when I hear about a Windows UI update, and I&#39;d love to be proven wrong."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This issue is way overblown here on HN.In day-to-day usage, I have rarely been annoyed by these &#34;inconsistencies&#34;.The best example to illustrate this article is: Installing a driver with the Windows XP layer. That&#39;s probably something that will only happen to people installing very old hardware with drivers from over 10 years ago. I consider that a backward compatibility win: It is great that it even works in Windows 10."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What a fascinating case. There are so many details in such a short articles that is each worth its own discussion!Let’s start with my personally theory that hopefully won’t color all of the conversation about the individual points. This guy pissed off some people and those people are using their petty power to make his life hell. It’s like the 10’s of thousands of people jaywalking without issue and then the homeless guy that gets arrested for jaw walking. We all know that’s not why he was arrested but the law is clear, he was breaking the law, and they enforced it. So the individual incident dots it’s I’s and crosses it’s t’s as long as you don’t bring up the dreaded ‘uneven enforcement’ issue which is at the heart of everything wrong with the law in America. I have no evidence for the theory but it makes sense with the multiple issues involving this guy mentioned in such a short article.Next interesting point. Is giving a speech about how to treat a broken bone considered ‘practicing medicine’? Who gets to decide the answer. Is a PHD candidate writing an exploration of the efficacy of the various methods for treating a migraine practicing medicine? What if he’s selling copies of his paper on the checkout counter at the drug store? I use medicine instead of engineering because I think it’s easier to discuss but the point should hold the same regardless of which licensed profession we are discussing.Shit I have to run but hope to return to this conversation to discuss the other fun questions raised."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Texas may do a lot of crazy things when it comes to state government, but one thing I think we definitely got right is the Texas Sunset Commission (https://www.sunset.texas.gov/). Basically, all boards set up by the state government are automatically abolished every 10 years I believe unless the state legislature passes a law to continue the board.  So every 10 years the Sunset Commission evaluates agencies/boards about to expire and gives recommendations on if they should be merged, eliminated, etc.The whole idea is to prevent these little long-running fiefdoms from continuing indefinitely, where board members just become more concerned about their own power than their stated purpose.People being people it&#39;s not perfect, but it does go a long way to cut down on this type of abuse."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Useless bureaucracy hinders innovation and progress.I live in Spain where engineering is very regulated. This results in some engineers spending 6+ years in university to gain the same status as their international peers who studied for 3 or 4 years.There&#39;s no point in enforcing this other than collecting fees to pay the salaries of people who don&#39;t really do anything."</p>

The natural assumption here is that the game devs were doing all their work inches away from large fancy monitors not thinking of the so-called 10’ experience most people use to consume the content.At least many console games now have text size sliders (with varying levels of usefulness).https://kotaku.com/the-year-in-tiny-video-game-text-2019-184..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I vehemently disagree that vertical space used is negligible.  Due to standard aspect ratios, the vertical space of the display is at a premium. 1920*1080 means you have 840 less vertical pixels than horizontal - it makes a lot of sense to me to try to reclaim some of that space for actual content instead of widgets."</p>

I mean, it must, right?I&#39;m wondering how they addressed those, since making any room wider would change gameplay. I also can&#39;t help but wonder if being able to see a little bit further to the right would ever make anything easier? Or is the distance forward (to the right) fixed to the same value, so you&#39;re mostly just getting more visibility into where you&#39;ve already passed?The video and GitHub repo don&#39;t seem to explain it.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’ve noticed that in the time since I was a kid, the focus of public school has shifted from about the 40th percentile student to the 5th percentile student. In my school, the entire focus of the operation was the decent student... the one who showed up, put in a decent effort, did at least three quarters of their homework. The school had tremendous resources for these kids to go to college, and the very best colleges for the very top students. There was honors, accelerated, standard, and remedial and the kids who were really trying would never be sent to remedial because that’s where the true losers were sent (in a different building) where they couldn’t disrupt anyone else’s learning. Nobody cared what happened to those kids including in many cases their own parents.Now in my kids school I see way too much focus on this segment, which is by its nature low ROI — the number of teacher years it takes to turn one of those kids into someone worthwhile is like 10x the amount it takes to turn an average bright kid into a future surgeon or researcher."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In North America, teachers are grossly underpaid and their ability to discipline poor performance has been entirely eviscerated. It’s not just SF, look at what’s happening in Vancouver: https://nationalpost.com/opinion/rex-murphy-cutting-honours-...The problem is the administration: The board that sets the standards and the parents and politicians who sit on those boards.The solution is this: Ban anyone without a minimum teaching experience of x years from participating on boards, bring all teacher salaries up to comfortable middle-class in every district and give them back their authority in the classroom. Otherwise this downward slide into illiteracy will continue until North America is dominated by an idiot majority."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Another initiative headed for mandate status is a school policy that no assignment can receive a grade of less than 50%&gt; And my direct supervisor repeatedly demanded that I pace my classes for the benefit of the single student in each section who was struggling the mostI don&#39;t understand school.  Why do they do things like this?  Who actually thinks this is a good idea?  I&#39;ve never met anyone who does. How have we gotten to the point where standards are not allowed?"</p>

This page has a pretty decent write-up on it: https://leochavez.org/index.php/2020/11/16/disabling-intel-a...."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Should we have a debate as to whether or not Spectre mitigations matter for some (or all) desktop computers?  I know that, theoretically, I could install a piece of software on my Linux box that is malware and could try to read my memory via those methods, but let&#39;s be honest - we&#39;re all mostly concerned with servers that run code for dozens or hundreds of different clients.I&#39;m a foil hat as much as the next - security is of the utmost concern to me, but for once I actually just don&#39;t care and would take the performance back on my local dev machine."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Honestly, I think it&#39;s time to reconsider the wisdom of allowing arbitrary untrustable third party executable code to run instantly in the form of things like JavaScript on web pages, instead of just nerf everyone&#39;s computer into molasses to prop up an idea that&#39;s been bad for the web anyways.I&#39;ve been of this opinion for a while now, not just because of performance slowdowns and security issues, but also just because of the way JS on web sites has been reducing usability in the form of popups, bitcoin miners, playing videos, sudden redirects to phishing sites and whatever crazy things are out there now.I&#39;m not saying get rid of JS, but treat it like it is - running code you can&#39;t trust. Web sites should start as largely static HTML documents that you read, and then if they need to use JS then they should be required to ask permission to do so, the same way any other executable code is managed in any other computing environment. That seems wild, but I think it&#39;s far less crazy than taking away a decade of performance improvements to the entire computing ecosystem by default so a broken security model can continue unquestioned."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I know this is so different, but I can&#39;t help but think of the 1950&#39;s DoD Heavy Press Program[0]. I think about these special industrial monsters a lot when I read about semi fabs.In WW2 after examining the components from aircraft kills, german wing spars would often survive. It was discovered that Germany used unique forged alloy wing spars to achieve their excellent aircraft performance, perplexing allied engineers. These wing spars&#39; strength and weight is critical to the structural properties of modern air frames. Without them, jet air craft like the f-15 would have been impossible.Machining these advanced alloy parts proved difficult, expensive, error prone, and impossible to manufacture but a die forged alloy wing spar was stronger, lighter, cheaper and beyond the industrial capability of every allied nation. We did not have the metallurgical technology to create such a large forged alloy wing spar in 1945.After the war, the US and Soviets recovered designs for the extremely large press assemblies required for advanced air frames. In the 1950s, a huge national program was geared up to create absolutely massive Heavy Press machines. The Soviets had a massive 30,000lb press for these parts, and we created a couple of monstrous 50,000lb machines[1] that are still in operation today. These things are older than we are and still out there cranking out air frame parts today for modern air frames in 2021.Without this kind of national investment in this kind of unique manufacturing, we would be unable to fly without importing 747 parts from wherever they could be created.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_Press_Program

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wonder what the deeper thinking is here.So right now China consumes most of the world&#39;s semiconductors but only produces a modest fraction of them. China is going through a whole of society effort to expand its semiconductor sector in order to not be dependent on anything the US can cut off via sanctions. China will expand its semiconductor sector, regardless whether it is economical feasible, because it is a matter of national security.The countries that are going to be hurt by these US semiconductor subsidies are going be Taiwan, South Korea, Japan ... not China."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I went to one of these places when I was 13. Same thing, picked up in the middle of the night, and sent to a wilderness program that turned into 18 months of boarding school.The school was burnt down by the students a few years after I left and I got a couple thousand dollars in a class action lawsuit when it came out that they were hiring unlicensed therapists and admitting students who should have been in intensive  psychiatric care and were an immediate danger to others around them.I look back on it as one of the most valuable experiences in my life, not because there was any validity to the program but because it just confronted me with a lot of intense challenges at a young age that really developed my critical thinking and mindset at a young age."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My first thought: wow, the US is crazy, I’m glad they don’t have this in the UK! Then I remembered that I was at a famous boarding school for five years, the most miserable years of my life. Thirty years later I’m still coping with the aftereffects. I think of that place as a form of institutionalised child abuse, and frankly if someone pipebombed it, I would not shed a tear.One simple thing: it wasn’t authoritarian adults or teachers. If anything, they were AWOL. It was the students that really made each other’s life hell. Of course, we were teenagers. Much later, I stopped blaming the individuals and started blaming the institution.Here’s a tiny anecdote. One guy, who I think was genuinely evil, took psychology as a minor subject. As an experiment, he decided to drive another, younger, vulnerable pupil mad. Gaslighting him, messing with his head, that kind of stuff. And he succeeded!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was sent to an “emotional growth boarding school” in the ‘90s. I wasn’t kidnapped but many of my schoolmates were. A few years later the department of education (can’t remember if it was state or federal) shut the school down after stories got out about the horrific things that were going on there. Kids forced to sit in corners for days at a time, ambulances not being called for kids who had very seriously self-harmed, strip searches (administered by other kids), physical restraints... I could go on. The place had a cult-like atmosphere that was centered on the headmaster and his weird homegrown therapeutic method.I had nightmares for years afterwards and still haven’t fully come to grips with what happened there."</p>

Here is the github repo for their open source adblock engine written in rust:https://github.com/brave/adblock-rustHere is a (somewhat dated) article describing it by the authors:https://brave.com/improved-ad-blocker-performance/&gt; Google will take decisions that benefit their advertisement business, like making impossible to use adblockers on any Chromium based browser.Because the brave adblocker is integrated directly into the browser (ie. not an extension) the Manifest V3 limitations don&#39;t apply."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find Brave Rewards very egregious. You get lots of BAT and the marketing copy hypes it up immensely without mentioning, anywhere, that you need to provide your SSN and Driver&#39;s License to a third-party (Uphold) if you actually, you know, want to cash out.This seems particularly irritating because, let&#39;s say you set your browser to show you the max amount of ads for a while. You saved up for a few months, decided you had enough, tried to cash out only to discover that slap in your face that they never mentioned. Of course this benefits them, but the fact that the browser puts you in the situation of giving up your privacy to receive money is ridiculous for a &#34;privacy&#34; browser."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I always find it odd that we worry so much about how much our browsers are tracking us, but almost nothing about what our ISPs are doing.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Amateur mistake, compared to my professional mistakes.I once wrote a bot that sent email within the company (100K+ employees). I kick-started the bot on a server remotely and only then discovered it&#39;s an endless loop. It required server admin rights to stop it, which I did not have.I couldn&#39;t immediately reach server admins so had to physically drive there. An hour or so later somebody helped me kill the process.The emails already sent could not be cleared out server-side, which meant that recipients had freezing email clients for over a week, unable to handle the volume, a typical 300K new emails per recipient. They had to Ctrl+A and Delete 100 emails, do this for the next 100, and so on, whilst not deleting real and useful emails.I pretty much destroyed email for those people.I don&#39;t just destroy things at scale though, also at home. Around the time we had our first home broadband internet connection, I set up a web server and just kept my PC running. Unknown to me, the web server software included an email server with open relay enabled by default.About 3 days later, my dad complained about the internet connection not working. The IPS detected the issue (millions of emails sent out via my home server) and gave us a red card, fully shutting us down, permanently."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Aww I’m feeling bad for the poor engineer who is saying “crap” a thousand times now, or is blissfully unaware that their day is about to get much worse.Once during a system upgrade we ran some scripts and they triggered emails to about 8,000 people before we realized it (would’ve been 150k people otherwise). The next day was all about clean up, sending an apology email etc.My mother had visited the next day and asked why I wasn’t hanging out and my son (6 at the time) said, totally unphased, “oh he can’t come now because he’s saying sorry to 8,000 people”Hope you get through it! These mistakes happen. Oh, and your test passed. :-)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Now imagine it didn&#39;t just say &#34;test&#34; or &#34;asdf&#34;.I still might sometimes put a funny/lighthearted twist on debugging logs that nobody outside the company would see, but I never put in swear words, condescending things, or anything else I wouldn&#39;t be okay with if it was accidentally logged in production.I fortunately did not have to make that experience myself, but I&#39;ve seen too many supposedly &#34;internal only&#34; messages turn uninternal."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I joined, I was perplexed by this way of operating meetings. It surprised me greatly that people wouldn&#39;t want to read the doc at ahead, give it time for thinking and researching, and then come to the table feeling prepare to contribute to the best if your ability.Now, I understand and deeply appreciate this method. I believe it provides lots of benefits. It drives towards better docs that can be understood quickly by non-experts. When there are just a few minutes to review the doc, we don&#39;t have time to go digging for information on our own - the critical information must be provided in the material given. There will also be SMEs in the room who can clarify any shortcomings here. Because the audience of the docs is non-SMEs, it drives towards inclusion of other teams. From this, you get more diverse viewpoints, considerations, and experience. It also contributes towards cross-team awareness and education. It makes it much easier to participate as a contributor to the meeting while simultaneously less impactful when you don&#39;t. It let&#39;s us timebox our attention span - you won&#39;t accidentally spend hours rabbit-holing into a doc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Having witnessed this through a flood of incoming ex-Amazon folks I agree that it brings so much more content and focus on a meeting. It is amazing. The silence, the reading, the staying on topic (apart from tangents that sometimes need to be brought up, but are vulnerable to being just dismissed with the power of The Document) all helps to get the attention and feedback you need.The thing is though, that while the article mentions briefly challenges with the writing, it does not shine light on the hours and hours or reviews, rewrites and re-reviews when preparing the document. The endless and often times pointless arguments and bad blood between people on how to write a sentence so that it would be &#34;correct&#34; and every word and number counts. Arguments if a given word should be &#34;benefit&#34; or &#34;impact&#34;. If the word should be &#34;system&#34; or &#34;solution&#34;. It does not feel productive and I am not sure if counting the hours spent would actually add up classical &#34;hours wasted&#34; in a typical 10 person &#34;pointless meeting&#34;. And also when usually a piece of writing has some soul of the writer, in these documents they end up being soulless, blank format robotic texts only aiming to convincing the reader to fund your project or sell your idea over others. And that leads to quite an Amazonian culture that is a subject of many different articles.I just felt there was something omitted by OP. So while it has benefits, it does have a cost associated."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"An ex-Amazon PM ‘promoted’ the silent reading culture in my previous company. Definitely brought a lot of benefits:- forced more senior / leadership members to read through and internalize the details. Reduces wasted time asking already answered questions.- we used google docs. Question and answers were posted as comments. This formed a log of the majority of the discussion. Less note taking needed.- allowed less assertive members to ask questions or give answers.The only drawback - the overwhelming silence at the start that I never really got over…"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Two interesting takeaways:&gt; This is the beautiful thing about having a company that isn&#39;t on the stock market. Imagine you have a company that goes slower and slower every quarter, and then you confront the shareholders with the statement, that the way to solve it, is to do absolutely no new features for a quarter or two, refactor the code, learn new methodologies etc. I doubt that the shareholders would allow that. Luckily, we don&#39;t have any shareholders, and we understand the vital importance of this investment in the long run. Not only in the project, but also in our skill and knowledge, so we do better next time.This is reassuring the notion of what I think actually matters, what the real essence is of developing a product, may that be a piece of art and entertainment (like here) or a productivity tool etc.There are creators and there are consumers. We split them up by developers, designers, domain experts and so on, but what matters is that all the other participants, especially those who can exert power traditionally are not part of the essence and if not being careful and responsible, can easily add complexity and limitations that are entirely accidental and can even be harmful.This reminds me of the agile manifesto, modern UX approaches and other processes that are driven by creators, but are often and very unfortunately being bent over backwards to fit into hierarchical power structures.&gt; TDD actually is the constant fast swithing between extending the tests and making them pass continously. So as you write tests, you write code to satisfy them basically at the same time. This allows you to instantly test what you write, and mainly use tests as specifiation of what the code should acctually do, which guides the thought process to make you think about where you are headed to, and to write code that is more structured and testable from the very beginning.The important notion here is that TDD is not about tests and correctness, but about development. It continuously checks assumptions and explores the surrounding code, state and data until a sufficient solution is found.If we squint a little we can see how closely related TDD with REPL Driven Development is. In essence it is the same thing and even has similar results, where the tests or REPL code can be left as an artifact for further, likely historical understanding.We know now that neither is sufficient for a high degree of correctness, but they are certainly useful for understanding and development."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d be curious to hear what kovarex thinks in 2-3 months.TDD is often sold as a fix-all solution, which is incredibly appealing to mgmt and quite fun for most programmers as a new paradigm, allowing for quick adoption.It also has its uses, especially in the enterprise space where requirements aren&#39;t often clear. But I don&#39;t know many good programmers that truly stick to the dogma after the honeymoon period. It becomes just another tool in your toolset.Uncle bob is a salesman, not a &#34;craftsman&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Every time a Factorio thread makes it to HN I feel like a fully recovered meth addict who suddenly has their old dealer knocking at their door:--Dealer: &#34;Hey? You there? I got some meth for you.&#34;Me: &#34;Go away! I don&#39;t want any!&#34;Dealer: &#34;Oh now don&#39;t say that. You remember how good it is? I know you do.&#34;Me: &#34;I can&#39;t, I can&#39;t afford it, the price is too high.&#34;Dealer: &#34;What? Come on, it&#39;s free! You already paid for it!.Me: &#34;I&#39;ll lose my job, I can&#39;t, just go away!&#34;Dealer: &#34;Your JOB? This IS your job. Open the damn door, THE FACTORY MUST GROW&#34;Me: ::cowers in the closet chanting please leave please leave please leave::--Also it was never good. It was more like a mind virus. Like the sort of problem or project at work you can&#39;t stop thinking about until it&#39;s done. Only with Factorio, it&#39;s never done. Never.My best defense against it are other video games I can stop &amp; start when needed. Or booting up my VPN connection and picking a work task from my back log until the cravings go away."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is another nail in the coffin of the Hong Kong we knew and loved…I was a resident for many years, I witnessed the peaceful protests of 2014, I witnessed horrifying wanton violence in 2019, I witnessed the rapid destruction of the freest laissez faire city state in the world. Above all I feel great sadness for the people of Hong Kong.The CCP cannot tolerate any dissenting voices as a matter of preserving their total grip on power. It was an inevitability Hong Kong would be crushed and silenced although the world and Hong Kong was caught off guard by the speed at which this has occurred. I take some consolation with the G7&#39;s recent communique."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is tragic, the US, Japan, Canada, GB, AUS, the EU need to band together to counter China’s egregious rights abuses instead of solely pursuing their own business and national interests. They could all offer residency programs for the bright students and others that are currently suffocating there. China can’t punish all these countries together. If no one stands up Taiwan will be next to fall and then China would have unprecedented power by controlling the chip industry…."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Feel truly bad for Hong Kong here.
Sadly nothing will be done here by the west. 
Let&#39;s not forget a &#34;social justice&#34; warrior LeBron James criticized an NBA owner for tweeting &#34;Stand with Hong Kong&#34; not too long ago. It&#39;s all about money in the west."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think anybody developing open source / collaborative commons software that targets non-technical users could learn some tricks from streetcomplete. It has managed to lower barriers to entry and seems to get many people engaged in what is quite a technical area. Some UI expert might be better able break it down but here is my braindump of some key factors:* at a basic level, generally smooth handling of drawing of a legible map and basic UI functions (esp. compared with some other foss openstreetmap apps, no need to name names :-)* considerably narrows down the map editing options. by presenting controlled choice lists the novice editor feels &#34;safe&#34;* uses simple and innocent gamification (scoreboards, &#34;unlocking&#34; websites etc)There are ofcourse glitches and indeed a keen openstreetmap enthousiast may &#34;outgrow&#34; it relatively quickly but assuming the devs get further support and build on the initial success it could be a reference point for highly usable open source apps targeting larger audiences"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I personally have problems with doors, and stuff that should be locked. I can never be sure I locked properly.Totally did backtrack unreasonable distances just to check if I had closed the door.It&#39;s all fine when it&#39;s my door. Worst case scenario, I get robbed.However it&#39;s more of a problem when it&#39;s someone else&#39;s door. Worst case scenario, they get robbed, and that&#39;s a different story. Or pets get out...Obviously I can&#39;t take the door on my front seat... So my solution is to take a picture of me trying to open the door, a kind of proof that it&#39;s closed.And, would you know it, it works! When I get anxious, I pull out my phone and look at the pictures.It&#39;s getting better, actually. I believe I&#39;m fixing it slowly. Good riddance!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember a panel on a news program years ago where the one guest was a psychologist who was treating &#34;untreatable&#34; drug addicts by getting them &#34;hooked&#34; on running or weightlifting or martial arts.  They would stop drugs but would instead be doing martial arts for hours a day or running 20 miles every morning.  Then he would start treating the addiction personality and causes, but in many cases the patients would just stop coming and live three or more hours of every day in the gym.The other guests were various degrees of horrified.His patients went from literally living on the street as heroin addicts to doing 3 hour gym sessions and holding down a job; and his peers thought he shouldn&#39;t be allowed to practice.Recently I was reading a book on ADHD and the author was quite adamant that you could only be diagnosed with ADHD if your life was worse than  &#34;the norm&#34;.  In this view, if you have symptoms of ADHD but can, for instance, hold down a good job then by definition you don&#39;t have ADHD.  I deleted the book from my Audible account."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve read most of Scott&#39;s blog posts and he rarely mentions OCD and when he does it tends to be &#34;this is what I think people with OCD experience&#34; and not &#34;this is what my patients have told me&#34; which leads me to believe that he is not an expert in OCD.I have OCD and it&#39;s ruined my life in ways that are hard to articulate. Which is why I can point out two good reasons why what&#39;s being described might not be a good idea. First, giving into compulsions just legitimizes them and reinforces the patterns that are central to OCD and can ultimately make things worse. Secondly, OCD has a habit of changing how it manifests. Sure, maybe the woman is no longer bothered by the hairdryer, but what happens when it becomes changes to worrying if the oven is on? She&#39;ll be right back where she started.I doubt that the anecdote actually happened as described. It&#39;s way too contrived, simplistic and borders on &#34;Psychiatrists hate her! Cure your OCD with this one simple trick!&#34;. Realistically, OCD is incredibly insidious and if it were that simple to cure then nobody would have OCD. What&#39;s described is, at best, a short-term fix and half the psychiatrists likely knew that such things rarely stick.I&#39;ve had the same thing happen to me more times than I can count. I think I found the silver bullet, a way to permanently defeat my obsessive thoughts. If I&#39;m lucky then it&#39;ll last a week before my OCD comes back in full force. But the truth is that you cannot directly fight OCD, it&#39;s like squeezing dough. When you clamp down in one spot, it just squirts out somewhere else. There&#39;s a quote that I think describes it perfectly &#34;To hate me is to give me breath, to fight me is to give me strength&#34;. Fighting OCD or giving into its demands is just falling into its traps. You only truly win when you reach a point where you don&#39;t respond to it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I would love to learn how the routing algorithm works. This is probably one of a few opensource-but-in-production implementation of such kind of algorithms. here seems no doc in the repo unfortunately.Still, it&#39;s very exciting to see they started from a &#34;Helicoptor Router&#34; [1] five years ago! The author clearly knew what they were doing.[1] https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps/commit/7123f71eec..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have used maps.me until a few years ago but was never really happy with the performance of the bike routing algorithm.I&#39;ve switched to Osmand [1] and BRouter [2] (both available on F-Droid) and nerver looked back. BRouter on Android is a bit tricky to set up (you need to download routing tiles in addition to the map files through a really ugly UI), but once you&#39;re done it&#39;s the best bike navigator I can think of (and it&#39;s really fast).The BRouter profiles are highly customizable, check out Poutnik&#39;s repositories [3] for examples.
Some of his profiles and many others con be tested on https://brouter.m11n.de/ (german).[1] https://osmand.net/[2] https://brouter.de/[3] https://github.com/poutnikl/Brouter-profiles"</p>

It streamlines the story as if it was always headed towards the today, culling aspects that didn&#39;t pan out or magnifying aspects that were at the time more minor and not considered the central issue or angle."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;&gt; The machine was still considered impressive decades later when the AI pioneer
Norbert Wiener played against it at the 1951 Paris conference,[AI51][BRO21]
[BRU1-4] which is now often viewed as the first conference on AI—though the
expression &#34;AI&#34; was coined only later in 1956 at another conference in Dartmouth
by John McCarthy. In fact, in 1951, much of what&#39;s now called AI was still
called Cybernetics, with a focus very much in line with modern AI based on deep
neural networks.[DL1-2][DEC]Yeess, that&#39;s true. John McCarthy named &#34;AI&#34;. And he wisely set the
foundations of the field in the work of his thesis advisor, Alonzo Church, and
the mathematicians of his generation, and the ones before, all the way back to
Gödel.That is to say, McCarthy set the foundations of AI in mathematical logic, the
branch of mathematics that began in antiquity by Aristotle, flourished in the
Middle Ages, the Rennaissance and the Enlightenment with the works of Arab and
Christian scholars, reached its peak with Leibniz and was finally exalted with
the work of Frege, Russel, Whitehead, Hilbert, Tarski, Skolem, Herbrand, Gödel
himself, Church, Turing and others. The branch of mathematics that gave us
digital computers, much like Jurgen Schmidhuber points out in his article. It is
this work that is the only, well, logical, foundation of artificial
intelligence. That suffices to explain why the earlier &#34;cyerbnetics&#34; branch of
research fell through: because unlike McCarthy&#39;s AI, it was not grounded in
solid theoretcial foundations that had already yielded such monumental results
in mathematics and computer science.And it is the foundations of AI in logic that AI research must return to,
eventually, because it makes no sense to throw out two thousand years of
progress, just because an intellectual midget by the name of Sir James Lighthill
wrote a report. It would be even worse to throw out such richess of knowledge in
return for the ability to put bunny noses and ears on selfies with &#34;neural
networks&#34;."</p>
