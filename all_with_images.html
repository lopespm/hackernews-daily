We have identified root cause and we are actively working towards recovery. This issue is affecting the global console landing page, which is also hosted in US-EAST-1. Customers may be able to access region-specific consoles going to https://console.aws.amazon.com/. So, to access the US-WEST-2 console, try https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked at a company that hired an ex-Amazon engineer to work on some cloud projects.Whenever his projects went down, he fought tooth and nail against any suggestion to update the status page. When forced to update the status page, he&#39;d follow up with an extremely long &#34;post-mortem&#34; document that was really just a long winded explanation about why the outage was someone else&#39;s fault.He later explained that in his department at Amazon, being at fault for an outage was one of the worst things that could happen to you. He wanted to avoid that mark any way possible.YMMV, of course. Amazon is a big company and I&#39;ve had other friends work there in different departments who said this wasn&#39;t common at all. I will always remember the look of sheer panic he had when we insisted that he update the status page to accurately reflect an outage, though."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"OK...So, I&#39;m the tech lead for Cloudflare Workers. In complete honestly, I did not even know we ran some sort of comparison benchmark with Compute@Edge until Fastly complained about it, nor did I know about our ToS clause until Fastly complained about it. I honestly don&#39;t know anything about either beyond what&#39;s publicly visible.But as long as we&#39;re already mud slinging, I&#39;d like to take the opportunity to get a little something off my chest. Fastly has been trumpeting for years that Compute@Edge has 35 microsecond cold starts, or whatever, and repeatedly posting blog posts comparing that against 5 milliseconds for Workers, and implying that they are 150x faster. If you look at the details, it turns out that 35 microsecond time is actually how long they take to start a new request, given that the application is already loaded in memory. A hot start, not a cold start. Whereas Workers&#39; 5ms includes time to load the application from disk (which is the biggest contributor to total time). Our hot start time is also a few microseconds, but that doesn&#39;t seem like an interesting number?We never called this out, it didn&#39;t seem worth arguing over. But excuse me if I&#39;m not impressed by claims of false comparisons...On a serious note, I&#39;ve been saying for decades that benchmarks are almost always meaningless, because different technologies will have different strengths and weaknesses, so you usually can&#39;t tell anything about how your use case will perform unless you actually test that use case.  So, I would encourage everyone to run your own test and don&#39;t just go on other people&#39;s numbers. It&#39;s great that Fastly has opened up C@E for self-service testing so that people can actually try it out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was expecting a point-by-point comparison from Fastly. Instead, this comes off incredibly defensive and evasive, basically boiling down to two irrelevant points:* Rust compiled to WASM is faster than Javascript (ok, but I&#39;m not going to switch my entire stack just to use your CDN)* Fastly performance throttles their free accounts (ok, but not Cloudflare&#39;s fault, and I definitely don&#39;t want to get into your pricing game if you&#39;re going to start offering different tiers of serverless workers... part of Cloudflare&#39;s allure is its simplicity in pricing).They do have two good points:* Benchmarks between CDNs should be done from the same client locations (fine, but why did you then use your own set)* Cloudflare should not prohibit benchmarking of their products (fair)But this whole post read like a feeble attempt at misdirection, and made me distrust Fastly as a company. The complaints about their methodology aren&#39;t solved by using your own, even more flawed, methodology that doesn&#39;t even use the same language. You could&#39;ve just emailed them and asked to work together on an apple-to-apples test instead of creating an even more flawed benchmark."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As mentioned in the article, Cloudflare expressly prohibits benchmarking their services in the tos.I think it&#39;s rather disingenuous for Cloudflare to publish their own benchmarks calling out competitors when they won&#39;t allow anyone to run their own tests and comparisons."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love Cloudflare, but these Image products are a black mark on their reputation.Every point the author says is 100% correct. I&#39;ll add one more point, which ended up making it a total non-starter: you can&#39;t import lots of images because their rate limits are so pernicious. If you have tens of thousands or millions of images, keeping within their single digit per second rate limit, which appears to be totally non-negotiable, makes it impossible to add images at any scale.They have another product called Cloudflare Images which can work from Workers: but here the pricing is almost absurd and from the data they show on their dashboard, they only cache a tiny percentage of the requests. This means you end up paying a lot more than makes sense."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I thought Cloudflare was going to win the image hosting/serving/resizing game based on their original blog post, but that doesn&#39;t seem to be the case.I kept getting frustrated with the complexity and changing costs of solutions out there, so about a year ago I launched https://www.simplefileupload.com. It&#39;s a super easy, flat rate cost solution to quickly allow users to upload images and files. It provides a customizable upload widget and serves files via a CDN and firewall to protect against attacks. It doesn&#39;t have query param image resizing yet, but it&#39;s coming!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thanks for the feedback. I&#39;m on the CF Images product team.
We will allow the download of the original images, it is actually one of the next features coming up. Also we will introduce webhooks and Images Analytics next."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Django has allowed me to enjoy some side entrepreneurship. I have released three products as a solo part time dev that I would never have been able to do in a reasonable time using Java/Spring (my strongest stack). My first project went nowhere, but the second generated 1k+ a month and sold for 50k, and the third one is following a similar trajectory.My advice - keep it simple- function based views- centralize access to the ORM (avoid fat models, use a service layer)- responsive bootstrap template with crispy forms- minimal js- 12 factor type setup - django-environ or similar- be aware of n+1 select problem (I use django debug toolbar but looking into django-zen-queries)- plop it on heroku, AWS lightsail, Digital Ocean or if containerizing use AWS Fargate- avoid celery unless you are at a scale you need it - use django-cron, django-db-queue or similar- use a managed database and managed email serviceI have had zero scalability problems. People say Django is slow but it handled 10k active users on a small EC2 instance without any issues (static stuff served via cloudfront)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Django is the nicest framework I&#39;ve come across! For some context, my favorite overall programming language is Rust. Despite Rust having several web frameworks, I use Python the server due to Django being so nice.In Python, there are micro frameworks like Flask, and whatever new ones claim to be &#34;Blazingly fast!&#34;, async etc. Once you get over the learning curve, Django seems the nicest to use, due to including features like an auto-updating ORM, email, authentication, admin page etc. None of the Rust frameworks, in contrast, come close to feature parity.Django&#39;s feature base is vast, and I admit I don&#39;t understand much of it. You can choose the feature sets you need. The template language is inflexible, but you can smooth this over using JS instead A/R."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We went all in on FastAPI with my team, but we&#39;re hit the issue that the projects of Tiangolo (FastAPI, SQLModel, Typer) seem to be turning pretty much unmaintained : https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/discussions/3970We&#39;ve already been hit by multiple bugs with fixing PR opened, but left to rot, and missing documentation : the &#39;tutorial&#39; documentation is great, but if you want a reference you have to go read the code.I guess that&#39;s the issue when you pick projects maintained by one person, so for my next projects I might get back to something built on stronger grounds, like Django.How is Django this day with modern Python constructs like typing in general and Pydantic models integration ?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Michel van Biezen has an excellent video series on Kalman filters:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaCcOwJPytQHe walks you though all the way from the rationale, to a simple algebraic example, to the full blown Linear Algebraic Matrix solution.  It&#39;s really worth watching even just the first couple videos to get a deeper understanding of this very useful technique."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The best exercise I had in our sensing &amp; estimation class was to derive the Kalman filter from &#39;scratch&#39;. It&#39;s actually just the series of steps used to perform a minimization of a convex cost function, where the cost function is the inverse likelihood of the measurements given the data.Someone once joked that all of sensing and estimation (and path planning and optimal control) is just applied convex minimization."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"OK. The reason all this happening is that Bitcoin really did go to the moon. That&#39;s what powers all this speculation. If the price of Bitcoin had been stable for a decade, and it worked reliably, it would be a useful medium of exchange, but nobody would care. This is all about MAKE MONEY FAST.Bitcoin found some early use cases. Drugs first. Then getting money out of China. Money laundering. Tax evasion.  Scams. Bitcoin is the scammers dream - remote, anonymous, irreversible transactions. Much less risk of the mark coming for the scammer with a baseball bat.Then China cracked down on cryptocurrency, shut down all the miners, and arrested a few hundred of them. Financial regulators in the more legit countries started regulating Bitcoin exchanges, so the operators couldn&#39;t just steal the money. Know Your Customer became a thing. In the US, the IRS, FinCen, the FBI, and the SEC all started paying attention to what was happening on blockchains. Cryptocurrency crime was no longer risk-free for the crooks.But by now, sheer momentum kept Bitcoin going up. That&#39;s a powerful force. It&#39;s not forever, though. Check out meme stocks a few years later. Remember, all this stuff is zero-sum. For every winner, there has to be a loser.That&#39;s what provides the engine behind &#34;Web3&#34;, NFTs, DAOs, and whatnot. It&#39;s not the technology."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find both the evangelism of and the hostility towards “Web 3” kind of silly. Obviously there’s some amount of interesting stuff and obviously there’s some amount of tech bro assholes getting rich who “shouldn’t”.Just like ~2008-2012, ~1999-2002, ~1994-1996, ~1982-1986, etc.On the technology side: distributed Byzantine consensus is an open problem with some promising prototypes. It would have very cool use cases: remittance is huge, ENS is fucking cool, Brave/BAT is cool, NFTs for e.g. concert tickets or restaurant reservations or whatever would be cool, IPFS is cool.The technology isn’t there yet. POW doesn’t scale. Ouroboros Praus/Genesis needs a clock oracle (see: Spanner), Tendermint/Algorand/PBFT are too slow (global 3-phase. commit, right). Solana/ICON/etc. are expensive cloud databases. L2 rollups/Lightning/sharding are “kick-the-can” exercises. But it took time to go from the Paxos paper to Chubby as well, maybe someone solves it.Yeah, it’s mostly scams today. But it’s always been mostly scams. Microsoft bundling IE was a scam. Pets.com was a scam. Path was a scam. Uber and AirBnB were (are?) illegal as hell. Third-party cookies powering Google and FB is a scam.When the dust settles some amount of this stuff will have been worked out technically, legally, and financially, and the rest will be “lol do you remember when…”.This time some people will be rich who neither had rich parents nor knew Bay Area royalty, but YC wasn’t always part of the machine either. I’m sure Goldman and YC will eventually embrace those people with open arms.I for one look forward to us collectively getting our knickers untwisted about it so we can go back to rewriting every calculator app on earth in Rust (I kid! Don’t hit me! Doofy Haskell is better than no Haskell!).;)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I completely agree with the author. I&#39;ve been reading a lot about the EVM, and while there&#39;s some interesting technology involved, it feels unlikely to be able to support any worthwhile applications outside of blockchain finance or moving $ around the world[0] (since the code can really only directly reference the blockchain itself).It&#39;s a bit like playing with a programming language in a sandbox that has (1) has no I/O functions[1], and (2) has enormous costs associated with even the most basic of computations. Ok, it&#39;s not like that; it is exactly that.Sure, you could build a crypto toy and convince some suckers to transfer some of their wealth to you, but calling it an app platform or the next evolution of the web is definitely a stretch. I sincerely wish that wasn&#39;t the case (I&#39;d love to find an exception), but that&#39;s what I&#39;ve come to conclude.[0] Don&#39;t get me wrong, there&#39;s tremendous value in being able to move money around the world without the blessing of governments and central banks![1] Any interaction with entities outside the blockchain require oracles, and at that point, you might as well throw away the other benefits of being on a blockchain."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t know if others have experienced it, but I run a monitoring server from Hetzner and have daily issues with IPv6 latency and packet loss (edit: Finland DC).I monitor 3 other IPv6 locations, the monitoring server will very randomly throw alerts, and only from Hetzner. Yet, when I opened a ticket, I was told it was the fault of the other providers, despite the mtr traces showing otherwise, and not having issues outside Hetzner.Hopefully more IPv6 users means that I won&#39;t be the only one impacted by those networking issues. I find IPv6 useful for servers that are not public-facing. They are firewalled of course, but it also means I can access them directly from home without hops or VPN (my home having a static IPv6 address)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I assume this is common knowledge, but I personally find Hetzner to be exceptionally good.It&#39;s always been good to me when I was using their European data centers, but that was always a bit of a bummer because of latency.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I often use exodus to move software onto a Synology NAS (after hosing my installation in the past through haphazard use of alternative package managers) and it has been incredibly helpful.  It&#39;s great to be able to bring over utilities without fighting with docker, building appimages, or the like.Thank you so much for it!It just works most of the time, which is wild given how diverse the environments it operates in can be.  One piece of software I have struggled with however is w3m.   Wrong __data_start/_end pair
   Aborted (core dumped)

I get the above error messages which I understand to be related to libc, but I cannot get around it. Is this something anyone has seen before?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This probably won&#39;t work on binaries that contain references to system files necessary in order to run the binary that aren&#39;t code. You usually can&#39;t detect them other than running the program and watching it die, or running the program with strace and looking for the files it&#39;s trying to stat/open.In the past what I&#39;ve done when I have to copy a binary somewhere, is statically compile it in a Docker container and export the install files, then copy those over. I have about a half dozen tools prepped like that (gdb, curl, strace, busybox, etc)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Could this be used to relocate Android-native libraries to other platforms? Even if the architecture matches, the bionic libc calls is what I found more challenging."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is still the strongest apple advantage: design, engineering and build quality.Recently I wanted to buy a second notebook so I could leave my MBPro at home in trips where I didn&#39;t want to work, but still had a machine that run linux and windows for some quick idea or even some light gaming.Decided for a Samsung Galaxy Book Pro. Expensive machine, but slightly cheaper than a MacBook Air. good i7 11gen processor, excellent battery life, very light but with surprisingly good thermals, 1tb SSD, but unfortunately no option to have it with more than 16GB RAM.Anyway, was very satisfied with it, and it was so light that I was even booting it with linux and doing some programming on it.But, one day I just opened the lid by the sides, heard a crack, and the gorgeous OLED screen had cracked.Of course I didnt abuse it, I just opened it, without excessive force or speed. But the screen is very fragile, the lid is paper thin, but not rigid enough, it seems, to avoid this problem.And of course, Samsung says it was my fault, and I will have to pay the fix.And yes, I know people have plenty of complaints about apple, but I never had encountered such an obvious problem with an Apple product. Have they not stress-tested this stuff?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Does anyone have a canonical URL to the previous month&#39;s scan of the LEGO mini-figure? I didn&#39;t see any navigation on the site unless there&#39;s a magic spot I missed or am inadvertently adblocking: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29253441This month&#39;s entry comes off way too much like advertising for my taste, with the flowery language like &#34;magic features&#34; instead of just &#34;features&#34;, or the seemingly-unnecessary sales statistics in lieu of a technical description of the Airpods Pro: &#34;In 2020, Apple sold 110,000,000 AirPod products. Talk about mass manufacturing.&#34;Maybe it&#39;s just an unconscious tic when talking about Apple products. Even I have a hard time not saying &#34;Boom&#34; when showing off something cool :) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx7v815bYUw"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the AirPods Pro were a regression from the OG AirPods for four reasons:- Idle life took a huge dive from the originals. My OGs haven&#39;t been charged in something like six months, and the case is still at something like 20%. Meanwhile, the case holding the APPs would die in less than a week and the buds inside of them a week after that.My wife&#39;s APPs have been lost for a while because of this.- Noise cancellation performs worse than the original firmware. They have actually been outclassed by other offerings, such as the Sony WF1000XM4.- The buds themselves have a design flaw wherein earwax will accumulate in its inner grille severely enough to significantly compromise bass response. There&#39;s a thread in MacRumors that&#39;s something like 36 pages long acknowledging this. Apple quietly fixed this in version 2 of the APPs (with the MagSafe case).- The mic isn&#39;t as good. The original APs performed extremely well in wind and loud surroundings. I think the downward beam-forming mics were a big part of this. The mic on the APPs perform worse in these scenarios IMO.I&#39;m glad that Apple went back to beam-forming mics.Regardless, I&#39;m thankful for Apple for lighting up the true wireless headphone industry. The APs were a dream come true when they came out; nothing before it compared (and I had $600 custom IEMs that were waterproof and had a control scheme controlled by head nods). The APPs accelerated the creation of noise cancelling true wireless. I&#39;m excited for the next iteration of these products."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Update: 3 hours after posting and being on the hacker news front page:Automated email out of the blue: &#34;We’re pleased to let you know that we’ve recently reviewed your YouTube account, and after taking another look, we can confirm that it is not in violation of our Terms of Service. We have lifted the suspension of your account, and it is once again active and operational.&#34;Thanks hacker news for voting this up and clearly triggering something within the GooglePlex. Still a big -1 for Google/YouTube that their normal processes are completely broken."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem is not the content of the video, crypto or not. The problem is not that YT moderates aggressively (it doesn&#39;t do enough IMHO) or even how it moderates.The problem is that there is no serious appeals process, and no third party oversight of moderation decisions. This is true for all the big platforms.How do we fix that, IDK, but probably at the government level."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Presumably, many Googlers who are directly involved in designing and implementing content moderation are active readers of Hacker News, as is evidenced by the fact that having a story hit the front page is an effective way to solve problems like these.But what I never see is any of those Googlers taking the time to explain why they feel these seemingly-broken approaches are the only ways to solve the problem of moderation at scale. To me, it seems insulting to one&#39;s intelligence to receive an automated message that your channel&#39;s been banned, be given the option to appeal, and to receive an equally automated message rnd() minutes later that your appeal has been denied. But what do I know? I&#39;ve never been tasked with solving such an engineering problem.I know FAANGers here may feel put upon by what appears to be a hostile environment against their companies, but that&#39;s at least in part because you&#39;ve never said exactly which technical and practical challenges lead to this state of affairs. If it&#39;s not against your company&#39;s NDAs, I challenge you all to try; whether the community agrees with you or not, I think we would all learn something useful from a productive discussion about the problem."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; MySQL is a pretty poor database, and you should strongly consider using Postgres instead.Wow, right on the chin with that one.&gt; More jarring were the people who insisted everything was OK (it seems most MySQL users and developers don&#39;t really use other databases)I only have anecdata of my usages of MySQL and Postgres but I swear people that cut their teeth on MySQL and have never used Postgres just don&#39;t know what they are missing.Yes Postgres can be slower out of the box and yes Postgres has worse connection handling that usually requires a pooler but the actual engine and it&#39;s performance makes it worth it in my opinion."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It is incredibly hard to improve something that your user base doesn’t think needs improving. That part really stands out to me.When I first moved to Postgres I was fairly reluctant - my impression was that it was some arbitrary flavour of sql, and since I was used to MySQL (the only sql database I’d ever used) it seemed incredibly unnecessary to bother with. I imagine there are tons of people out there like I was who would rather let things be.Since the first few weeks I don’t think I’ve ever chosen to use MySQL again; Postgres totally changed my career for the better."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I got into programming in 2000 and right when I did Tim Perdue wrote a very important article comparing MySQL and Postgres. He concluded that Postgres was the better database.[edit] Thanks to DocTomoe for finding this:https://phpbuilder.com/mysql-and-postgresql-compared/Some of the discussion of the article survives:https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/39635C4A.1A4486D9%40al...The article was a very big deal at the time, because it was so well researched and so devastating for MySQL.I figured that article was the death knell for MySQL, but then MySQL surprised me by just going and going and going. It was helped along back then by having a very close relationship with the PHP language. Nowadays, you can use any database you want with PHP, but in 2000 PHP was very much biased in favor of MySQL, and every article written about PHP was written with the assumption you&#39;d be using MySQL as the database. I suspect that MySQL would have died except for the massive life support it got from PHP during those years.The moral I take from all of this is that sometimes you can have two technologies, and one is clearly better, yet the one that is clearly better can remain under-utilized for 21 straight years.I know a bunch of HN people will now show up and defend MySQL, or defend a lazy style of programming that accepts defaults even when that means using a poor cousin of something good. But we should stop for a moment and really think about the implications of this. Because it really is remarkable that people have known of the superiority of Postgres for 21 years and yet people still use MySQL."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not just news sites, either.  A lot of fandom wikis run on the same platform, fandom.com.  That site is a pain in the absolute fucking ass to use on any mobile device, specifically because of the autoplaying video that takes up half the screen on every page load.  Weirdly, desktop is fine; no autoplaying videos or any such nonsense.  It&#39;s only on mobile that Fandom has seemingly made a deliberate effort to make the user experience as frustrating as possible.  And not once has the video had even a tangential relationship to the article being viewed.The worst part is that uBlock Origin&#39;s element picker doesn&#39;t work on Firefox for Android (or if it does, I haven&#39;t figured out how to use it), so on the one platform where it&#39;s maximally annoying I can&#39;t do anything to block it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like these are “somebody got a promotion” patterns.Basically, somebody was able to “prove” to Higher-Up Managers that $X number of these videos were “watched” or “engaged with” (or whatever today’s BS lingo is), and therefore the business “benefited” in some way by “reaching” more people.  Profit?In reality, at least in my case, what happens is: (1) I say “WTF!?!?”, (2) I make a mental note to never ever visit the site again, and (3) (sadly) I see it again and again at different sites."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Author here. I forgot to mention:With a Wemos D1 mini (ESP8266) MCU that costs around USD 2.00, you can pretty easily make the Vindriktning WiFi connected and get the data to a backend [1].You just need to solder three wires, and there is enough space within the enclosure to fit the D1 mini inside.This would then allow you to get the exact measurements and to better understand if the &#34;green&#34; is more on the lower end or the higher side.[1] https://github.com/Hypfer/esp8266-vindriktning-particle-sens..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Informative article with fair, fact based, conclusions.I&#39;d like to add that:- The VINDRIKTNING is extremely consumer accessible ($11.99, good build, simple traffic light system).- It may be put into spaces that previously had no particulate air quality monitoring.- The spouse-acceptance-factor is extremely high (unlike e.g. a couple of circuit boards wired together off of Aliexpress).There are other consumer friendly offerings, but they aren&#39;t affordable (e.g. Amazon Smart Air Quality Monitor 4x cost, Airthings 10x cost). That being said, IKEA could fix their traffic-light system&#39;s cut off points for free and should consider it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I would be very careful with this kind of evaluation. There are lots of sensors that perform well vs reference instruments but not in the field.If you want real evaluations, SCAQMD (the folks in charge of air quality for southern california) do evaluations of commercially available, low cost sensors, both against reference instruments and the lab.See http://www.aqmd.gov/aq-spec/evaluationsYou can see what i said is true from the table - lots of sensors that are very well correlated with reference instruments in the lab, but suck horribly in the field.I would think you would be better off submitting the sensor in question to them, and letting them put it through its paces.(They publish within a month of finishing testing, and testing takes ~8 weeks)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’m your age and of similar profession with a known history of doing software development. Having been a nerd since very early age I come to the conclusion that0) I am growing older and I may get more conservative  
1) I used a lot of products that evolved to a local optimum but I see a lot of them being thrown back into a evolutionary state they already passed a decade ago. Maybe to eveolve better, but I have my doubts. 
2) Everything is bloating now. Instead of a collection of good tools interacting I have now 3+ ways of opening an Excel-File someone shared in Teams. All of them are broken and Teams is broken, too.I feel as if the excellent wrenches I have been using for 20+ years are growing tumors in the form of a can opener. All to please people who never used a wrench or a can opener before. And production of the original wrenches is cancelled. Over night.Next time I need a wrench it may be made of felt, because fedoras are en vogue and the mad hatter has to sink venture capital into expanding his business.(Funfact: In German you could make up the very valid and understandable, but still strange word “dosenöffnerförmige Tumore” )"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think there at least 3 things at play here:#1) Software used to live on a disk you buy. That software doesn&#39;t change, until buy a new disk. Then it lived in apps, where you can update or not. Now often, it lives in the mythical cloud where changes can happen all the time.Now, even on the disk front, things were always changing. Often for the better, sometimes for the worse. In the OS world Dos-&gt;Windows-&gt;Windows 95 were big changes, and the OS9-&gt;OSX change also huge! But now the changes are always.#2) The entire software world is built on VC money. VC money is not looking for slow and sustainable growth. Or a happy userbase of 10k people. The VC world doesn&#39;t mind if 99 companies crash and burn trying to harvest the wind while building their sails if one takes off.#3) Out of the VC/startup world, large companies must justify their existence and every team and every programmer on that team must justify theirs. No one ever stuck around by saying &#34;everything is good, we literally don&#39;t need to do anything or acquire another customer, let&#39;s all cut out hours to 2 days a week, keep patching bugs and making security updates, be happy with our current level of subscriptions, and spend a bit of time in R&amp;D to make sure we have other bait in the water too if for some reason our users stop liking this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"IMHO the answer is the tech version of bullshit jobs.You know the concept - jobs that exist just to exist and pay for someone&#39;s living, though they produce nothing of actual value, and it takes effort to actually remove so no one does.With software it goes something like this:1) A  product is built, something that solves a real issue. It&#39;s new, rough around the edges and has only the basic critical features.2) Funding is found and a large team is hired to implement what&#39;s needed and fix all the rough edges.3) The team comes up with good, new ideas that actually improve the product experience for everyone, so in the eyes of management and the investors they have merit.4) After the first 10 good ideas are implemented, the next ideas are... not as helpful, but some users still like them and nobody wants to fire anyone who&#39;s been doing really good work so far.5) Fast forward a couple of years, the team is huge and there is really no headroom to improve the product. Everyone tries to come up with bullshit ideas and force their ideas through, just to have something to show come performance review time. The users stay with their tried and true product, and they&#39;re so invested at this point that a few regressions make them bitter - but not enough to leave.6) Rinse and repeat.I&#39;ve been on that team. The engineers there are often mentally older, comfortable, and smart - or at least were smart.  Many of them are sure what they do is important. But they&#39;re wrong. They now hold bullshit jobs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"To anybody affected by this layoff, my company Placement.com created a Better.com Alumni Job Board [0] to help smooth the transition. We&#39;ve seen over and over how much easier it is to get a job at a company where:1. You have a connection (or can build one easily)2. The company recognizes the companies you previously worked forTargeting companies that ex-colleagues work at is a powerful strategy! So we made this board for everybody affected. Also, if you are interested in talking to a career coach, I&#39;m happy to give a free intro session to everybody affected here. Just email me sean@.The lack of empathy shown in this situation is intense and I hope y&#39;all know that there are amazing companies that will value you more waiting with open arms![0] https://www.placement.com/boards/bettercom-alumni-companies"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know it’s just an anecdote but as a customer I kind of believe this.I just completed a transaction with them that had to be extended beyond the rate lock window. For about 10 days there was a daily back and forth where they asked me to provide some documentation. I would provide the requested documentation and about 12 hours later I would receive a task of uploading the same required documentation.The document was a 50ish page legal document that required someone to look at it. It’s clear nobody was actually spending any effort on it. Even calling my loan officer wasn’t getting me anywhere. It wasn’t until the deadline approached that they called me and wanted to get it all sorted out and they extended my rate lock.The way management handled this looks horrible but if there’s any truth to these employees essentially stealing wages from their employer then they’re lucky they’re just being fired and not being prosecuted."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The funny thing is that krebsonsecurity.com are the ones that published the false information in the first place.Good summary of the whole saga by Crosstalk youtube channel which covers mostly Ubiquiti: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paLm0tP5GbI"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For me a company of their size and, what I would expect, maturity, this new announcement does not satisfy me or provide me much assurance. Consequently I am still happy I have been recommending people against Ubiquiti since the original announcement from Krebs.* Why was it so easy for a lead engineer to get access to a root AWS user without anyone else being notified? I.e. AWS GuardDuty provides FREE alerting for when an AWS root IAM account is logged in or used, this account should be under lock and key and when used, confirmed and audited by relevant persons or teams.Start edit/* Furthermore on the root account being easily accessed, the root account in the companies I&#39;ve worked at had MFA enabled, and the QR code is locked in a safe only accessible by two people agreeing it needs to be accessed in a break glass situation, where warranted./End edit* Why was he also able to delete critical CloudTrail logs and reduce their retention to 1 day? I.e. These logs should be in a S3 bucket or other environment where such changes cannot be made. Alternatively, they should be shipped to a redundant service that manages this risk to prevent data deletion* Why did Ubiquti not announce they were compromised sooner? The hack started in early December, Ubiquiti noticed the compromise on Dec. 28. Ubiquiti told the market on January 11th. Is that a satisfactory turn around? Giving them some credit for the XMas break I&#39;ll say this partially understandable.All the AWS configuration I&#39;m speaking of above, I would describe as Security 101.Most of these settings can be set and managed from AWS Organisations for free, and backed up with alarming and alerts for Guard Duty trivially. That a company of Ubiquiti&#39;s size and maturity had such basic risks not managed is still a concern.I understand AWS Organisations can be difficult to set up for legacy AWS accounts, but even with that said, setting the alarms and monitoring up that would help manage the risk associated to the questions above is not difficult and should have been in place.That Ubiqitui would only find relief ultimately from the developers poor OpSec rather than Ubiquiti&#39;s own security policies and procedures provides a commending perspective of their internal security posture."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Investigators say they were able to tie the downloads to Sharp and his work-issued laptop because his Internet connection briefly failed on several occasions while he was downloading the Ubiquiti data. Those outages were enough to prevent Sharp’s Surfshark VPN connection from functioning properly — thus exposing his Internet address as the source of the downloads.Not the first time I’ve read about a VPN unable to mask someone’s ip when they were on a wonky connection."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"WebAssembly is kind of a hack here (although a clever hack that saves a lot of effort) - the essence of what the Mozilla folks have done isn&#39;t WebAssembly, it&#39;s a trusted compiler - by which I mean a compiler that emits trustable code, regardless of how untrusted the source is. It&#39;s a really neat idea that I hope to see more adoption of, because our current security models for software suck.Security based on process isolation is extremely inefficient and coarse-grained - having a trusted compiler could (eventually) massively increase performance by removing processes entirely (no more virtual memory! no more TLB flushes and misses! less task switch overhead!) and eliminating the kernel/user mode separation, with an increase in security.&#34;Could&#34; because it&#39;s not clear to me if the reduction in expressiveness from our languages now to future languages with a theoretical trusted compiler (all jump targets have to be known at compile-time?) will be accepted by the majority of the populace. Look at how hard it is to get people to accept borrow-checkers..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This sandboxing is achieved via RLBox[0], which is a toolkit for sandboxing third-party libraries. It comprises of a WASM sandbox and an API which existing application can leverage. The research paper[1].[0]: https://plsyssec.github.io/rlbox_sandboxing_api/sphinx/[1]: https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.00572"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So if I&#39;m understanding this correctly, Firefox compiles its dependencies as WASM, effectively blocking function calls to things it shouldn&#39;t and illegal memory access, and then translates it back to C so it can compile it normally? Sounds neat!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Something very similar happened to me with Amazon. I used a new debit card from an online bank to purchase an expensive item and deliver it to a foreign address (which is admittedly suspicious). The payment bounced, Amazon immediately locked my account and requested to see a card billing statement sent to my home address to reactivate it. Upon login I am presented with a stern request for documentation, a pdf upload field, a tweet-sized text field for comments, and all communication comes from a noreply@amazon.com address. All my kindle/audible/etc media immediately became inaccessible.I went through every possible channel to explain that the card does not send me a billing statement and I cannot possibly produce one, requesting to be called or at least emailed by a human, to no avail. After spending tens of thousands of dollars on Amazon over the course of fifteen years I couldn&#39;t even get a personal call from the case manager, and all my purchased media is gone.To this day I have found no resolution, and the only next step is to contact them through a lawyer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of people in this thread talking about losing their store credit and app/content purchases. I&#39;d imagine the worst case scenario could be much worse.  Apple runs fairly popular cloud storage services that are strongly encouraged to you for your photo storage and files.  The photo storage especially has an option to automatically delete your local media because it&#39;s already backed up on Apple&#39;s servers.  Will these all be locked out without warning or recourse for a miscellaneous card whoopsie?Even standard files on iCloud.  Who knows how important the average users&#39; cloud files are to them?  (I don&#39;t use public cloud storage at all anymore because of this exact fear - what if some arbitrary billing/transaction error locks me out of everything without recourse?).To be fair I&#39;ve no idea what the person in question got their account locked for and if there was any shadiness involved but I doubt they&#39;d write about it publicly (or get access restored) if there were, which implies that at any time your account and your data can be taken away for something entirely mundane.It makes me really concerned in fact how Google would handle something similar to this - given that for Chromebook users everything (literally EVERYTHING you would normally do locally on a computer) is in/via your Google account."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Every company (Apple, Google, Amazon, etc) is guilty of pulling this non-sense on customers. It is too easy for them to wipe out thousands of dollars of value with no meaningful explanation (read the Terms and Services and go away? seriously Apple?) and no accountability.IMO, states should enact laws where you can take the company to court in your local county and no contract can override that right. If the termination is found justified, the company must refund all account assets at fair market value and any remaining balance. If it was not justified, the company must reinstate the account, pay all court and legal fees, and a reasonable amount of mandatory punitive damages.Also, I don&#39;t get why Apple et al pull these stunts anyways. They already have a huge &#34;regulate me&#34; post it on their back."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Many years ago I had a job offer at Badoo in the UK. After many rounds of going back-and-forth with the contract, me trying to better understand certain clauses, them going back to the lawyers, etc. I told them I&#39;d be happy to sign if they removed the caluses that stated pretty much anything I created on or off hours belonged to them.They went back to the lawyers and came back to me saying that this is not the first time this has been brought up, that the contract was standard across the org and was originally written for managerial types and C-suites, and that the company had never even considered taking over an employee&#39;s off-hours work, open source or otherwise.I said good, then it should not be a problem to remove the clause. They said they would have another discussion and would really like it for me to join. I said great, then once you issue me a contract with that clause I&#39;ll be happy to join, assuming I hadn&#39;t found something else.They never came back to me. For years I wondered if anything had actually changed. Reading this tweet I&#39;m glad I declined."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked for a company once that had this sort of &#34;we own everything&#34; IP clause. They tried to get me to sign it after I had already started. I crossed out that part, initialed the change, and sent it back unsigned. Ended up going back and forth a few times, and then it got dropped behind a desk or something and we all forgot about it. Not surprisingly, I suppose, that company turned out to be a bit of a mess for other reasons. When I went to leave several months later, I got a note from the CFO&#39;s admin.&#34;We don&#39;t seem to have a copy of your employee agreement on file. Could you please sign the attached copy and return it?&#34;Haha, no. What are they going to do, fire me? I went down and explained the situation to her, and we had a good laugh. Never did sign. All of the company&#39;s own IP turned out to be worthless BTW, and they were lucky they didn&#39;t get sued for misappropriating IP from the CTO&#39;s previous employer (DEC). Companies doing this is a huge red flag not only because of its grasping nature but because it often reveals a general kind of awfulness among its principals and/or backers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The new worldgen is incredible, both above and below the surface. Hats off to everyone at Mojang that worked on this!One of my favorite game memories of all time was the first time I played Minecraft during the alpha days and immediately got lost in the world. For me, going into a 1.18 world and finding a giant mountain chain and then finding a cave on the peak of the mountain that falls all the way into a giant underground ocean at the bottom of the world in a huge cavern complete with underground vegetation… it brought me right back to that sense of exploration and wonder that I remember from the very first time I played Minecraft.Also, I found this datapack (sort of like a mod but doesn’t require patching the game since the game natively supports loading datapack files) called Terralith [1] that extends the 1.18 worldgen with even more cool stuff. Wandering around the new 1.18-style mountains is incredible, and then stumbling across something the resembles Yellowstone National Park added by Terralith is even more incredible. It’s worth a try if you like just wandering around in Minecraft marveling at the scenery.[1] https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/terralith-overworl..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Man. I really do want to like it, but this update is the first one that gives me the Microsoft-finally-took-over vibes. Traversal and with that exploration just became so much harder. The landscape is now riddled with holes that you either build scraggly bridges over, or lead to massive detours. The sides of bodies of water are much higher and steeper on average, making it impossible to see the landscape you&#39;re passing, and getting up there to take a look is tedious.So you&#39;re basically stuck near spawn unless you want to spend much more time getting around.A lot of surface iron was replaced with copper, which is useless, meaning progress is now slower than ever, and grinding becomes even more of a necessity. Generally, many of the items that now clutter the inventory are mostly useless, and the inventory needs constant attention.Minecraft is a fantastic game that I have spent well over a thousand hours on over the last decade, with many more to come very likely. That being said, with the account transition to Microsoft/Xbox and this update that gives me personally the &#34;Microsoft knows whats best for its users&#34; vibes that I still distinctly remember from WLM and Skype, I am definitely less optimistic about the game&#39;s future than I was a few years ago. I do hope my caution proves to be unwarranted."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you like voxel world generation, I strongly advise you to check out Veloren[1], it has a much much deeper worldgen that what Minecraft offers.[1]: https://veloren.net/ the game is still under development but it has been playable for more than a year now."</p>

Five new facilties per state?

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There was a comment on the recent Blender 3.0 thread posted here wondering why there isn&#39;t an equivalent program for audio. This looks very polished and much more approachable compared to Ardour or LMMS, and seems like a good candidate. But one feature I really wish my dream &#34;Blender for audio&#34; had would be the convenient device view that Ableton and Bitwig offer for working quickly with effects. It&#39;s so much faster than the type of effect chains offered by DAWs like FL and makes it fun to mess around and experiment with effects-based synthesis. Looking at the screenshots and videos it looks like Zrythm doesn&#39;t have this feature, although I understand how tedious it would be to implement because you would essentially have to write your own effects or create wrappers around others to expose an interface that can fit in a device view. Probably not high on the list of priorities for a work in progress DAW"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Looks nice, particularly the piano roll.Do any Free DAWs have Ableton-like VST &#34;hiding&#34;? I can&#39;t leave Ableton because of how insane window management gets on complex projects when 10 different VSTs are all fighting for screen space. Even the screenshots for this app look chaotic from all of the VSTs covering the screen at the same time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not the only approach that&#39;s possible. There&#39;s quite a few lifts in France that pull a similar trick, but with only one cable.They solve the problem by having the bar below the clamp be a flexible section, as the bar approaches the turn, a section a static rails forces the bar to rotate 30-40 deg around the cable, moving the protruding part of the clamp out of the horizontal plane. Then the cable passes around a large diameter wheel, also 30-40 from vertical, to create the turn.Because both the bar and the wheel are both 30-40 degrees from vertical, the wheel meets the top of clamp, rather than the side, but cable can still make a turn in the horizontal plane. They&#39;re a little uncomfortable for the rider, because the bar you holding onto gets jerked left and right, but you make around the bend just fine, and without an elaborate 2 wire system.I think the Chardonnet ski lift at  Val d&#39;Isère is an example of this type of lift, but I can&#39;t find any photos of the corner unfortunately.For chair lifts, the lift at Ski Dubai has turn half way up, and their chairs are permanently clamped to the cable. For going up the chair just goes around the outside of normal wheel. For going down, to passes around an elaborate wheel with cutouts to make space for the chair clamp and bar. The running surface of this wheel is made up of smaller rollers, and there&#39;s a big friction break on hub. So a computer watches for incoming chairs, then slows the big wheel down as needed to align the chair with a cut out. You can catch a glimpse of this here (best video I could find)[2].[2] https://youtu.be/M7ghP4YTk3M?t=204"</p>

Near the turning point they put up a warning sign like &#34;please hold tight or you might be thrown off&#34;. As a kid I always enjoyed the experience though. Sadly all of them have been torn down by about a decade ago, due to its high maintenance cost.cf. http://cable.cocolog-nifty.com/sakudo/2006/02/post_d5e1.html"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I worked at WhatsApp between 2011 and 2019. This FAQ had very specific instructions for how to opt out of sharing that were only available for a limited amount of time. The FAQ serves as documentation of the product and there&#39;s no need to keep online specific instructions that can no longer be followed.In order to opt out, you needed to have an existing account and take specific actions around the time you agreed to the 2016 new terms of service. Based on the internet archive, this article was removed after April 20, 2018, and before May 5, 2018. When it was most likely obsolete (I don&#39;t recall the specific deadlines for accepting the 2016 TOS)On the plus side, the various terms of services are all available without digging in the internet archive https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/terms-of-service/revisions"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Instead of arguing how bad WhatsApp is in terms of privacy, people would be better off by switching to more privacy respecting alternatives such as Telegram or Signal.I know it&#39;s hard to switch if most of your friends are on WhatsApp, but you can talk to them and switch together."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Old habits and mindsets never seem to change despite corporate pronouncements and PR puff pieces written by stenographers. The regulators (and legislators) are either the biggest dupes, or much more likely in on it.Let’s not forget the FTC hookup for Netflix by Obama and the eventual payout when he left office.Or Ajit Pai who came from Verizon to run the FTC and undid the Obama era changes favorable to Netflix and inimical to Verizon.——-I hardly see any of these events as triggers for the mass migration to apps like Signal. The network effects seem impregnable for now."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s worth noting that dig (and host) bypass the normal DNS resolution mechanism used by most programs on the host. i.e. These tools aren&#39;t using getaddrinfo/gethostbyname.Sometimes, I want to see the results from getaddrinfo, which are impacted by caching on the host itself and/or OS-specific configuration settings that dig and host know nothing about. (scutil --dns on macOS, systemd-resolvedand nscd on Linux, etc.)In that case, I usually use ping. e.g., waiting for a DNS change to propagate to a host, I might use:    while :; do ping -c 1 hostname; sleep 1; done"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Dig is great and DNS is hella underrated. It seems like not nearly enough folks know how to wield it. At both $lastco and $thisco people just used a mess of configuration to point to service IPs/URIs. I showed them how to set private zones and records for both A and SRV and suddenly everything is just using sane defaults.Side note: does anyone know why dig&#39;s output is so...eye-bleeding? Why does it show so much info by default? +short should be the default. Why the ;; &#34;comment&#34; prefix?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; By the way: if you’ve ever wondered what IN means, it’s the “query class” and stands for “internet”. It’s basically just a relic from the 80s and 90s when there were other networks competing with the internet like “chaosnet”.Reading things like this makes me feel better about the relics in my code that aren&#39;t really hurting anything but would take work to remove."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This comes up every year so I ask a question:If you could fix copyright, how would you do it?Here is what I would do:1.  All works must be registered in a government registry.If it&#39;s not in there it&#39;s not copyrighted.  If you want to register a work from before the law passes, you have to prove you own it under the current system.  This would solve the orphan works problem -- if no one can prove they own it, it becomes public domain.  Basically, ownership should be recorded like actual property with a proper chain of title.  It would be published on a public ledger.2. You must renew your registration every three years.  The fee for renewal will be X% of the revenue from the work, where X = years since first registration - 5 (edit: With a minimum fee of $100 to discourage hoarding useless IP).  First renewal is at 8 years.  Your registration fee would be recorded on the public ledger.If you want to continue to derive benefit from your work you have to pay for the privilege.  After 105 years it will obviously no longer be worth it, but probably long before that.  This would be reported like income taxes -- you self report your profits but if the government thinks you&#39;re cheating, they can audit you.  If you have multiple works in one product (think Marvel movies) then all revenue goes to the oldest work (that way you can&#39;t avoid the fee by putting new and old characters together).If you don&#39;t renew, the work goes to the public domain.How would you fix copyright?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t think they even tried to read the ISA spec documents. If they did, they would have found that the rationale for most of these decisions is solid: Evidence was considered, all the factors were weighted, and decisions were made accordingly.But ultimately, the gist of their argument is this:&gt;Any task will require more Risc V instructions that any contemporary instruction set.Which is easy to verify as utter nonsense. There&#39;s not even a need to look at the research, which shows RISC-V as the clear winner in code density. It is enough to grab any Linux distribution that supports RISC-V and look at the size of the binaries across architectures."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"RISC V is an opinionated architecture and that is always going to get some people fired up. Any technology that aims for simplicity has to make hard choices and trade offs. It isn’t hard to complain about missing instructions when there are less than 100 of them. Meanwhile nobody will complain about ARM64 missing instructions because it had about 1000 of them.Therein lies the problem. Nobody ever goes out guns blazing complaining about too many instructions despite the fact that complexity has its own downsides.RISC-V has been designed aggressively to have minimal ISA to leave plenty of room to grow, and require minimal number of transistors for a minimal solution.Should this be a showstopper down the road, then there will be plenty of space to add an extensions that fixes this problem. Meanwhile embedded systems paying a premium for transistors are not going to have to pay for these extra instructions as only 47 instructions have to be implemented in a minimal solution."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So this is one tiny corner of the ISA, not something that makes ALL instruction sequences longer - essentially RISCV has no condition codes (they&#39;re a bit of an  architectural nightmare for everyone doing any more than the simplest CPUs, they make every instruction potentially have dependencies or anti-dependencies with every other).It&#39;s a trade off - and the one that&#39;s been made is one that makes it possible to make ALL instructions a little faster at the expense of one particular case that isn&#39;t used much - that&#39;s how you do computer architecture, you look at the whole, not just one particular caseRISCV also specifies a 128-bit variant that is of course FASTER than these examples"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have used Apache Guacamole to access running GitHub Actions workflows as remote desktops. It worked super well for testing GUI apps on other operating systems that I didn&#39;t want to deal with setting up.It&#39;s also nice if you want to run a GUI application in someone else&#39;s sandbox.https://github.com/jstrieb/ctf-collab/blob/9300c57364f71fe29..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We adopted Guacamole for access to some of our Windows server production environments; the great thing about it is you can put your corporate SSO / authorization model into a web app to control access and not have to disclose credentials to service accounts to developers. You can also tap off a feed from the guacd that represents a complete screen recording and save it for audit trail purposes.The only issue we&#39;ve had is that FreeRDP (that underlies it for connectivity to Window servers) is a bit fussier than the native RDP environment, or at least we&#39;ve had challenges getting equivalent compatibility across old/odd Windows configurations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Using it mainly because of the paranoia of just exposing RDP to the internet. Http(s) is very convenient to add more layers of security, in my case via NGINX (both as LXC containers in Proxmox). I&#39;m using a wildcard domain *.myhome.tld pointed to my static IP. Guacamole is hosted at try_guess_me.myhome.tld, with NGINX basic auth same for all subdomains (further protected by fail2ban). So in total 3 tokens are required (subdomain and basic auth username and password) just to get to the Guacamole login page, where additional username/password + 2FA are required. I used to expose RDP directly for years, but after a chat with a colleague before vacations and a purchase of a NUC for a homelab server decided to strengthen the security slightly.RDP is still much better user experience, so once when I needed a longer session I used Guacamole to access my router admin interface and temporarily expose RDP directly via a random port and a very strong password. I&#39;m still not convinced that the latter combination is not enough, but it&#39;s better to be safe than sorry."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a terrible description of what the law actually does.  Let&#39;s shine some light on the FUD.  The law, H.R. 3684 (as enrolled), defines an &#34;advanced drunk and impaired driving prevention technology&#34; as a system which can do /one/ of the following:1. &#34;passively monitor the performance of a driver... to accurately identify whether that driver may be impaired... and prevent or limit [car] operation if an impairment is detected.&#34;2. &#34;passively and accurately&#34; detect whether someone&#39;s BAC exceeds the Federal limit, and prevent or limit car operation if it&#39;s detected.3. Both.This will apply only after the DOT finalizes a rule describing what all those things actually mean in terms of manufacture.  The law requires that the Secretary publish this rule within the next three years, unless they think it can&#39;t be done, in which case they can push it out another three years.  That rule must give car manufactures at least another two years to implement the requirement.  It also gives the DOT an out to say that it can&#39;t be done, in which case in 2031, they need to write a report to Congress to say why it can&#39;t be done.In software terms, this is a user story that was just submitted for development.  It&#39;s Congress asking the executive branch to do some work, but not actually forcing them to do so."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find the way American law-making is done to be fascinating. As far as I can tell the US is the only country on Earth where politicians are able to &#34;bundle&#34; completely unrelated things into a single piece of legislation. It definitely doesn&#39;t happen here in the UK in any substantial way (laws get amendments added on but they&#39;re always at least somewhat related to the main part), and I&#39;ve never heard of it anywhere else in the world.It&#39;s a truly interesting thing to read about from a negotiation perspective, but it must make the process of actually getting things done in politics really hard."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A couple quotes from the article that stood out to me:&#34;More pressing than the privacy concerns, though, are the safety issues. Including an automatic kill switch of this sort in a machine with internet access presents the obvious scenario that a malicious agent could disable your vehicle remotely with no warning.&#34;and also:&#34;...by 2026, vehicles sold in the US will be required to automatically and silently record various metrics of driver performance, and then make a decision, absent any human oversight, whether the owner will be allowed to use their own vehicle. Even worse, the measure goes on to require that the system be &#34;open&#34; to remote access by &#34;authorized&#34; third parties at any time.&#34;What could go wrong..."</p>

&#34;Ok so this just happened. Buckle up.About a month ago my wife broke her pixel phone. It couldn&#39;t be turned on so we couldn&#39;t wipe it.We contact Google and used the device care to get an RMA.Today someone posted nude pictures of my wife and I to her social media accounts. They accessed her Google account and tried to lock us out. They used her PayPal to send someone $5 (a test probably).How could this happen? Well Facebook and Instagram show logins from Texas. The old phone still showed on our find my phone app and it was in Texas. Guess where we sent the phone for RMA? The last ping from the old phone (which was today) was the same as the place we shipped it. The exact location down to the very building. Clearly they fixed the old phone and since it wasn&#39;t wiped, was still logged into her Google account.I called Google and they basically said &#34;woah that&#39;s fucked up we&#39;ll get back to you&#34;. We filed a police report but I don&#39;t expect they will do anything.What are my options here for sueing Google? I know that sounds insane but this breach of trust and privacy is egregious. Hundreds of people have now seen my penis including our friends kids. It&#39;s really fucked up.Any advice on what to do here?&#34;my big question is whether this phone is password enabled.  also this stinks because i know the first comment is &#34;well do a factory reset&#34; but if the phone doesn&#39;t turn on, etc. then i don&#39;t believe that is possible (short of possibly ADP which is out of the reach of 99% of people)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We did a write-up on the tech stack and some of the approaches we considered for sharing code between our Platform and the Self-Hosted versions here: https://supabase.com/blog/2021/11/30/supabase-studioWe aim to get these to parity with each other, excepting some billing/server management features.A big shout out to Sentry who do served as a good model for us (https://develop.sentry.dev/sentry-vs-getsentry/)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Been using Supabase for a while and love it. It’s got that feel of a really well thought out service where things just work how you’d want it to and new features arrive that you actually want and make life easier. It’s one of a handful of companies I saw and immediately wished I could invest in.This announcement doesn’t really matter to me since I really like having a hosted service. But it’s good to know it’s future proof - ie if Supabase go out of business or a project takes off and I want to self host with all the good stuff then I can."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Been using SupaBase for a couple of months now on a side project and it’s very nice. I’ve used Firebase extensively and it’s so nice to have a similar offering using SQL for the DB layer. Good to see them sticking to the open source ethos."</p>

People who realize something is wrong have no forum to air their concerns."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I see this kind of thing happening all the time, facilitated by third parties.For example, a few months ago I found this funny video of some trombonists playing Bruchner in unusual situations[1] that had been uploaded on 14th September 2015 and noticed it had an obviously-bogus copyright claim for the music (&#34;Song: Calling You (Live), Artist: FUN, Licensed to YouTube by (on behalf of FUN); Songtrust, Sony ATV Publishing, and 2 music rights societies&#34;), with a link to where this bogus &#34;song&#34; had been uploaded[2].The &#34;song&#34; proved to be a video consisting of the original trombone video&#39;s soundtrack played twice, over an unrelated static image, that had been uploaded on 13th May 2021—six years after the video it was ripping off.There was enough information on the &#34;song&#34; video to find out that it had been supplied to YouTube by a company called TuneCore[3] who according to their website offer to &#34;SELL YOUR MUSIC WORLDWIDE: Get your music on Spotify, iTunes/Apple Music, Tidal, Amazon Music, TikTok, Tencent &amp; more&#34;.I contacted TuneCore in July to point out that their service was being abused, but got a semi-automated reply to the effect that unless it was _my_ copyright that was being infringed they weren&#39;t interested.  I replied, and also responded to their automated did-Jira-help-you-today survey, in both cases pointing out that they were (however inadvertently) involved in fraudulent activity but (unsurprisingly) never heard back.I see now that the TuneCore &#39;song&#39; video has been made private, but the original trombone video still carries the false copyright claim.So frustrating.[1] https://youtu.be/rY0m2cLH1m8[2] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-577Wp8yBQ - now private[3] https://www.tunecore.com/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Maybe worthy of its own post but there&#39;s another kind of overt scammer on Youtube. It goes like this:They find some technically hip, well known content and create a new channel with a very similar name as the originator. Create an exciting full screen ad for a crypto currency faucet scam, with price charts and crawls. &#34;Live&#34; stream the original content inset into the ad.Here&#39;s one example: https://cryptoplayboys.blogspot.com/2021/11/spacex-scam-live...Even if you report these things, they don&#39;t get removed very quickly. They&#39;re getting tons of views so why would YT care? The original content holder would care about being associated with them and should sue for defamation though."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the strategies that changed my sleep quality for the better is to stop taking coffee after 9 AM; after learning that caffeine has a half-life of around 6-7 hours[0], but a quarter-life of around 12 hours. If you have a cup of coffee at noon, a quarter of that caffeine can still be circulating around your brain at midnight.[0] https://youtu.be/k5BMGmf1ai0"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; A 20-minute nap provides an energy boost comparable with a cup of strong coffee (without the later crash).This is not true for me. If I get a 20-minute nap in the middle of the day, I wake up wasted. It takes around another 20 minutes for me to get really awaken."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Josef Pieper[0] has written about leisure at length. What we call &#34;rest&#34; today is largely either idleness or recreation and something meant only to &#34;recharge us&#34; so that we can continue to work. But this is ass-backwards and not leisure. Leisure is what we work for and this was reflected, among other things, in the medieval culture of religious feasts. Our modern culture is a work-centric culture, but the middle ages were more of a leisure-centric culture.To better understand what leisure is, Pieper points to the etymological roots of words like &#34;school&#34; (from the Greek word for &#34;leisure&#34;) and points to the distinction between the liberal arts and the servile arts (the former are superior to the latter and what the latter exist to enable). By definition, work is for the sake of something; you don&#39;t work for work&#39;s sake. Our culture either worships work for its own sake (an absurdity and largely a neurotic distraction from our own nihilism) or it terminates with a preoccupation with consumption and indulgence of various appetites. A culture frustrated by a false materialistic/mechanistic anthropology will produce this kind of vulgar ethos.[0] https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/767958.Leisure"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have been a professional artist for about twenty years and it is my considered opinion that any &#34;rule&#34; given out to beginners is actually a warning: violate this rule and making something that looks good becomes a lot harder, so you should probably better make sure you&#39;re not violating any other &#34;rules&#34; unknowingly.If you know damn well that you&#39;re violating multiple rules then sure, go for it - break your perspective, fill the drawing with tangents, shade with black, etc, break the fuck out of these rules, and you can end up with something pretty good. You have to know your shit backwards and forwards to really pull this off; go look at how solid Picasso&#39;s pre-Cubist stuff was, for instance.There are good reasons to choose to use black and there are good reasons to avoid using it; this article talks about several. IIRC, one of the reasons painting teachers traditionally like to tell you to avoid it is because most commonly available black pigments can very quickly ruin the saturation of any other color you mix it with, ending up with unpleasantly grey shadows. But if you do more graphic work that treats each color as a largely separate entity then a lot of solid black can make stuff positively glow."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"#000 on my screen isn&#39;t going to be pure black either.  There&#39;s ambient light, the black level on the monitor, etc.  Several of the examples of saturated grays in this article are low-contrast UI that&#39;s hard to read.  Please don&#39;t do that.&#34;Words on web pages aren&#39;t black&#34;.  But they should be #000 or close to it.  Let the user&#39;s screen and environment determine the rest.Interfaces are artificial constructs designed to be as readable and understandable as possible.  Looking at the color of shadows and physically dark things is unhelpful for designing readable interfaces with sufficient contrast."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a design background and have written a lot of CSS, and I have opinions so just interpret this all as a personal preference if you want.* It&#39;s basic floor/ceiling stuff. Once you go #000000, you can&#39;t go any darker. Are you 100% sure the thing you&#39;re making #000000 is the absolute darkest thing on your site/app you&#39;ll ever need to declare?* Conversely, never use white! Modern macOS sucks at this! A large window of Mail.app in light mode is pretty blinding. What if you want to add a subtle highlight to a button border on a white background? #fafafa was always a go-to white for me because its easy to remember.* Shadows are really never black and your CSS shadows will look better if you don&#39;t default to black. Toggle &#39;tint shadows&#39; on the _excellent_ css shadow palette generator: https://www.joshwcomeau.com/shadow-palette/. Play with background colors, you&#39;ll see.* Your design will never please everyone, especially anything close to a majority on certain tech news aggregators."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I had an algorithms class (6.006 or 046?) with Silvio Micali, who I learned partway through the semester was one of the first authors about these things.Anyway, he was a great professor. When talking through algorithms, he&#39;d always start with say, an n^4 solution. Then cut it down to n^3, call on people to help out, etc. I remember it being something like this (in an Italian accent that we really enjoyed)&#34;And now we&#39;re at n^2! Pretty good you might think eh? After all, we were at n^4 just a few minutes ago, this is much better? But, the human mind is a wonderful thing! It is so creative and some people thought about it, and they got n log n! Amazing. I know you are thinking, n log n is always as good as it gets in this class. Well I don&#39;t want to go into the details because, it is horrifying! But actually some people, they did even better! And you know as I said, the human mind is amazing! So maybe one day, you will do even better.&#34;Also I sat across the aisle from him when Eliezer Yudkowsky came for a talk and only realized it when he answered a question EY asked the audience.This kind of turned into me reminiscing but my point is, the guy who put these out there and did a lot of work on them is a great undergrad professor and that makes me happy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not an expert, but coming from a logic background, I always think that ZK proofs are fudging the idea of &#34;completeness&#34; (and &#34;soundness,&#34; for that matter). For example, in [1] (Definition 1.1):&gt; We note that the constants 2/3 and 1/3 are arbitrarily chosen for simplicity. We can always amplify the completeness probability to 1 − negl(λ) and the soundness probability to negl(λ) with repetition.But that&#39;s not completeness in the metamathematical sense. That&#39;s a statistical boundary on what it takes to &#34;convince&#34; someone (or &#34;gain knowledge&#34;). But that&#39;s a stochastic redefinition of a pretty hard-line property of proof systems. In other words, you could theoretically have no knowledge and just get astronomically lucky to an arbitrary degree (whatever degree it would take to cross that proof threshold).[1] https://crypto.stanford.edu/cs355/18sp/lec3.pdf"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A while back I came up with a third ZK Where&#39;s Waldo protocol [1] that avoids the need to watermark the page or search Alice for contraband, and also has the (usually desirable) property that it&#39;s only convincing to Bob.You instead have Bob randomly choose whether Alice must a) pull off the screen, revealing the original page, or b) punch a hole through to Waldo, but not both. Then you can do any number of rounds of this, with Alice putting the page in a random position each time.It&#39;s only convincing to Bob because bystanders (or rather, anyone not part of the random number generation for which challenge to use) can&#39;t rule out the possibility that they conspired to have Bob always pick the challenge that a faker Alice could solve. (Show the original page when the uses the real one, punch a hole when she uses a fake page.)[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15323790Edit: That original comment gives the &#34;magic formula&#34; for coming up with such ZKPs as well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; NSO Group said in a statement on Thursday that it did not have any indication their tools were used but canceled the relevant accounts and would investigate based on the Reuters inquiry.Why would they cancel accounts without knowledge of wrongdoing?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Arguably, this is the real use case Pegasus was designed for. A government (Uganda) that does not have a large and mature civil service that would support a G7 level technical domestic intelligence agency went to market for the tools of one (NSO), so they can keep tabs on foreign intelligence agents (state department staff) in their country. I am not a fan of NSO at all, but this case sounds like they&#39;re providing sovereignty or statecraft as a service to a government that prefers to buy instead of build their security capability.When the game is defined as a competition for how to break its rules in the most unexpected ways and with the fewest consequences, Uganda appears to have joined in with aplomb. To me it&#39;s the first time an NSO story doesn&#39;t seem like a scandal."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One thing I, personally, find very interesting is that a lot of wording from the coalition contract on this and related matters is apparently taken from or at least based on [0] a document [1] released by the CCC for that very purpose. I haven&#39;t personally carefully verified this to be true, but I have no reason to distrust the linked report.[0] https://blog.fefe.de/?ts=9f60b12e[1] https://www.ccc.de/de/updates/2021/ccc-formulierungshilfe-re...(both in German)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this is all fine and dandy until the new Innenminister is starting his or her work early next year.They will project the concerns of the civil service and somehow carve out enough special regulations that will all but hollow out any such rights.I really want to believe that the majority of the coalition parties believe that they are saying, but that&#39;s not how politics are made or put into practice.E.g., after Zimmermann, there was great hope that Germany would be a lot less conservative in it&#39;s interior policy, but following interior ministries have not really become much less conservative.Here&#39;s to hope, though - Cheers."</p>

No to mention that my work or hobbies don&#39;t often interface with 3D modeling.So I have been thinking about what makes this project so special. I think it&#39;s the fact that the community owns it. So you don&#39;t have to ask for permission to do anything. Mix that with inherently creative people who approach the tool and you get:AI-generated Kanye West rap teaching you how the modifiers work - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7Nn5Uilso0"</p>

Unreal&#39;s built-in modeling tools are usually enough for my purposes so I rarely open Blender, but when I do, I am so appreciative that this software exists and is free to use.It&#39;s incredible how far Blender has come. I remember the days when time between significant releases was measured in years, not months. The progress they&#39;ve made in recent years — particularly since Epic Games gave them a $1.2 million Epic MegaGrant — has been impressive, and encouraging to watch.Thank you to all who fund Blender, and thank you especially to the people who make it.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There is a Frankfurt-based toy store owner who has been very vocal on Youtube about the quality and value problems in recent Lego sets. Lego has sued him multiple times but Streisand effect set in and he has gained a large audience.If anybody who understands German langauge is up for some great irony from a charismatic toy professional on this topic, you should have a look.WARNING: You will waste some hours on this..  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9OKWm_x2RI&amp;t=1504s"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I saw a term in the comments: AFOL. I had to look it up: Adult Fan Of Legos.I loved legos as a kid and would spend hours building stuff. Now the kits seem more like models to be assembled and put on display and not touched rather than “a paint brush of blocks” where I can use my imagination. It lost my interest. My attention is now on software where I feel I can build anything. I liken it to my lego experience as a child.I don’t necessarily think there’s a right or wrong thing here. It’s interesting to note how our mind changes as we age and grow older. The ”do anything” mentality get displaced with something else. This would make for an interesting PhD topic. :)I found another quote from a related article that captured this feeling.    “It’s like a blast to the past, straight to our childhoods,” said Deason, 40, who lives in Connellsville, Pa. “It took me by surprise, but it makes sense: Life is so structured. But with Lego, you can do anything.”

    Deason has a few million Lego pieces, which she organizes by type and color. The Star Wars and Architecture sets, she says, are the most popular among adults, who almost always look for the instruction manuals.

    “The younger kids come in and it’s all about their imaginations — playing pretend, building zombie towns,” she said. “But at some point that gets lost. The adults seem to value the final finished project. That’s where they get their satisfaction.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d say someone earned a free AT-AT for the bug report.On the one hand that&#39;s a minor quibbling little problem there, &#34;I have to use tools on this one part when disassembling it&#34;, and then the dearth of such problems during their run is an amazing testament to their engineering process. That they have fans that can catch this issue and explain it so well is another testament to the standards they&#39;ve maintained.Can we call &#34;lego instructions&#34; an example of software design? I think we must. Programs designed to run on meat CPUs of unknown specs."</p>

Once the door is open for censorship, it all works just like lies do, and it&#39;s often associated with lies and or hurt egos, say lack of acceptance and respect, and it tends to spread, until it&#39;s ridiculous.And let&#39;s get real here:  This whole mess is because the government and big media don&#39;t like being near constantly ratioed.They do have the option of improving how they work and what they say, but maybe they feel it is easier to just try and hide the problems.  People went away from broadcast because of this crap, and reproducing it online means people will go somewhere else again.What it won&#39;t do is transform things into being reputable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The majority of YouTube traffic comes from mobile devices (this can be observed in Google Ads for any video campaign), which is losing market share because of Tictoc.Google will do whatever it takes to monetize every inch of their investment. By turning off dislikes, users will be forced to engage with additional content.This is also visible on the other side of the spectrum - Google is pushing heavily integrated campaign products (e.g. Performance Max Campaigns), which include non-performing channels as display and video (in comparison to search), which can&#39;t be turned off.At this point they can, as they are a monopoly, but I hope they will get burned, as they are introducing more and more dark patterns, which result in lower than poor user experience.My take on this - AdBlock relentlessly, support creators directly. Switch platforms eventually - there&#39;s choice out there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hacker News has a similar problem with comments:  net_votes = up_votes - down_votes

You need at least two of the above variables to get an idea of both the direction and magnitude of the voting. Hacker News provides only one: net_votes. YouTube used to provide up_votes and down_votes, effectively providing all three. Now YouTube has reduced its information to up_votes, so they&#39;re now down to one variable in the equation, as Hacker News has been all along.The difference between 102+/100- votes and 2+/0- votes is large, but invisible on this site. I think it would be better for HN to go to where YouTube was, giving us an idea of both the net vote and the level of activity. Like up/down or up/total or net/total."</p>

Google how to fix something and their docs are missing, outdated, and often in broken english.The screen itself is big but slow to refresh and in most modes leaves traces of the previous pages. They have a manual button to full refresh the page, but a user shouldn’t have to do that.It’s not a certified android device so you have to jump through a bunch of somewhat insecure hoops to get the play store installed and log in.Privacy: There privacy statement basically says “lol we promise to be private k?” So I want to run this thing through wireshark to see how true that is. My only skepticism is that it’s a Chinese company, and that might not be fair, but given the information I have on my device it would be good to confirm.All that said, they have a color eInk screen that’s coming out soon that looks wonderful."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I enjoyed Sam Newman&#39;s take on this capability [1]&gt; Great to see AWS providing direct data coupling as a service. /s&gt; This service allows you to directly map a GraphQL endpoint to a database table. It’s like putting getters and setters on an object and claiming your encapsulating private variables. The end result is coupling between GraphQL clients and the underlying datasource.&gt; Information hiding is a key concept in independent change. Can I change the provider (of the GraphQL) endpoint independent of the clients? Directly exposing internal data structure makes this very difficult.And [2]:&gt; So a few people have asked why I have this snarky response. What is my problem with this service? Well, to be clear, it’s not an issue with GraphQL, it’s an issue with direct coupling with underlying datasources #thread&gt; The service as advertised makes it simple to map a GraphQL definition against a database. Now, what’s the problem with this? Well, the devil here is in the detail. But fundamentally it comes down to how important information hiding is to you.&gt; ... see the thread for more ...[1] https://twitter.com/samnewman/status/1346541251617828877

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For those unfamiliar with ITA Matrix, it was for a long time the go-to flight search tool for the most dedicated flight hackers, points hackers, etc.It was built by ITA Software [1][2] in the early-mid 2000s (the earliest mention I can find of it is in 2004 [3]) to test and showcase the capabilities of their flight search platform. I once heard that ITA and other consumer-facing flight search companies had tested that kind of UI with ordinary users, but found that not enough people understood or liked it enough for them to justify making it a mainstream interface.Hipmunk, a YC-backed flight search site that launched in 2010, was heavily influenced by the ITA Matrix UI, after co-founder Adam Goldstein had found Matrix to be the best way for him to find flights when travelling around the world for college debating competitions. And while Hipmunk did a good job of being more consumer-friendly and popular than Matrix had been, sadly they didn&#39;t gain enough traction to make it as a standalone company, and after being acquired by SAP/Concur, it was shut down last year.It&#39;s an interesting, and perhaps depressing case of a product design concept being far superior to what&#39;s available in the mainstream for a certain class of user, but cannot gain enough mainstream acceptance to be a viable business or even a well-supported service for those who love it. And far more than most other product categories, flight search has huge infrastructure costs, so it&#39;s very difficult to economically sustain niche products (from grim personal experience of being part of a team trying to build a novel flight search product ourselves).In this case it&#39;s just lucky that Google owns the infrastructure and has enough enthusiasm internally to keep it going to some extent.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITA_Software[2] https://xconomy.com/boston/2008/12/17/ita-software-the-trave...[3] https://www.fodors.com/community/europe/customs-question-sea..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"ITA Matrix is still my go-to for booking flights:https://matrix.itasoftware.com/Playing with this version, it&#39;s a little easier to use, but I don&#39;t see any functionality not in the regular version. Still, if it means Google is investing in Matrix, that&#39;s a good thing. I always worry at some point it will be killed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It’s an interesting look at AWS pricing since the cost of the M1 Mac Mini ($699) and it’s power consumption (avg 26 watts) are known. Based on hardware costs (significant) and power costs (insignificant) you’re looking at a hardware ROI at about 6 months from the $.65 per hour price. AWS has an estimated 60% gross profit margin, so from there it’s probably possible to estimate some other interesting things about their costs, utilization rate and 
depreciation schedule.Edit: Sorry, my napkin math assumed a unstated utilization rate of 40 hours per week, but that’s not a great assumption due to the 24 hour minimum. Still, some proportion of machines will be idle, though 75% idle seems like a bad guess."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article is profoundly insightful.I have been searching for patterns and insights in this field for 25 years.  What 
 apenwarr concludes is true:    All we need is to build distributed systems that work. That means decentralized bulk activity, hierarchical regulation.


The problem is, everyone wants distributed systems that require everyone else to agree (global consensus), which is literally impossible (see: CAP theory, and what happens when Partition occurs).  There&#39;s another word for &#34;require everyone else to agree&#34;: Tyranny.Fortunately, the entire universe and everything in it works without global consensus, just fine (for various definitions of &#34;fine&#34;).There is also methods for building computational distributed systems that work &#34;fine&#34; in the face of CAP failure:https://holo.hostThis is a serious breakthrough.  And we really, really need this, NOW.Just to whet your appetite, here&#39;s some high-level observations on how these breakthroughs may affect our lives, in the area of Money: https://perry.kundert.ca/range/finance/holochain-consistency..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I strongly believe that money itself has been corrupted lately, this then causes all number of bad flow on effects to happen. A massive shift happened when central banks started getting involved in direct purchases of various asset types and we started to see a major distortion happen in monetary policy that which has distorted the functioning of money itself. For example who would care if their business is completely unprofitable if it could get access to freshly printed money every quarter to prop it up. What then happens to all the other businesses who don&#39;t get access to that freshly created money? When we have situations like the BoJ owning more than 60% of the Nikkei 225 we really ought to be asking some serious questions about if we really have free markets? We also should be asking some questions about the properties we desire in money itself. If a central monetary agency can go about unconventional monetary policy such as purchasing equities we can quickly have a situation whereby an unelected group of bureaucrats can damages the ability of money to be used as a means to convey information. Further there&#39;s questions about picking winners and losers that comes up there too. As a whole I think people need to ask what money is again and have some serious conversations about what money and the monetary system should be. It seems that these difficult questions really fell out of favor a while ago and as a result things have been drifting in a direction that many people aren&#39;t comfortable with.If we don&#39;t ask these questions then technological approaches to money, like various cryptocurrencies and other financial technologies are unlikely to actually cause long lasting improvements. We have some serious monetary policy problems in the world right now and while some tech could help (in some cases) these aren&#39;t primarily technological problems."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"* Everyone seems to increasingly be in it for themselvesI was fortunate to have had a career with mild autonomy to help other team members even if it was slightly out of my job description. But this only happens in a shared office environment where you can see when someone is falling behind or overhear a problem. That physical presence also creates a bond with co-workers that&#39;s often more powerful than the corporate mission.But working from home for the past years I feel like I mercenary working among mercenaries. Working with people that have never met and will never meet and for whom work isn&#39;t about the mission or the customer. If I get work done early, I now just call it a day. Why bother with ad-hoc testing, documentation, checking in on that new hire, proposing a conference paper, investigating technical debt, etc. It&#39;s liberating but it&#39;s also depressing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"fools begone.The ideal monitor rotation --the one that secures the most favour on HN-- is a slow 1-2 centimetre per second continuous orbit about the office in 2 dimensions on a tracked rail.  This in turn ensures that one may not only glorify their monitors rotation, but also glorify their practice of standing whilst working instead of sitting.  The movement --which rotates as well amongst its own Z axis-- also promotes good evangelical proselytization of the many woes of desk sitting, for example, that ten million people die per second for not standing at the lectern as a fourteenth century pork belly clearinghouse clerk.At days end then the monitor should be guided into a velvet sack, and stored gently atop a layer of old Haskell parchments that it may succor inspiration at the next stand-up which is conducted standing, as our christ lord intended."</p>

They add a small note to the end of their results to inform you if the page should normally have had more search hits.So this raises so many questions. Has _no party_ requested to delist TPB under DMCA?!That sounds incredible if true. But the only explanation I have for Google feeling like they need to go this far, delisting on their own initiative! It&#39;s like a scenario that should never have to happen, and something they should never do either.So what&#39;s going on here?Update: Ugh, editorialization... Apparently court has been involved here and while Google may not be individually targetted and forced YET, so &#34;voluntary&#34;, it&#39;s easy to see how Google see the writing on the wall and choose to comply. No point in fighting this with such a clear cut DMCA violation. But in this case I&#39;m still surprised it took this long!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google Search itself is now a threat to the open web. Forget Chrome.Google willingly interferes, in a heavy-handed way, with both search suggestions and search results, with both Google Search and YouTube. Just try to look up any topic on YouTube, and you&#39;ll have to get past the hundreds of mainstream media channels covering the event, before you actually find the original video. They artificially promote &#34;authoritative sources&#34; which are anything but, since they may be second-hand coverage of original videos that get buried in search results.Google&#39;s results are not only manipulated by clever SEO people[0], but by employees[1], in direct contradiction to Sundar Pichai&#39;s sworn testimony. Some of that is very defendable. But there&#39;s zero transparency. Given their search monopoly, and that most people aren&#39;t aware that search results are manipulated, Google Search is the web. Websites that get delisted are presumed to have ceased to exist. Focusing on browsers (Firefox) is good, but no longer enough.That&#39;s why Google Search itself is now a threat to the open web. Switch to other engines. DuckDuckGo, Brave Search are the ones I trust, and there&#39;s tons more.[0]: how many times have you tried looking for a machine&#39;s user manual, mistyped the model number, and somehow &#34;found&#34; a webpage with the manual for a product that didn&#39;t exist? and then modified the model number further and found more results from the same website, with relevant keywords and yet another incorrect model number? My understanding of SEO isn&#39;t good enough to know how they do that. I don&#39;t believe websites can dynamically alter their index to show up for so many typoed search queries.[1]: https://medium.com/@mikewacker/googles-manual-interventions-..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The reason to block the merger is pretty straightforward:1) Nvidia designs expensive chips and sells them by the millions. [1]2) ARM designs cheap chips and sells them by the billions. [2]3) Nvidia&#39;s &#34;normal&#34; product departments are incentivized to prevent ARM from competing with Nvidia&#39;s expensive chips, in various ways. This would hinder ARM&#39;s innovation and growth opportunities vs being independent.I am glad to see this motion to block the merger, for the sake of a competitive market for CPUs, GPUs, etc.[1] https://www.techradar.com/news/nvidia-hits-new-highs-in-gpu-...[2] https://www.tomshardware.com/news/arm-6-7-billion-chips-per-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is the most megalomanic thing I&#39;ve ever heard of. ARM has high chances to be both the next x86 and the most common embedded architecture. While at the same time Nvidia GPUs are already the de facto standard for GPU computing. So Nvidia would have monopolies in 2 verticals. No reasonable and competent antitrust commission could ever allow that - although probably everyone was betting the latter wasn&#39;t the case..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Strategically, why wouldn’t the US gov’t want a US company owning ARM? Why is the FTC pilling on to block this? How would I, as a consumer, be harmed by a graphics company owning an instruction set and design specification?Stopping two US companies from merging because it would create a monopoly and negatively impact US consumers is one thing. But this isn&#39;t even remotely the case here? Doesn&#39;t the US government get more tax revenue if Nvidia makes some extra dough charging royalties for that IP? I’m confused."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think Facebook (meta)‘s key asset is now WhatsApp.Facebook is practically dead. It’s just a stream of awful content that isn’t from your friends. It’s hyper advertising and desperate attempts to clone other platforms as it slowly dies. It’ll continue for a long time, eventually becoming yahoo like, but young people do not care about it at all.Instagram has similarly been over monetised but in an earlier stage. It has been roundly defeated by TikTok, utterly destroyed by TikTok, in the battle for teens’ attention.Oculus was a great buy but the gap (in terms of years) between instagram’s peak and oculus really coming online is just too wide to “save” the company.In contrast, WhatsApp is still used across the generations. It’s the one platform where grandparents and grandkids are both active users.If I were Zuck then I’d focus on turning WhatsApp into an Asian-style chat platform with integrated services. That I can’t wire money on WhatsApp in the U.K. is I think a very very big strategic error on his part.It seems clear Facebook (meta) can’t build anything truly new, but they can certainly extend platforms - they should focus on WhatsApp. It has longevity, strong network effects, and huge potential. Just don’t use ads and destroy it.Otoh Facebook deserves to die so I hope he continues to think oculus will save them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Facebook aside you really see this across the board on almost any platform, that once the product reaches it&#39;s 1.0 stage, (where it is good, does what the users want it to do, and has realised its vision) it begins a process of gradual decay, as the focus of the product managers (now panicking to find some statistics to improve to show their bosses) shifts from &#34;building functionality&#34; to &#34;increasing engagement/retention/active users per month&#34;.Whatever product it is, whether a social media platform or an online learning platform, it will slowly be zombified into an attention sucking machine, whose goal has now become to keep you interacting with the app as much as possible (using ML and DL of course).I mean, Twitter now sends me daily notifications that a person I follow made a random tweet (wasn&#39;t this the purpose of the news feed?), Udemy now has a notification service and an inbox that fills up with automated messages that are just a &#34;welcome to the course&#34; message. Everywhere I look, the pattern is the same, Product is good &gt; Product adds social features &gt; Product attempts to cluster user activity and make recommendations based on social features.We, as in the IT industry, need to come up with a culture or methodology of &#39;declaring a product complete&#39; whereby all product managers are gracefully allowed to move on and a product is put into a state of stasis, where bugfixes and the occasional relevant feature is built. If a product was not designed to show intelligent recommendations, use gamification or become a notification dashboard then that should be bared from ever appearing in its Backlog.I&#39;m deeply worried about the long-term effects of an industry that is booming by sending sending some of our brightest minds to scale the economy of distractions Or to innovate Ad-tech.I really hope we&#39;ll look back at this age with the same wisdom-fuelled disgust we have when we look back at the early industrial age. Where smog factories were built in the middle of cities and dusty kids were shovelling coal. We lack any sort of foresight wrt. the digital economy we&#39;re building. Maybe one day we&#39;ll find a healthy alternative to make software-products users love.But until then, seldom are the days where I do not look at the internet with such savage despair."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t understand Instagram language. My GF uses it. It is full of digital influencers, people who make money because they are digital influencers. Young people with sometimes funny but generally pointless and most often ridiculous dancing moves to an equally ridiculous repetitive song. People buying expensive things, doing idiot things talking about uninteresting details of the uninteresting lives of equally uninteresting people...I don&#39;t understand the hypnotic effect it has."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What we&#39;re seeing here is one of the wealthiest countries in the world with a population of &gt; 80M people crumbling over a few thousand ICU patients because of long-standing issues that were never addressed.The staffing problems in hospitals (and nursing homes) have existed much longer than Covid. I heard a lot about them myself when I did my FSJ (volunteer work) back in 2004, and it&#39;s only gotten worse since then. Our government is in full CYA mode, and doing everything they can to blame a scapegoat for problems they themselves have willingly created over decades. It&#39;s despicable, and nobody should support it.FSJ is a year-long volunteer program for young people typically organized and funded by NGOs like the Red Cross and similar. I worked with small children, plenty of the other volunteers I met regularly worked in hospitals and nursing homes. They all talked at length about how atrocious the working conditions were and how they were asked to do things they weren&#39;t legally allowed to (e.g. taking blood, handing out medication) because the staff shortages were severe enough that people didn&#39;t have enough time to adhere to very reasonable safety rules anymore. That was 17 years ago.This is a well known, widely publicized[0] and not at all new problem, and the unvaccinated are not to blame for it. Let me repeat, we&#39;re talking about one of the wealthiest countries in the world with a population of 83M people crumbling over a few thousand ICU patients.[0]Some random articles from 2018/19 (German):https://gesundheit-soziales.verdi.de/themen/mehr-personal/++...https://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/wenn-aus-notstand-panik-...https://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2018-05/pflegenotsta...https://www.rbb-online.de/kontraste/ueber_den_tag_hinaus/bil..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a double vaccinated German, I am very disappointed and angry about this move.Our politicians have failed to prepare the country for the Winter (who could have known...). We lack a basic strategy how to cope with Covid.And now they try to fix this by dividing the country in two. This will have no effect whatsoever on the infections, it will just continue to drive a divide that is already existing and will make anti-vaxxers even more convinced that this is a big conspiracy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If we were a serious society, then the conversation would be about:immune vs non-immunehigh risk vs low riskinfectious vs non-infectiousBut no, it&#39;s jabbed vs unjabbed. It doesn&#39;t make sense. Everyone in Germany who wants the vaccine has had it, and if you&#39;ve had Covid, you&#39;re about as protected as the vaccinated. Furthermore, leaky vaccines don&#39;t prevent transmission, can&#39;t eliminate the virus (animal reservoirs) and may even make it more virulent. See Marek&#39;s disease: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15757475/ https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/leaky-vac...This is not a rational, science-based policy. This is about punishing the non-compliant, mostly the under class. As the upper class continues with their events surrounded by masked servants, with endless examples of officials breaking their own rules. Worse, we are normalizing the dehumanization of a group of people who we&#39;re told are diseased and dangerous and it&#39;s all their fault. Germany of all places should be absolutely allergic to such rhetoric."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Ex-Ubiquiti employee here. Nick Sharp wasn&#39;t just a senior software engineer. He was the Cloud Lead and ran the whole cloud team. His LinkedIn profile will confirm it. This is why he had access to everything.Nick had his hands in everything from GitHub to Slack and we could never understand why or how. He rose to power in the company by claiming to find a vulnerability that let him access the CEO&#39;s personal system, but nobody I spoke to ever knew what the vulnerability was. I discussed this with another ex-Ubiquiti person in an old thread [1] Now I&#39;m positive he faked the security issue as a power move, just as he faked this attack for extortion purposes.He would also harass people and use his control over Slack and GitHub against the people he didn&#39;t like. Many people left around this time partially because Nick made everything so difficult at the company. What a terribly depressing series of events.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26694945"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve always been fascinated by the idea that intelligence lies within a spectrum. Someone might be incredibly smart about a narrow topic or field, yet be blind to their own stupidity within another realm.To me, this seems like a classic example. To quote the press release: &#34;During the execution of that search, SHARP made numerous false statements to FBI agents, including, among other things, in substance, that he was not the perpetrator of the Incident and that he had not used Surfshark VPN prior to the discovery of the Incident.  When confronted with records demonstrating that SHARP purchased the Surfshark VPN service in July 2020, approximately six months prior to the Incident, SHARP falsely stated, in part and substance, that someone else must have used his PayPal account to make the purchase.&#34;This man was a senior developer yet this quote sounds like it comes from a nine year-old. Not to mention &#34;hire a lawyer, don&#39;t talk to the police&#34; has always been pretty solid advice.He now faces significant prison time, and the strong potential for a dismal life."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Mr. Sharp is apparently not so sharp. He carried out the attack from his home network. He connected directly for enough time that his bare IP was logged. The rest of the time, he carried out the attack using a commercially purchased VPN solution that was trivial to trace back to him via the purchase record. He lied to the FBI. (I have yet to understand why people talk to law enforcement instead of staying silent so as to not implicate themselves.) And, for no apparently good reason (meaning, there&#39;s no claim of him shorting the stock), after the raid, he seeded fake news that drove the company&#39;s stock down 20%."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Back when Edgeium was new and just Chrome but with a lot of Google cruft removed, I actually used Edge instead of Chrome when I was on Windows. It was the same browser with some additional tweaks that I quite liked.Then Microsoft started this aggressive, disruptive push to bring it to iOS Safari&#39;s level as the only browser people should use.I don&#39;t know any good operating systems for normal people anymore. Windows 10 and 11 are hostile, macOS only runs on very expensive hardware and doesn&#39;t run most programs people need (because the business world is still Windows oriented) and Linux has been making progress but still isn&#39;t a good alternative for the common user unless they have an expert to rely upon when something breaks down. ChromeOS doesn&#39;t run on most devices (it can, but the images aren&#39;t available) and I wouldn&#39;t recommend a Google-oriented OS to most people anyway, if they can avoid it; Android is bad enough already.I miss the Windows 7 days. The Win10/11 kernel may have seen loads of improvements, the UI and basic behaviour has only been regressing for many years now. The Windows 11 window snapping is nice but it doesn&#39;t excuse the aggressive spyware that comes with the OS, and neither does it excuse this antitrust lawsuit in waiting."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I heard some people having a decent time with Edge in the past with some features implementations. Not that I would use it myself, but I&#39;m firmly convinced these childish plays only ruin whatever good work was done on it. Who on Earth would continue using a browser that has such hostile behavior and dark patterns all over the place e.g., buy-now-pay-later at browser level?It&#39;s so hard to trust Microsoft anyway, I&#39;m glad 11 is such a tranwreck dead on arrival. Makes it easier to discourage people from using it, ever."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Microsoft Edge runs on the same technology as Chrome, with the added trust of Microsoft.&#34;They named their user tracking, telemetry, and &#34;Buy Now, Pay Later&#34; add-ons &#34;trust&#34;?  That&#39;s really Orwellian."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a super cool blog post. However I think it alludes to a much larger problem. For many products today, it’s very difficult or impossible for most people to verify the product works.For a network switch, there are free and open source tools like iPerf to test and verify speeds are as advertised. For a faraday box, you have to go through all these steps (and knowledge learned) just to be able to test these. What about for vitamins, or pet food, or any other “durable” products that are supposed to last for X years?In an age of snake oil salesmen, paid for reviewers, and fraudulent products on Amazon, there is a real opportunity for creating systems that enable individuals to verify products do what the sellers claim they do."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really like Snowden&#39;s recommended Faraday cage for phones or other devices of similar size: two drink-shaker cups[1].Drink shakers are cheap and widely available. The average hotel room in any medium/large hotel chain probably includes a shaker as a standard item as part of the minibar. The simple two-cup style (as seen in [1]) is preferred over the fancier &#34;strainer top&#34; style because you can press the two cups together; this should cause the inner cup to slightly cut into and/or deform the outer cup along the circle where they join together. The seal between the cups should work sort of like the  knife-edge seals used in vacuum chambers.A metal box or conductive bag is only a Faraday cage if it is fully closed/sealed. Any imperfection in the seal or hole[2] might allow the radio signal to leak out. Most improvised items (freezer, random metal box, etc) have poor seals. Making a high quality cage that actually block a modern phone can be done without much trouble, but the drink shaker method is the only method I know of that will do the job using widely available (free) or very cheap ($10-ish?) parts.[1] https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/HLB1yRyhXZTxK1Rjy0Fgq6yovpXaZ/Win...[2] Holes of sufficient size. How big are the waves you are trying to block?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At my former job we had a rather large faraday cage for testing telco equipment. Two things surprised me: 1) It is more fiddly to ensure a room-sized faraday cage doesn&#39;t leak RF than I thought.  It is really easy to make mistakes that compromises experiments. 2) There was a bath-towel sized piece of cloth that came with one of the expensive Rohde &amp; Schwarz instruments that was astonishingly effective at blocking signal.So I mainly used the room because that&#39;s where the magic blanket was - which was easier to use than ensuring the room was set up correctly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Ha, yes, I&#39;ve done that at https://gigablast.com/ .
The biggest problems now are the following:
1) Too hard to spider the web. Gatekeeper companies like Cloudflare (owned in part by Google) and Cloudfront make it really difficult for upstart search engines to download web pages.
2) Hardware costs are too high. It&#39;s much more expensive now to build a large index (50B+ pages) to be competitive.I believe my algorithms are decent, but the biggest problem for Gigablast is now the index size. You do a search on Gigablast and say, well, why didn&#39;t it get this result that Google got. And that&#39;s because the index isn&#39;t big enough because I don&#39;t have the cash for the hardware. btw, I&#39;ve been working on this engine for over 20 years and have coded probably 1-2M lines of code on it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The consistent theme every time this comes up is that dealing with the sheer weight of the internet is almost impossible today. SEO spam is hard to fight and the index gets too heavy. However, I wonder if this is a sign that we&#39;re looking at the problem wrong.What if instead of even trying to index the entire web, we moved one step back towards the curated directories of the early web? Give users a search engine and indexer that they control and host. Allow them to &#34;follow&#34; domains (or any partial URLs, like subreddits) that they trust.Make it so that you can configure how many hops it is allowed to take from those trusted sources, similar to LinkedIn&#39;s levels of connections. If I&#39;m hosting on my laptop, I might set it at 1 step removed, but if I&#39;ve got an S3 bucket for my index I might go as far as 3 or 4 steps removed.There are further optimizations that you could do, such as having your instance not index Wikipedia or Stack Overflow or whatever (instead using the built-in search and aggregating results).I&#39;m sure there are technical challenges I&#39;m not thinking of, and this would absolutely be a tool that would best serve power users and programmers rather than average internet users. Such an engine wouldn&#39;t ever replace Google, but I&#39;d think it would go a long way to making a better search engine for a single user&#39;s (or a certain subset of users&#39;) everyday web experience."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Natural Language Processing is a pox on modern search engines. I suspect that Google et. al. wanted to transform their product into an answer engine that powers voice assistants like Siri and just assumed everyone would naturally like the new way better. I can&#39;t stand how Google is always trying to guess what I want, rather than simply returning non-personalized results solely based on exactly what I typed in the textbox.While that may be good for most people, there is still a lot of power and utility in simple keyword-driven searches. Sadly, it seems like every major search engine has to follow Google&#39;s lead."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A title that actually describes the post, mostly paraphrasing the first paragraph:Reasons why this buffer overflow wasn&#39;t caught earlier despite doing all the right thingsAnd then to give those reasons:- &#34;each component is fuzzed independently&#34; ... &#34;This fuzzer might have produced a SECKEYPublicKey that could have reached the vulnerable code, but as the result was never used to verify a signature, the bug could never be discovered.&#34;- &#34;There is an arbitrary limit of 10000 bytes placed on fuzzed input. There is no such limit within NSS; many structures can exceed this size. This vulnerability demonstrates that errors happen at extremes&#34;- &#34;combined [fuzzer] coverage metrics [...]. This data proved misleading, as the vulnerable code is fuzzed extensively but by fuzzers that could not possibly generate a relevant input.&#34;The conclusion is, of course, to fix those problems if your code base also has them, but also &#34;even extremely well-maintained C/C++ can have fatal, trivial mistakes&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love adventofcode. I have a rule I follow now which makes it a lot more enjoyable: if I can&#39;t make headway on a problem after trying for a day or so, I&#39;ll use the subreddit to find a hint, and then usually that&#39;s enough to help me to the answer. Very occasionally I just completely cheat (often the pure math based questions).I don&#39;t like missing out on the stars.... I mean it&#39;s the only way you get to see the awesome ascii art when you collect all 50 for the year.Many thanks to Eric and team for what must be a huge effort to run such a fun programme.Oh, the other thing I do: I don&#39;t even start until sometime in January :) far less stress and keeps the whole family much happier ;)"</p>

The first few days will still be fun.I&#39;m checking out Elixir this year, because I write 95 % Ruby at work and I&#39;m getting really intrigued by the functional stuff seeping into it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I respect that AoC gets very difficult and is for an audience that isn’t me.But I love the format and what I’d enjoy is a similar project where the difficulty doesn’t really increase, but each day is a different problem domain. Breadth not depth.For example, perhaps we start with some data processing from a file. Then answer some basic statistics question about the data.  Then maybe some basic signal processing.  We form an image. We transform the image. We play the image as audio.  We break it into packets of some sort then share it on a “network.” We reassemble it. We build a state machine and pass it the reassembled data in some way. We discover some new output.Etc. etc. culminating with some fun discovery that inside that original data was a secret code or whatever.And instead of an intense challenge, we’ve just had a fun walk through an intro to two dozen subdomains of CS/sweng. You may not have immediately known the answer to each puzzle but you never felt lost."</p>

Oskar Stalberg also made a great demo of how it works[0], but it might not make sense just from that. Martin Donald made a really nice youtube video on how it works[1]. The name &#34;wave function collapse&#34; can be off putting but it&#39;s pretty straightforward, and an algorithm that can come in handy for many uses both in game development and just general software development.I&#39;m actually procrastinating on HN from working on a GPU parallelised version that can generate millions of positions every frame. In Townscaper you can actually see that the algorithm runs quite slow and lags behind the players input, there&#39;s just a bunch of animation to hide it. I&#39;m hoping to eventually get a version that can run in log2(mapsize) time.[0]http://oskarstalberg.com/game/wave/wave.html

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Reputation is a fragile thing. I&#39;ve got no horse in this, it&#39;s not my industry and I&#39;m just a spectator. But two days ago I thought of Stripe as a top notch company, with top notch leadership. Since I&#39;m well aware that PR is a thing, that reputation also tends to be brittle, but while nobody had said anything bad about Stripe, I thought they were tops. This is not so much about Stripe as about the PR world we&#39;ve created: we know that everything we&#39;re told is polished to make it look as nice as possible, so when the facade cracks, we should adjust heavily.So now I&#39;m going to have to shift my priors, and it may well be unfair to the firm. For one, I don&#39;t know if the allegations are true. I also don&#39;t know whether this is a one-off, or whether this happens all the time and this is the tip of the iceberg. I do know that whatever I hear is going to be deeply invested one way or the other.Specifically about the rescinded offers, the only acceptable reason to do that is when the person has gotten the offer in bad faith, eg they lied about their CV or claimed to have done something they provably hadn&#39;t. Other than that, someone who&#39;s gotten an offer may well have started moving house, taking their kids out of school, gotten their spouse to quit their job, and all sorts of hard-to-reverse decisions. It&#39;s an utterly crappy thing to have happen, and any company that does it should be outed for it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Stripe&#39;s recruitment pipeline is well known (at least in most ruby dev circles) to be fucked. I&#39;ve experienced this first hand and even gotten lip service from exec leadership (see my HN comment history). Stripe is very good at PR, aren&#39;t they?The thing is, there are lots and lots of companies who don&#39;t have these types of problems; that don&#39;t treat candidates poorly, follow thru with the offers they make (I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m typing that!).Hiring is already a power dynamic slanted for the employer... this shit just seem excessive and like 0 fucks are given.As a job seeker, don&#39;t waste your time interviewing at companies that have these fundamental problems just getting in the door. The odds will never be in your favor, but these types of problems make for a much larger mountain to climb.Knowing these things, and how good Stripe is at PR, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if things on the inside are actually a dysfunctional mess. I hope not."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some people are getting side-tracked asking if this is a common problem. I think that&#39;s a distraction: the right number of rescinded offers to engineers and other individual contributors is 0.[0]If the actual number of candidates affected is small, then it would be cheap to make it right for them. You could find a team that can take the engineer (we&#39;re not interchangeable parts, but Stripe is a big company), and/or offer monetary compensation for the opportunity cost.[0] I&#39;ll reserve judgment about higher level management. I don&#39;t know if the norms and circumstances are different. Obviously this also excludes failed background checks, candidates being dishonest, etc, etc."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For years now I&#39;ve ran a programming site (stackabuse.com) and have closely followed the state of Google SERPs when it comes to programming content. A few thoughts/ramblings:- The search results for programming content has been very volatile the last year or so. Google has released a lot of core algorithm updates in the last year, which has caused a lot of high-quality sites to either lose traffic or stagnate.- These low-quality code snippet sites have always been around, but their traffic has exploded this year after the algorithm changes. Just look at traffic estimates for one of the worst offenders - they get an estimated 18M views each month now, which has grown almost 10x in 12 months. Compare that to SO, which has stayed flat or even dropped in the same time-frame- The new algorithm updates seem to actually hurt a lot of high-quality sites as it seemingly favors code snippets, exact-match phrases, and lots of internal linking. Great sites with well-written long-form content, like RealPython.com, don&#39;t get as much attention as they deserve, IMO. We try to publish useful content, but consistently have our traffic slashed by Google&#39;s updates, which end up favoring copy-pasted code from SO, GitHub, and even our own articles.- The programming content &#34;industry&#34; is highly fragmented (outside of SO) and difficult to monetize, which is why so many sites are covered in ads. Because of this, it&#39;s a land grab for traffic and increasing RPMs with more ads, hence these low-quality snippet sites. Admittedly, we monetize with ads but are actively trying to move away from it with paid content. It&#39;s a difficult task as it&#39;s hard to convince programmers to pay for anything, so the barrier to entry is high unless you monetize with ads.- I&#39;ll admit that this is likely a difficult problem because of how programmer&#39;s use Google. My guess is that because we often search for obscure errors/problems/code, their algorithm favors exact-match phrases to better find the solution. They might then give higher priority to pages that seem like they&#39;re dedicated to whatever you searched for (i.e. the low-quality snippet sites) over a GitHub repo that contains that snippet _and_ a bunch of other unrelated code.Just my two cents. Interested to hear your thoughts :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Somewhat tangential but I believe Google Search is going downhill, they seem to be losing the content junk spam SEO fight. Recently, I&#39;ve had to append wiki/reddit/hn to queries I search for because everything near the top is shallow copied content marketing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not only SO threads, I particularly hate the ones that mirror GitHub Issues. They don&#39;t even link back to the original thread, for Christ&#39;s sake!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I used to be a volunteer teacher for a 3-hour weekly class in a local prison.One of the things this article misses is that gangs – which are especially active in prison systems – use books to pass ciphered messages.  Highlighting, underlining, dogeared corners, scratched out characters, etc. are used prolifically as encoded messages that would appear to be regular wear to a casual observer.  The &#34;tradecraft&#34; these guys employ is amazing (albeit for a horrible purpose).  We were allowed to have books shipped directly from publishers or known third-party entities (e.g., Amazon) and there was a request form an instructor could fill to add new approved vendors.All that to say, I understand the policy, even though it&#39;s not ideal for those honestly wanting to read.  It&#39;s hard for most people to imagine but a lot of the people in prison are some seriously bad dudes, and there are real cases of warring gangs orchestrating &#34;hits&#34; on other gang members through innocuous looking content."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the things that happens with used books being donated is that the paper will be used as a medium for getting contraband drugs into the prison.An example of this (letters) https://nypost.com/2021/11/05/wisconsin-inmates-to-get-photo...&gt; Wisconsin prison inmates will begin receiving photocopies of their mail next month as officials attempt to stem the flow of paper laced with drugs into correctional facilities.&gt; The Wisconsin Department of Corrections (DOC) said paper and envelopes can be sprayed or soaked in synthetic cannabinoids such as K2 and then sent into prisons, where they are torn into strips and smoked and sold to inmates.&gt; The Fox Lake prison switched to photocopying prison mail in April after nine “potential overdoses” and two incidents of violent behavior connected to drug use. In the months since, the prison has seen numbers in both categories drop before reaching zero in August, officials said.That&#39;s for a single sheet of paper - consider the difficulty of verifying that a couple hundred pages of a novel haven&#39;t been tampered with.One of the easier ways to do this is to have the book be new and come directly from a distributor."</p>

I had a brief brush with the Law at one point in the past; but reading about what goes on in there and how it completely fucks over people is just incredible.I sincerely believe that if there’s any one thing that will end the American experiment, it will be its Prison system. Generations of poor people being brutalized and radicalized, creating an incredibly violent culture both inside and out… it’s just not sustainable to keep imprisoning millions of people.I don’t know what the solution is. I suspect we will need to invest massively in both keeping people out of prisons and creating conditions in society that make it less likely for people to fall into destitution."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Rant time: You&#39;ve heard it before, git is powerful, but what good is that power when everything is so damn hard to do? Interactive rebasing requires you to edit a goddamn TODO file in your editor? Are you kidding me? To stage part of a file you need to use a command line program to step through each hunk and if a hunk can&#39;t be split down any further but contains code you don&#39;t want to stage, you have to edit an arcane patch file by hand? Are you KIDDING me?! Sometimes you get asked to stash your changes when switching branches only to realise that after you switch and unstash that there weren&#39;t even any conflicts and it would have been fine to just checkout the branch directly? YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!&gt; If you&#39;re a mere mortal like me and you&#39;re tired of hearing how powerful git is when in your daily life it&#39;s a powerful pain in your ass, lazygit might be for you.I sympathise, deeply. If you&#39;ve never found yourself counting lines - repeatedly, because your last attempt failed - while manually editing a hunk, then I envy you."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If there is one thing that terrifies me it&#39;s using Git, or any source control, from the command line. No matter how long I&#39;ve been in this industry, I just can&#39;t get cozy with doing a lot of heavy lifting in any shell environment. Give me the GUI all day every day."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; ClojureScript is not that easy to integrate with the JS ecosystem. I know, there’s been a lot of improvements done in this space over the years, and I’m sure someone will immediately point me to relevant docs, but it’s still the extra mile you need to go when compared to regular JS codebaseThis always kills me. Clojure(script) is one of the neatest languages I&#39;ve ever used, but it is just such a pain to work with. I spent hours getting NPM imports working in a project, when it ought to take seconds. It really makes it hard to recommend, even though the language itself is amazing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The results keep getting &#34;refined&#34; so as to suit the popular 80% of queries, while getting much worse for any technical or obscure queries. Forced synonyms and &#34;people also searched for&#34; are typically useless and almost infuriating. Once you get off the first or second page, the results get even worse-- with pages entirely unrelated to the query (e.g. not even containing the searched phrases). They are probably testing/already implemented some sort of multi armed bandit type optimization like on Youtube&#39;s search results where they just show any popular pages (ignoring relevancy) to see if they yield a click.I&#39;ve used DDG for the past ~5 years, and it is typically worse without using a hashbang like !so for technical queries. I guess that is what the web has evolved to-- knowing which mega-site you want to search against rather than discover new sites?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It feels like the algorithm (combined with the SEO/marketing industry) has effectively nuked discussions from organic results.Based on the search box suggestions I get, it seems many people work around this by appending reddit to their searches. If I search for &#34;warmest winter coat&#34; it&#39;s a bunch of untrustworthy content marketing until you try something like &#34;warmest winter coat reddit&#34;Unfortunately I prefer to avoid reddit (which also has a fair amount of astroturfing), but I haven&#39;t found a good alternative. I severely miss Google&#39;s old &#34;discussions&#34; (or was it forums?) filter."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a whole class of searches that no longer have value because of SEO. Try &#34;best exercise bike&#34; or anything that can be similarly monetized and you will of course end up at a well-crafted page designed to monetize you.My deepest apologies for saying this, but for any type of query that has a monetization angle, I now add &#34;site:www.reddit.com&#34; to the query to find actual discussion about it.Normal Reddit disclaimers apply as much of what you find is garbage but at least if you search &#34;best exercise bike&#34; confined to reddit you&#39;ll get real opinion not hellbent on monetizing you."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It seems everyone here is confused. Here&#39;s the official FAQ, and it has 0 marketing garbage.https://aws.amazon.com/private5g/faqs/There&#39;s no &#34;telecom as a service&#34;, and there&#39;s no &#34;5g can be split into multiple networks&#34; nonsense.Amazon is just selling 5g access points and hardware (just like you would install wifi), and rents you a private connection for that hardware to AWS, and management of that network from AWS. Basically."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Become a telecom as a service!Super cool. For those who are glancing over, this is a big deal. 5G isn&#39;t really like 4G upgraded. It&#39;s more its own thing. I believe this has been available though for a while and many telecoms have partnerships with FAANG beyond Amazon.With 5G you can essentially split a network into multiple partitions and scale them independently on-demand called Network Slicing. (like cloud computing but just the network).This could be extremely useful for security. Maybe even the death of VPNs. This is also useful for scaling network resources to services as they need it.Short-term, things like &#34;Tesla Free Network&#34; could exist for their self-driving cars. Or, Uber offering free fast Internet to their drivers or a truly private device.Long-term, I am concerned about the emergence of private networks with different access. Such as a &#34;Google Network&#34; or a &#34;Netflix Network&#34; that offer different services or privacy levels at different costs.It&#39;s a crazy, scary, but also fun direction we are going.Edit: Final comment. If you think this might be the death of AT&amp;T with independent providers, think again . Amazon &amp; Co. and others like Google are bringing their developer platform, while the telecoms offer their infrastructure. It&#39;s a gross partnership that makes sense. When you send bits over the network -- everyone will be getting paid except you."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Let me put my perspective, coming from a guy who is involved in private Cellular networking (US as well as other countries):1) Private 5G can be deployed either with licensed operator (Cellular provider) or in CBRS band (CBRS band is opened by FCC for the private cellular deployment). It can be used free or paid, different options. (Fees is minimal).2) CBRS still doesnt support 5G. No idea how AWS will provide. But even if it is private 4G, for the end user it doesnt matter.3) Your available bandwidth is limited by the air waves bandwidth you are using, nit by 4G or 5G. Per enterprise, CBRS band is limited to LTE equivalent band (20MHz). Total CBRS band is 200MHz, if I am not wrong). You are not going to get giga speed just because its 5G.4) Not all phones support CBRS band. You will be limited to CBRS band support in handset feature.
5) Each end device will need SIM (SIM card either physical or virtual). Its not like your laptop will be connected with private 4G or 5G. You will need modem as well as SIM card (unless your devices support these features).6) Its really for small geographic reason. Its not that easy to take the equipment with you and start using. (like in car or train etc).7) There is a concept of SAS server, that&#39;s why AWS device needs to be connected to this server in cloud (There are SAS license holders, to them). Once you install the system and that is connected to the SAS server, first you get the frequency band which is open in your area. If some one using that band (another CBRS player), you are out of luck (ask me , who has to call different teams when deploy in lab). PLus, there are scenarios when these licenses can be revoked (if you are using free band). The law enforcement can ask FCC to use the band temporarily. GCC can revoke your lic and stop the system.What AWS did is big, but for enterprises."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really like this quote from the manual:&lt;&lt;There are a class of &#34;ideal attractors&#34; in engineering, concepts like &#34;everything is an object,&#34; &#34;homoiconicity,&#34; &#34;purely functional,&#34; &#34;pure capability system,&#34; etc. Engineers fall into orbit around these ideas quite easily. Systems that follow these principles often get useful properties out of the deal.However, going too far in any of these directions is also a great way to find a deep reservoir of unsolved problems, which is part of why these are popular directions in academia.In the interest of shipping, we are consciously steering around unsolved problems, even when it means we lose some attractive features.&gt;&gt;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We are gettig an increasing amount of interesting Rust operating system for different uses.- Hubris for deep embedded- Redox OS for Desktop/Server (https://www.redox-os.org/)- Tock for embedded (https://www.tockos.org/)- Xous for trusted devices (https://xobs.io/announcing-xous-the-betrusted-operating-syst...)I assume there are more."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have an embedded real-time control project that is currently written in Rust, but runs with RTIC (https://rtic.rs/), a framework which is conceptually similar (no dynamic allocation of tasks or resources) but also has some differences. RTIC is more of a framework for locks and critical sections in an interrupt based program than a full fledged RTOS. Looking through the docs, here&#39;s the main differences (for my purposes) I see:1. In Hubris, all interrupt handlers dispatch to a software task. In RTIC, you can dispatch to a software task, but you can also run the code directly in the interrupt handler. RTIC is reliant on Cortex-M&#39;s NVIC for preemption, whereas Hubris can preempt in software (assuming it is implemented). This does increase the minimum effective interrupt latency in Hubris, and if not very carefully implemented, the jitter also.2. Hubris compiles each task separately and then pastes the binaries together, presumably with a fancy linker script. RTIC can have everything in one source file and builds everything into one LTO&#39;d blob. I see the Hubris method as mostly a downside (unless you want to integrate binary blobs, for example), but it might have been needed for:3. Hubris supports Cortex-M memory protection regions. This is pretty neat and something that is mostly out of scope for RTIC (being built around primitives that allow shared memory, trying to map into the very limited number of MPU regions would be difficult at best). Of course, it&#39;s Rust, so in theory you wouldn&#39;t need the MPU protections, but if you have to run any sort of untrusted code this is definitely the winner.Hubris does support shared memory via leases, but I&#39;m not sure how it manages to map them into the very limited 8 Cortex-M MPU regions. I&#39;m quite interested to look at the implementation when the source code is released.Edit: I forgot to mention the biggest difference, which is that because tasks have separate stacks in Hubris, you can do blocking waits. RTIC may support async in the future but for now you must manually construct state machines."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hope everyone considers themselves as working for themselves, regardless of the actual vehicle that attaches themselves to their current income stream (job or their own company or whatever...)Even self-employed, you still have many bosses (customers, etc). In fact _those_ bosses can be harder to fire depending on contracting terms... And you might find it harder to churn out the sales to maintain a steady income stream.Even company-employed, you still should frame things in working-for-yourself. What are you getting out of the relationship? Is the employer holding up its end for you?The traditional, paternalistic concept of employment is outmoded. It says your career growth should be managed by your employer (don&#39;t let it...). It presumes the work you do and your job are always 100% the same (they&#39;re not). It assumes a kind of one-sided evaluation of the employee, where the employer has all the power (very untrue these days)."</p>

That was happening on the regular well before COVID.1 in 1000 people striking out on their own doesn&#39;t really explain the &#34;ongoing  shake-up in the world of work&#34; like they&#39;re trying to suggest."</p>

The contemporary themes that are relevant are the fact that current privacy movements like Tor, Signal, OTF, BBG are fundamentally military funded and survive on government contracts. It distracts from the needed political discourse into a technology one where &#34;encryption is the great equalizer&#34; and everyone can resist big brother in their own way on the platforms the government has built. Encryption does exist, but it also distracts from other vectors like vulnerabilities (that led to Ulbricht getting caught), what services you would e2e connect to, how you get the clients to connect to those services, what store can push binaries for said clients etc."</p>

Why not wait for actual misuse and base a case on that?Also what&#39;s so special about Giphy?

Expected behavior of a link is to link me elsewhere, not to show a pop-up GIF, so I&#39;m immediately confused when that happens. I also can&#39;t figure out how to make the link actually link. Does it link anywhere? Is it even a link or just Jscript onClick thingy? Do I have to click on the GIF to make it link, because that&#39;s 2 clicks when precisely one is accepted link practice. Clicking to engage and then clicking again to disappear is super aggravating, especially on mobile screen, especially on such a long list. Click, click, click, click, click click, click, click. Ahhhh!This works well if I can hover over the links with a mouse to engage the pop-ups, which then disappear when I hover away. If I have to click on the links, like you do on mobile, then click again to dismiss, neither click actually linking to anything, it fails UX.Also, too much info in too small a space on mobile. Too much being communicated. Too dense. What UX test calls engineeritis. You need drill down pages for these links. If I click one, I expect a page with detailed information, a drill down, not a pop-up summary GIF.Mixed UX metaphors. Not lethal, but not quite there yet. Very cool, though, especially for the rapidity with which you were able to implement it, but it needs a bit more test on the UX side on mobile.A button toggle that displays a responsive, inline GIF as a drop-down, not pop-up, is perhaps the better solution, even if it&#39;s not quite as neat as what your creativity created. That would work as expected without damaging your intent, but that still involves click click click."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s really annoying when I&#39;m browsing a page and my mouse &#34;accidentally&#34; moves over something and a giant thing pops up in front. Terrible UX. End up having to play dodge-the-mines with my mouse"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This was a wonderful surprise. DESQview (and anything early Quarterdeck) holds a special place in my heart.My uncle, Gary Pope, co-founded the company. I grew up with DESQview and QEMM as two of our primary pieces of software running on our computers.I moved onto Linux many years later, and used to have a Linux box as my primary machine, but with a DOS computer sitting next to it, DESQview/X loaded up, and would use DESQview/X as a makeshift second monitor by using it as an X11 display server.DESQview/X was based on X11R5, I believe, rather than X11R6, so I was a bit limited in terms of which software worked, but terminals were just fine.Anyway...A while back, I assembled all the DESQview/Quarterdeck material I had sitting around and put it up for others to look at. There&#39;s some stuff in here that you won&#39;t find anywhere else:https://www.dropbox.com/sh/htvf2edf3mrx0be/AABllqVhf0BzOytup...There&#39;s a README with some background, screenshots, marketing material, photos, product reviews, and even a paper that my mom wrote up about DESQ (the precursor to DESQview and DESQview/X), with a little bit of background on its development, back in 1984.Hope it proves interesting! :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, looks like this has never had an HN thread before. One interesting submission (https://archive.org/details/desqview-x-booklet) but no comments:DesqView/X: A Technical Perspective [book] - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7061438 - Jan 2014 (0 comments)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember running DesqView (without the X) in the early 90&#39;s, it must have been on a 286 (is that possible?), I only got a 486 around 1994.I remember being impressed by the fact that I could run multiple applications at the same time and switch between them. I think I ran a BBS at the time (a combination of Frontdoor and something else... the memory is thin).I vaguely remember excitingly showing my parents, probably my mother, &#34;Look! I can run multiple applications and switch between them!!!&#34;, and she gave me a confused look of &#34;what the hell is this boy going on about&#34;."</p>

Especially after seeing this disclaimer on their download page:&gt;&gt;&gt;IMPORTANT: These binaries are provided by anyone who are willing to build and submit them. Because these binaries are not necessarily reproducible, authenticity cannot be guaranteed. For your consideration, each download page lists the GitHub user that submitted those binaries."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem with this is updates: there is no trusted publisher of binaries, and even if you pick one person to trust, oftentimes builds are 6 - 8 weeks out of date with Chromium which means you&#39;re susceptible to all the published zero-days.Tried building it myself and it takes 4 hours on my 32-core 5950x, and you still depend on someone actually porting a version bump because their patches need to be regenerated for every new chromium build.I like the idea of it in principle; if someone donates some CI time and we get official CI builds, plus getting more active with picking up new builds it&#39;ll be a real contender. I&#39;ll stick with Firefox for now."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m in a post-Thanksgiving charitable mood, so thank you, Jack. The execution hasn&#39;t been perfect (as has been commented on ad nauseam), but Twitter is the closest to a worldwide-accessible [1] Speaker&#39;s Corner [2] I know of, and that - despite all the completely valid criticism - is a valuable public service: mediating access to information has been the defining tool of control for those in power pretty much since civilization began, and I, for one, will always pick an imperfectly moderated cesspool over the prior status quo where a church or a government told me what&#39;s true and what to think. FWIW, you&#39;ve also championed transparency and decentralization for your platform more than any other SV social media titan [3].[1] If you have access to the Internet, that is.

[3] https://twitter.com/jack/status/1204766078468911106"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A few reflections on this announcement.1) Remember that CEOs of public companies are essentially unable to say what they think or want. The cost of doing it is being sued for damages, having to spend countless hours with lawyers, etc. Jack might think X, but he&#39;s only allowed to say Y, and he doesn&#39;t want to go beyond that because he doesn&#39;t want to fight that fight.Only people in a close circle really know what&#39;s going on, and it&#39;s most certainly not random people on the Internet (or HN).2) Also, consider that Twitter, and perhaps Facebook (sorry but I don&#39;t give a sh*t that its new name is Meta), are really difficult companies to run, especially if you&#39;d like to do some public good, as opposed to just maximizing returns.There are so many things that can go wrong, so many other things that will set your company on fire without warnings, and that doesn&#39;t give people the time to think strategically on how to tackle certain difficult scenarios.Twitter and Facebook essentially control most of the public discourse these days; never seen such amount of power in the hands of a few companies.3) Despite common opinion, I actually think that Twitter (unlike Facebook) has done more good than harm. Why? Because it has essentially enabled an incredible explosion of &#34;voices&#34; that can be heard (err, read) all over the world.4) Yes, we can think of countless ways to make Twitter better, but remember that Twitter is not run by Jack Dorsey, nor that other companies are run by their CEOs. Companies are run by boards, which means, by large funds with controlling interest in these companies. Even a well-intentioned CEO has to fight against many things his/her board want. And unlike enlightened CEOs, enlightened boards are essentially a very rare creature, almost never seen on planet Earth (IMHO).5) You might think I&#39;m defending Jack, perhaps I am, but it might be because hatred is really easy to dispense, while trying to be balanced in your judgement is really hard, and perhaps the conversation about Twitter should benefit from cooler heads, as opposed to quick slogans."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It will be interesting to see how Twitter changes as a result. Twitter with selective following and setting your timeline to &#39;time order&#39; creates a pretty good environment for me. It feels like the equivalent of living in only a few chosen &#39;subreddits&#39; rather than getting the full frontal reddit experience."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been meaning to write almost exactly this blog post for a while now, glad that someone else did it.Two things that I think are worth calling out:1. In many ways Apple&#39;s anti-competitive behaviour on iOS/iPadOS is a blessing. It&#39;s one of the few things that keep Chromium&#39;s dominance in check. Of course, it&#39;s not great that Apple are stifling innovation like this, but consider the alternative: Chromium dominance on all platforms.2. Why it&#39;s worth caring about this at all? So what if Chromium is the only engine, it would make things easier for developers after all. To this I say, go read some of the discussions in standard bodies(for example about FLoC). Engineers from Apple and Mozilla are largely our bastion against Google&#39;s harmful proposals for the web. Pushback from Apple and Mozilla are only relevant as long as they have market share to speak of. The recent lawsuit against Google(summary[0]) by many US states should be extremely worrying to anyone that cares about the open web and it should make handing over any more control to Google a terrifying prospect.Mozilla maintains a list[1] of their positions on various standard suggestions that is also a useful resource.0: https://twitter.com/fasterthanlime/status/145205393819534131...1: https://mozilla.github.io/standards-positions/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a depressing situation, particularly knowing that Firefox is pretty much kept alive at Google&#39;s whim. It makes one seriously wonder whether it is feasible at all to maintain an independent open-source web browser in 2021. People tend to blame Mozilla&#39;s management and I&#39;m sure there have been management failures but I&#39;m not sure what they could do to make Firefox a thriving, independent, sustainable browser. It seems that the market niche of tech-capable people who value privacy and customisation over a simplified UX is not capable of sustaining Firefox on its own. So Mozilla tries to move in Chrome&#39;s direction, removing configuration options and &#34;dumbing down&#34; the UI, which frustrates its existing user base (including me) while apparently also failing to eat into Chrome&#39;s market share.So what to do? Go back to being the quirky, heavily configurable browser we all know and love? That would be great for me, but even assuming Mozilla can afford to do that now (greater configurability leads to greater code complexity and therefore greater maintenance costs), experience seems to suggest it won&#39;t be enough to allow Mozilla grow its market share to a sustainable level.Finally, and this is a bit of a tangent, but I&#39;ve never quite understood why Mozilla got such a hard time from users about telemetry. I understand that telemetry is in general something to be suspicious of, but we&#39;re not talking about handing your data over to Google so they can target you with ads; we&#39;re talking about sharing technical data with a non-profit organisation to help them maintain and improve the browser you rely on. Mozilla are removing a feature you use daily? Okay, did you enable the telemetry that lets them know you use it? Receiving and analysing user data is increasingly important to delivering a good user experience. If open-source projects can&#39;t access the same data as proprietary ones do, we can&#39;t expect them to be able to react to user demands in the same way, and so we can&#39;t expect them to be able to compete in today&#39;s market."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think part of this discussion needs to be that Firefox, while open source, doesn&#39;t provide footing for the community to build browser forks the way Chromium does. This sort of open usage, ironically, feels very fitting to the spirit of Firefox, but they&#39;re not even close to Chrom(e|ium).I&#39;ve been building a browser full time the past year+ (synth.app) and FF core wasn&#39;t really even an option. They&#39;ve done very little to make the engine usable outside of Firefox.Now I&#39;m sure there are a variety of savory and unsavory things that led here, but building that stuff out seems like a good way to grow the ecosystem. At least they would&#39;ve had a chance at capturing the Brave/Opera/Edge/etc market and those seats at the committees.This isn&#39;t to say that I&#39;m not worried about these standards merging like this. I&#39;ve spent many hours working out weird chromium only behaviors that websites rely on these days to do things (and egregiously so if they detect an agent remotely resembling chrome)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those who have worked around and at Stripe for the past decade, this is not a surprise. Stripe, and especially the founders, have a quite a poor reputation for screwing over people in and around their orbit.Almost every fintech startup has the story of Patrick reaching out about an acquisition, mining them for information playing along and then ghosting - same thing for candidates. They leadership team, specifically Patrick and Will Gaybrick are extremely smart but have screwed over a ton of people - be very careful about trusting.You don&#39;t hear anything about this online, they&#39;re incredibly effective at squashing hit pieces and have a huge amount of reporters and power brokers under their control. On HN and silicon valley Stripe and Patrick are a PR machine. Patrick has almost direct control over YC and HN, you&#39;ll notice that every single Stripe post automatically has pc as the first comment, regardless of anything else. Everything negative gets buried.With Patrick now living in Woodside, Will on permanent vacation in Malibu and John permanently in Ireland the company is definitely a bit in chaos mode internally. Their entire people team has turned over and they&#39;re having major retention issues - so I&#39;m not super surprised that stuff like this is starting to leak out.I run a $XB fintech, and am afraid to use my name given the backlash."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Had the opposite experience recently as an EM. Spent a few months trying to find a staff-level engineer. Found a great candidate who worked for a FAANG, worked to get our budget up to his expectations, sold him on the team, and he accepted our offer with a start date 6 weeks in the future so he could have time to wrap up his work. Fine, I&#39;m just happy to have filled the role after an arduous search. A few weeks go by, and he hasn&#39;t responded to my &#34;we&#39;re excited to have you join the team, etc&#34; email or any HR emails about filling out his paperwork. I call and email, the recruiter calls and emails, nothing. We never hear from him again..He&#39;s been active on social media so we know he&#39;s alive, and assume he parlayed our offer into a raise somewhere else. Ok, that happens, but to accept an offer and totally ghost? Jeez. I could have used those intervening weeks to interview more candidates had he just sent me a quick note, now I&#39;ve got to backfill his position while also trying to fill the new ones that just opened... I guess hiring is a shitshow from both sides sometimes."</p>

This software is very dead and abandoned at this point, and the only thing bearing its name is vaporware that appears to be so distant from the original as to effectively not even compete with it.Of course, the copyright holders have every legal right to do so. But doesn’t it seem pointless? This codebase probably has more historical interest than commercial by now. Am I missing something?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Honest question, as someone who actually used Winamp back in ~2004: why would you want to use it now?I have some nostalgia for it, sure, but what exactly does it actually offer you that something like VLC doesn&#39;t? It seems like it plays my music and videos competently enough, and I don&#39;t know anyone who actually uses Shoutcast anymore.This isn&#39;t a passive aggressive dig or anything, I would actually like to know."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"All TV&#39;s are dumb tv&#39;s if you only use them as an external display/monitor and don&#39;t connect them to the net. I have a dedicated computer for a media center and just use HDMI1 input on the TV. Never enter menus. Never update the OS. Never agree to anything. Never let the TV &#34;phone home.&#34; Never set up wifi. Never connect a CAT5 to it. Set the input using the remote and forget it. Treat it as a dumb monitor. Computer is connected to the net, TV is not and has no way to access it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Summing up the main options and linking to some comments that mentioned them:* extra-large gaming monitors, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29383077* Sceptre brand TVs (they can be purchased from Walmart) https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29383298* Projectors maybe, but 4k projectors are very expensive. (On the other hand, 1080p projectors look great in my opinion.)* Most big brands such as LG, Samsung, etc. have &#34;commercial displays&#34; or &#34;digital signage&#34; that are dumb or at least have fewer problematic features. One kind you&#39;ll see is marketed for putting in hotel or hospital rooms. Another kind is marketed for displaying at e.g. a bar/restaurant, building lobby, etc."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I get a horrible feeling in my stomach when I see these &#34;remote&#34; IDE options. I am very sure that they have their benefits, coding from a thin-client machine and having an &#34;always on&#34; session in the cloud ...But it feels like a slow errosion of our control and ownership of our tools. Where everything is becoming a rent-seeking opportunity and good tools are made available for a monthly rent.Personally I like having my whole build system, IDE, CI/CD on a machine I work at. I get this might not be for everyone, but I think we need to be careful what we give up long-term for these conveniences.Granted, I could just use VI and a terminal and nobody is forcing anyone to use anything ... but like many things, they are not like-choices.I depend on my tools, and the fewer dependencies to paid-montly SaaS features the better."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This looks very interesting.This was almost overdue. Since the beginning of Covid, the need for good remote code development raised quite a bit (at least for many people I know, including our team). When compared to VS Code and its remote editing over SSH, IntelliJ was really lacking. I know of a couple of people who went away from PyCharm just because of this.Related reports: https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/PY-19752, https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-226455I tried Code With Me but this seems limited to 10 minutes in the free version or so, and also not really intended for remote editing but more for pair programming.&gt; hosted in SpaceWhat does this mean? I have not really explored this so far. Can I host private own Space instances? I can imagine this would be a requirement in many environments.Is Space an alternative to GitHub or other hosting solutions? We would not want to move our code, issues and internal project management over to some other platform. We just want good remote editing support.Will there be a free community version of Fleet?Anyway, I applied for an invitation to Fleet Preview. Maybe I can get a chance soon to try it out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Meanwhile IntelliJ is rotting with months-old bugs that render entire features useless, with no fixes and no ETAs in sight. The only product that I pay money for that constantly, on almost every release, pains me with new bugs, a good portion of which are never fixed. I thought about using other Jetbrains products like DataGrip (and now this Fleet), but I&#39;m not going to invest even more into a company that simply refuses to fix bugs and regressions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So the cool thing about this demo was that I remember when it was first submitted many years ago and thought it a cool demo that demonstrated the viability of WebGL which I expected to take off a lot quicker than it has.But I also recently came across madebyevan.com again by accident after researching the backing of different npm projects to assess which ones had good momentum or commercial backing behind them to assess their long-term viability, and noticed a lot of npm projects (~2M weekly) relying on esbuild [1] as a fundamental part of their build system due to its amazing performance [1].All good except that the foundational part of many npm projects feature is mostly being maintained by a single developer [2], a @evanw who was also prolific in responding to esbuild&#39;s issue catering for different peoples issues &amp; feature requests. I didn&#39;t think this level of investment in a popular OSS project was sustainable and hoped they had good sponsorship behind them, but was surprised that @evanw [3] didn&#39;t have sponsorships enabled which I thought strange as most authors of popular npm projects have good sponsorship, but upon further research it&#39;s because Evan Wallace&#39;s day job is as the CTO and cofounder of Figma - a popular company with ~10B valuation.Which is great in that esbuild isn&#39;t at risk of being sporadically abandoned from its lead developer joining a new/demanding startup, on the other hand a foundational project in npm&#39;s ecosystem is being developed in the spare time of a Co-founder &amp; CTO of a ~10B Co - who also creates great demos :)[1] https://github.com/evanw/esbuild[2] https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/graphs/contributors[3] https://github.com/evanw"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Different cultures have different unwritten behaviours on roads.In the mountains of Italy, drivers give a short honk before entering a turn on a serpentine road, which usually can&#39;t be seen around. If there is no responding honk, they will take the full width of the road (making the very tight turn easier and faster). Tourist drivers have to pick up on this :)In much of Europe oncoming cars flash their lights to warn others about dangers and (especially) speed traps or police checks, so they can slow down in time.Here in Lithuania, flashing your warning lights (the four orange ones on the corners of the car) means thanks, for example if you let someone merge from one of the very short onramps. I&#39;ve never seen this in Germany, where onramps are however much longer.And amongst truck drivers it&#39;s pretty wide-spread to blink right to tell a following car you think it&#39;s safe for them to overtake you and blink left when you think it no longer is. At least on long roads where there are no obvious right turns. I flash them a grateful hand sign when passing their mirror."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ok, time to throw in the explanation I grew up with. I always thought it was definitive, but turns out its not. Unfortunately I have already passed on this urban legend :P.On foggy roads in north India, it is difficult to see vehicles on the road. So lights were used to indicate the status of big vehicles like trucks. Two lit bulbs on left and right corners (illuminating Horn Please) meant honk to get a pass. And to indicate you can overtake, the driver could light one bulb in the middle (illuminating a OK) to indicate its ok to take over. Eventually this system was scrapped but the tradition to paint &#34;Horn OK please&#34; remained.(my god the theory is falling apart in my own head as I retell it)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A reminder that pretty much no lorry driver in india knows English. Vehicles here have inane phrases like this and it’s for the most part almost protocol to paint them when you get a vehicle of that class. The guy who paints Lorry backs with the company name probably asks “you want the horn ok please phrase right” and the drivers probably like yeah whatever.Not like the drivers here expect courtesy from anyone around them. If anything they expect (and return in kind) douchebaggery. It’s like playing gta. Of course you expect every passerby to steal your car and you act accordingly.Similarly auto rickshaws all over Tamil Nadu used to ubiquitously have the phrase “the age for a woman to get married is 21”. Similar bullshit reason (though in this case the govt might have mandated it at some point, memory unclear). Thankfully it’s disappeared nowadays."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"(my day job is developer on Proof-of-Stake Algorand block chain, I&#39;m a developer, this may not be polished official PR)
Article&#39;s theory about malicious old blocks doesn&#39;t hold up. Let&#39;s say I start a new node and verify history since the beginning. Somewhere along the line I&#39;m connected to a malicious node which hands me a fictionalized block. It would need to have been signed by not just one but about 30-45 accounts _which had stake at that time_. Proof-of-Stake attacks aren&#39;t about having 51% of the CPU that overwhelms a Proof-of-Work system, but about having 60-70% of the _value_ in the network. So, if Warren Buffet comes along and wants to spam our network, I guess he could, but that would destroy the network and destroy his value that he sunk into the network. _That_ is a guardrail for PoS systems as much as any crypto or consensus-protocol element (and the algorithms are right, original article misunderstands them)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"PoW systems rely on the &#34;phone a friend method&#34; as well. When you download a Bitcoin client from a &#34;friend&#34;, you are trusting them to honestly introduce you to the network. If you fall asleep for a period of years, you have to trust your friends to honestly inform you of all of the PoW forks and policy changes that have occurred over that interval. The only difference is that PoS blockchain clients must be bundled with a modestly-recent block hash along with the thousands of lines of code that you have no practical way to audit.The problem eventually reduces to Ken Thompson&#39;s &#34;Trusting Trust&#34; [1] problem. There&#39;s no way to externally validate the honesty of any system (cryptocurrency, or otherwise).[1] https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rdriley/487/papers/Thompson_1984_Ref..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Proof of work has always had an economic flaw that you could theoretically temporarily rent enough mining power to perform double spends of more value than the cost of renting those devices.But this attack has never been performed because the reality of all these cryptocurrencies is that the security depends only relatively weakly on proof of work. Instead it relies on trust between the main stakeholders: miners, big nodes and developers. This is just like any other human organisation. That trust is only reinforced by proof of work, making it easier for new parties to become trusted."</p>

As a [mostly] self-taught software developer, I’ve been on the receiving end of a lot of this behavior.In my case, I have a real “Oh yeah? I’ll show you!” streak. I became expert at stuff, simply because some e-bully told me I was bad at it (because they were the only ones fit to judge others).Not everyone has that kind of stubbornness. I suspect that a hell of a lot of truly gifted folks never realized their passions, and that our industry has been robbed of significant talent, as a result.Maybe I’m looking at the past with rose-colored glasses, or I was fortunate to run into the people I did, but I don’t recall encountering a lot of this behavior, when I was getting started. I needed a lot of help and nurturing, when I was younger, until I reached the confidence level required to have an “Oh yeah?” response. I’m grateful that I got it.&#34;A new idea is delicate. It can be killed by a sneer or a yawn; it can be stabbed to death by a joke or worried to death by a frown on the right person&#39;s brow.&#34;

I think I have trained my brain so much on rapid skimming of websites for useful info, while throwing away most of the content, that I tend to do the same with books, which really doesn&#39;t work well.Has anyone found alternative ways to consume this information for brains that work like mine?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The thing that changed my career as a software engineer, in terms of seniority &amp; remuneration by time and effort, was by changing my efforts from learning arbitrary tech to learning the domain I worked in. Asking useful domain-related questions gets you noticed in stand ups and helps you write the right code. I work in fintech so the best bang for my buck I’ve had was reading an entry level cert in investment finance.I think the generic bit of this advice is to excel as an engineer is to focus on the business, not the tech."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This reminds me of the sort of light poking of common &#34;correlation is not the same as causation&#34; and &#34;beware of confounding factors&#34; statistical failures behind the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster &#34;clearly reduction in pirates has caused global warming!&#34; [0]. But it&#39;s a major in modern public discourse, and one for once that I&#39;m quite willing to lay heavily at the feet of the public education system. Easily one of the most valuable classes I took in my entire time K-12 was AP Probability &amp; Stats as a sophomore, but that was an entirely optional class with restricted openings anyway (a single teacher in a school of 1200+) which the vast majority never took even where it was offered. Yet interpreting the deluge of data in the modern world requires some level of being able to reason about things probabilisticly and have a sense of what actually goes into a measure of &#34;significance&#34;, null hypothesis and the danger of result-driven analysis finding links that don&#39;t exist and/or cannot possibly be causitive, how sampling a population works and what the error bars look like at different sizes, random vs biased distributions, the underlying distributions, confounding factors etc. I really wish in general kids got started on some light probability thinking as early as possible, in elementary school even, without any real math (let alone calc and such) yet, but just some initial stuff to start to illustrate the mindset. Lots of very fun games and hands-on exercises with dice and so on use or could be made to use important aspects of probability and its misuse.At any rate, I&#39;m certainly not an expert. But there seems to be some missing BS filter where people can recognize something as silly if the example is silly enough but not in the exact same logic fail for something that seems &#34;more reasonable somehow&#34;.----0: https://www.spaghettimonster.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The biggest news, of course, is the addition of the long-awaited STRICT mode which fixes SQLite&#39;s biggest shortcoming (at least from a particular perspective) by turning into a proper, strongly-typed datastore.https://www.sqlite.org/stricttables.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well I definitely prefer the new strict mode, I&#39;ll enable that right away. I&#39;ve long fantasized about a mode that would make SQLite behave like a normal SQL database, but this is not that. You still can&#39;t store a float in the database and get it back out unmodified. SQLite will expand it to a double, and it can&#39;t store NaNs. And probably more overhead to be able to support storing strings in my REAL column. Oh well.I tried out DuckDB which is more my style but the .NET libs are poor and I can&#39;t shave that yak right now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;  Content inserted into the column with a datatype other than ANY must be either a NULL (assuming there is no NOT NULL constraint on the column) or the type specified. SQLite attempts to coerce the data into the appropriate type using the usual affinity rules, [...].I would like an even stricter mode with no automatic type coercion."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My guess - DocuSign has a hard to penetrate moat: It&#39;s known and accepted in courts. Everything else doesn&#39;t really matter.Imagine you&#39;re a legal department. You have to choose between DocuSign, which you know the court will accept, or a competitor. DocuSign costs 10x as much as the competitor. But that&#39;s nothing compared to the cost of litigation, or worse, the cost of losing litigation. So you will likely choose DocuSign anyways."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In every big transaction,” said Leech, “there is a magic moment during which a man has surrendered a treasure, and during which the man who is due to receive it has not yet done so. An alert lawyer will make that moment his own, possessing the treasure for a magic microsecond, taking a little of it, passing it on. If the man who is to receive the treasure is unused to wealth, has an inferiority complex and shapeless feelings of guilt, as most people do, the lawyer can often take as much as half the bundle, and still receive the recipient’s blubbering thanks.”- Kurt Vonnegut, God Bless You Mr. Rosewater"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; legally binding way to put signatures and timestamps on a PDF.IANAL, but the idea that a signature is what makes a contract legally binding is not exactly true. It is a symbol of the acceptance of the contract, but legal acceptance can take many forms - so whether you use a service to signify acceptance, or just sign it using acrobat or Adobe&#39;s site, or even just a verbal agreement... those are all valid acceptance, legally speaking.DocuSign&#39;s use case is not the signing, but the management of those documents and signatures - tracking which documents are sent, which have been read (yes, the doc owner can get notified when you even look at a Docusign document), which have been signed, and being able to store copies of signed docs. It is mostly for the companies sending you contracts, not for you as the signer."</p>

The guy started out just wanted to share the basics and now I think he makes a living through that site.EDIT: I should also add that I know drawabox is off topic, but it is IMO a great example of where education might be going. Carefully constructed resources and advice for self-motivated learners, and a patreon to support it. The people at teachyourselfcs.com can learn from this site."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a self-taught programmer and I&#39;ve been looking at this curriculum longingly for a while now. I&#39;ve been working up the courage to quit a cushy but unfulfilling job to study CS full-time (also math and physics, but that&#39;s just for fun).I fell in love with programming after I started working, and have spent the last 7 years automating everything I can in my job. I&#39;m confident in my ability to solve problems, but I&#39;m missing a solid understanding of the fundamentals.I already have a BS in Materials Engineering, and I have mixed feelings about returning to university. Tuition has doubled since I graduated, and I&#39;m perfectly capable of teaching myself. The authors of teachyourselfcs.com have some strong opinions on CS masters degrees, though I would consider it if I found a topic that really called out to me AFTER I had built those fundamentals.I have plenty of savings, but I&#39;m worried that my effort will be wasted if it doesn&#39;t come with an exclusive piece of paper at the end. Will it be an obstacle, or am I worried over nothing?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;In recent weeks, infections have increased steeply, coinciding with the detection of B.1.1.529 variant. The first known confirmed B.1.1.529 infection was from a specimen collected on 9 November 2021.This variant has a large number of mutations, some of which are concerning. Preliminary evidence suggests an increased risk of reinfection with this variant, as compared to other VOCs. The number of cases of this variant appears to be increasing in almost all provinces in South Africa&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My current take (not a virologist, doctor):At this point, if you are not immunocompromised and you have the first vaccination and a booster. You should be able to easily recover regardless of the mutation(s). The virus would need to completely diverge from SARS-CoV-2 in order to fully defeat the countermeasures of the current vaccinations."</p>
