								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Source: I work in the field.This is a current limitation, and an artifact of the data+method but not something that should be relied upon.If we do some adversary modelling, we can find two ways to work around this:1) actively generate and search for such data; perhaps expensive for small actors but not well equipped malicious ones.2) wait for deep learning to catch up, e.g. by extending NERFs (neural radiance fields) to faces; matter of time.Now, if your company/government is on the bleeding edge of ML-based deception, they can have such policy, and they will update it 12-18-24 months (or whenever (1) or (2) materialises). However, I don&#39;t know one organisation that doesn&#39;t have some outdated security guideline that they cling to, e.g. old school password rules and rotations.Will &#34;turning sideways to spot a deepfake&#34; be a valid test in 5 years? Prolly no, so don&#39;t base your secops around this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a constant cat-and-mouse game. When I worked in this space (2019-2021), the best defense against deep fakes was looking at the microfacial behavior/kinematics of the &#34;puppetmaster&#34; and comparing against known standards of the deepfake subject. Works even if the fake is pixel-perfect (since it looks at the facial &#34;wireframe&#34; rather than the image itself). The obvious downside is you need sample data of the subject (and usually tons of it). I wonder if that general approach can be optimized. E.g. Deep fakes tend to struggle with certain fine movement/detail, if you had a reflection of the subject, the algorithm would have to not just replicate the main face and the mirror, but also be completely optically consistent.Was a fun project, but the cat-and-mouse feeling was inescapable. 
For those curious, look up the DARPA MediFor project. Siwei Lyu (in the article) did a bunch of work in this space. Also see Hany Farid and Shruti Agarwal. They&#39;ve worked specifically with deep fake detection.https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14491"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Slightly more robust method...Ask the caller to move out of the frame and then back in again.You will see a noticable &#39;step&#39; as the face that is partially in the frame suddenly gets detected as a face and the deepfake is applied.The only way around this is to crop the input video quite heavily - by at least one face diameter, which is a lot if the user is near the camera."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I got super lucky. I started a company and didn’t really have any meaningful traction. I was about to shut it down. Walking out of the grocery store one night after work, I passed by my former manager when I was an intern. We got to talk for about 30 seconds, mentioned my company, she asked me to email her. I did, and that very quickly led to my first big customer which makes me about double what a FAANG swe would make.My advice: get lucky.My insight porn version: 10 easy steps I used to get $500K ARR and how you can do it too"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Jonathan Haidt speaks about something similar in The Happiness Hypothesis. Epiphanies can only take you so far, before their novelty wears off and they lose the power to change your behaviour. This is why self-help book readers tend to keep reading self-help books. 4 weeks after finishing one they need another hit of epiphanies.Even the lamest examples listed in the OP article can probably give someone a boost in productivity for a while, as long as that epiphanic rush lasts.I&#39;ve felt this in myself over the years. I&#39;d hit a low point and try to hoist myself out of it, with some sombre new ethical code for creating a work ethic; some new note taking system; or epiphany gleaned from Shakespeare or Nietzsche.You can see it in the Jordan Peterson clips that haunt my YouTube shorts."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Out of the 3 &#34;Insight Porn&#34; examples linked in the article, I think the Paul Graham essay seems out of place. I know I know, this is hacker news. Yet another person sticking up for pg. But I just don&#39;t think this essay (or others) is really trying to boil some dream/goal into steps. In fact, in the &#34;How to get startup ideas&#34; referenced in this post, pg says:&#34;So if you can&#39;t predict whether there&#39;s a path out of an idea, how do you choose between ideas? The truth is disappointing but interesting: if you&#39;re the right sort of person, you have the right sort of hunches. If you&#39;re at the leading edge of a field that&#39;s changing fast, when you have a hunch that something is worth doing, you&#39;re more likely to be right.&#34;To me, he is doing the opposite of insight porn. Basically saying this might not even be for you. He doesn&#39;t even suggest that you go become an expert in something. Rather, he just throws his hands up. He tries to spare you from the disappointment of hearing this by calling it &#34;interesting&#34;. That contrasts _a lot_ with what most of the insight porn is trying to convince you of. They rarely try to disappoint you and mostly just hype/pump you up."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;&#34;While the role of the artist isn’t going away soon, the role of stock image sites might disappear. &#34;Not, yet. While it&#39;s cheap relative to stock images, it&#39;s time consuming to generate exactly what you want. Prices for stock images will collapse for the common quick to use images but the price for the specialized high end images will hold their value or even increase in value. Those historical and such images will continue to be valuable.It will be interesting to see if a specialized job will rise where people will get paid to generate just the right image. It might be called &#34;A.I. image artist &#34; This individual will generate an image with an A.I. but use graphic tools to finalize it for use."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Honestly, this is an awesome use of DALL-E and I&#39;ll probably start doing the same for my blogIt&#39;s perfect because:- The images just need to get across a vibe, they don&#39;t need to be perfect- It&#39;s a low-value enough use of images that you&#39;d probably never commission a human artist to do them; instead you&#39;d either use stock photos, or skip having images completely- The nature of header images for a tech blog tends toward the abstract/surreal, which means it&#39;s either hard to find the right stock images, or the ones you do find will be super abstract to the point of being boringAll of these make it a great use of the technology"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Given the irregular distance between holes and the different angles of the holes, I&#39;d guess something organic. There&#39;s still a lot we don&#39;t know about even well known fish like sharks, what to talk of fish or marine life that we have yet to discover.

That would allow my older S1 Sonos gear (which I spent thousands on) to have basically unlimited life."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is one of those gotcha that trap senior devs way more than junior devs. Growing up with C being my first language, I intuitively associate switch with a jmp table (ie extremely fast). Even though I knew it’s unlikely to be as performant in JS, it never occurred to me that it would actually be slow, until I did a deep dive into low level JS optimization.Related: Matt Godbolt’s talk on emulating 6502 in JS. He also mentions the poor performance of switch for opcodes: https://youtu.be/7WuRq-Wmw5o"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like function tables. I think they are cleaner than switch statementsBut, (maybe this is an invalid test), checking today my results suggest a switch is faster than a function table in 2022? At least at a base level. Maybe the more complicated the code for each case gets the less likely it is to get optimized.... which is true in general? large code blocks are less likely to get optimized and a switch is considered one large code block.https://jsbenchit.org/?src=5c1e5bcf62448b6d1750b12893b0f0a1"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the title, I expected to find one of the frequently called case statements was unoptimized and they fixed it. Instead, the fix was rewriting all case statements in a way the javascript engine would optimize. Very frustrating if you&#39;re unaware of the obscure rules around it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Whether it’s because I was wrong, or failed to make the argument [for HTTP trailers support], I strongly suspect organizational boundaries had a substantial effect. The Area Tech Leads of Cloud also failed to convince their peers in Chrome, and as a result, trailers were ripped out [from the WHATWG fetch specification].FWIW, I personally think it&#39;s a good thing that other teams within Google don&#39;t have too much of an &#34;advantage&#34; for getting features into Chrome, compared to other web developers, however, I also think it&#39;s very unfortunate that a single Chrome engineer gets to decide not only that it shouldn&#39;t be implemented in Chromium, but that that also has the effect of it being removed from the specification. (The linked issue [1] was also opened by a Google employee.)Of course, you might reasonably argue that, without consensus among the browsers to implement a feature, having it in the spec is useless. But nevertheless, with Chromium being an open source project, I think it would be better if it had a more democratic process of deciding which features should be supported (without, of course, requiring Google specifically to implement them, but also without, ideally, giving Google the power to veto them).[1]: https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/772"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had never heard of HTTP trailers. So FYI&gt; The Trailer response header allows the sender to include additional fields at the end of chunked messages in order to supply metadata that might be dynamically generated while the message body is sent, such as a message integrity check, digital signature, or post-processing status.https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Tr..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A few years ago I worked on a service that had to stream data out using protobuf messages, in a single request that could potentially transfer several gigabytes of data. At the HTTP level it was chunked, but above that I used a protobuf message that contained data plus a checksum of that data, with the last message of the stream containing no data but a checksum of the entire dataset (a flag was included to differentiate between the message types).This simple design led us to find several bugs in clients of this API (e.g. messages dropped or processed twice), and gave us a way to avoid some of the issues mentioned in this article. Even if you don&#39;t use HTTP trailers, you can still use them one layer above and benefit from similar guarantees."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is kind of stunning.  They appear to have discovered something like 30 novel (previously unknown) immune cell receptor interactions (Fig 1).  Then they built a quantitive model, looked into where these interactions are localized in the body, and lots more beside.  A truly ridiculous amount of information for a single paper. This seems to be the &#39;what&#39;s it all about&#39; paragraph in the paper:&gt; &#34;The immune system is distinctive for being a distributed system. It is not fixed to a single localized organ in the body, but rather is made up of numerous specialized cell types that must adaptably organize their intercellular connections to respond to pathogens and other threats wherever they may appear. We provide a systematic and quantitative view of the cell-surface proteins that enable immune cells to dynamically wire their interactions. The receptor interactions that we report in our network each merit further individualized study to characterize their full roles in health and disease.&#34;For those interested in computational modeling (basically they simulate immune cells circulating freely within the body and interacting based on their receptor types), here&#39;s the supplementary description link (pdf), which is enough for a whole paper on its own.https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs415..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who struggles with some vague immune system issues with more questions than answers, I was shocked at how much knowledge of the immune system is presented here. I was immediately curious about how I can apply this knowledge to help me understand my own immune issues. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t know enough about biology and chemistry to understand much of this. But I found this bit near the end encouraging, and a helpful summary of what is presented here:&gt; More broadly, the integrated approaches that we pioneered here for disentangling the immune system provide a framework for future systematic investigations ... Our analysis and the methods that we developed provide a template for future studies looking at physical cell wiring networks in detail. From these combined approaches, we may finally begin to disentangle cellular circuits in immunity and beyond, bridging from individual protein molecules to multicellular behaviour.This seems to be a comprehensive model on a level that has never been seen before, so in that sense, I&#39;m very excited about it. I just hope it doesn&#39;t take decades to trickle down into providers&#39; hands who can actually do something to help patients."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am really, really excited for the day we are able to augment or manipulate the immune system in a large and meaningful way.For anyone who likes to visualize the whole kit and kaboodle of current human knowledge check out the virtual metabolic human database.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s not even just batteries. Every laptop I&#39;ve ever owned comes with a AC to DC converter. Every laptop I&#39;ve ever owned has outlived that AC-to-DC converter. Every converter that has failed has failed in exactly the same way: the plug/cord connection at the laptop end becomes unreliable.And every single one of them, across a range of manufacturers, has had the cord not be detachable from the brick. So what could have been a simple $5 replacement cord is now &#34;replace the entire converter&#34; and is now $30 if you try to find a third-party and pray they&#39;re not a fraud, or $50 from the manufacturer. Meanwhile at perfectly good converter (sans cord) is landfill.But lo and behold: the brick-to-wall cord is detachable. And funny that, that one never breaks…"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It would be great if consumer electronics products had expected lifetime ratings on the front. People would naturally take issue with products with significantly below median lifetime, and also if their own products didn&#39;t live up to the lifetime.It would also make sense to phrase other quantities on product packaging in the way they&#39;re experienced by the consumer: instead of emphasising the wattage of a bulb, if you showed the lumens/$, more efficient bulbs would naturally win out. Instead, LED bulbs have fake wattage numbers to show the equivalent wattage incandescent lighting that would be needed to match the LED."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have been a long time enthusiast of high power flashlights. We typically use 18350, 18650, 21700, or 26650. But I have been in dismay as even in this community, companies are starting to move away from these standards and provide proprietary batteries (Olight) or sealed (some newer Fenix models).It would be good if* We could safely obtain reputable Li-ion batteries from reputable sources. I trust a handful of companies to vet their supply chain so I&#39;m confident of authentic cells like Murata VT6, etc .. but its less than ideal. I don&#39;t think my mom would be able to just find a authentic 18650, and this has to pass the mom test* Easy way to recycle these cells. This needs to expand past home improvement stores, which often seem clueless as to the specifics of what they can accept"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"About 8 years ago, I blogged a very brief guide to using git for a solo developer. A lot of people seemed to like it.A couple times since then, I&#39;ve noticed there was something I was using that wasn&#39;t in it, but that could be added without making it significantly longer or more complicated. So there were a couple of updates.I did another one today, and had the thought that since this guide now includes the benefit of 8 years of practical experience in actually using it, while still essentially being &#34;Git In Two Minutes&#34;, it might be worth posting to HN. So here it is.It doesn&#39;t say anything about github. It really is for a solo developer who wants to start using git in a very painless way. With the additional goal that you can profitably use git for years without going beyond the described features.https://www.garyrobinson.net/2014/10/git-in-two-minutes-for-..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sounds amazing, would love for something like this for racing sims (CPUs these days have more cores than good uses for those cores...)For the gotchas - I&#39;d guess that the exhaust manifolds would make a huge difference in terms of sound, and they seem hard to simulate. For example, engineers tune the individual per-cylinder exhaust distance - this way, the exhaust fumes from each individual cylinder align nicely once the exhaust from each cylinder merge into the final exhaust pipe. Otherwise, if, for example, the firing pattern is 1-5-..., then the air from cylinder 1 might arrive to the exhaust pipe at the same time as air from cylinder 5, given high RPMs and limited speed of sound.And the fluid dynamics of the cylinders are something that is extremely critical to modern cars, too. And I&#39;d guess that this is where things like misfires can be simulated.Disclaimer - this is all based on my highly unsophisticated mental model,"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The thing that got me into computing was watching an engine simulation my dad, a mechanical engineer, wrote in BASIC. He wanted to get some numbers on the mechanical advantages of various crank designs, so he only simulated the piston, crank, and crankshaft. And it chugged at about 1 fps on a TRS-80 Model II. But still, seeing that piston and crank arm move made me realize computers are capable of truly wondrous things.And if that was the Lv 1, this is the Lv 99."</p>

(Since the intersubject variability and potentially also the natural intrasubject variability for most measured scales seem higher than any expected treatment effect).I am almost certain that e.g. none of the approved and quite convincingly working SSRI:s would have shown any efficacy in a study with this design and similar N."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Thanks for the kind mention!I am Stephane, the person behind that website/project. I see a lot of people having concerns about the title - Background Sound Canceller - and they are right. That title is not mine, but poster&#39;s own.I describe my project as &#34;Background Noise Generators&#34;, or sometimes as as &#34;Non-Distracting Noises and Music&#34;.They are not sound cancellers but sound maskers.The idea is to create a noise you like, to mask a sound that you don&#39;t want to hear. Your colleagues, tinnitus, ... anything.Because these noise generators are designed to be non-distracting, there is a big chance that your brain will not even hear them after a couple of minutes... but they will keep masking the nuisance you wanted to het rid of in the first place. That is the magic exploited by the project. Create these sonic &#34;focus bubbles&#34;.Happy listening."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I expected a website offering to use your microphone to record, invert and cancel background noise via the speakers. Turns out the website is offering prerecorded sounds instead, not really cancelling anything. Still though, surely someone has tried my idea? It would likely need some adjustability to match the phase delay between microphone and ears-via-speakers but I guess it could work."</p>

Please known that VLA is about the typing not about the storage.The line:    typedef int T[n];

is the essence of VLA-ness, not `int A[n]`. The array of VLA type can have any kind of storage one wants.It can be stack    T a;

It can be heap    T *a = malloc(sizeof *a);

It can be even infamous alloca()    T *a = alloca(sizeof *a);

Please stop talking about this &#34;VLA is stack-base vector&#34; crap because it means that one does not understand what VLAs are about. I admin that automatic VLAs are pretty much always wrong but this use case is a tiny bit of the realy functionality of VLA types.VLA were added to language to handle multidimensional arrays.And the really shine at this task. Even C++ has not good alternative for it. Vector of vectors is a really crappy data structure.A few examples when working with square matrices:- allocation on stack    float A[n][n];

- allocation on heap    float (*A)[n] = malloc(sizeof(int[n][n]));
    ...
    free(A);

- indexing    A[i][j]

- passing to functions:    void add(int n, float A[static n][n], float B[static n][n], float RES[restrict static n][n]);

    ...

Please show me something as simple, effective, self-documenting and elegant in C++."</p>

That means there are now two apps called &#34;Google Meet.&#34; Google has a help article detailing this extremely confusing situation, calling the two Meet apps &#34;Google Meet (original): The updated Meet app&#34; and &#34;Google Meet: The updated Duo app.&#34; The &#34;Google Meet (original)&#34; app will someday be put out to pasture; it&#39;s just sticking around while Google rebuilds the meeting functionality on top of Google Duo. Did everyone follow that?I&#39;m in stitches; dying of laughter over here. Folding together apps to reduce the number of chat apps if probably a good thing, but renaming them to an existing name while the old app is still around? Even Microsoft had the decency to tack on &#34;for business&#34; when they were butchering Skype&#39;s branding!On a more serious note, I&#39;ll be interested to see how this affects the business side of things; will Google Workspace keep Meet, and what Meet will it be?EDIT: Reading through the linked help article, they talk about Google Workspace under the section for the new &#34;Meet&#34; nee Duo and not under the section for &#34;Google Meet (original)&#34;, so I guess they have or will transition it. Probably."</p>

Now it’s just cringy.What is going on over there? Why are they not able to make up their damn minds and come up with one app?Google reminds me of Ballmer’s Microsoft. Factions on top of factions and no leadership anywhere to be found."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Haxe is really unusual and interesting, and I don&#39;t think it gets talked about enough.&gt; Haxe can build cross-platform applications targeting JavaScript, C++, C#, Java, JVM, Python, Lua, PHP, Flash, and allows access to each platform&#39;s native capabilities. Haxe has its own VMs (HashLink and NekoVM) but can also run in interpreted mode.Compiling from one language to another isnt particularly unusual, but compiling from one language to so many is very unusual. On first impression it sounds unserious—real compilers output machine code—it&#39;s tempting to denigrate it by calling it a transpiler. But there are a lot of advantages that come with this approach. You always have access to the full capabilities of your target platforms. From a single language you can write code that is massively portable while also targeting specific platforms with just an if statement.The &#34;real&#34; compiler authors spend months working on linkage, calling conventions, runtimes, symbol mangling, allocators, and debuginfo trying to get their native code to link properly to the objective-c frameworks on iOS—and it never feels quite right. If you instead compile to objective-c, a lot of things get easier. It&#39;s a very pragmatic approach."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The blog post is really top tier. Consider how much time some engineers spend considering details when they&#39;re just being contracted to do a job (I&#39;ve work with lots) and how this indie game project is being explained, nitpicked, loved and cherished.The blog post alone makes you want to purchase whatever this person has been working on based on how much passion is oozing off the explanation of how it&#39;s made.Side note... A lot of YouTubers also work like this: pushing the craftsmanship to beyond expectation to almost cause an emotional reaction.In this case though, it&#39;s genuine engineering with high standards."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The biggest problem with graphql is that you have to do a lot of non-obvious work to harden your system against DOS attacks or people that want to fly by and download your whole database. It&#39;s easy to construct a query which puts unreasonable load on your system.The more fine-grained nature of boring REST calls makes it more easy to control client impact on the system.If you want to see the kind of work you actually need to put in to make a graphql API, look at Shopify. They have rate limits based on quantity of data returned. Cursors and pagination. The schema is a huge ugly mess with extra layers that never show up in the pretty examples of GraphQL on the internet.Note that even if you use graphql for a private api to your web client, folks will reverse engineer it and use it for their own purposes. There are no private apis on the web.I&#39;m not a fan of graphql for anything that the public could see. It&#39;s somewhat akin to exposing a SQL interface; it opens up too many avenues of trouble. Keep public communication channels as dumb as possible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Having worked in big tech and small startups, I think GraphQL is a brilliant way to solve an organizational problem that massive tech companies have.It&#39;s that the team maintaining the API is different from the team that needs changes to the API. Due to the scale of the organization the latter doesn&#39;t have the access or know-how to easily add fields to that API themselves, so they have to wait for the maintainers to add the work to their roadmap and get back to it in a few quarters. Relevant Krazam: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8OnoxKotPQAt a small start-up, if the GET /foo/:fooId/bar/ endpoint is missing a field baz you need, you can usually just add it yourself and move on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Whether it was the intention or not, I find GraphQL solved a fascinating problem: it let front end developers move faster by greatly decoupling their data needs from the backend developers.Backend developers describe the data model, expose it via graphql. Front end developers, often ones who never met those backend developers, can see the data model and just use it. They can change what they&#39;re querying on the fly, get more or less as they see fit.It lets everyone move faster.But as a backend developer, I actually fucking hate it, myself."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Tried splitting a complex arrangement (Chicago by Sufjan Stevens). Drums bass and vocals come out fairly well, though the drums stem seems to lack other percussion elements outside of the core rock drumkit (e.g. tamborine), and cymbals hits are clipped rather than ringing. The &#39;other&#39; stem, the rest of the instrumentation, keeps a fair bit of the percussion and there&#39;s bleed from the vocal melody.The backing vocals seem to have disappeared for the most part, and are only audible in the vocals stem when the lead vocal is present (like they&#39;re reverse-ducked? Been a while since I did any production, the terms have escaped me...).Not much use with complex arrangements to be honest, I was hoping to get things like the strings section separated from the rest of the arrangement.Original: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWX3El-slpYOutput: https://file.io/etpOQt57ziKe"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The Old Norse word for Saturday, laugardagr, literally means &#34;washing day&#34;. This custom still survives here in countryside Eastern Europe where many people routinely go to sauna (banya) every Saturday (or Sunday like my family). Before the 20th century,  a lot of Eastern Europe (especially Russia) still lived like they lived in the middle ages: 95% of the country were serfs on feudal property living in traditional wooden houses with no modern benefits of civilization, and the bathing culture was pervasive: there were saunas (banyas) everywhere, and most villages were close to a river so water access was not a problem. Saunas were also a place where people gave birth. I find it hard to believe that Russian peasants were living the same lifestyle for centuries and only recently decided to start bathing. My family comes from Old Believers, a religous group which rejected church reforms of the 1600&#39;s and went into hiding in taiga, they preserved pretty ancient customs and their bathing culture was pretty intricate: for example, there always must be a separate towel/bucket of water for head, body, feet - this wouldn&#39;t have developed without a rich bathing culture before. Those villagers who could not afford their own sauna bathed in... ovens (inside the house). It&#39;s one of the older customs still preserved in some places. The traditional oven was pretty large and a whole person could fit in it. My mother was bathed like that when she was a child in their Old Believer village. However, I don&#39;t know if this was specific to Eastern/Northern Europe or common in Western Europe, too. I remember reading that due to overpopulation and deforestation it was harder for West Europeans to have frequent bathing every week. But here, population wasn&#39;t dense and forests were abundant."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Its funny that western history distorts the history of the rest of the world.I hear western kids saying no one used to bathe in the ancient times.As an Indian, it was practically mandatory for each and every individual to take a bath at-least two times a day. Additionally the following customs were very prevalent till recent times.  1. Washing legs after coming home from outside.
  2. Washing hands, face and legs before sitting to eat food.
  3. Washing whole body after sex.
  4. Washing legs before entering others homes.
  5. Leaving footwear outside the *gate* of any home before entering it.
  6. A full bath in a river / lake / house tank *before* sunrise and once *before* sunset.

Also, body was supposed to be massaged with oil of sesame seeds (once a week), and greengram flour was rubbed on every part of the body. After sitting in the sun like this for a few minutes, the flour was scrubbed off by hand, and then a hot water bath taken.For shampoo, two traditional herbs are recommended. Kunkudukai and shikakai. Both are used as it is without any processing. Kunkudukai would be crushed and mixed with water to form a liquid and then applied on head. Amazingly, it would form a lather when rubbed on the head. I remember doing this type of head bath every sunday, until about 2005. Any shampoo was forbidden in our home. The items were dead cheap too.[Edit]Kinkudukai is also called soapnut.https://www.stylecraze.com/articles/benefits-of-soapnuts-for...The above site tends to exaggerate the benifits a bit, but it is believed that kunkudukai inhibhits dandruff and is anti-fungal and anti-bacterial.By personal experience, it tastes absolutely vomit inducing bitter and will burn your eyes to high hell if as much as a diluted drop enters it.Its a natural, safe and environmentally friendly way of taking a head bath."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"ughh I dislike when pop history takes this smarmy tone and is also not particularly accurate.&gt; In fact soap is a motherfucking medieval invention. Yes. It is. The Romans – whomst I don’t see a bunch of basics going around accusing of being filthy –  did not, in fact have soap, in contrast. They usually washed using oil. Medieval people? Oh you better believe that they had soap.Wait a minute, what about Aleppo soap? I thought the Romans knew of it and Wikipedia alleges the same in their article:&gt; Although it has been claimed that soap-making was introduced to the West from the Levant after the First Crusades, in fact, soap was known to the Romans in the first century AD and Zosimos of Panopolis described soap and soapmaking in c. 300 AD.Citation: https://www.google.com/books/edition/A_History_of_Greek_Fire...Then the OP author goes on to say:&gt; It was first introduced from the East, like most good stuff was at the time, but it took off rather quickly.This contradicts their claim that soap was a medieval invention! It wasn&#39;t a medieval invention. It was adopted technology.That&#39;s not a big deal I guess, but if you&#39;re going to make a rant about historical accuracies, what else isn&#39;t exactly accurate here? It seems the effort is put into the berating imaginary enemies rather than the writing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I once was shipped a _very expensive_ server motherboard from Amazon by mistake when trying to buy something cheaper. The customer service agent (Indian non native speaker) failed to understand that Amazon didn’t ship the correct item, and refused the return. I spoke to another agent and they thanked me and I got the correct item exchanged.I previously posted about this on HN and one of the responses was “who cares? Az makes $100k/min”You know what? It matters. Doing the right thing fucking matters. Have some integrity, don’t take what isn’t yours, give back what was a mistake. Don’t fall into the trap of relativism.You don’t know the whole story either... I’d like to think by returning that item I saved someone from getting fired; or a saved a small low margin retailer from losing their shirt. I’ll never know, but at the end of the day I can sleep with a clean conscience."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The clothing company LL Bean dealt with this same sort of issue.  It used to be that if you weren&#39;t happy with a purchase, you could return any item you bought from Bean, at any time, for a full refund.One day, the CEO of the company donated some of his old LL Bean clothing to a charity that accepts used clothing.  One of the shirts he donated had his initials embroidered on it.  In less than a month, that same shirt had been returned to Bean, stating the person was unsatisfied with his purchase, and requesting a full refund of the purchase price."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Super informative article, with a lot of little insights, claims, and customer blames.  Some are exceedingly fair, others are shirking responsibility on the seller&#39;s side.  Still a great read!1. &gt; If an item is in good shape or really is new and just unwanted, the packaging is almost always damaged beyond what could be considered a new item, so at best we might be able to sell it in a damaged package sale, which we do twice per year.It&#39;s generally difficult to open products without damaging the packaging.This is an intentional design with consumer packaged goods, likely for a variety of valid reasons.Doesn&#39;t seem like the customer&#39;s fault (and shouldn&#39;t be the customer&#39;s problem), as long as the customer is being honest and not pulling a fraudulent return.2. &gt; but the Pista has two little screws that you have to remove take the thing apart and when we looked, all of these returned pumps have had those screws unthreaded which you can see as deformation in the screw head, whereas a new in box pump has only had them installed.Does this suggest the manufacturer is using sub-par zinc screws instead of stainless steel?  So many products have cheap screws that basically can&#39;t be removed without stripping or deforming the head, it makes the product unserviceable and dooms it to eventually land in a landfill, prematurely.  Seems unacceptable to call a product top-notch with these kinds of components inside.Fraudulent returns are still bad, as are shoddy products falsely marketed and sold as top-notch gems.3. &gt; Folks think they’re pulling one over on Jeff Bezos but don’t understand Amazon doesn’t own that inventory, it belongs to companies and when you think you’re screwing Amazon you’re actually screwing directly with some smaller company behind the product.This is 100% on Amazon, due to marketing things as &#34;Amazon Prime&#34; and &#34;Sold and Fulfilled by Amazon&#34;.  Nasty, because the customer signals get to be ignored by Amazon as they reap the profits and offload the problem downstream onto Little Companies."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I remember MySpace being described as &#34;an easy personal website&#34; back in high school.Unfortunately, it&#39;s not easy to make an easy personal website today. Personal sites take so much work to design, and most feel stale because they don&#39;t have dynamic content like posts. About.me used to be great, but it didn&#39;t get maintained.I&#39;m working on a project to make personal websites as easy to set up as a social profile. No designs to pick - just a photo and profile photo. Not static - you have a mailing list and the latest post is shown on the homepage. And, people can &#34;follow&#34; with their emails.Facebook used to be pitched as &#34;the place everybody is&#34;, but that&#39;s no longer true - social networks are getting dis-aggregated. So, I expect personal sites to become a way for people to gain more control over their audiences, and to help move an audience from one platform to another (via a &#34;link in bio&#34; to their personal sites)If you&#39;re interested in trying out my project for your own site:https://postcard.page(Will trade free access for feedback!)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When social networks started taking off, in the spirit of the late 00s there was a push to create standards for distributed social networks so that personal websites could replicate a lot of what social networks did. DiSo is one that comes to mind [1].The fact was...people didn&#39;t care. It made building harder...not easier.I think it&#39;s inevitable. Over time, adoption trends towards easy UX, and open standards almost by their nature lag behind silos in their ability to optimize experience.[1] https://diso-project.org/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The hard part is finding the interesting websites - there is such a firehose of content that we&#39;ve necessitated a separate role for content curators.I get Thinking About Things, which points me to interesting sites on the internet (https://thinking-about-things.com/). Another great one is Findka essays (https://essays.findka.com/). Would love to hear any other recommendations."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am using freebsd since version 8 for all my server needs (was using linux, but got repelled by its chaos which I dont care about on my laptop, but it pisses me off on server).Some more points:- bhyve, developed by netapp, they ditched all old technologies support and it works faster on my i5 server than kvm on my i7 laptop. Snapshoting using ZFS is not a feature to discard either.- FIBs, absolute miracle routing tables that you can apply to whatever software, define the routes as fib 1 (lets say it is openvpn) and then use them as simply as `setfib 1 bash` to use them in all child processes- backward compatibility, this is where linux is really horrible, there was an article about compiling binary on freebsd 2 and running it on freebsd 10. Try this on linux, binaries are not compatible even on minor versions.- jails... docker? Really? Jails are 15+ years old implementation, kernel supported, that stood test of time, actually being a security feature. It runs circles around the docker in everything except how much it was adapted by community. I never understood why people rather used an inferior solution like docker.- not to mention all the chaos in linux ecosystem, in next sub-version, the commands can have completely different switches,...I will never understand on what technical merits people are using linux for servers except the support-ability of hardware. Due to the whole show that linux is getting we would prosper as a humanity by ditching the linux. Unfortunately, marketing is worth more than anything.(I do understand that people will not agree due to their preference, but try to use it. I doubt you will prefer linux ever again.)"</p>

The installer recognizes it, but the driver doesn&#39;t work.- The console terminal defaults to 80x25, I don&#39;t know how to resize it.- I can&#39;t figure out how to start X Windows.- If I run it in a VM (e.g. VirtualBox), the network bridging doesn&#39;t work so my FreeBSD instance has no internet access.It&#39;s probably my fault, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s in the docs somewhere. But it probably means that I&#39;m not the target audience for FreeBSD, since I don&#39;t have the time and patience to figure out the most basic things."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One application where FreeBSD especially shines is as a fileserver to Windows clients: Unlike on Linux, NFSv4 ACLs are supported natively!The NT ACLs used in Windows and SMB are much more expressive than Linux&#39;s POSIX draft ACLs. When a Windows client writes a file to a Linux Samba server, it cannot necessarily express the file&#39;s ACL as a POSIX ACL losslessly. To work around this, Samba&#39;s vfs_acl_xattr saves the &#34;real&#34; ACL as an extended attribute: https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/vfs_acl_xa...This means the ACLs set by clients won&#39;t be enforced for local users on the file server, and that you need special tools to view and edit those ACLs.In contrast, FreeBSD supports NFSv4 ACLs on ZFS, and those are a superset of NT ACLs. Samba saves the NT ACL as an NFSv4 ACL, and this can be viewed or edited using getfacl and setfacl as with any other file on the server."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This one: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19584921 And it wasn&#39;t even my post!A long time ago I found myself teaching Computer Graphics at my alma mater. Over the following years my approach to the subject evolved, and I really got the hang of it. After I stopped teaching, I took my notes, handouts and slides, and made them into a series of articles that I put on my website, where they remained in relative obscurity. Hacker News managed to find it every once in a while, and it was generally well received, but nothing came out of this. Until April 2019, when that post made the HN front page again, except this time it caught the attention of an editor in No Starch Press.Long story short, my materials are now a book, Computer Graphics from Scratch, sold by No Starch Press [0], and also available for free on my website [1].This genuinely wouldn’t have happened without your support. THANK YOU, HN community :)[0] https://nostarch.com/computer-graphics-scratch[1] http://gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Seven years ago, I started a blog called The Pragmatic Engineer. For three months, I wrote a post every two-three weeks. But no one really read them. So I took a short break, which break turned into a month, then another, another… and I did not have motivation to write. Barely anyone read it, after all.A few months after starting the blog, I saw a small traffic spike - maybe 30 visitors - from this site called Hacker News after a submission [1]. I never heard about HN before but it looked interesting so I started to visit it, and eventually registered to upvote stories I like.Then, another few months later - when I had not published anything for 3-4 months - as I was checking out HN, I could not believe what I saw: a months-old post of mine was on the front page titled “Move Fast Without Breaking Things”. Traffic was so high, my site could barely keep up on shared hosting with MediaTemple, my blog running Wordpress.There were 50+ comments discussing my post, versus the 2 that were on the blog itself (it had a commenting system). The comments were more insightful than I’ve ever seen for any of my blog posts. This was the HN post [2].Now, this post did not “make me money”. But it WAS a turning point where I got validation that strangers on the internet find what I wrote interesting. And it gave me a motivation to write when no one read it, knowing that just because people are not interested in what I wrote today, people might find it interesting months or years later.I kept writing my blog for years. Eventually, this blog served as the basis of The Pragmatic Engineer Newsletter which I launched a year ago, and which is my new fulltime job and one of the most popular technology newsletters with over 120,000 people reading it. More than enough people chose to pay for it to make this a a viable fulltime career on the long run.Thank you, Hacker News, for those first two submissions, all the comments, and the motivation it gave to keep writing. It was a turning point. I still remember how I could barely believe in March 2016 that so many people I never met can be interested in reading thoughts I put in writing.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10692734[2] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11374221"</p>

One of my favorite places in the world is Koh Lanta, Thailand. When traveling, I’m always on the lookout for places that give off the Koh Lanta vibe. What does that mean? Hard to say, exactly, but having tourist amenities without being touristy. Charming, slow, cheap. I don’t know exactly; if I did, it’d be easier to find. Anyway, forgetting that Google is bad at long tails, I search for what is the koh lanta of croatia? and get:This is a near impossible query for human beings, let alone for computer given the state of the AI at this point in time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a lot of Google hate on HN, and much of it is deserved, but I think this particular trend of blaming Google for the prevalence of useless clickbait articles is a bit much.The real answer to this question is that walled-garden social media took over everything. The much-pined-for &#34;Old Google&#34; worked because people used to actually create content on their own sites, and not just post it on walled garden monolithic social sites like Facebook or Twitter."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; What I dream of is Google circa 2006. A time where a search engine searched what you asked for. A time before aggressive SEO. A time before social media, when the only people on the internet had a reason to be there. A time before sticky headers and full-screen modal pop-ups asking you to subscribe to a newsletter before reading the article. A time before click-bait and subscription-only websites which tease you with a paragraph before blurring out the rest of the content.Well, I built sort of exactly this: https://search.marginalia.nu/It&#39;s not great, but it sure has its moments.Should be noted, regarding Koh Lanta, that travel is one of the most aggressively SEO-spammed topics, along with pharma and online casinos. It&#39;s extremely difficult to cut through the noise and reach any sort of signal."</p>

Whatever else you&#39;d say about Bernstein here, he knows how to pick a FOIA lawyer.A maybe more useful way to say the same thing is: if Matt Topic and Merrick Wayne are filing this complaint, you should probably put your money on them having NIST dead-to-rights with the FOIA process stuff."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Near the end of the post – after 50 years of axe grinding – djb does eventually get to the point wrt pqcrypto. I find the below excerpt particularly damning. Why not wrap nascent pqcrypto in classical crypto? Suspect!--The general view today is that of course post-quantum cryptography should be an extra layer on top of well-established pre-quantum cryptography. As the French government cybersecurity agency (Agence nationale de la sécurité des systèmes d&#39;information, ANSSI) put it at the end of 2021:Acknowledging the immaturity of PQC is important: ANSSI will not endorse any direct drop-in replacement of currently used algorithms in the short/medium term. However, this immaturity should not serve as an argument for postponing the first deployments. ANSSI encourages all industries to progress towards an initiation of a gradual overlap transition in order to progressively increase trust on the post-quantum algorithms and their implementations while ensuring no security regression as far as classical (pre-quantum) security is concerned. ...Given that most post-quantum algorithms involve message sizes much larger than the current pre-quantum schemes, the extra performance cost of an hybrid scheme remains low in comparison with the cost of the underlying post-quantum scheme. ANSSI believes that this is a reasonable price to pay for guaranteeing an additional pre-quantum security at least equivalent to the one provided by current pre-quantum standardized algorithms.But NSA has a different position: it says that it &#34;does not expect to approve&#34; hybrids. Publicly, NSA justifies this by- pointing to a fringe case where a careless effort to add an extra security layer damaged security, and- expressing &#34;confidence in the NIST PQC process&#34;.Does that mean the original NISTPQC process, or the current NISTPQC process in which NIST, evidently surprised by attacks, announced plans to call for new submissions?Of course, if NSA/IDA have secretly developed an attack that works for a particular type of post-quantum cryptosystem, then it makes sense that they&#39;d want people to start using that type of cryptosystem and turn off the existing pre-quantum cryptosystem."</p>

So I&#39;ll be more than happy to let them do their thing.As for sustainability: all electronics that contain rechargeable batteries are in principle not sustainable and we all have one or more of those devices.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think Musk&#39;s counterclaims are more interesting than Twitter&#39;s response. Here&#39;s the summary of the five counterclaims:* Twitter committed fraud by lying to the SEC about the mDAU numbers with the intent of inducing Musk to buy Twitter at an inflated price. No, really, this is the allegation (see paragraphs 202-206).* Count 2 is that Twitter committed [Texas fraud statute] by lying when it offered its shares. It&#39;s shotgun-pled, so I don&#39;t know which specific statements are supposed to be wrong, but I&#39;m imagining it&#39;s basically the previous count recast under a different statute.* Count 3 says that Twitter broke the contract by failing to provide information.* Count 4 says that Twitter broke the contract by instituting a hiring freeze. [not gonna fly, especially when Musk admitted that Twitter gave him warning of what it was doing and Musk didn&#39;t respond. Did I mention that Musk&#39;s answer admits far more than I would have expected?]* Count 5 is pretty please declare that Twitter lying about mDAUs is a materially adverse event that is cause to break the contract.I still can&#39;t get over the banana-pants insanity of the first count... arguing that Twitter lied about its numbers for years specifically so that someone would buy it at an inflated price?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; &#34;To the contrary, Musk forwent all due diligence—giving Twitter twenty-four hours to accept his take-it-or-leave-it offer before he would present it directly to Twitter&#39;s stockholders,&#34; Twitter wrote.Bot/spam account analysis is just trying to do PR spin. Musk has no legal standing to use any of that to back out of the merger.&gt; The five-day trial is now scheduled to begin on October 17So we will see about 2 more months of PR campaigns from Musk and Twitter about the case."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find it rather ridiculous and in bad faith that Musk is harping on the bot issue for 2 reasons.First, it wouldn&#39;t matter anyway. He signed away any and all rights to due diligence in the agreement.And secondly, it&#39;s completely impossible for any outside analysis to determine the number of active users on Twitter because most active Twitter users don&#39;t tweet or interact in anyway. They just read tweets and those users see ads, which makes them monetizable users."</p>

In my experience the calls for more housing from the wealthy and business class are disingenuous; more often really a call for more apartments to be built exclusively in neighbourhoods dominated by the poor and working class and a continued ban of apartments in the low density single family home areas that the wealthy business owning class live in.Often this is called the &#34;Grand Bargain,&#34; that new housing can be allowed, but only if it is constrained to a tiny area (which becomes increasingly dense), while the bulk of single family homes are left untouched.The challenge for voters is to discern between those that are calling for more housing that are genuine YIMBYs, that want to build more housing for everyone more equitably, everywhere in all neighbourhoods, and those like Andreessen, which merely want to continue on with Grand Bargain thinking, and want to continue the status quo by which the poors live as far as possible away from him."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fun fact: the town of Atherton is also singlehandedly responsible for delaying and almost derailing Caltrain&#39;s electrification project, because the electric poles needed would, and I quote, &#34;compromise the quaint character of our neighborhood&#34; (shock horror).https://www.almanacnews.com/news/2017/12/21/atherton-battlin...And of course: &#34;Other speakers protested the aesthetic and safety impacts of the taller, and heavier, poles, saying they would also reduce property values.&#34;The town also voted to close their own Caltrain station, because they clearly don&#39;t want the kind of riff-raff who use public transport there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve served on a city Planning Commission, and I can say categorically that you never truly know who someone is until the city tries to re-zone the property around their house.Being fair to Andreessen and his family, they likely bought their house knowing that the property was zoned single-family residential, as was the entire neighborhood, and that it&#39;s relatively difficult to change land use policy. That is, until the Legislature of the State of California decided it knew better than every incorporated city, and wrote a housing density law that superseded local zoning regulations.I&#39;ve always been surprised that tech billionaires don&#39;t spend money influencing State Senate/Assembly races. Maybe that will change."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Roomba / iRobot is years behind the Chinese companies. We just got an Ecovacs X1 Omni - a mopping vacuum bot with actual rotating mop scrubbers, AI vision obstacle avoidance, LIDAR mapping, and most importantly fully automated water fill &amp; mop pad cleaning at the base station. We fill a clean water tank &amp; empty the dirty one about once a week. Floors are spotless - huge difference from static cloth mopping bots.Meanwhile, iRobot still hadn’t figured out how to make an effective stand-alone mop bot, much less an auto fill station or combined bot that actually works. Roborock and Ecovacs products launch in China 6-12 months before their US launch. By the time Roomba has a decent mop bot, the X2 or X3 will probably be out offering integration with home plumbing to avoid any manual intervention for months at a time.EDIT: commenters are asking what works offline from Roborock / Ecovacs. For the self-cleaning-mop generation like the X1 Omni:- Roborock obstacle avoidance is local, but works better with cloud.- Roborock can be controlled by a local home automation server without internet access.- Ecovacs obstacle avoidance requires cloud.- Ecovacs control requires cloud.I remembered these stats from a Youtube video that I can&#39;t find; probably in my partner&#39;s history since we watched reviews on the TV together.I picked the X1 Omni over the Roborock because it has superior mopping performance on tile floors, but I think both would be good options. It seems like Roborock is more privacy compatible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I mean not trying to start a flame war, but everyone is
praising how great roborock is but the reality is, most of  Xiaomi/Roborock technology is stolen/reversed engineered from Neato. Chinese robot vacuum would not even be close to their current capabilities if it wasn’t for the LiDAR on the XV11. If you look at the tear down from the first couple gen, the PCB and components were exactly the same compared to Neatos. (I owned both Neato and Roborock vacuums)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I had a feeling this was gonna be about 3D Touch just from seeing the title.It was definitely one of my favorite features, and Force Touch isn&#39;t a drop-in replacement.With 3D Touch anywhere on the keyboard, you could apply pressure to start moving the caret (text cursor) around, but what was even more useful was being able to apply a little bit more pressure to start selecting text with incredible precision.With Force Touch, you can long press on the space bar till you get haptic feedback, then you can move the caret around freely. However, if you want to select text, you need to use a second finger on the keyboard after you start moving the caret around, but honestly it&#39;s an absolute mess to use; try it out, I can guarantee you won&#39;t be able to select what you were planning on.However, as much as I miss it every time I fail to accurately select text on iOS, I don&#39;t mourn its loss. Force Touch is adequate. It&#39;s just not a replacement, and seems a shame it was probably removed to reduce costs and hardware complexity, all at the cost of regression."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yeah, missing this 3D Touch.The input experience (or AI supported typing) is getting worse and worse for me on the iPhone. Especially, if your are using different languages in parallel. For me it is my mother tongue German and my most second language English and sometimes using Spanish. In an (for me) unpredictable way, there are words replaced to &#34;correct&#34; typos. But, independent of the used keyboard language, which is completely ignored for this auto-correct, it replaces it with German word, when I write English and sometimes with English words when I type German. Then this forced touch was helpful to select the letters/word to re-write it correctly to make the sentence meaningful. But now, this whole selection process is completely broken (for me). Since the removal of force touch, when I try to go to a specific spot, it selects parts of the sentence in a completely (for me) unpredictable way. Then I have no chance to un-select anymore, so I have to replace the whole. The experience is getting worse and worse.I think peak iOS was in the past."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Maybe I’m in the minority here but I really did not like the feature and many people I tried to explain the feature to were confused that it existed.. “no no don’t tap the screen, you need to PUSH on the screen to make it do the action”.. and I would get a look like “huh?? Push on the screen? Why what’s that gonna do..” people saying pushing hard on the screen is intuitive seemed to live in a different bubble of people than I interacted with.."</p>

If you&#39;re interested in the technical details currently available, check out the about page[0] on the official MoonRay site, or this presentation from SIGGRAPH 2017[1]. I&#39;m particularly excited for the HeatMap render pass, seems like a really practical way to identify what&#39;s bogging your scene down. Not to mention the gorgeous volumetric rendering this engine is capable of (see How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden Realm[2]).Really impressed that Dreamworks is making this move. They&#39;ve made some of my favorite films of all time (the Dragons franchise genuinely changed my life and is a major part of why I love filmmaking, film scores, and 3D rendering) and I&#39;m glad to see they&#39;re doing this. I can&#39;t wait to try MoonRay in Blender once a community integration exists![0]https://openmoonray.org/about[1]https://jo.dreggn.org/path-tracing-in-production/2017/Moonra...[2]https://www.awn.com/animationworld/how-moonray-became-hidden...EDIT: I&#39;ve also come across this excellent blog post written by an engineer who worked on MoonRay for 4 years: http://rendering-memo.blogspot.com/2019/And this paper recommended by erichocean in their reply below: http://www.tabellion.org/et/paper17/MoonRay.pdf"</p>

One of said client is the government, and it is asking them to buy some very specific equipment, knowing fully well this equipment is only sold in Israel.However, the Emirates cannot trade with Israel, and refuse to pay for any equipment labelled as coming from this country. Calling one of the officials, they asked for a solution. They told them to ship everything first to the UK. There, they should unpack every single object, and package them again with different country labels. Once the box has passed custom, nobody will raise the topic about the equipment origin.And so this is what they do."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love the idea of this, and I disagree with others about the price being too high. If you&#39;re in the US/Canada/UK and planning to spend even a couple of hours per month using this to further your skills and career, then the value of your time investment will exceed your cash outlay on the subscription.That being said, I wonder whether you&#39;ve considered offering a student discount for bona fide students? You could do this via sites like Unidays or StudentBeans. You can rely on their process for verifying students, instead of just accepting anyone with an edu email address (which are sometimes available to alumni).I&#39;m sure some of the folks doing online CS degrees at WGU and Georgia Tech would be interested in this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Price point I feel is too high for specifically what it is offering.A general point I would make.In education: cost is a barrier of entry - a smaller ask might yield far more results from people in disadvantaged situations able to scrabble up ladder. A rising tide raises all ships.You are doing work creating the material and course work - I&#39;m not saying release stuff for free. but $80/mo is something to bat an eye at for a lot of people that would otherwise be interested in this.I would price it at $40-60, with maybe an intro month at $20. the $60 price point is a video game: which fits in my mind as roughly the value you seem to be offering per month. but I don&#39;t actually know how much time each course takes - thus the range from $40-60.that&#39;s just my two cents."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This looks very promising, I think it could be a great resource for companies that want to invest in training their developers, but don&#39;t have the resources to build a curriculum themselves.&gt; What new courses should we add?The courses you have already are good, but are quite low-level. To broaden the applicability perhaps you could also try something like &#34;build a REST API that matches this OpenAPI schema&#34; (getting persistence working properly could be an interesting challenge). Going further, I wonder if it&#39;s possible to do a course like &#34;build a web app that does X&#34; (Realworld or TODOMVC are possible values of X), using browser automation to test. This is probably very hard without manual review. (Scoped broadly enough, this could be solved with a server-rendered framework or a client-side framework.) Common engineering/craftsmanship problems here are authentication, persistence, navigation, performance tuning, perhaps log-wiring, etc.More generally, I&#39;m wondering if there is a good open-source option as a competitor / baseline comparison? As others have noted, Leetcode is one common source of study exercises, but it&#39;s quite annoying to work with as you need to submit code in the browser rather than using your IDE. I&#39;d love to see a repo with exhaustive test cases for the things you&#39;re building; for example low-level algorithmic exercises like &#34;exhaustive tests for binary search tree&#34; or higher-level &#34;build a git client&#34; like CodeCrafters offers. Being able to step-debug through failing test cases is always going to be more realistic training than the Leetcode workflow."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s annoying for sure. I deal with abuse at a large scale.I&#39;d recommend:- Rate-limit everything, absolutely everything. Set sane limits.- Rate-limit POST requests harder. Preferably dynamically based on geoip.- Rate-limit login and comment POST requests even harder. Ban IPs that exceed the amount.- Require TLS. Drop TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1. Bots certainly break.- Require SNI. Do not reply without SNI (nginx has 444 return code for that). Ban IP&#39;s on first hit that connect without. There&#39;s no legitimate use and you&#39;ll also disappear from places like Shodan.- If you can, require HTTP/2.0. Bots break.- Ban IP&#39;s listed on StopForumSpam, ban destination e-mail addresses listed there. If possible also contribute back to SFS and AbuseIPDB.- Collect JA3 hashes, figure out malicious ones, ban IPs that use those hashes. This blocks a lot of shit trivially because targeting tools instead of behaviour is accurate."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;  They&#39;re a major part in killing off web forums, and a significant wet blanket on any sort of fun internet creativity or experimentation.&gt; The only ones that can survive the robot apocalypse is large web services. Your reddits, and facebooks, and twitters, and SaaS-comment fields, and discords. They have the economies of scale to develop viable countermeasures, to hire teams of people to work on the problem full time and maybe at least keep up with the ever evolving bots.This is not true at all.  There are web forums that are not &#34;web-scale&#34; and don&#39;t spend all day fighting bot spam.  The solution is real simple: it costs 10 bux to register an account, if you&#39;re a nuisance your account is banned and you pay 10bux to get back on.Even the sites that don&#39;t require payment for explicit registration - often succeed by gating functionality or content behind paywalls.  Requiring a &#34;premium membership&#34; to post in the classifieds forum is an extremely extremely common thing on small interest-based web-boards (photrio, pentaxforums, homebrewtalk, etc).  That income supports the site and supports the anti-bot efforts as a whole.  The customer isn&#39;t advertisers - it&#39;s the community itself, and you&#39;re providing the service of high-quality content and access to people with similar interests.You need to bootstrap a community first, of course, but it doesn&#39;t need to be a large community, just a high-value one.The twitters and facebooks of the world just don&#39;t like that solution because they value growth above all other considerations.  They&#39;d rather be kings of a billion user website with 200 million bots than a 1k-100k user forum with 100% organic membership and content.  And they value engagement over content quality, which is the entire reason comment-tree/vote-based systems have been pushed heavily over web-1.0 threaded forum discussions as well.This botpocalypse is the inevitable outcome of the systems that social-media giants have created, not inherent outcomes of the internet as a whole."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Really glad to see someone finally talking about this.Does anyone know what&#39;s going on with that &#34;Duke de Montosier&#34; spam botnet? It accounts for more than half of the botspam attacks on my sites, and I can&#39;t find anyone talking about it online anywhere, except one tweet dating back to mid-2021. It&#39;s identifiable by several short phrases that it posts:Duke de Montosierfor Countess Louise of SavoyTestaru. Best knownAnd cryptic short posts that can assemble into creepy sequences:Europe, and in Ancient RussiaCentury to a kind of destruction:Western Europe also formedand was erased, and on cleanedonly a few survivednumber of surviving European55 thousand Greek, 30 thousand ArmenianMany of the IPs involved seemed to be in Russia, China and Hong Kong, though they&#39;re coming from all over (eg European &amp; US VPNs, Tor exit nodes). From tracking the IPs on AbuseIPDB, the weird spam posts seem to be just one layer, while behind the scenes it also attempts SMTP Auth and IMAP attacks on the server.I&#39;m eager to know more if anyone knows, and especially if anyone is trying to shut this thing down. But I can&#39;t find anyone even talking about it. (Maybe there&#39;s a reason for that?)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Sorry for your loss and everyone else who is sharing.About 10 years ago, my mom came down with cancer and was in hospice care for some time. I had the opportunity to sit with her and hold hands and talk. She was a person of faith, I am not. She asked me to light the yahrzeit for her which I of course agreed to do, and did, although I had to consult the internet to figure out how.She asked me if I would reconsider my rejection of faith, I had to be honest with her and said that I was sorry that I could not do that. She said if she got up there, into heaven, and could get me a message, would I change my mind. I said sure Ma. We came up with a goofy pass phrase, that only her and I knew, and pinky swore never to tell anyone. No, I have not received the message, but I do the candle. It is coming up on the 10th the web site says."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sorry for your loss.The thing I noticed is that I have my own life - my grandparents passed some stories to me as well as my parents and they are part of my life. I have photos from like 1900&#39;s passed to me as family heirloom.But I came to realization that I am unable to understand even 15% of any other persons life. Even my SO life will be maybe tops 40% that I can grasp or share as we spend really a lot of time together.Maybe that is me but I feel that we are really isolated and our communications with words is really limited. Even being together in the same moment - each person feels/reacts a bit different.I paint it as tragic in a sense but it is also beautiful that we really are unique snowflakes in the end.So in the end I don&#39;t feel like it is even important for me to make some kind of interview - important part is to remember that they were alive and their life was their own and only their own as I cannot touch it I cannot grasp it - hence all life being special and to be celebrated, because there is not going to be second one that is identical with its struggles and with its dreams."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminded me of a project from long ago. When I was growing up, I was not particularly good about expressing gratitude to my family. I recognized this in myself and in college and wanted to make up for lost time.I went around and interviewed my extended family and some of my mom&#39;s friends over the course of about 6 months. I asked each person for any fun or touching stories they had. There were a lot. I edited down many hours of footage into a 45 minute video that basically said, &#34;thanks for the last 22 years&#34;.Days before I moved across country to start my job after graduation, I got the family together and had a viewing party. Unbeknownst to my mom this wasn&#39;t a going away party for me, it was an appreciation party for her. It was a wonderful moment.Two people who I interviewed as part of this project have since passed away. So I dug up and digitized all of the unedited footage so that I can easily pull it up on my computer. There are some wonderful memories from my grandma and my father at a happier/healthier time in their lives. In their final years they were not really able to speak at all, so this footage really captures them at their relative best. It has been a helpful way for me and my family to deal with grief.OP: Thank you for sharing your story. Sorry for your loss."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For our dating site, which of course has to deal with many prinses, Nigerian or otherwise, when we manually verified an account to be a scammer, we reject logins with a message stating that the IP address has been blocked. Scammers will usually go through all of their VPNs/bots in order to try to login, allowing our system to flag them all.We&#39;ll manually review all accounts that use (more than one of) those ip addresses. Works like a charm! :-)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ok, I have no issue with tactics like these when they&#39;re wasting spammers&#39; time. But sometimes it seems like real users get caught up in these honeypots for scammers and hackers.A lot of the crap real sites make people go through e.g. when they lose access to their account or login to a VPN or the site just &#34;can&#39;t verify their identity&#34; for some reason.  Where you go through a bunch of hoops and captchas, only to have some step fail or reach a dead end. They really seem like they&#39;re just set up to intentionally waste people&#39;s time.For example, Steam has a system where if you enter too many invalid passwords, it will present you with a captcha which you can never actually solve. It&#39;s a lot more annoying than just saying &#34;you have been locked out of trying to log in for X hours&#34;.But this, this is fine. It&#39;s pretty clear that the person you&#39;re targeting is a spammer, and it&#39;s pretty clear to the user after about 60 seconds that you&#39;re password system is a joke."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Troy, watch out you don&#39;t open yourself up for an attack from the bad guys: They&#39;ll start sending you solicitations with ReplyTo addresses of industry honeypots, and before you know it, you&#39;ll become a known spammer and your regular outgoing emails will be routed to recipient&#39;s spam folders or maybe even dropped entirely."</p>

Just to add to what the rest of the team has already mentioned, we&#39;ve tried to create a tool that can help ourselves and others track and better manage our working habits to avoid burning out and reinforcing patterns that keeps us productive while also keeping us mentally healthy. This is especially important today, where we&#39;re seeing a rapidly changing working environment with the increase in the adoption of work from home and flexible work schemas and the changes that come along with them.Looking forward to hearing everyone&#39;s thoughts in the comments below, and please don&#39;t hesitate to ask me and the rest of the team any questions you might have!"</p>

I am impressed both from an engineering and a product perspective.It shows that they are playing the long game.I think they are achieving what I wished happen to the Clojure ecosystem: productive, well designed, respected and popular. Clojure missed the last step, unfortunately."</p>

You may want to configure some things, so check out the options[2].:If you want a &#34;native&#34; install, after you have elixir installed you can use     mix escript.install hex livebook

and start it with     livebook server

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have a theory - tree based models require minimal feature engineering. They are capable of handling categorical data in principled ways, they can handle the most skewed/multimodal/heteroskedastic continuous numeric data just as easily as a 0-1 scaled normal distribution, and they are easy to regularize compared to a DL model (which could have untold millions of possible parameter combinations, let alone getting the thing to train to a global optimum).I think if you spent months getting your data and model structure to a good place, you could certainly get a DL model to out-perform a gradient boosted tree. But why do that, when the GBT will be done today?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Results show that tree-based models remain state-of-the-art on medium-sized data (∼10K samples) even without accounting for their superior speed.Is that really &#34;medium&#34;? That seems very small to me. MNIST has 60,000 samples and ImageNet has millions.I think the title overstates the findings. I&#39;d be interested to hear how these methods compare on much larger datasets. Is there a threshold at which deep learning outperforms tree-based models?Edit: They touch on this in the appendix:&gt; A.2.2 Large-sized datasets&gt; We extend our benchmark to large-scale datasets: in Figures 9, 10, 11 and 12, we compare the results
of our models on the same set of datasets, in large-size (train set truncated to 50,000 samples) and
medium-size (train set truncated to 10,000 samples) settings.&gt; We only keep datasets with more than 50,000 samples and restrict the train set size to 50,000 samples
(vs 10,000 samples for the medium-sized benchmark). Unfortunately, this excludes a lot of datasets,
which makes the comparison less clear. However, it seems that, in most cases, increasing the train set
size reduces the gap between neural networks and tree-based models. We leave a rigorous study of
this trend to future work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s baffling to me how little research attention there has been to improving tree-based methods, considering their effectiveness.For example, LightGBM and XGBoost allow some regularization terms, but the variance/bias is still mostly controlled by globally setting the max depth and max node count (and then parameter searching to find good settings).Surely there must be more powerful and sophisticated ways of deciding when to stop building each tree than counting the number of nodes?  If this was neural nets there would be a hundred competing papers proposing different methods and arguing over their strengths and weaknesses.I&#39;m not sure whether the problem is that neural nets are just fundamentally more sexy, or that in order to make SOTA improvements in GBMs you need to dive into some gnarly C++.  Probably both."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Re: the age of &#34;That&#39;s what she said&#34;:I thumbed through The Frogs (Aristophanes) at a used book store once.  This play was written circa 400 BC.  In the prologue, one character is offering to entertain the audience with a few jokes, and another character says, &#34;Yes, but not &#39;That&#39;s what she said.&#39;&#34;  The joke was too over-used.I was astounded to think that the joke was that old!  But it&#39;s actually not.  The old jokes of ancient Athenians were a little too obscure, I guess, so the translator picked a modern example.  Still, that translation of The Frogs is from the 1950s, so the joke was old at least that far back.  (Here is the translation: https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.65406/2015.6540...)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These remind me of a category of &#34;joke&#34; that some of my middle-school peers and I engaged in: the non-joke. The only one I can remember went something like: a man walks into a bakery and asks for two baguettes. The baker looks at him, thinks for a moment and says &#34;It&#39;s OK, you can leave your bike outside&#34;.Looking back, I think this idea was somehow rooted in the idea that jokes have delivery and that if you use that delivery (rythmn, emphasis, body language) maybe you could say anything and be funny. There was also the peer effect - if you had an audience &#34;plant&#34; in the school yard that would start the laughter, sometimes it would catch even for these non-jokes.Decades later, the idea I described above seems both obviously false, but also true, in the sense that a lot of modern stand up is based on &#34;say anything the right way and people laugh&#34;. However, &#34;the right way&#34; for standup is very different than the &#34;telling a joke&#34; structure.On the other hand, it does feel to me at this point that this is the crux of the contemporary poetry slam: read an arbitrary text in the right way, and while it may not win any prizes, it will feel like poetry, because that&#39;s what make it poetry."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m surprised noone has brought up what I recall being told was the oldest known joke. Not sure about the specifics, but IIRC it’s from a mesopotamian cuneiform tablet and goes something like “Name something that never happened — A wife has never farted in her husband’s lap”. Supposedly a reference to the common knowledge at the time that everyone involved (or maybe just the wife) would vehemently deny it if it did happen, or perhaps awkwardly pretend it didn’t happen, knowing well that everyone noticed and politely joins in the pretense.I don’t like it when people act as if these were objectively bad jokes. Many jokes are very dependent on a specific cultural moment as well as carefully crafted wording. Lots of current jokes fall can flat if you slightly change the phrasing, even if they aren’t word play. And then there’s delivery, pacing, knowing your audience…Surely widespread literacy and technology allow modern people to develop comparably sophisticated tastes just by the sheer wealth of entertainment we consume, but people 5000 years ago were still people and I’m sure they found humour in similar places as we do.edit: here’s a source: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-joke-odd-idUSKUA147851200... Again, I would take issue with the reduction to “toilet humour”. Clearly the comedy of manners aspect plays the larger role, even if farts are somehow eternally funny."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I thought this was a fantastic podcast. I&#39;m not sure how so many people can hate Lex and his (free!) work. I&#39;ve been waiting for some of these interviews (with a technical interview for years/decades). I&#39;m a bit confused why you&#39;d want to speed then up or skip them, surely this is missing the point of settling into a thought provoking conversation? I happened to have a longish drive yesterday for a day of walking in the hills and listened to the whole thing in 2 sections. Never felt bored and had quite a few interesting thoughts come up during the conversation. Thanks Lex!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I know I&#39;m going to get downvoted for this, but the answer to your question depends on your analysis of the problem.If you&#39;re an ecomodernist, who believes we can stop and reverse the transgression of planetary boundaries (climate change, biodiversity loss, chemical pollution, ocean acidification, etc.) without any meaningful system changes, the sibling comment tips might help.If you are, like me, unconvinced by the ecomodernist argument – and have a grasp on all of the different ways the environment is being destroyed (not just &#34;climate&#34;), know Jevons paradox and rebound effects, are up to speed with the empirical knowledge of decoupling rates of both energy and material flows compared to &#34;safe&#34; limits – then &#34;working for climate&#34; almost exclusively means working to bring about a big political change.Unfortunately that limits quite a bit the income potential of the work, but for me that&#39;s what &#34;working for climate&#34; means."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wrote this summary of what emissions sources matter if you want to move the needle, and how reputable sources argue for resolving them: https://climate.davis-hansson.com/p/big-picture-2020/I used that as a basis to look for roles that - I imagined - actually would help make a dent. In the end, I took a job in the smart electric grid space, writing code to help the EU grid take on more cheap renewable generators at Tibber.There’s a lot of software in many of these spaces! Decarbonising the grid, electrifying transport, building heat and industry, reducing agricultural emissions and so on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This was a variant of the question that I had when I left Stripe in 2019. After hearing someone say “We are the first generation to feel the impact of climate change and the last generation that can do something about it.”, I became fixated on the question of what can I, with my software skillset, do to have a meaningful impact on climate?.  The answer (in hindsight), is a ton.My particular approach was to start a company (Watershed[0]), but today there are lots of great options as a software engineer. There are already plenty of great examples in the thread of places to look for companies (MyClimateJourney community, climate job boards, etc). I think the most important thing is not to feel like you need to learn a ton before jumping into the fray. Most engineers that joined us had zero climate experience beforehand. All you need is to be curious, be an effective engineer and you can learn what you need on the job.My email is in my profile if you want to chat![0] We’re hiring (https://watershed.com/jobs)
 and engineering is absolutely our rate limiter in helping companies decarbonize. We’ve built a climate platform that’s powering the climate programs of some of the world’s leading companies (Block, Shopify, Doordash as a few examples). Our goal is to be responsible for reducing the world’s yearly carbon emissions by 500 megatonnes of carbon by 2030 (1% of global emissions)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I once took a critical thinking course and bought the textbook 2nd hand from the college bookstore.  A week or two in, I noticed half of a sentence written in the margin.  As the professor started teaching the topic from that page, he rhetorically asked a question, did not get an answer, and then answered himself with the sentence from the book.  I filliped ahead and found that the entire book was annotated with all of his answers, anecdotes, and various other helpful notes.  There was even a table that accurately listed his wardrobe choices!  The notes were in several different handwritings, and the book had been resold over a dozen times, so that professor must have been teaching the same class the exact same way for a decade or more.  I quickly became a star pupil as I always had an answer ready.  I added a few notes along the way and then sold it back to the bookstore at the end of the year.  I really wanted to keep it for posterity, but It just seemed wrong to take it out of circulation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In my middle school German textbook, I found the following note (translation my own):Hi Katie, we should meet up over tea over these images. The first image should be a simple sketch of two dudes playing football, tell the guys in graphics that the one they gave me is waaa too complex. The second image should be a chick playing tennis.The note went on in this manner for a couple more sentences, describing all the images on the page. Because I was a blind student who used a screen reader, I had to get the PDF version from the publishing company, which I then put in a specialized ebook reading app for the blind. I strongly suspect that the editors of that book used some PDF tricks for hiding information to post notes to each other. Whether they were alt descriptions, white fonts on white background, regions shrunk to be 1px tall by 1px wide or something else entirely, I do not know. That file was intended for printing, not digital distribution, so I guess that they decided the notes didn&#39;t need removing as long as they weren&#39;t visible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; He looked around at the faces in the crowd and said, “I’m opening the bidding at one dollar.” I about shit myself. I bid the $1 immediately to get things rolling. Well, after I bid, he looked around and said, “Once, twice, sold that man there for $1.” I just laughed… and wondered how the Hell I was going to get this pallet home and what I was going to do with all those books.&gt; When I asked the auctioneer afterwards why he’d let it go so cheaply, he said, “Did you see anyone trampling you to get in a bid?” I said no, I didn’t. His reply, with a smirk on his face, was, “Gotta’ know your audience in this job.”&gt; Well, needless to say, I got the books home and spent a few years going through them and selling some, giving some away, etc. However, that’s not the point of this story. The point was finding things in books. So, with that in mind…Dude goes to an auction and finds books. Nobody bids on the books. Dude is amazed that the auctioneer is willing to sell him something nobody wants for a low price. Dude spends years going through those books.I&#39;m happy for this guy."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The Jewish people have their Sabbath, as a hispanic person myself, we have our Siesta. I spent over a decade in the tech industry and I&#39;d literally be scoffed at for actually napping in a nap room or pod for 20min. Finally just started doing it in my car. But that&#39;s one of my practices that anchors me not only to my culture, but my Creator. It humbles me. And brings me joy. I hope everyone could find what their practice could be that would bring them this.Take some time, at least once a year, to sit down with yourself and have a vision for your life not based on work or status (ie vacations or the acquisition of things). If that isn&#39;t enough to snap you out, go to a small village in Latin America or maybe like Matthew McConaughey discovered and talked about in his book, a quaint monastery in New Mexico. Stay there until it makes sense.Most people want to be productive because they want to feel valued by others. But if you have to look to your own value from others, you&#39;ve already lost, and will continue to lose forever.Be. You. Slowly. and you&#39;ll find you&#39;re more valuable than you ever thought."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really don&#39;t get any of those &#34;be more productive&#34;, book, video, course and so on.Every single person I know just wastes their time with that. 
Usualy they work long hours and still don&#39;t get much done.But hey, they have Zettelkasten with things the never read. 
A to do list with stuff they never do.
And they go out in the morning at 5 for jogging, while gulping down a liter of coffe or energy drinks which results in them being groggy the whole day.If you ever think you need to adhere to what is preached in any self improvement thing, just don&#39;t.Habe your shit in order, avoid working mor than 7 hours day and take your weekends and vacations seriously.Especially in IT nothing will get you further than being smartly lazy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the original, and most effective, competition hacks is to convince people that you sleep less than they do.When someone tells you they sleep 5 hours a night then run two miles and take a 15-minute cold shower then start their work day, 85% of the time they are lying, 10% of the time you will have already noticed the effects of chronic sleep deprivation, and 5% of the time it&#39;s drugs.But this has been a surefire way to put your competitors on the back foot for hundreds, probably thousands of years."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I just got access to the DALL-E 2 beta, and it&#39;s a ton of fun to make pictures out of everyday occurrences as prompts.Someone else here on HN observed that everyday people don&#39;t &#34;get&#34; how huge this all is. I experimented with asking random acquaintances at a local cafe for prompts and showed them the generated pictures. All but one person was totally unimpressed.If everything feels like magic, then what&#39;s one more piece of magic?This scared me more than the implications of DALL•E 2 itself specifically. People think of the technology in the world as mysterious black boxes that do inexplicable things, and they hence no longer understand relative complexity, progress, or change.My impression is that to most people DALL•E 2 is not &#34;substantially&#34; different to, say, Google Image search. Text in... image out. What&#39;s the big deal?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve spent just over 1 week with DALL•E 2.Over the past 7 days I’ve generated ~1000 images, 150 of which were good enough to save. I only saved images which made me audibly gasp.Witnessing your own novel idea spring to life is a magical experience. DALL•E provides an artistic tool on a comparable level to digital photography, and by extension Photoshop.At this stage it’s 100% clear to me that DALL•E has heralded in a revolutionary new age of design. Every day I worked with it, I grew more confident in my outlook.It might not necessarily be an OpenAI product which truly “integrates” with humanity — but DALL•E has shown me that it’s possible… and just a matter of time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"PHP has so many hidden benefits:- it&#39;s stateless by design (much easier to scale)- it was &#34;serverless&#34; before Serverless- surprisingly performant- no &#34;unknown unknowns&#34;. it&#39;s so tried-and-true, there&#39;s no surprises- deployment is so simple, just drop a file on a web server. No middleware needed.- No long compile times because there is no compiling needed.EDIT: why the downvotes? If you don&#39;t agree, just reply so we can have a healthy dialogue.EDIT2: I also think there is something unique about PHP documentation. It has plenty of real life examples, and the ability for users to leave comments allows you to hear directly from others &#34;gotchas&#34; that people have experienced. I feel like PHP documentation is very undervalued."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I love legacy codebases.&gt; A legacy codebase means that the product is performing well. It means that I can often make immediate and impactful improvements.Wow. This person must have worked on very different legacy codebases than me.Legacy Javascript code, to me, is something that I do not want to touch with a 10 foot pole, because every little piece of it can be intertwined with and used by many other hidden places. Plus, I&#39;ve never found a legacy JS codebase that has a robust test suite, so any refactoring I do can be hard to test and verify.From a practicality perspective, I get that the best programming language is the one you can use to build your product, but I tend to long for languages like C# or even Go when I&#39;m trying to deliver a product on a team with 10+ people. Static typing really helps when you&#39;re interfacing with someone elses code, and Typescript only aids this point.Maybe if your target audience is genuinely 10 year olds learning to code, fine. But also if you&#39;re building a serious product for a company, please don&#39;t choose a &#34;Janky programming language&#34; because I really don&#39;t want to have to debug it after you left before really thinking about sanitizing user input.I feel like, in the hands of a really talented programmer, they can be super productive in PHP or Javascript or really anything. But I&#39;ve just had a lot of bad experiences with quickly written, undocumented code."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This really speaks to my heart. I learned programming as a young kid when my uncle taught my pascal. But I just couldn&#39;t see the point of console programs and never really got into it. Eventually I picked up late 90s HTML (hello geocities!) and php was a natural next step. I still remember going to the library to borrow the book PHP and MySQL web development. It was so empowering. I could make any kind of application I wanted and see the result in my browser, GUI and all (Win32 API was way beyond me at that age). I made my own forums, ebay clone, and a few web apps for an old Korean MMO.Fast forward a few decades, and things look very different. Tons of web app backends being written in go, nodeJS/TS, and I recently learned people write them in rust+webasm. It&#39;s just crazy to me. I&#39;ve worked on FOSS projects that are massively over-complicated because of their platform/language choice, when they would&#39;ve been very straightforward php choices. But php still has this weird stigma about it despite most of the old concerns having been addressed.I do have to say, though, that front end web development is way better than before with the advent of React and co, webpack, css libraries etc. Doing all that html/js/css by hand was always painful."</p>

Does Copilot have access to private repos that CodeGen cannot access?Also, it would be really cool if I can personalize FauxPilot by feeding it with all my repos on GitHub.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Tangential, maybe someone here knows; how complicated would be to implement an autocompleter that just understands syntax + patterns and can offer me suggestions but based on my own stuff? Like what is the simplest version of Copilot that doesn&#39;t require huge amounts of training but just does a decent job at recognizing tokens and trying to fill in the structure based on some input code. e.g: `app.get(&#39;/&#39;,|`  &lt;- at this point I should get an express.js handler autocomplete like `(req, res, next) =&gt; {}`, maybe with multiple choices grepped from my own data ranked by occurences. Is this too extreme it needs a multibillion parameter AI model to achieve? Does anything like this exist? Like an auto-snippet thing but contextual and token replacing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There is plenty of room for all of Chess.com, Chess24 and Lichess to exist.Lichess has the best platform to play on and is free to use.Chess.com is a business. As such they want to earn money.
However, without a large, online chess community there will be no subscribers.
The amount of effort chess.com has made to sponsor events, streamers etc.
is tremendous.Making a living as a chess professional is tough. 
Streaming/YouTube has opened the field somewhat: it is no longer
required to be in the world top 20 to make a living in the field of chess.The Chess24 initiative is without doubt inspired by Chess.com.
Chess24 gives yet another way for chess players to earn money.
Via Chessable (owneed by Chess24) players can sell chess online book/booklets.If Hikaru has a clause in his contract with Chess.com, that he can&#39;t play on Lichess - then the just can&#39;t play on Lichess. That&#39;s simple.Would Nike be happy if Portugal’s Cristiano Ronaldo suddenly appeared in Adidas shoes?It works the other way too: Wen did you last see Magnus play on Chess.com?
[I am aware that Magnus as owner/investor in Chess24 makes his own rules - and plays on Lichess]"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Paying off Chess streamers is pretty much the only way Chess.com can keep people using their site. Their product is simply inferior in every way, except for their library of master lessons, and all these GMs exclusively streaming through Chess.com.I figure all this spending on sponsorship and GM content is why the rest of their site is so inferior to Lichess. Lichess can spend all their time perfecting the platform, and it really shows."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Chess has always had this dichotomy over free/paid services. (a bit not unlike programming tools).I love lichess.org but make no mistake: without the dedication of one talented Scala programmer willing to underpay themselves that site would not exist.Commercial sites can provide more services and offer more opportunities to chess professionals simply due to the funding model.Disclaimer: I&#39;ve played over 100k online chess games since 1992. Starting with original ICS (client was on Xwindows) before ICS/FICS split drama, then chessbase.com, then chess.com and now lichess.org. I slightly prefer lichess but play on chess.com as well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really like this trend of &#34;making the terminal great again&#34;. Between rich/textual in python and lipgloss/bubble tea for golang, this turns cmd from &#34;the default ugly stuff that is easy to produce&#34; into &#34;something fun and pretty&#34;.Also note that those projects have the (not anymore) secret goal to also produce a web app from the same code base automatically.I imagine native will follow, or wasm, or something. Nevertheless, having the terminal as the smallest denominator for UI makes a lot of sense for small utilities. You won&#39;t build the next Figma with it but a lot of scripts could benefit from that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The advice to use lru_cache is good.But there is an issue if lru_cache is used on methods, like in the example given in the article:1. When lru_cache is used on a method, `self` is used as a part of cache key. That&#39;s good, because there is a single cache for all instances, and using self as a part of the key allows not to share data between instances (it&#39;d be incorrect in most cases).2. But: because `self` is a part of a key, a reference to `self` is stored in the cache.3. If there is a reference to Python object, it can&#39;t be deallocated. So, an instance can&#39;t be deallocated until the cache is deallocated (or the entry is expired) - if a lru_cache&#39;d method is called at least once.4. Cache itself is never deallocated (well, at least until the class is destroyed, probably at Python shutdown). So, instances are kept in memory, unless the cache is over the size limit, and all entries for this instance are purged.I think there is a similar problem in the source code as well, e.g. https://github.com/Textualize/textual/blob/4d94df81e44b27fff... - a DirectoryTree instance won&#39;t be deallocated if its render_tree_label method is called, at least until new cache records push out all the references to this particular instance.It may be important or not, depending on a situation, but it&#39;s good to be aware of this caveat. lru_cache is not a good fit for methods unfortunately."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of my proudest moments during the development of &#34;Linux on the Web&#34; had to be the creation of a Terminal application (try it at https://lotw.site/shell) that can render its output with near-native efficiency. My initial attempt was based on placing character images, one-by-one, onto a canvas element, but it was horribly sluggish. Then I started playing around with a &#34;Virtual Dom&#34; (React-like) approach, wherein I convert the underlying data structure into an html string, and then set the innerHTML property of a div element, for every time the screen has to be redrawn. (Source code: https://github.com/linuxontheweb/LOTW/blob/main/root/code/ap..., the relevant code is the &#34;render&#34; function starting on line 569, and the innerHTML is set on line 940).I don&#39;t know how many years its been that I started working on the Terminal application, but it was only within the past week or so that I &#34;bit the bullet&#34; and figured out how to do finger pad/mouse wheel scrolling of the output buffer (See the &#39;main.onwheel&#39; function in the source code for that little tidbit!). Since I required fine-grained control over the rendering process, I could not rely on the &#34;naive&#34; way of doing scrolling on the web (which is to simply let the browser take care of the entire process)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have worked at both startups and tech companies 40+ years old, and the conclusion I&#39;ve come to from my anecdata is that every engineer at every company is swamped all the time.Feature requests and bug reports are easy. Writing features and fixing bugs is hard. Your todo list will always grow faster than you can tackle items. Once a senior engineer retired, and I inherited about a hundred of his bugs out of the 600 or so he left behind.It&#39;s a marathon, not a sprint. Working at a consistent pace is better than burning yourself out. The work is omnipresent. It will never stop growing. It will consume all if you let it.Unless you&#39;re at an early-stage startup, let your manager deal with your giant and ever-growing todo list. Let someone more plugged-in to the business side deal with prioritizing, and focus on technical excellence. Unless you aspire to management yourself, that&#39;s already plenty to do.Anyone who tells you every engineer needs to be in touch with every business concern either only works on early-stage projects or is part of a hustle culture that I don&#39;t ascribe to. I don&#39;t have the energy for technical excellence and knowing everything about the business."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just talked about this with my wife just yesterday about her peer. If you&#39;re always the hero to take on too much work and you never keep up, you invite various significant structural problems.You&#39;re too useful to remove, you may not get attention for corrective measures because of fear of the person leaving.You are often too swamped to effectively get work done smoothly and in an expedient manner.You become a single point of failure (bus factor 1) so that when you take a vacation / hit by a bus, the company suffers significantly.A common personality trait of these types of people seem to be self reliance / control seekers. When they own that authority of work, they are less likely to accept delegation to get them out of their woes.In general, these types of employees may end up being labeled super stars, but they&#39;re also potential albatrosses that could significantly wound a company if not properly managed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been on both sides. A lot of people say people who want to be swamped is a control problem but I&#39;ve found its more delicate than that. My circumstances require me to have decent insurance so my life will forever be tied to an employer. I don&#39;t really get an &#34;escape&#34; at least until obamacare becomes cheaper than $2800/mo. for what I need in order to try out the entrepreneur life.As a result I work very hard. I end up getting a lot of work done, and thus more work on my plate. This is often manageable and I use this as a gauge of my probability of being fired for any given reason. Someone knocking on the door of a PIP likely won&#39;t be getting as much work especially if it&#39;s reasonably complicated. It&#39;s been my experience as work starts to die down to a less-than-consistent level I&#39;m usually out the door (never fired, but often laid off in this industry).However, this burned me when I became staff-level because I&#39;d get so much work that despite trying to reduce the bus factor back to &#34;manageable chaos&#34; I was unable to and ended up leaving the job for another one because I became the smart guy in the room.But overall I aim to walk the razors edge between swamped and normal at all times because it&#39;s the only form of security I have. When I am in this condition I am now useful enough I have plenty of power over my employer and my position and for an employee this is an ideal situation to have. Especially when the alternative is extremely expensive &#34;between jobs&#34; insurance, or a less than ideal insurance package from another company."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Yep, there&#39;s a premium on making your architecture more cloudy. However, the best point for Use One Big Server is not necessarily running your big monolithic API server, but your database.Use One Big Database.Seriously. If you are a backend engineer, nothing is worse than breaking up your data into self contained service databases, where everything is passed over Rest/RPC. Your product asks will consistently want to combine these data sources (they don&#39;t know how your distributed databases look, and oftentimes they really do not care).It is so much easier to do these joins efficiently in a single database than fanning out RPC calls to multiple different databases, not to mention dealing with inconsistencies, lack of atomicity, etc. etc. Spin up a specific reader of that database if there needs to be OLAP queries, or use a message bus. But keep your OLTP data within one database for as long as possible.You can break apart a stateless microservice, but there are few things as stagnant in the world of software than data. It will keep you nimble for new product features. The boxes that they offer on cloud vendors today for managed databases are giant!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Our industry summarized:Hardware engineers are pushing the absolute physical limits of getting state (memory/storage) as close as possible to compute. A monumental accomplishment as impactful as the invention of agriculture and the industrial revolution.Software engineers: let&#39;s completely undo all that engineering by moving everything apart as far as possible. Hmmm, still too fast. Let&#39;s next add virtualization and software stacks with shitty abstractions.Fast and powerful browser? Let&#39;s completely ignore 20 years of performance engineering and reinvent...rendering. Hmm, sucks a bit. Let&#39;s add back server rendering. Wait, now we have to render twice. Ah well, let&#39;s just call it a &#34;best practice&#34;.The mouse that I&#39;m using right now (an expensive one) has a 2GB desktop Electron app that seems to want to update itself twice a week.The state of us, the absolute garbage that we put out, and the creative ways in which we try to justify it. It&#39;s like a mind virus.I want my downvotes now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; However, cloud providers have often had global outages in the past, and there is no reason to assume that cloud datacenters will be down any less often than your individual servers.A nice thing about being in a big provider is when they go down a massive portion of the internet goes down, and it makes news headlines. Users are much less likely to complain about your service being down when it&#39;s clear you&#39;re just caught up in the global outage that&#39;s affecting 10 other things they use."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’m fascinated by how much this is exactly like working with a human artist who doesn’t really understand the domain that you are wanting to represent with an image. Iterate, iterate, iterate.It seems like the most valuable thing this could do is get some of that early exploration out of the way faster and easier than a human can do it, get to two or three concepts that feel like they’re in the neighborhood, and then let a human expert take over and turn it to something final quality. That’s pretty cool."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This blog post proves that Dall-E 2 will not make human taste and design ability obsolete. The final image he ended up with is a lot uglier and more complicated than most of the intermediate steps. I think generative art AIs will have a similar effect on design as compilers have on software development, and will not put artists out of a job."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not sure if this will be considered off topic, my apologies if so.The article says that octopi is the plural of octopus, but it&#39;s actually octopuses. Octopus is originally Greek, not Latin and thus does not get the Latin plural -i, but instead would get the Greek plural -odes. Since it ends in a way English can deal with, the commonly accepted usage is octopuses (English) over octopodes (Greek) with octopi being the least correct.https://qz.com/1446229/let-us-finally-resolve-the-octopuses-..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I find this stuff fascinating, and this article is way above average for online posts about proprietary/algorithmic/quantitative/low-latency trading (very leaky Venn diagram there). I have a few nitpicks but overall it&#39;s informative and it&#39;s an interesting format: viewing an industry through the lens of a particular firm, especially one as fascinating as Jane. Anything that develops literacy in modern finance amongst the lay public is a good thing in my book.If this stuff floats your boat I&#39;d also recommend any of Carl Cook&#39;s talks, e.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH1Tta7purM. Optiver is AFAIK in a somewhat different business than Jane, but they&#39;re also players (or were last I had any inside baseball).Too many people got their worldview on this industry from &#34;Flash Boys&#34;, and I say this as a Lewis fan, is criminally stupid at best and in bad faith at worst (if you want a well-researched, accessible alternative: https://www.amazon.com/Trading-Speed-Light-Algorithms-Transf... is about a zillion times better).It&#39;s a pretty short list of places I&#39;d ever go through some grueling and semi-arbitrary gauntlet to work for, but Jane is on it for sure.I hope the author(s) do Medallion next."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;the winners get a job from which people routinely retire rich in their 30s, and the losers... don&#39;tHonestly, I find this ridiculous. Firstly, Yes, working at Jane Street is a well paying job and you&#39;ll do well out of it. No. People aren&#39;t routinely retiring in their 30s. I don&#39;t understand where this absurd idea comes from. Look at all the rich people in the world, look at how old they are, and ask, are they retired? No! People who are driven and smart don&#39;t suddenly earn their first $5m go off and buy an annuity. They&#39;re more likely to go off and found their own trading shop at 30 than they are to retire.Secondly, you know what happens to people who don&#39;t get hired after their internship at Jane Street? They go to HRT, to G Research, to Jump, to Citadel, to Optiver, to IMC, to XTX, if they&#39;re really unsuccessful they&#39;ll go to Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta. These are not people desperate for a job."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Generally good article that delves into how a market maker functions. Couple points:Re EA: quoting my boss, EA isn&#39;t really a dominant thing in the market maker space, it&#39;s pretty much only espoused by a couple high profile individuals (mainly, SBF).Re strategy: point about how there&#39;s little strategy involved in being a market maker is off-base. Everything is ultimately strategy: do I continue to pour resources into a strategy that is losing money in the hopes of eventually seeing pnl? What markets should I focus on? What is the best use of time for each employee that maximizes pnl/head? etc etcOne thing that I thought article got right is that most work involved in market making is about avoiding trades, not making them. Capturing the bid ask spread is conceptually easy. The hard part is avoiding trading with toxic counterparties.Part about put options is especially apt. Market making during a crash / recession (like right now) is especially difficult because all the non-toxic counterparties have stopped trading as much (people like to trade a lot more during a bull market than a bear one). By setting up a structure such that you profit during a crash (either by buying puts, leaning net short, or through some other method), you introduce an uncorrelated return stream that can really help."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The truth is that a majority of tech companies don&#39;t need 50%+ of their employees.Google could lay off vast swathes tomorrow and be immensely more profitable without any loss in revenue.The 2010s will be remembered as the golden era for tech employment. The second we start getting industry wide layoffs, the insanely high wage inflation we&#39;ve seen will kick into reverse much faster than you probably believe possible.Further, tech employees will be the first to suffer in a high inflation environment due to rising discount rate. Yet tech is such a small portion of the labor force that layoffs here basically mean zilch when it comes to the unemployment rate/inflation, and thus there&#39;s a long way for it to fall before the Fed adjusts policy"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s brutal.  We just laid off a couple hundred people last week, only five from our department (which is 190 people) but two of them were from one of my teams.  Demoralizing, and in the case of that team, absolutely devastating to productivity in the short term.Cutting almost 1 in 4 employees is beyond anything I can imagine.  I think I&#39;d feel like I was rearranging deck chairs if I survived the cut and stuck around.  I&#39;d be putting out my resume right now."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The people I know who are still inside (Google) seem optimistic that maybe the company is taking a pause to deal with some of its bureaucracy and internal politics issues and with people&#39;s complaints about perf. I suppose that&#39;s good.From my perspective: They&#39;ve got way too many people doing a lot of meh work and feeling really ... important about it. And it&#39;s on the whole asphyxiating the industry."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; As several of these statements blatantly contradict one another, I went back to the data and ran the same sanity check that I did with Facebook above. In other words, what if Google is using the hiring freeze as a smoke screen and only continuing with the strongest candidates, while keeping the rest on the bench?An actual hiring freeze sends a very strong negative signal to employees and investors. To employees it says &#34;the ship is sinking.&#34; Layoffs are right around the corner and that is absolute poison to morale. To investors it says &#34;technical or not, we&#39;ve hit a recession.&#34; Brace yourselves for impact. Google and Facebook are both advertising companies, so they are tightly coupled to the business cycle. When business spending starts to falter, they&#39;ll feel it first. And they have.So it&#39;s not surprising that the companies themselves are far from clear about this, sending mixed messages. I expect them to continue to do so for as long as they possibly can.The bubble has inflated so far for so long, I get the sense that even among cynical young employees and &#34;investors&#34; there&#39;s a sense of permanence in the positions of both companies. The thing is, those with fewer than 10 years experience have never seen the ferocity of the other side of the business cycle. When it turns, that mofo turns. Those in top management positions have seen it, and they&#39;re going to do everything in their ability to deny and evade it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google has always recruited and interviewed independently of whether they actually have roles open that make sense for you. Earlier this year, I passed the interview and spent six weeks in &#34;team match&#34; before I gave up and took a role with another company. Had a friend who did the same for months for a PM role.Just bc you&#39;re getting contacted by Google recruiters this week or interviewing doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;ll ever find a team or get a real offer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s interesting to see that they also adopted the current industry standard of automatically banning people at random, not telling them why and not giving them any way to rectify it. But then, well, I mean, it&#39;s Oracle. What did you expect?Normally something like this would put them on my &#34;will never use any of their products nor work with them&#34; shitlist, but it&#39;s Oracle, so they were already there since, like, ever.Also, obligatory: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zRN7XLCRhc&amp;t=33m"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a similar experience. Recently my account got suspended for no reason. I have been logging in and reading up on the tutorials / documentation to see how to use Oracle Cloud and I hadn&#39;t even started using any of the free resources yet, but my recently created account got suspended nonetheless. Unless my account was hacked (which I would like to be notified of) I cannot have violated any ToS. I got the same non-response when I asked why my account was removed.To me it looks like Oracle isn&#39;t being honest about their &#34;always free&#34; tier and they just shut down non-paying accounts to cut costs if they don&#39;t foresee them converting into paying customers any time soon. If it were a bug / mistake, then I would have expected better support (restoring the account or providing a new account if that&#39;s not possible), but being ghosted by a big corporation when you know for a fact that you did nothing wrong is pretty frustrating.I have not had such a bad experience with any cloud company ever. I sincerely hope Oracle changes, but as it stands I will never spend a dime with Oracle and I will dissuade anyone from using their services, because of how unreliable they have demonstrated themselves to be."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reading this I can&#39;t help feeling that Python puts the &#34;simplicity&#34; in all the places that don&#39;t matter. Simplicity is the reason given for not having useful language features like pattern matches as expressions, or lambdas with multiple expressions, but I&#39;ve never seen these features[1] cause problems in other languages. And then we have this... Surely semantic simplicity is the simplicity that actually matters, but the way the simplicity argument is used in Python is often to enforce arbitrary syntactic and semantic complexity.[1] It&#39;s almost ridiculous to call these features as they&#39;re just a consequence of the underlying language model. E.g. if you have expression blocks you have lambdas with multiple expressions with no extra work."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a 50+ greybeard (literally) and here&#39;s my story: I once figured I could improve my chances of getting a job if I shave my beard. I knew I looked much younger without it, people would get my age wrong by some 10-15 years. And so my 6 months-long search for a job that time ended in success on the first interview after I shaved it. The first one! I remember the faces of the guys who hired me when they saw my personal data on some tax form that I filled later, after the contract was signed.Ageism in this industry is real. I think the root cause of it is investors, it&#39;s where the origins of this phenomenon are. They prefer younger entrepreneurs who in turn hire people like themselves, and so it propagates down the hierarchy as the company grows. It&#39;s transitive. In fact this is true for all types of discrimination.I switched to entrepreneurship and feel the same effects here. Good luck raising money or even finding a co-founder. It&#39;s tough. Not going to shave my beard though.I have no idea what could be done here other than for the aging tech people to unite and form their own companies, investment funds. Just like the other discriminated groups do - women, then racial and other minorities.Edit: I should add, I was talking about a hands-on engineering job, not management. I love coding and not going to quit it because of ageism or pay or other circumstances."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know agism is rampant in this industry, but it still shocks me. I&#39;m 23 and relatively junior at ~1YOE. The &#34;grey beards&#34; I&#39;ve worked with have all been incredibly technically proficient and a joy to work with.The skill and ability and depth of experience held by my older coworkers makes me grateful to have the opportunity to work with and learn from them.To any older individuals here still working in tech, please don&#39;t feel unwanted. Your experience is needed and appreciated, especially by the juniors who get to work with you."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My thoughts: It keeps getting better and better.You stop reinventing wheels. You know where most of the holes are and
can laugh when the kids fall in them. You know the hype cycles and can
spot the fads and fashions. With 10 or 20 languages behind you, code
becomes separate and &#39;above&#39; languages, so you can think in structures
and abstract algorithms. Enjoy standing up for principles, you&#39;re the
man now, and there&#39;s not much left to &#34;look up to&#34; (especially in this
morally declining business). Not having something to prove means you
can know your limits, like when to quit trying to fix someone&#39;s &#34;poor
little thing with a broken wing&#34; that ain&#39;t ever gonna fly. You&#39;ve
time to read all four volumes of Knuth and really (almost)
understand. Also, you&#39;re not going to win that Turing award now, so
enjoy not having to try.Things to watch out for.Look after your eyesight and posture. Spend more time thinking about
code while out walking. Shout at clouds less because you realise that
dumb ideas will die of their own accord in good time. Enjoy the new
toys the kids make, even if they aren&#39;t &#34;production ready serious&#34; -
they will mature in time."</p>

been waiting for for a _loong_ time, and it&#39;s finally reality, thanks
to the Asahi team. We&#39;ve had arm64 hardware around running Linux for a

doing test builds and boots and now the actual release tagging. But

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Part of why it is so difficult is that these C-level executives have mastered the art of sounding good with minimal set of accomplishments. Sometimes I listen to these presentations and it feels like a solid story and presentation, but there is nothing behind their rodeo when you sit back and dig deeper. A fucking mirage.It&#39;s not the person who does excellent work that gets promoted or climb up the corporate ladder, but the person who knows how to sell their work, as sad as this is."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked for a large, late stage, Softbank backed company. They brought in some C-suite execs while I was there. A CTO paid several million annually with large, public company experience. They were totally clueless, and the engineering org was almost revolting within 6 months, trying to stage a coup to the CEO. No technical experience, no leadership, installing cronies, speaking in opaque platitudes.I&#39;m not angry about it, though they did oversee us being on the cusp of a promising IPO to a pretty bad outcome that cost me a lot of money, but I&#39;ll say that any illusion that you have to be competent to be a C-suite exec, and any imposter syndrome I ever had, went out the window after that. Ironically it increased my personal confidence, if these idiots can do it I certainly can.I think the old saying &#34;nobody gets fired for buying IBM&#34; kinda applies to some execs maybe, like nobody gets fired for hiring some stellar resume exec with lots of experience, but they may get fired for taking a chance on an upstart."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s because you shouldn&#39;t hire them but you should grow them internally. Outside hires for executive positions are usually a great way to de-stabilize your company, early hires tend to be loyal to the founders and if you then hire some &#39;suit&#39; to sit between them and you you risk them breaking off.So the solution to this problem is to ensure that your early hires are all top notch with the potential to eventually build out to become your C-suite, and to treat them as generously as you can when it comes to equity.And if you&#39;re really smart you stick to that mantra: hire quality over quantity, it will allow you to push back the typical organizational struggles until you&#39;ve achieved an order of magnitude or more in revenues (assuming product market fit)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Great letter. Wanna bet it was completely ignored? Glad to see it here. Maybe it won&#39;t be ignored.Librarians rock. There&#39;s even a show about them[0], Starring Number One.I can&#39;t access the gMail account I set up, because I made a mistake, when setting the password, and did not save the one I used.It will not allow me to access the account I set up.After a while, I just gave up. I am satisfied that someone can&#39;t use my gMail address to impersonate me (because even I can&#39;t get it).

								<p class="story__comment_others">"About a decade ago, a broken iPhone caused me to experience how bad Google&#39;s MFA reset process was — there were multiple _years_ where the “hard landing” form triggered a flow which sent an email to an internal mailbox which didn&#39;t exist! — and while I was able to use printed backup codes after I returned home the experience left me concerned enough that I went to one of their identity group&#39;s public meetings here in DC.One of the things which I was struck by was how unseriously they appeared to view their role in modern life. People were generally very casual about the need and were especially uninterested in anything which required them to work with outside parties.My suggestion was that they consider a protocol where trusted civic authorities could be allowed to confirm someone&#39;s identity, which sounds like it would be useful for this case: let the person initiate a mediated reset flow where someone like a librarian, police officer, etc. could authenticate in their official capacity and check a box saying that they&#39;ve confirmed the photo ID for the person standing in front of them. Most of the benefits from MFA are preventing things like phishing attacks which are also stymied by limiting it to people in your geographic area, although you might want to disable this for high-risk people enrolled in Google&#39;s Advanced Protection Program."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Perhaps the solution is for libraries or local authorities to setup their own email providers. An email address “for life” with your library card, with the necessary support and in-person reset verification that their patrons need. I’m not suggesting this would be an easy or inexpensive undertaking, but maybe that’s just the next step in service evolution for a public information service like a library group."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;Trivial inconveniences&#34; are a big hurdle when trying to build a habit, but are a great tool for breaking bad ones. Anything you can do to break the dopamine loop helps, however small it may be. I&#39;ve had success with:- setting long passwords to social media that aren&#39;t autofilled (saved in bitwarden) and logging out after each session- nerfing addicting parts of webapps (plugins which block the facebook news feed but allow messaging/groups helped a TON)- forbidding dedicated social media apps and only using &#34;worse&#34; internet sites- router DNS blockers, even if I can get around them, the act of having to bypass it raises my awareness I&#39;m doing something subpar for myself"</p>

Reading his post had a major impact on me—since then I have always thought differently about the time I spend online.It’s interesting how people, including myself, try to justify various addictions. How am I supposed to stay informed about important topics without the news? How do I know how to help people in need without knowing what’s going on? There are much, much better ways than reading CNN/NYTimes every day. Also, there really is nothing new about the human condition today compared to a hundred years ago.[1] http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/hatethenews"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Turning off all notifications on my personal phone was a life changer. No longer I feel like I&#39;m wearing an electronic collar. Giving everyone who has your contact information access to your attention is poison to the ability to concentrate. Another big thing for me was cutting down on infinite scrolling, blogs and videos and spending a lot more time with long form content (mainly books). Attention is our most precious resource and we should guard fiercely against attempts to monetize it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Well this is... eerie. I just released Stictionary[1] on Friday.It is an offline, ad free, dictionary that remembers words you look up. It gives a word of the day and provides (admittedly underfeatured atm) flashcards to review your word lists. It includes optional syncing to keep your word lists across devices. I&#39;ve been holding off posting about it while i complete the website[2].Love to see someone else had such a similar idea. Great confirmation of the unmet need in the space. Really awesome execution as well. Congrats on the launch!On a personal note, i built Stictionary after tracking all the words i looked up manually for years. Now i have an app that does it for me (and was a blast to build).1: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stictionary/id1613214660?platf...2: https://www.stictionary.com/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Actually, iOS already has built-in support for dictionary and thesaurus. In any native text input field, select a word and choose Define or Look Up. The choice of dictionary is customizable; I usually choose New Oxford American Dictionary and Oxford Dictionary of English (not to be confused with the venerable Oxford English Dictionary). They are high quality dictionaries. They are basically the same except that the pronunciation for the latter is in IPA which I&#39;m more used to.When I need to look up a word, I create a new note from control center, type in the word, double tap to bring up the contextual menu and then the dictionary.It pretty much checks all the boxes. For distraction-free reading, turn off &#34;Content from Apple&#34; in the Siri settings to avoid those obnoxious Siri knowledge panels."</p>

The language means nothing, the principles mean nothing.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Note these are bail conditions (so presumably an alternative to a much more constrained existence in prison) for a charge that indicates potential for inflicting severe economic damage after organization via communication devices.When compared to bail conditions for other charged crimes which may also be strict and context-related (eg. trackers or keeping distance from a victim of violence) it sounds tough (and right to be strictly monitored under rights laws) but not necessarily unreasonable.Is it wrong/excessive/draconian? Possibly. But I don&#39;t think a knee-jerk assumption that it is any of those things is appropriate."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a (thankfully mild) inherited retina disorder. If you read the part about lasers and eye damage it’s basically that, but the “lasers” are faulty genes rather than anything external causing the eye damage. And I can verify that at first my brain did an incredibly good job at error-correcting over it, but in the last couple years it’s finally been able to “peek through”. One day I was hiking and suddenly had black spots in my vision. Then after that I woke up one morning and noticed large black halos in my vision that went away after a couple seconds of being awake. A couple weeks later and I started getting flashing visual artifacts in the edge of my vision.Which is/was terrifying because I didn’t know this was a multi-decade process I was just becoming aware of and instead assumed that if I just noticed this much visual degradation in a couple weeks then surely I’ll be completely blind in a couple more?  Thankfully that’s not how it works, the damage has been increasing at a slow steady constant, it’s just that the processes in place to correct for said damage do a _really_ good job at hiding it, until they don’t, so the rate of degradation seems much worse than it actually is.That said, please if you notice any new visual artifacts get them checked up on _immediately_, while my case is a slow genetic issue sometimes it’s a detached retina, which can happen for any number of reasons and can usually be reversed quite easily with surgery if caught early.  I was “lucky” mine was genetic rather than physical trauma, since I didn’t go see someone until things got noticeably worse."</p>

This shaved tons off of my bundles (unfortunately have some libraries we rely on that are both substantial but old)Another one is library deduping.

You could compress pages, kinda like ZFS compresses blocks, and still maintain random access, and get pretty close to whole-file compression."</p>

The Asahi team don’t have support for everything yet (notably no GPU) but what they do have support for seems to be high quality, well integrated with Linux’s conventions, and upstreamed into the mainline kernel! How much other hardware can claim that?The Asahi developers have also stated that Apple tends to keep hardware peripheral interfaces stable across generations (they speculate that this is to keep things easy for their own OS dev teams), and that this has so far proven to be true for M2 (and several iPhone generations before that), and thus once support is available , it should stay relevant for some time.Given this, it seems like MacBooks could easily end up becoming the laptop of choice for Linux developers in the years to come."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Call me crazy but I think long term (10 years +) the Intel strategy of fabricating chips domestically is the correct choice. There&#39;s a ton of geopolitical pressure in this direction. The US simply doesn&#39;t want to be dependent on Taiwan for chips, for obvious reasons.Intel knows this and is trying to become the TSMC of the west. And frankly they&#39;re the only ones that can pull it off. I&#39;d be surprised if 10 years from now the majority of their revenue comes from selling processors rather than fabricating them for AMD, NVIDIA, etc. Why compete when there&#39;s plenty of steak for everyone?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had invested in AMD when Lisa Su took over as CEO. I had been keeping tabs on the company for some time. Unfortunately I needed money to cover my basic living expenses and had to sell all my shares about a year later. Even at the time, it was painful because I had spent a lot of time researching AMD and I was very optimistic about Lisa Su based on her background and her tenacity.I could have made maybe 20x on my investment... Still, I don&#39;t feel regret. You can only regret things if you had a choice and I know that there&#39;s no way I could have avoided selling those shares."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"A few years ago, Bing had a bunch of tools for developers: base64/HTML/URL codec, ASCII table, QR code generator, color picker, formatters, even the ability to run code in the browser on the servers of an online judge (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11450385)One day they all just disappeared. I actually wasn&#39;t the only one who noticed (https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-bing/what-h...)I think I know why: the Bing blog implies that most of it was the passion project of a couple of summer interns in 2015.

This probably would have never been noticed if there wasn&#39;t a end-to-end prober test because this particular formula was an example in the Google Home instruction pamphlet.Search is very a complex system and quite possibly there is a poor SRE looking into this right now."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Great job!I can sort of relate. I worked on an infrastructure system, almost entirely alone, for ten years, before it was finally taken over by a capable team, and I was able to step away, and it took on a life of its own. It is now a worldwide standard, used daily, by thousands.I say “sort of,” because it was never something I planned to make money on. It filled a need. Also, and it’s a long story, I had to weather a fairly hefty level of abuse during that time. The demographics of the target user base were … challenging.It’s all good, now.One thing all that time brought me, was a really high-Quality product. Lots of time to squash bugs, and iterate the UX."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice project. I can relate in that I have my own personal hobby project that I have been working on for years and I would like to get many more users trying it out.Mine is a new kind of data management system that can manage unstructured, structured, and semi-structured data. Think of it as a file system, database, and NoSql system all rolled into one. It is currently in open beta at https://didgets.com/You say you have &#39;finished it&#39;. Software is never finished, but if you have checked off all the feature items from your design, then close enough for now. With my project, the TODO list is still extremely long. It can do many things already, but I seem to put two more items on the list every time I cross one off.It seems that every solo, multi-year project goes through the phases you describe (burn out, depression, questioning your sanity, etc.) and mine is no exception. It still feels very self-fulfilling every time I get a major piece working or I blow away the alternative in a speed test."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"OP, I&#39;ve been working on a very similar thing for some years now, too.  I could write a book about this at this point, but I will avoid gushing here.Please let me share some pain.Many developers/companies make this thing and none of them really know how to (or can) share.  I&#39;m happy to share my list.The end result, as I see it, is a fragmented mess of either partially completed or fully completed and walled (and/or poorly modularized) software.Take for example VS Code&#39;s tree view.  Can a developer with a need for an explorer view just use VS Code&#39;s tree module?  Not hardly.  Go reinvent.Contrast that with CodeMirror.  If you look, you will see CodeMirror everywhere.  This software truly  empowers devs and it has resulted in pure awesomeness.There&#39;s no shame in not open sourcing what you&#39;ve created, I&#39;m assuming you haven&#39;t.  And I can&#39;t say anything about how you have modularized your components.But it pains me that the next dev who gets an idea like yours will either give up or spend 6 years struggling to create the same thing (except the CodeMirror part).Worse, Microsoft can afford to struggle and or throw people/money at this.  They can pay people to work full time.  They can give away their editor(and more) for free.  That&#39;s a win from user&#39;s POV.Are you aware that VS Code runs on GitHub and does the majority of this kind of thing?  I think they could completely shut down all sandboxes or similar kinds of software from a financial perspective.I said I wouldn&#39;t write a book.Anyways, I strongly appreciate what you have done.  It looks great.I wish we lived in a world where we could work on the same team building this kind of thing.My best wishes to you on getting paid to do it full time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been thinking it&#39;s time to start moving away from that damn site.- If I actually want to start conversations, I get a lot more comments on HN or Reddit- When I was a job searcher, the idea of just being able to apply from my profile was really cool. Except every job just re-directed you to some form that wanted you to upload a resume anyway.- Of the handful of potential clients who have found me there, none have ended up signing a contract. Better odds just talking on random slack channels.- It&#39;s getting more and more cringe. Call me a prude but it&#39;s really tacky when people post photos of stuff like their wife and their baby asleep on the couch. Do you really want to post your families intimate moments to get likes on a &#34;professional&#34; social network?- If I&#39;m honest with myself I realise that I just replaced my addiction to one blue site (FB) with another.Anyway add me on LinkedIn!! https://www.linkedin.com/in/lewisandrewcampbell/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A bit of tangent, but it reminds me of a funny story:I discovered one day that I am getting recommended &#34;Long distance truck driver&#34; jobs through email and some of the re-targeted ads. First, I ignored them, but in a week or two, it became apparent that it was not just a coincidence.  After some research, I realized that I had listed &#34;Device Driver&#34; programming as a skill on my LinkedIn and personal website. I suspect it must have been crawled, and the word &#34;Driver&#34; was matched to send me those recommendations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; It appears that LinkedIn is automatically importing job postings from other places on LinkedIn and other sites such as angel.co if the company name of the job posting matches your company name on LinkedIn.The irony when LinkedIn get so upset about people scraping their website."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t have a car and absolutely hate the car-centric culture of American cities (I live in SF).That being said, this article is completely wrong and draws the wrong conclusions. People were anti-car early on because most people didn&#39;t have cars. Later, people stopped being anti-car because most people had cars. The article would have you believe that at no point in time did the majority of people want car-centric city streets and that it was forced on them by a small minority of people interested in selling cars. That simply isn&#39;t the case. Vocal opposition to cars faded away as more people owned them.It&#39;s important to understand the status quo correctly if we ever want to change things. The sad reality is that most people want cars, even in dense cities. As I look out my apartment window on a Sunday morning, with pleasant weather and a walkable green neighborhood, I still count far more cars going by than people on foot or bicycle. Hopefully that would change if we made it easier and safer for people to walk, but it&#39;s not productive to pretend most people secretly hate cars."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ouch, so US towns and cities didn&#39;t always be hostile towards walking.  My assumption that it&#39;s always been this way, was wrong.But in a way that&#39;s worse because it means they used to have this privilege and it has been taken away, and cars-first has become the norm.But the roads would have been used for something, at a guess, was it trams and horse carriages, and that these didn&#39;t pose much of a problem?  I&#39;ve been to towns with trams in the middle of roads and it&#39;s normal for people to just walk around it or near the tracks without problem.  But I am a stupid tourist so I kept my distance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember in Sixth Grade (in Maryland), our teacher telling us that there was still a law on the state books, that said (I can’t remember what he said, precisely, but this is the gist):If a car is going in one direction on a road, and there is a horse (I don’t think he specified whether or not it was harnessed, but I’ll bet it needed to be in harness) coming the opposite direction, the car needed to pull over, and yield to the horse.If the horse refused to pass the car, then it was incumbent upon the car owner to (in escalating order):1) Turn off the engine.2) Cover the car in a blanket.3) Dismantle the car, piece by piece, until the horse passes.I could see a cranky old farmer having fun with that law."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article perfectly exemplifies the arguments in discussions. Lets just concentrate on the waste discussion. The article says heavy metals in solar panels are a problem (I kind of agree, although the way it is described makes it out like we are talking about huge amounts, in reality the lead in solar panels is largely from soldering so very small amounts. Orders of magnitude more are being used for other applications (like car batteries)). They then say that recycling is currently still a problem (sort of true, although there are companies who say they can 100% recycling solar panels already). Similarly for wind they say we still don&#39;t know how to recycle the carbon blades, again sort of correct (but there are many other applications of carbon fibre which produce much more waste).Then when it comes to nuclear waste however, the argument is we can ignore pretty much all long lasting waste, because of some development in the future will make recycling of spend fuel rods feasible. So essentially he is comparing the current state of solar panel recycling to some future potential nuclear waste recycling. That&#39;s a dishonest comparison. Moreover ignoring the amount of waste from dismantling the nuclear power plant (which needs to go into nuclear storage because it is radioactive due to irradiation), while talking about the carbon fibre from wind turbines is also disingenuous.We see the same argumentive structure when talking about the economics; the current state of renewables is compared to some potential future state of nuclear. While in reality renewables are on an exponential cost reduction trajectory and all the nuclear potential is completely unproven."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is this idea that nuclear is not being deployed because people have a wrong perception of risks.However, the main reason is the economy. The costs of solar, wind and batteries are dropping exponentially but the costs of nuclear are not improving. We can blame regulation and the hypothetically wrong public perception about safety, but the reality is that costs cannot go down easily because of the innovation dynamics:1. It takes several years to build a nuclear reactor. Hence, innovations take a decade to reach the market. Learning curve has to be slow.2. A nuclear reactor cannot be shipped, it has to be build on site. This makes manufacturing automation, economies of scale and competition hard. In other words: you cannot have factories in China, or elsewhere, shipping cheap nuclear reactors all over the planet.A change in regulation might lower the costs, but it&#39;s not going to improve much the innovation dynamics.In conclusion, all this talking is mostly irrelevant: nuclear reactors are simply not going to be built because they are not competitive. And things are getting worse by the day because the alternatives have a better innovation cycle."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We saw another downside of nuclear power in Ukraine: When Russian troops attacked towards Enerhodar and there was shelling in the area the safety of the  reactor could not be guaranteed. In the end, containment can be guaranteed w.r.t to internal accidents but no facility can ever be safe from outside issues like war, natural disaster or politics.Solar has less single points of failure and if it fails not much happens, like in the case of the stolen solar power plant (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokmak_Solar_Energy)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Russian here. Roskomnadzor&#39;s capabilities for blocking TOR are quite sufficient to cripple TOR&#39;s capabilities to the point of making it unusable as a VPN service, unless you set up your own private TOR ramp, which in this case is essentially the same as personal VPN, but much more slow.The algorithm is quite simple:1. Attempt to connect to TOR2. If it connects, blacklist the IP, goto 1.3. TOR is unavailable(If an anonymous TOR user can obtain bridge address, shared by any means, email, Signal, messenger pigeons or whatever, RKN operative can obtain it as well)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This has been really fascinating to watch. A patch just landed in Pion DTLS[0] yesterday to make the fingerprinting harder. I don&#39;t remember all the commits, but the Tor devs are absolutely amazing to work with and submit patches that are pretty much perfect :)If you haven&#39;t had a chance to investigate WebRTC I really think it is worth it. WebRTC gives up P2P Data/Media everywhere and it is really hard to block (because so many companies depend on it). To me it really feels like the best path forward to circumventing control. It also is a great career move. You can help people build conferencing tools during the day, and Censorship Circumvention at night.[0] https://github.com/pion/dtls/commit/de299f573c3e44fece16f09c..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I remember during my undergraduate physics years at the University of Otago, we had a visiting guest speaker - I think it was Dale Bridenbaugh around 1976 when he had resigned as a manager in GE&#39;s nuclear division worried that their plants were not safe [0].  He had just also toured Australia as a guest speaker toward the anti-uranium effort [1].At the time, Robert Muldoon was Prime Minister of New Zealand and was pursuing &#34;think big&#34; projects for NZ including a planned nuclear power station.  As one of the &#34;GE Three&#34; [2], Bridenbaugh blew the whistle that the quoted price tag of the
power plant did not include necessary safety precautions which he eloquently explained would cost at least an order of magnitude more (greater than the GDP of NZ).  Of course the whole idea made no sense in a country blessed with hydro and geothermal resources.  In the end the project was abandoned for total cost of ownership budget reasons rather than nuclear issues.I wonder what has changed since then?[0] https://www.times.org/nuclear-power-back/2018/3/8/the-long-t...[1] https://www.bmartin.cc/pubs/82alternatives.html[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GE_Three"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;The SMR’s 12 modules, each producing 50 megawatts&#34;So each module is a little smaller than the reactor of the 1960&#39;s era submarine I served on and is based on the same pressurized water technology. I was a &#34;nuke&#34; so had to go in the reactor compartment several times. As far as I can remember, the reactor was about 10 feet in diameter. We went in the shipyard for refueling after the lifetime of the rods, which was 15 years. I could never understand why we didn&#39;t build these for civilian use (cost I figured) but now we will. Cool.https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/news/2022/22-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While this is an overall good development, and I wish the company luck. Its really not the solution.While scale is what killed nuclear, the people who initially decided on scale, did so for good reason. You lose a huge amount if you scale down, specially with PWRs.These small PWRs try to get some of that efficiency back with factory production, but at best it just evens out. The advantage is the added flexibility. So I don&#39;t think that putting traditional PWR in a tube is really any kind of series solution to transform our energy system.However there are good things coming out of this. For example, NuScale went threw a process managing multiple reactors from the same control room. That is the same thing that essentially all GenIV reactors want to do as well. Having managed to get that concept threw the regulator will make it massively easier for anybody that follows.Its a damn shame that we don&#39;t have GenIV reactors since the 80s. We had the technology and every reason to use it. We could be living in a nuclear age right now, and I consider it the largest failure of humanity that we failed to do so. People in 100 years will look back and think we were insane that we did not use the technology we discovered."</p>

Sue them back? Thats the world they live in, and its a world that as a small time person or corporation you can not win in (long term).Look at Gawker and Peter Thiel--no matter how you feel personally about what they did, what they published about him was absolutely legal.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I opened up the article mildly curious about which internet personality was about to make the outlandish claim to the biggest victim crown for internet clicks.I&#39;m heartbroken it was Steven Danziger, they guy that took on big oil, gave them a black eye, and went to (house) jail for it.Even though his case is one I&#39;ve followed for years, it even escaped my own memory.Also, someone mentioned Snowden and Arrange.  for comparison. Although they can be thought as same, remember these two, unlike Danziger, took on the govt, the intelligence apparatus, and its guns.  They should have known full well that when you play high stakes poker you are risking a ton.Danziger OTOH, was taking on a private corporation. His case is big, but no too different in scope than say Erin Brokovich&#39;s case against PG&amp;E &amp; Hinkley(2), or Jan Schlittchmanns case vs WR Grace and Beatrice Foods(1). The plaintiff counsels won in both cases, without consequences to their life or careers.Arrange and Snowden were morally righteous however they probably knew the size of the sacrifice they were about to make and made the decision to proceed anyway. I doubt Danziger had any idea that what he was getting into would cost him his career.(1)   https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderson_v._Cryovac,_Inc.(2) https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinkley_groundwater_contamin..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s worth noting that there is another side to the story. As Wikipedia notes (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Donziger), significant evidence of Donziger&#39;s fraud ended up being captured by a friendly documentary crew that had been following him around.The Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague found that the evidence placed before the Court was &#34;the most thorough documentary, video, and testimonial proof of fraud ever put before an arbitral tribunal&#34;, and that [Donziger] did engage in blackmail and bribery of Ecuadorian judges.The situation is complex, and I certainly don&#39;t have any insight into the true rights and wrongs of the case. And there&#39;s certainly evidence that points towards Donziger&#39;s innocence too. But Esquire&#39;s take is, I think, entirely unbalanced, and discounts out of hand the idea that any of the many, many court cases Donziger has lost (in multiple legal systems and in front of multiple judges) may have been at all correct."</p>

The loss of power is affecting part of a single data center within the affected Availability Zone. Power has been restored to the affected facility and at this stage the majority of the affected EC2 instances have recovered. We expect to recover the vast majority of EC2 instances within the next hour. For customers that need immediate recovery, we recommend failing away from the affected Availability Zone as other Availability Zones are not affected by this issue."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; The dog has a lot of false positives from the cameras being triggered by car headlights or small animals.My real dog has the same feature, so you’re at least doing a good job mimicking nature, heh."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I bought a house I picked up a dog dish and put it by my walkout basement sliding door.  Also the pond next to my house has old tennis balls show up in it now and then so I put them next to the dish.According to the local cops break ins in my area are mostly just kids going into open garage / garage side doors / back doors that are left open and stuff to steal is out and obvious and so on.I figure just the sense of hassle / unknown of &#34;who knows how this dog is&#34; might be enough of a deterrent."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To add credence to this post, I once heard an interview with an incarcerated burglar who claimed that dogs where the one deterrent that scared him off. He said that an alarm as only as good as the response times of the police and he&#39;s usually in and out of there in five minutes anyway. But who wants to risk it with a dog? Better to just move on to the next house.A few more tips:- Best place to hide valuables is in the kitchen pantry. Master bedroom is the most common place, but who is gonna think to go through your snack food.- A lot of burglaries happen in the winter in the late afternoon or early evening when it is starting to get dark out, but before the homeowners get home from work.- Your house is only as strong as the weakest link. Fancy locks can be bypassed by breaking a window. Design your security system to handle low level burglars (who probably don&#39;t know how to pick a lock), not foreign spies. For most people, this also holds true for online security."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Camera software is an area that is frustratingly closed off, and where manufacturers regularly differentiate new/more expensive cameras with firmware differences: subject detection, auto focus, drive modes (pre-capture, higher frame rates, etc), file format support (HEIC, compressed raw, colorspaces), ui features (how custom modes work, menu systems, etc).Competition in this space driven by a provider that doesn&#39;t have a motive to convince users to buy the next new camera (ie: open source software) would be very useful to users.Sony and Panasonic cameras (and perhaps other manufacturers) are running Linux (and release some of the third party source code they include in their products, but the amount of reverse engineering that has been done on those camera&#39;s software.Canon uses a custom RTOS (DryOS), and lots of work has been done to extend the existing Canon firmware to enhance its capabilities (Magic Lantern[1] and CHDK[2]), but as far as I know fully open software for these devices doesn&#39;t exist.Camera capabilities these days are highly software dependent, and the functionality of dedicated cameras is held back by subpar software development practices and a lack of pressure to make things better.1: https://magiclantern.fm/

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The problem isn&#39;t the capability of remote attestation.  The problem is who&#39;s using it, i.e. who&#39;s defining what &#34;security&#34; means.  As noted above, for a company, &#34;security&#34; often means intentionally inhibiting my freedom, not actually securing anything I care about.We would benefit from a better public discussion of what &#34;security&#34; encompasses.  Else, we risk conflating &#34;what MS wants me to do with my computer&#34; with &#34;preventing hackers from stealing my credit card number&#34;.Imagine a world where you could submit personal information to a company, with the technological assurance that this information would not leave that company... and you could verify this with remote attestation of the software running on that company&#39;s servers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is there any way we can make Remote Attestation providers liable for any losses incurred while using their services? Can we make it so that banks, record companies, and individuals can sue Microsoft or Google if their system doesn&#39;t deliver on the promise? If we still see cheating in on-line gaming even though all machines are attested, can we we get our money back?I feel like part of the problem is that Remote Attestation providers get to have their cake and eat it too: they make a theme park, set up boundaries, and charge admission under the premise that it&#39;s safer to play in their walled garden than in a public park.But if a bad actor slips through their gate and picks a few pockets or kidnaps a couple children, the operators get to say &#34;not our problem, our services have no warranty -- read the EULA&#34;.I feel like in the real world, if a park operator explicitly bills itself as &#34;a safe place to play&#34; it&#39;s their problem if someone goes on a crime spree on their property -- there is some duty to deliver on the advertised safety promise.But somehow, in the software world people can control admission, control what you do and somehow have no liability if things still go off the rails. It&#39;s just a sucker&#39;s game.Of course, I&#39;d rather not see remote attestation happen, but maybe part of the reason it keeps creeping back is exactly because there is zero legal downside to making security promises that can&#39;t be kept, but incredible market advantages if they can sucker enough people to believe in the scheme."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unpopular opinion:Hardware-based attestation of the running software is an important security feature, especially in a world where data leaks and identity theft are rampant. Let&#39;s say I&#39;m a healthcare provider, and I&#39;m about to send sensitive medical data to a third party vendor. Wouldn&#39;t you prefer that this data only be able to be decrypted by a computer that can prove to the world it booted a clean OS image with all the latest security patches installed?If the vendor wants to install some self-built OS that they trust on their computer and not update it for 5 years, that&#39;s their business, but I may not want to trust their computer to have access to my personal data.Remote attestation gives more control to the owners of data to dictate how that data is processed on third-party machines (or even their own machines that may have been compromised). This is useful for more than just DRM."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I made this site.Copying a comment I made on HN a few weeks ago:The ADS-B signals that many aircraft broadcast include not just the aircraft&#39;s GPS positions, but also a measure of GPS accuracy (strictly speaking, ADS-B doesn&#39;t talk about GPS specifically and can handle any sort of navigation technology; I&#39;m sure there are some planes out there reporting positions based on inertial navigation systems, with correspondingly low accuracy, or GLONASS-derived positions, or whatever, but my understanding is that right now something on the order of 99% of aircraft with ADS-B are using good old GPS so I&#39;ll just keep using the term GPS in this description). If you go to https://globe.adsbexchange.com and click on just about any aircraft, you&#39;ll see an info sidebar on the left of the screen. Scroll down until you see the ACCURACY section, and you&#39;ll see values labeled NACp, SIL, NACv, NICbaro, and Rc. Those are all self-reported measures of the accuracy of the data being sent by the aircraft[1]. NACp is &#34;Navigation Accuracy Category for position&#34;, and is a good measure of whether the aircraft&#39;s GPS is working well. (A somewhat obscure feature of ADS-B Exchange lets you see a map of all aircraft that are currently reporting poor navigation accuracy for their GPS: https://globe.adsbexchange.com/?badgps)To make the maps, I process a day&#39;s worth of data from ADS-B Exchange to find all the aircraft reporting poor navigation accuracy and then I color map hexes (using H3 hexes) according to the proportion of aircraft passing through that hex that reported bad GPS accuracy. Specifically, I&#39;m counting an aircraft as experiencing &#34;interference&#34; if it at some point reported good navigation accuracy and then reported low accuracy. Doing this helps filter out aircraft that just have an ongoing issue with their GPS equipment, or don&#39;t even have GPS.When I do that, areas where there is systematic interference—almost always jamming by military systems—become obvious. There are a few conflict zones (Syria, Cyprus, Israel) that have been experiencing jamming for years, and the U.S. often has smaller scale military testing, especially in the West and Southwest. You can also see the jammers that are apparently setup around Moscow to prevent drones from flying near Oligarch dachas[2].I started making these maps in February before Russia invaded Ukraine because I thought it might provide an early warning of an invasion. I didn&#39;t see that, and in fact this technique doesn&#39;t do a very good job of mapping GPS jamming around the actual war zones because civil aviation stopped over Ukraine, so there are zero or few aircraft with ADS-B reporting their GPS accuracy[3]. Without that data, I can&#39;t make a map.Sometimes I do see changes, like when Russia suddenly started jamming around Kaliningrad in March 2022, causing interference in many Baltic states and leading to Finland to cancel some flights[4]. Then a few days later, they just stopped.I don&#39;t think too many people have realized yet what an amazing source of GPS interference data is available using ADS-B! It&#39;s like having thousands of sensors roaming the planet, broadcasting GPS accuracy data every few seconds. I sometimes wonder if I would disrupt someone&#39;s nascent business model if I started publishing my maps regularly.1. https://twitter.com/lemonodor/status/1493789598077440000

								<p class="story__comment_others">"A quick update on some of the infrastructure behind the map: One day of being on the front page of HN has used up half of the Mapbox free quota of map loads. To sustain this level of traffic would cost me something like $2000/month just for Mapbox. Since this is a non-profit project that I do in my spare time, something is going to have to give."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is fascinating. Really cool to see a map of GPS signals on Earth and the site looks really good, too. Love the colors and interface! Awesome :)Can anyone narrate any of the jammed signals? Like for instance what would be jamming in the ocean between Tripoli and Benghazi? Or what would be jamming around San Antonio, TX?"</p>
