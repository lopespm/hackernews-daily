								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think a proper way to solve this issue, not specific to python but languages running in a VM in general, would be to have some sort of language support where you specifically define what access rights/ system resources you allow for any given dependency.Example of defining project dependencies:  {
    &#34;apollo-client&#34;: {
      &#34;version&#34;: &#34;...&#34;,
      &#34;access&#34;: [&#34;fetch&#34;] // only fetch allowed
    },
    &#34;stringutils&#34;: {
       &#34;version&#34;: &#34;...&#34;,
       &#34;access&#34;: [] // no system resources allowed for this dependency, own or transitive
    },
    ...
  }

It would probably require the language to limit monkey-patching core primitives (such as Object.prototype in javascript),
and it would be more cumbersome for the developer to define the permissions it gives to each dependency.
These required permissions could be listed on the package site (eg npm or PyPI) and the developer would just copy paste the permissions when adding the dependency.
But if you upgrade a dependency version and it now requires a permission that seems suspicious (eg &#34;stringutils&#34; needing &#34;filesystem&#34;), it would prompt the developer to stop and investigate, or if it seems justified add the permission to &#34;access&#34; list."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In a previous HN discussion on the topic of rogue Python packages, readers had suggested bubblewrap and firejail for sandboxing. They limit the access a script and its packages have to your filesystem and network.I think that&#39;s the better approach - just assume all packages are malicious by default. Can&#39;t rely on scanners because of the large number of packages and attacks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I started to develop only inside VMs, with a full Desktop, IDE, browser etc. inside the virtual machine.There have been to many contaminations of major package repos lately. Only one typo in an import statement up the dependency chain and you’d be compromised."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"For some of us (me included) living in a racist society is like a fish swiming who does not notice water.  I only noticed when I became intimate with a person from a minority race and saw how they were treated.  That is when I noticed I live in a racist society.I love the economist.  Their writing is so good, they are biased but know it, and acknowledge it.  Biased, but not bigoted.  nYet this article misses the point, IMO, or racial quotas in professional schools.  They have the liberal individualistic bias, and have not noticed that one. It is their water  (I am a liberal myself, but I have had that particular bias removed by my experiences.)Here (Aotearoa) the point of quotas is not to allow some groups the same access to the privilege of the profession, but it is to help the consumers of professional services get what they need.For doctors, lawyers, architects, accountants (yes) etcetera being from a similar community as your clients is very helpful for your clients.  This is not a benefit to the individual professional, it is a benefit to the community.There is a secondary benefit to the professions themselves.  A cultural milieu helps bring new ideas forward.Whether or not the system in the USA is fit for purpose or not, I do not know.  But when deciding I hope the American judges think not, only, of benefit to the individuals but the wider effects on our communities."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the most pernicious consequences of this fixation on race is the definition of a person by an arbitrary social construct. Although they all check the same box, they have very different experiences and cultural backgrounds:* Black descendents of slaves vs African immigrants [1]* Chinese Americans vs Hmong Americans (a higher poverty rate than Black Americans! [2])* A Korean who grew up in Koreatown LA vs one who grew up in Utah* A Boston Brahmin vs an impoverished White Virginian whose family members were targeted by eugenic boardsThat said, Affirmative Action can reasonably make those from marginalized groups feel more welcome. In elementary school for example, I felt very out place among the largely affluent members of my accelerated math class. By contrast, I related much more to the mischievous truants who would later go on to be low-level criminals.[1] - https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/24/us/top-colleges-take-more...[2] - https://tcf.org/content/commentary/misleading-data-policies-..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For the youngens here on HN: TomTom was once one of the leading manufacturers of GPS navigation systems for cars - purchased as an accessory that was stuck to the wind screen. This was in a time before every car had a screen built in, and before everyone had a smart phone with Google Maps in their pocket.I guess that product is a prime example for becoming irrelevant by society progressing. I actually still use an old TomTom in my old car that doesn&#39;t have a screen (well, it does, but didn&#39;t come with a GPS built in - adding it after the fact would have been around 1000£), since I don&#39;t have a smart phone. But it has been years since I updated the maps, probably wouldn&#39;t even be supported any more?!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked at Tele Atlas/TomTom until 10 years ago. There is literally nothing new in this announcement except that they are going to &#34;steal&#34; data from OSM now.sensor derived data, user generated content, camera vans all of that is not new. All this existed when I left, so did the people mentioned in this announcement that are still running the show. I always hoped they would eventually realize that they need a fresh top management, but they seem to just keep doing the same old stuff with the same old people until the final collapse of the company."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Of all the fundamental shifts in my life that smartphones have enabled, having an ever-present map with GPS has been subtle but gigantic. I (we?) interact with cities so differently now"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I see what this app is about but at the same time it enforces information overload which is an instant turn off for me. What&#39;ll happen if I were to use it: I&#39;ll pile up more and more stuff I&#39;m interested into, I&#39;ll receive news about all things I&#39;ve subscribed to and eventually I&#39;ll get annoyed from the &#34;spam&#34;. Then I&#39;ll unsubscribe realizing that information overload can&#39;t be handled with apps, I have to solve that problem in my head. In the mean time Obsidian does the job for me if I&#39;m really really interested in something - I write it down and it&#39;s still not 100% that I&#39;ll come back to it later. That&#39;s a no go for me with all the apps that are used to create a &#34;personal encyclopedia&#34;. Engineering wise I can&#39;t say anything but good about the app. Keep it up someone might see things in a completly different way that me, there still might be a big market for this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This seems really well built. It&#39;s fast and responsive. It looks nice. But I just don&#39;t understand what I would use it for.It seems like the idea is to build a database of people, movies, Wikipedia articles and such and then be able to find them via search/links. But I&#39;m not at all sold on why I need this in my life.Is there a way to make the value clearer? Am I just not in the target audience? Who is going to see this and say &#34;TAKE MY MONEY&#34; and why?I&#39;m thinking of products that were instant sign-ups for me...Spotify: For one price, listen to all the music on Earth whenever you want. TAKE MY MONEY!Gmail: Fast email with 2 GB storage. This was such an instant sign-up they had to make an invite system to slow people getting access.Maybe could add something like Lichess: Chess training and games, with modern UX, offered open source as a public good. I mean, if you&#39;re at all interested in chess, that&#39;s an instant sign-up, right?Trying to say, this idea of presenting a clear value isn&#39;t limited to big players like Spotify and Gmail, but can also be done by smaller companies if the value presented is really clear.What should someone see that makes them instantly recognize they need this in their life, because that&#39;s what I&#39;m totally missing here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s a beautiful branding. The UX seems to be very intuitive. I would love to try it without registration. Since you store the data in the browser, have you considered offering a fully offline version that doesn&#39;t need registration for users to get hooked? I would like to postpone syncing until the data becomes valuable.To me, it would also be important that the data is stored in an encrypted form on the server and that the key remains in the browser and has to be stored by me.Personally, I would like to have the option to discover people who work on similar notes, think travel app [1] for mental journeys. It would also be nice to have some social features like voting on links or sharing notes or sets of notes so that others can annotate them. Bonus points if those social features use an open protocol so that users from other note taking apps can join.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33344734"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is Bart, Proton CTO here. For clarity, the issue mentioned here only impacts Proton Mail Bridge, our desktop IMAP/SMTP gateway to Proton Mail encrypted email.The fact that Bridge and its client can become desynchronized sporadically for some users is a high priority issue we have been working on. Bridge is open source, and as a result relies upon open-source components, and the root cause is an architectural issue in a library that Bridge uses to implement IMAP. When there are network issues, this library returns errors to email clients.Unfortunately, there are hundreds of email clients, and some email clients don’t handle errors properly, and this leads to desynchronization.Our error tracking shows this does not happen often (1-2% of Bridge users) and the symptom is usually incorrect display of messages or read/unread status which is fixed with an inbox resynchronization. There are cases where a combination of a desynchronized mailbox and a specific series of user actions can lead to accidental email deletion, but this is far rarer than desynchronization. Our implementation tries as hard as possible to avoid this. If you find you are missing an email, our implementation works around the issue by placing it in a users’ All Mail folder.As Bridge is open source, updates on this issue have always been publicly posted on GitHub. Addressing this issue at the source requires replacing the core IMAP library. Unfortunately, there are no FOSS IMAP libraries that are sufficiently well maintained. Therefore, the solution is to build our own IMAP library called Gluon, which we have been focusing on since this issue was reported to us. You can follow the progress of this open-source project here: https://github.com/ProtonMail/gluonWe are not refusing to fix the problem. The only possible solution is writing a new open-source IMAP library which we can maintain ourselves to ensure this class of errors cannot occur again. We have doubled the size of the team working on this this year so it is a priority for us.We’re confident that this addresses the main sources of desynchronization and will be available in the beta version of Bridge by the end of the year."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For a bit of context/back-story, Richard, who opened this issue, later also wrote a blog post about the whole ordeal:https://blog.sigma-star.at/post/2022/07/protonmail-adventure...In short: The idea was to move from a custom mail server to a paid, hosted solution. ProtonMail was chosen, with the bridge being used to get mails into a local mail client. Issues with the bridge eventually cropped up."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I didn&#39;t know what exactly is proton mail bridge. This is what I&#39;ve found:&gt; Proton Mail Bridge is a desktop application that runs in the background, encrypting and decrypting messages as they enter and leave your computer. It lets you add your Proton Mail account to your favorite email client via IMAP/SMTP by creating a local email server on your computer.Source: https://proton.me/mail/bridge"</p>

As it&#39;s often the case, I would do a lot of things differently if I were starting from scratch today."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I find uncanny about this is how closely this resembles random philosophical/artistic discussions one can find on YouTube - or even what I encountered in college dorm rooms.It&#39;s in fact the illogic of the conversation that makes it more realistic. The reality is that in many deep conversations, people talk about a shared topic, and sometimes even make a coherent point, but also tend to frequently talk past one another and fumble with the thoughts they are trying to convey.Even as as we listen, we don&#39;t focus on each word with the same degree of emphasis, but rather highlight those parts that are most salient to us while thinking of our own response."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Over the years so many different jurisdictions around the US and the world have stated their desire to be the &#34;next Silicon Valley&#34; and have poured an immense amount of money and effort to make it so, whether in the form of incentives for businesses, tax breaks, education, job training, or even just straight paying smart people to move there. Every such scheme has generally failed because they refused to emulate the one key piece of California law that is necessary for a startup ecosystem to exist – banning noncompetes.&#34;But I&#39;ll spend money to train my employees and they&#39;ll just take those skills to go work for a competitor or start their own business!&#34; Yes, that&#39;s a feature of the system, not a bug."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Makes a ton of sense.  Completely absurd for security guards and administrative assistants to have non-compete clauses.  Just another way businesses were trying to reduce the willingness of employees to quit so that they can suppress wages."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"IMHO, companies should have to compensate the employee for the period of the non-compete since they&#39;re still effectively working for them.  Salary limits are okay, but don&#39;t really go far enough.  If they want this it has a value and should be compensated for fairly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’ll offer a perspective unrelated to pay: It’s a pain to start learning C++, and even after you do, older devs will roast the hell out of your code because your book/tutorials of choice forgot to mention a crucial (in their opinion) feature that you absolutely should/shouldn’t use! Not to mention you’ve only programmed on Mac/Linux so far &amp; windows is totally different, has a different compiler, different ways to install libraries, different C++ standard features supported, etc.I like C++, and tooling has come a long way, but it’s so much easier to download rust/Python/node and you’re basically set on every platform &amp; immediately ready to go. NOW consider pay, and even someone enthusiastic about programming C++ will reconsider."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was a C++ programmer for 25 years. Last 3 years, I&#39;m using Rust language in my daily job and for all my hobby projects. I will not return to work in C++ again. No money can make me to change my decision. Nowadays, programming is a pure joy for me again. This was not the case when I had to work with C++."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who has been painfully self-teaching C++ for the last ~1.5 years on and on, these are my hangups:- The features that make C++ decent are often found in C++ 20/23, for which there are woefully few resources- Code taking advantage of coroutines and generators isn&#39;t commonplace yet, rare to find examples- C++ 20 concepts are a near mirror copy of Rust Traits and enable composition that&#39;s an alternative to inheritance, again difficult to find examples of- C++&#39;s way of &#34;implementing&#34; interfaces (IE iterator&lt;T&gt;) by having a magic defined set of type aliases and methods is not intuitive for me- Writing code to control things like parallelization and thread scheduling that&#39;s portable across libraries is difficult. I think std:: executor is supposed to fix this but if I&#39;m manually scheduling threads and I want to use IE oneTBB it&#39;s not obvious how to do this.- Dependency and package management is a nightmare. Need to condense CMake + vcpkg into a Cargo like tool and make it a standard- error messages are indecipherable. GCC 13-dev colors make this a bit better but human-written &#34;ELI-5&#34; errors succinctly explaining the problem and suggesting a solution (like Rust)- flags like &#34;-fsanitize=address,leak,undefined -fanalyzer -Wthread-safety -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=&#34; should be baked in to a default &#34;dev&#34;/&#34;debug&#34; mode newbies shouldn&#39;t need to know/think about- Profiling and instrumenting/monitoring should be a few CLI flags with nice UI visualizers (IE LLVM X-ray)- I have to Google what headers cstd/std stuff comes from half the time"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am still not understanding why my iPhone 13 landscape photos look as good as those from my $900 Nikkor Z 24mm f/1.8 S prime lens with its superior optics  on a $2k DSLR body.If the reason is fancy post-processing, then why can&#39;t Nikon have a tiny lens like the iPhone 13 and just add fancy post-processing to it?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; “I think the 12 MP shooting default is a wise choice on Apple’s part, but it does mean that the giant leap in image quality on iPhone 14 Pro remains mostly hidden unless you choose to use a third party app to shoot 48 MP JPG / HEIC images or shoot in ProRAW and edit your photos later.”This, 100%.The massive difference in image quality is when shooting in RAW. That’s when you actually get the 48MP &amp; the images are fantastic.But that’s not the default. The default is 12MP.That’s why reviewers are so torn on this camera system. If the default was a 48MP picture/quality, everyone would be praising it. But when the default is 12MP, it’s par for the course."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There is a huge potential for language models to get close to messy text problems (many of which are in Excel and Sheet). I am the founder of promptloop.com - the author of this tweet has been an early user.The challenge to making something like this, or Co-pilot / Ghostwrite, work well is about meeting users where they are. Spreadsheet users dont want to deal with API keys or know what temperature is - but anyone (like this tweet) can set up direct API use with generic models in 10 minutes. This document has all the code to do so ;). [1]For non-engineers - or folks who need a reliable and familiar syntax to use at scale and across their org - promptloop [2] is the best way to do that. All comments in here are great though. We have been live with users since the summer - no waitlist. And as a note - despite the name &#34;prompt engineering&#34; has almost nothing to do with making this work at scale.[1] https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lSpiz2dIswCXGIQfE69d...

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The most sensible use for AI that I can see at this time is for supporting humans in their work, but only where the system is set up so that the human has to do the work first, with the AI system looking for possible errors. For example the human drives the car, and the AI brakes when it senses dangerous conditions ahead, or the human screens test results for evidence of cancer and the AI flags where it disagrees so that the human might take another look. The opposite scenario with AI doing the work and humans checking for errors as is the case here will lead to humans being over reliant on less than perfect systems and producing outcomes with high rates of error. As AI improves and gains trust in a field, it can then replace the human. But this trust has to come from evidence of AI superiority over the long term, not from companies over-selling the reliability of their AI."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The web pages and git aren&#39;t updated yet, here is the vulnerability straight from the .tar.gz on their FTP:Fixed two buffer overflows in punycode decoding functions. 
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after
certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue
certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer.In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server. In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests client
authentication and a malicious client connects.An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow an arbitrary number of bytes containing the . character (decimal 46) on the
stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service). ([CVE-2022-3786])An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a
crash (causing a denial of service) or potentially remote code execution depending on stack layout for any given platform/compiler.
([CVE-2022-3602])-----------------------------------Doesn&#39;t sound that critical to me. CAs normally don&#39;t let you outright construct your own certificate, and I&#39;d expect you&#39;ll have a hard time to get a certificate issued which is both for mail encryption (so you get an email name constraint) and TLS (SAN constraint). And servers without TLS client authentication, which is about 99.99 % of them, aren&#39;t affected. TLS client auth is usually only used in enterprise networks and typically terminated by middleboxes running ancient software anyway."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To put this in perspective, the 18300kg per hour from the Permian site is equivalent (over a 100 time horizon global warming potential) to a 500 Megawatt coal power plant&#39;s CO2 emissions (~1kg of CO2 per kWh of electricity) burning 24/7. Or, to put it another way, it accounts for the same emissions as about 0.3% of the entire US electricity grid."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Several questions ask to contextualize this measurement.Here&#39;s a highly-cited paper in Nature (including some of the researchers quoted in the OP) that describes how an earlier survey of California methane emissions went:https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1720-3If I remember right, the state of CA asked for this survey. It was carried out by an instrument similar to that of the OP, but airborne, not on ISS as in OP.California has standards for methane emissions (e.g., https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/resources/fact-sheets/oil-and-gas-met...) that are now covering landfills and oil and gas infrastructure, and dairies -- three of the largest categories of large emitters.(One effect of these regulations, that lay people may have noticed, is trying to get food waste out of the landfill stream, and into composting, so that it doesn&#39;t decay anaerobically and produce methane. In LA, for example, the LADWP is test-driving a program where food scraps - vegetables, but also meats and fats - are diverted into green bins.)Strengthened regulations on methane emissions from oil and gas infrastructure are part of this - I&#39;m not saying the studies motivated these regulations, just that they are all part of policies heading in that direction.It is believed that large oil companies are aggressively selling off oil pumps/fields to get out from under this responsibility. (https://www.propublica.org/article/california-oil-wells-shel...)The ISS measurements in OP have covered (and will continue to cover) a much broader area than the California airborne survey - but with less spatial resolution - so presumably a broad survey of mid-latitude super-emitters will be possible in the coming months."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In Turkmenistan a pit has been burning for over 40 years.In 1971, when the republic was still part of the Soviet Union, a group of Soviet geologists went to the Karakum in search of oil fields. They found what they thought to be a substantial oil field and began drilling. Unfortunately for the scientists, they were drilling on top of a cavernous pocket of natural gas which couldn&#39;t support the weight of their equipment. The site collapsed, taking their equipment along with it [...] Natural gas is composed mostly of methane, which, though not toxic, does displace oxygen [...] So the scientists decided to light the crater on fire, hoping that all the dangerous natural gas would burn away in a few weeks&#39; time.https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/giant-hole-ground-has-..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know this website is not a hivemind, but it&#39;s interesting every time an article like this gets posted the majority opinion seems to be that training diffusion models on copyrighted work is totally fine. In contrast when talking about training code generation models there are multiple comments mentioning this is not ok if licenses weren&#39;t respected.For anyone who holds both of these opinions, why do you think it&#39;s ok to train diffusion models on copyrighted work, but not co-pilot on GPL code?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am a graphic artist. In the recent months I&#39;ve read dozens of articles and threads like this. I still can&#39;t see what the big deal is.Graphic artists don&#39;t have trade secrets or unique impossible techniques. If someone can see your picture, he can copy its style. It becomes publicly available as soon as you publish it. For the vast majority of graphic styles, if one author can do it, then hundreds of his colleagues can do it too, often just as well. If one author becomes popular and expensive - then his less popular colleagues can copy his style for cheaper. The market for this is enormous and this was the case for probably hundreds of years.I personally am a non-brand artist like that. More often then not clients come to me with a reference not from my portfolio and ask me to produce something similar. I will do it, probably five times cheaper than the artist or studio who did the original. It may not be exactly as good, but it won&#39;t be five times worse.Some clients are happy to pay extra for the name brand, and will pay. Some want to spend less, and will settle for a non-brand copy.The clients that are willing to pay for the name brand will still be there for the same reason they are now, and the existence of Stable Diffusion changes nothing to them. And the ones that just want the cheap copy would never contact the big name artist in the first place. The copy market will shift, but the big name artist doesn&#39;t even have to be aware of it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The dynamics on Twitter are quite weird. There’s a small number of users with potentially lots of followers for whom Twitter is an important part of their work or life. If you’re a journalist, being on Twitter is basically part of your job so maybe you should have to pay a bit more just like the customer of some business software ($100 pa seems pretty cheap there). Indeed maybe media publications should be paying for the blue checks for their staff. But on the other hand, these people are going to represent a large part of the draw of Twitter and so maybe Twitter should be paying them instead.But other people use Twitter in different ways. If you mostly use it as a social network between your friends you might not care because they’ll presumably see your tweets because they follow you rather than because they found them in search or whatever.If you’re using Twitter as a forum for discussions about some topic of your interest, maybe you’ll end up feeling crowded out in replies by people with the check. But if you’re at risk of being crowded out then maybe Twitter isn’t working so well as a forum. And I think that if eg A follows B and B retweets you, A should see your tweet whether or not you have a check. Maybe that isn’t so true with the non-chronological feed. If people in the community follow you then, depending on the dynamics, your opinions could still be spread via retweet rather than getting lucky in your position in the replies, no?If you’re some reply guy, maybe your tweets should be downranked but then if you’re serious about it then I guess you’ll pay."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The good:Twitter should not be editorally curating people through verification, making verification only about ID and being a real person is a broadly good change, as long as it&#39;s not necessary for participation. Brands, celebrities, those in the public eye could benefit from this. Needs to be implemented with care and ideally with a branding change so as not to confuse users as the semantics change.The bad:$8 is way more than the profitability of an ad supported user. There&#39;s no excuse for &#34;half the ads&#34;, it should be none at all. See: every streaming service. (Edit: ok some streaming services have ads, but for most online content - video, journalism, etc, if you subscribe there are no ads, it&#39;s just nickle-and-diming users to give them a bunch of ads, particularly when the marginal cost for Twitter Blue is essentially zero).The ugly:Paying $8 to get your voice heard by more people biases towards those with means rather than those contributing to the conversation. At best this will reduce conversation quality on Twitter, at worst this is ripe for abuse."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m likely to pay for it at that price. For reference, I have a bit more than 14K followers on Twitter.Why? Two reasons.1) Funding social media through advertising has led to dysfunctional outcomes like outrage being more visible than high-quality content. I’m in favor of alternative revenue streams, although they have to provide value, and removing ads doesn&#39;t count as providing value.2) My Twitter account is part of my consulting business. Eight dollars a month isn&#39;t much to pay if it improves my visibility or perceived legitimacy. I&#39;d be willing to try it for a year and see how it works out.FWIW, I wouldn&#39;t have been willing to try it at $20/mo."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The title/article seems to be a bit of a strawman, AFAICT countries (or their governments / citizens) do not consider the GDP as the one and only measure of national success. Politics are driven by tons of different interest groups (in the broadest sense, ranging from corporate interests, environmental activists, minority representatives, medical or teaching professionals, farmers, retirees living on state pensions, etc, etc.), not by whether some policy might give a boost to GDP. I could argue that it would probably be better if they actually did, but that&#39;s for another thread.In truth, pretty much nobody really knows for sure what policies actually will increase GDP, or what causes the short term fluctuations (business cycle / recession) or variation in long term divergense between different countries in the first place. The more honest academic economists will freely admit this. (I was explicitly thaught so in my graduate macro-economics courses). So I think it&#39;s a strawman to think that countries/governments are engating in some kind of myopic GDP maximization plan.I think the appropriate analogy is household or personal income. (GDP is just all incomes in a country summed up and corrected for inflation.)  It&#39;s probably not the most important thing in the world, and probably not the most important determinant of personal happyness or life satisfaction. But a severe lack of it (especially compared to the people around you) or an unexpected large drop will probably be considered problematic by most people."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s hard to overstate how terrible this idea is.GDP is a concrete measure that is difficult to fake.  Once you start arguing about the economic value of volunteering, divorce, income inequality, and crime -- you&#39;ve opened the door to never being able to trust GDP again.Should we create new metrics to track progress?  Sure.  Should we stop tracking GDP?  No way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This has been known since the idea was first conceived: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product#Limitat...The real issue is simply that, a lot of the things we want to convert to simple metrics can&#39;t be. Suppose I hand you a list of the exact rate each crime in a country was committed, and I ask you to convert that list to a single number, how would you do so? You could assign a weight to each crime, but how would you know which weights to use? What&#39;s the &#34;true cost&#34; of each crime?Of course, in reality we won&#39;t know the real rate of any crime. We will have estimates, which are likely quite far from the truth."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve read that doctors now spend as much as 50% of their time documenting their work. Companies such as Epic, which provide the software that hospitals use to build databases of patient data, have been big winners in the new world of hospitals-depending-on-software. But did the doctors become more productive? By almost any measure, they became less productive.People in tech keep thinking more tech will solve problems and they keep underestimating the flexibility of the old models. For instance, most large companies used to be run by armies of secretaries, and the senior secretaries functioned as what we would now call &#34;project managers&#34; -- they made calendars, oversaw who was working on what, followed up to keep track on whether work was being done, and kept a close eye on what money was being spent. The crucial thing about having humans overseeing such work is that humans can take a flexible approach to the rules: they know when to break them. By contrast, systems that are highly dependent on software tend to be more rigid. Software doesn&#39;t know when its rules should be broken.The flexibility of the old system is constantly underestimated, the rigidness of the new systems is often misunderstood.In his book &#34;The Design Of Design&#34; Fred Brooks talks about the power of trust, and he contrasts that situations where everything needs to be first negotiated and specified in a contract. High trust systems are flexible and fast, whereas a system where every detail needs to be specified in a contract is slow and rigid. We should stop and ask ourselves, our favorite Agile methodology resembles which of these? Are specifying things with needless detail?"</p>

It is higher now than at any point before July of 2020.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Reminds me of another example of video-game inspired tactics:Just before he reached the end zone, with 17 seconds remaining, Stokley cut right at 90 degrees and ran across the field. Six seconds drained off the clock before, at last, he meandered across the goal line to score the winning touchdown. For certain football fans, the excitement of a last-minute comeback now commingled with the shock of the familiar: It&#39;s hard to think of a better example of a professional athlete doing something so obviously inspired by the tactics of videogame football. When I caught up with Stokley by telephone a few weeks later, I asked him point-blank: &#34;Is that something out of a videogame?&#34; &#34;It definitely is,&#34; Stokley said. &#34;I think everybody who&#39;s played those games has done that&#34; — run around the field for a while at the end of the game to shave a few precious seconds off the clock. Stokley said he had performed that maneuver in a videogame &#34;probably hundreds of times&#34; before doing it in a real NFL game.https://www.wired.com/2010/01/ff-gamechanger/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is one of those events that I&#39;m of several minds about:
1) This is what keeps people outside the scene interested and taking note - NASCAR absolutely should publicize and play up this moment, it brings a lot of folks to the sport. It was incredibly awesome.2) A lot of times something like this is how you form some new regulations - it&#39;s truly one of those &#34;You know, this was excellent but we can&#39;t do it again&#34; situations.3) The best course forward is to leave it alone and legal in this moment, publicize it, but also treat it as the formation of some new rules.Side note, Nascar 2005, which he referenced as one of his inspirations for this, is one of my favorite gamecube games. I remember picking it up and playing it for hours on end, the soundtrack was awesome, and it didn&#39;t feel like an EA cash-grab at the time. Man how times have changed...Edit: Extra info - the 11 of Hamlin has previously made it into the chase for the champion ship by _intentionally wrecking drivers_ , so by and large a huge part of the fan base believes he got what was coming to him."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Congratulations to the Remix team. Though neither Remix&#39;s nor Shopify&#39;s blog posts make it clear, I&#39;m guessing Michael and Ryan will continue to lead Remix development while hopefully having a team of focused engineers working with them. Since Shopify really believes in and wants to use the tech, it&#39;s great that they&#39;ll be able to pay engineers to continue to develop it in the open. I believe Remix also was VC funded so Shopify probably also made their investors whole?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is huge. Remix is my favorite React framework at the moment. It is by far the best abstraction I&#39;ve seen of client/server model. Their API abstraction layer is just right, working with native browser and nodejs APIs, not obscure them. Typescript support is amazing.I&#39;d bet my money on Remix model and direction vs Nextjs"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting move by Shopify, given that they have Hydrogen [0]. I was half expecting Hydrogen to become its own all-purpose framework, but alas, they seem to plan for both to co-exist.&gt; While Hydrogen is focused on commerce, Remix is focused lower in the stack, and will continue to be a general web solution that scales from content through commerce and all the way to apps. Shopify will use Remix across many projects where it makes sense, and you can expect to see more of our developer platform with first-class Remix support over time.[0] https://hydrogen.shopify.dev"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The original thread emphasized too much on a few grants, which I feel is a minor issue considering how small part of the annual revenue they were. Not surprised Wikipedia is able to defend it easily.&gt; &#34;Awards and grants&#34; amounted to $9.8 million, of which $5 million (possibly $5.5 million) represented a grant to the Wikimedia Foundation&#39;s own Endowment held by the Tides Foundation. This leaves somewhere between $4 and $5 million for actual grants made to the community – a figure dwarfed by the Wikimedia Foundation&#39;s $50 million budget surplus in 2020–2021. There was no lack of money for grants.The actual problem is that the Foundation reached its endowment goal, five years before the the deadline it set [1], and yet, they keep guilt-tripping and pretending as if they are running out of money. How&#39;s it not profiteering? They could be honest and add, &#34;We have already reached our goal. But raising more could help us find more avenues to increase the world&#39;s knowledge,&#34; and they would be completely in the right. I bet fewer people would donate if they realized that they are not funding running expenses, at all.Addendum: If you&#39;re considering donating to Wikipedia, I suggest you look into doing it for Internet Archive. The complexity of their project and running expenses is way more than Wikipedia, and yet, they just received 12% of the amount that Wikipedia got in 2020 [2]. They just have $4M in net assets, and yet, I have never seen them guilt-tripping regular users.[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Fundraising_statisti...[2]: https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/943..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The money was transferred to an outside organisation, Tides Advocacy, sometime in the 2019–2020 financial year when the Foundation found it had a large amount of money left over because of an underspendThis is the root of the problem. Wikimedia rises too much money, and instead of putting it in a fund they &#34;need&#34; to find projects, programmes and - now apparently - outside organization that are in no way accountable to Wikimedia.Instead of burning all the money they are donated, Wikimedia should first and foremost strive to secure the technical and financial continuity of the project by e.g. investing a lion&#39;s share of the donations to a distributing fund that provides perpetual passive income from e.g. stock market dividends. Only once that passive income surpasses the current and foreseeable technical running costs (hosting, bandwidth, project and engineering staff) should they start giving money to external organizations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Basically the reason why I will not donate to any large organization. Imagine donating to an organization because you think it helps them pay for their servers or devs and then it enters an intangible web of different obscure organizations, all donating to one another in some obscure way. The cause it goes to is &#34;external organizations that support knowledge equity by addressing the racial inequities preventing access and participation in free knowledge&#34;, which is about the most nebulous, meaningless &#34;cause&#34; imaginable.
Where does the money go? Unkown.
Who benefits? The charities."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Yes!!! I have been saying for years that lower level protocols are a bad joke at this point, but nobody in the industry wants to invest in making things better. There are so many improvements we could be making, but corporations don&#39;t see any &#34;immediate shareholder value&#34;, so they sit around happy as pigs in shit with the status quo.What&#39;s kind of hilarious about this paper is, these are just the network-layer problems! It completely ignores that the &#34;port number&#34; abstraction for service identification has completely failed due to the industry glomming onto HTTP as some sort of universal tunnel encapsulation for all application-layer protocols. And then there&#39;s all the non-backend problems!And that&#39;s just TCP. We still lack any way to communicate up and down the stack of an entire transaction, for example for debugging purposes. We should have a way to forward every single layer of the stack across each hop, and return back each layer of the stack, so that we can programmatically determine the exact causes of network issues, automatically diagnose them, and inform the user how to solve them. But right now, you need a human being to jump onto the user&#39;s computer and fire up an assortment of random tools in mystical combinations and use human intuition to divine what&#39;s going on, like a god damn Networking Gandalf. And we&#39;ve been doing it this way for 40+ years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I get where this is coming from, but no. We don&#39;t need to replace TCP in the datacentre.Why?because for things that are low latency, need rigid flow control, or other 99.99% utilisation case, one doesn&#39;t use TCP. (Storage, which is high throughput, low latency and has rigid flow control, doesn&#39;t [well ignore NFS and iscisi] use TCP)Look if it really was that much of a problem then everyone in datacentres would move to RDMA over infiniband. For shared memory clusters, thats what&#39;s been done for years. but for general purpose computing its pretty rare. Most of the time its not worth the effort. Infiniband is cheap now, so its not that hard to deploy RDMA[1] type interconnects. Having a reliable layer2 with inbuilt flow control solves a number of issues, even if you are just slamming IP over the top.shit, even 25/100gig is cheap now. so most of your problems can be solved by putting extra nics in your servers and have fancypants distributed LACP type setups on your top of rack/core network.The biggest issue is that its not the network that&#39;s constraining throughput, it either processing or some other non network IO.[1]I mean it is hard, but not as hard as implementing a brand new protocol and expecting it to be usable and debuggable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The data model for TCP is a stream of bytes. However, this is not the right data model for most datacenter applications. Datacenter applications typically exchange discrete messages to implement remote procedure callsThis isn&#39;t just a datacenter problem. Every single network protocol I&#39;ve ever created or implemented is message based, not stream based. Every messaging system. Every video game. Every RPC transport.But, because we can&#39;t have nice things, message framing has to be re-implemented on top of TCP in a different, custom way by every single protocol. I&#39;ve basically got message framing-over-TCP in muscle memory at this point, in each of the variants you commonly see.The only kinda-sorta exceptions I know about are HTTP/1.1 and telnet. But HTTP/1.1 is still a message oriented protocol; just with file-sized messages. (And even this stops being true with http2 anyway).In my opinion, the real problem is the idea that &#34;everything is a file&#34;. Byte streams aren&#39;t a very useful abstraction. &#34;Everything is a stream of messages&#34; would be a far better base metaphor for computing."</p>

The innovation capable from people being ably to publish their views, congregate freely, etc. is a foundational good I believe in.On the other hand, I&#39;m aware that certain influential figures explicitly manipulate their speech in order to primarily amass personal power regardless of any second-order effects. E.g. cults are horrible, even though people are freely congregating, they just feel like they can&#39;t leave because of the emotional abuse these influential figures are heaping via their speech.On a third hand, the loved one of a politician was severely injured because of someone who believes the incorrect speech of influential figures and I desperately do not want further injury or violence to occur spurned by incorrect speech on the facts of reality.So what&#39;s to be done about the actual, real harm being done, while also protecting free speech?

preclude an ethical, environmental or economic choice to not partake
in its use, or to substitute other choices.No technology should be encumbered with locks, licenses or mechanisms
that affect the post-sale rights of its owner to repurpose or modify
as they see fit (all other safety and contention (RF) issues can be
dealt with at a another layer of legislation and enforcement.)No impediment shall be made to the access, manufacture and distribution
of spare parts or consumables, software updates, power supplies,

Otherwise you bought a service and not a product.Any service you decide to run on the device, should be possible (without explicit approval of the manufacturer) to be provided by any company. The current situation is like you bought a TV and you can only watch the TV-network of the manufacturer.Needless to say, within this law it should be allowed for any company to perform repairs too, or provide hardware extensions, etc."</p>

I&#39;m going out on a limb, but perhaps macOS&#39; Dark Mode, or VSCode&#39;s dark mode, wouldn&#39;t exist without Solarized blazing that path.It&#39;s kinda funny how, before Solarized, I would see tons of gimmicky themes like some that were going for a Matrix or &#34;classic terminal&#34; feel, going all in on a certain theme but eschewing real usefulness. I want my basic terminal colors to remain adjacent to their intended hues! I want different keywords/tokens in my code to be distinguishable!Ethan&#39;s application of color theory/science to the landscape was like a beacon in the darkness.Before Solarized, I used Zenburn (I actually still do in some environments, I&#39;m not too keen on the blueish hue of Solarized backround.)

Luckily since it&#39;s just a color scheme the website and info on github has been enough for it to continue to propagate.There have been plenty of other color schemes that I think it&#39;s safe to say have been inspired by Solarized and this is very satisfying to see. Many of them have done a better job at thinking through the git structure of their projects :)"</p>

Or is there some service being offered, or is it just design aficionados using this as a gathering place to talk about general design things?Are these projects created by design nerds who simply love it so much that they create things like this or the Dracula theme project for fun? (Excellent!) Or is there some corporate motivation for pushing people to adopt certain color themes?I think maybe the primary source of my confusion is that the nordtheme.com and draculatheme.com websites in particular feel like product pages rather than &#34;here&#39;s a cool thing&#34; pages.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article is great overall, but there is some stuff you should do differently, if you&#39;re wanting to follow in the author&#39;s footsteps:1. Just use UPC connectors everywhere unless you have really good reasons not to.2. Use single mode fiber (SMF) everywhere, including internal wiring. SMF is infinitely scalable for future needs, multimode (MMF) is not. These days the cost differences for cabling and optics is negligible. In fact, SMF cabling is often cheaper than MMF. And no, you generally won’t have to worry about attenuating signal.Also, in my extensive experience, FS.com optics modules are typically better manufactured and more reliable than OEM modules.I resisted the &#34;cheap chinese&#34; modules for a long, long time, but then discovered that most of my uplink carriers used them.It&#39;s been years now. I&#39;ve had many Cisco OEM, Dell OEM, and a couple from another 3rd party manufacturer go bad, but I have yet for one FS.com SFP to go bad. I&#39;ve got several hundred deployed in a wide variety of environments, from great (cool, clean areas) to bad (hot, dirty areas)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I always end up green with envy that people seem to have pre-existing conduits in their walls for running new cables.  There&#39;s no way, in my old house, of doing this without some invasive smashing in to walls."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice read, and great work on the terminations.I did an extensive amount of both fiber and CAT6A in my recent house build, totally about 21 miles together. I did a mixture of single mode and multimode only because of some AV device support for multimode, and because all of it was so cheap compared to the labor and time.I ended up with significant fiber runs between the MDF and IDF closets, the server room, and all of the AV endpoints which is a typical layout. I did run single mode fiber to all 18 wireless AP access-point locations, but I suspect those will not get used much given I also have 2 CAT6A shielded wires to each AP that can support 10G AND provided power.  I do use a direct fiber connection in my office to provide 10G to my network core from that desktop, but that could have been done over copper as well.Perhaps the biggest gain over copper is my switch interconnects which are 40G from the upstairs closet to the server room.  If needed it would be easy to upgrade those to 100G, and since there are 24 strands available you really could expand as far as you are every going to need to go with WDM and the like.The one really good use case for only fiber was running it down my driveway to our gate, which is about a 1/4 mile in distance. That is something that would be more challenging to do with copper. [although I do have copper installed].From my perspective the cost of running fiber was almost 0 compared to the entire project because so much more cost is involved in path finding and clearing ( cutting holes, etc), and the actual pulling.  I was very fortunate to have a large group of friends who spent a couple of days working with me to do the large pulls, combined with many weeks of evenings and weekends doing the rest myself.  Many hands makes that task much much easier.My particular build is documented in a build thread:

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It varies through regions. It is completely the opposite in China because:- No extra app. People scan the QR in WeChat (everybody has it) on the table, it will call a mini-app dynamically (somewhat similar to React Native but interpreted in WeChat).- You are putting orders directly.- You are paying within WeChat as well so it&#39;s seamless.- The app is smooth because almost every restaurant is using the takeout giant Meituan&#39;s mini-app.- Almost every single restaurants in China is tech savvy enough to use those systems because it&#39;s already a take-out centered society. Restaurants not leveraging these systems have virtually zero chance to survive the competition.- You don&#39;t have to wait for anything or talk to anybody in the whole process.The problems people mentioned in this thread:- Minorities, people without smart phone or those are less tech savvy, are left behind.- The walled garden and monopolies and such.These problems are real, but it&#39;s probably not the QR menu to blame, because it&#39;s a far greater problem - in China, you are not allow to go anywhere without WeChat and scanning QR code due to those draconian regulations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like it. It&#39;s annoying to wait for the waiter to come over with menus, it&#39;s annoying to wait to ask them to bring a menu back because you want to order more, and it&#39;s gross when you get a menu that hasn&#39;t been wiped down properly and is sticky with god knows what, and it&#39;s wasteful when they&#39;re printing hundreds of fresh menus a day for the places that give everyone a fresh one.Keep a few backup printouts for those who need them (like your phone gets no signal), but otherwise it&#39;s a fantastic step forwards. Goodbye to grimy wasteful printouts.Plus the bonus of never having to experience &#34;oh sorry we&#39;re out of that&#34; if they update the menus dynamically is fantastic."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hate QR code menus as they are often poorly implemented.However, I just experienced a QR code check for the first time.  That was really nice ..  I scanned the QR code with my iPhone, it downloaded the Toast &#34;app clip&#34;, which allowed me to pay the bill with Apple Pay.   It was totally seamless and far better than handing my credit card to a server to get lost or cloned."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I hate the US penal system. I grew up a semi conservative individual. Good guys and bad guys. Three strikes and your out sounded great. Tough on crime. All of that.A couple years ago, I was asked by my faith congregation to serve as a volunteer at our local maximum security state prison, offering Sunday services to the inmates. I did so for 3 years. It changed me.We’re there some truly troubled/warped people there? Yes. Do I kid myself that their “stories” weren’t surely one sided? No.I was struck by how arbitrary the whole thing is. And how utterly ineffective it is. What troubled me the most is that we have outsourced    this whole raft of problems, without sending it overseas. We want “problems” to just go away. And stay away. And so we outsource the existence of human lives to an alternate universe that exists right beneath our toes. And we maintain fascinating opinions about these people and their lives, with almost zero insight into what the existence we consigned them to was.  When people heard I went to the prison every Sunday to visit with inmates, they would immediately wax their opinion about what it must be like. And I found over time that their imagination did not match my reality. Their can be no empathy in that scenario.I dream (pointlessly) about a world where a much higher percentage of lay civilians spent volunteer time in prisons. Awareness leads to empathy. And only then when we weren’t outsourcing the issue, we might actually be moved to find something more effective."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I spent a month in the hole. It wasn&#39;t pleasant.- I stayed asleep for as long as I could, whenever I could. Chlorpheniramine was readily distributed to prisoners.- Exercise was difficult for me after the first week, as was motivation for basically anything.- I read anything they would bring down there.- We didn&#39;t have a choice in the books we had, so picking something to study wasn&#39;t really an option. Outside of the hole, I eventually had an outside person send me a biochemistry textbook though. However, being autodidactic is difficult with a single reference.- No one talked to me in the segregated housing unit, except for correction officers and during the 5-10 minutes I was able to use the phone a day.- I didn&#39;t experience any prison administrators attempting to provoke any inmates. Although, the grievance system was basically a journaling activity.- I found it very difficult to write anything longer than a paragraph to anyone my whole time in prison.- I was a known atheist in prison, due to some reading material I received in the mail. Outside of the SHU, people often tried to engage me about my beliefs, which I avoided."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So is prison meant to reform or punish? Life without parole clearly means the person will never renter society, so there’s no point in reforming. It’s just punishment. So why not allow the guy to read literature? Or is it because that would be enjoyable for inmates, and we want them to be punished? But the analogy of a tree falling in the woods and no one around to hear it is apt. I can’t think of a single time I’ve contemplated how prisoners are punished and thought “man it’s so great they’re sitting in there bored out of their minds, this makes my life so much better and I feel happy about it.”  They’re completely removed from society, they may as well be on Mars. It has no bearing on me or anyone else whether they’re having a good or shit miserable time. They will never leave, they will die in there. Can’t they just read a goddamn book if they want to?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wasn&#39;t aware of SAFe until one new manager got our director to loose his head for it and institute it in all teams.It was a total disaster.The idea of Agile is for each team to be responsible to improve their processes. Because improvement loops involving higher management are taking forever to complete and because each team has its own needs. &#34;Agile&#34; (quotes intentional) as practiced today is bad enough -- teams are not really improving their process, only implementing something taken from a book.SAFe is taking it one step further by absolutely obliterating team&#39;s ability to influence the process.At least with &#34;standard Agile&#34; it was possible for some teams to do the right thing, as long as they had a manager that understood what Agile really is.With SAFe that was gone.I was told that we can&#39;t even modify our t-shirt sizing because &#34;It has to be standardised, otherwise there would be too much chaos. BTW, we are definitely not creating a new request form to change t-shirt sizes in Jira&#34;Forget about changing any other part of the project. We had a bunch of testers and business analysts which did absolutely nothing but had to stay on the team because they were required in the process by higher management. We did not need them. I spent time hiring people who could do the work from discussing requirements with the business people through design, implementation up to deploying it to prod, but that did not matter.Talk about crazy projects..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"SAFe seems to be a bit like &#34;internet scale&#34;, it&#39;s designed for very large organizations building very large single software solutions. Most organizations wildly overestimate their size and the size of their solutions. A Microsoft Office release probably can benefit from SAFe, an update to an auth microservice maintained part/time by a team of .75 FTE doesn&#39;t.SAFe seems to sort of be a micro-waterfall approach inspired by Conway&#39;s law [1]. It build massive communication and coordination teams so that this gets reflected into short-term development waterfalls that produce software that mirrors the system that managed it. But this team needs to be dwarfed by the development effort they are trying to push forward or they&#39;ll end up dominating all of the activities with largely useless communication and coordination activities resulting in very slow forward software movement, confused goals and priorities, and overstaffing of projects.Example: I once ran a team that was developing some internal tools for a large org, but we were outside of the main SAFe effort. At one point we became dependent on some service the SAFe effort was going to produce. It took 60 people 3 years to not produce a correctly working service. Exhausted with this, I finally just had 1 person build the service we needed as a stopgap. She spent 3 months building it with part-time support from one other engineer for a couple weeks. More than 3 years later that is the service that&#39;s still running and the SAFe effort never did manage to get a properly working solution out the door. I can think of half a dozen similar examples where the parallel effort by a smaller team with less organizational overhead radically outperformed the giant SAFe team -- and they did it mostly by just ad hoc communication channels between the small teams.1 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway&#39;s_law"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t say nice things about Oracle very often, but they deserve some praise here. Graal is a very, very ambitious project, and Oracle has been funding it for years. It&#39;s still rough around the edges, but it promises to enable new programming languages to run on a high-performance JVM, compiled to native code. Write-once, run anywhere, at native speed. And now they&#39;re donating it. It&#39;s very decent of them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"GraalVM is truly great stuff.GraalVM native compilation helps Java in the data center to avoid being a cost sink and to reduce start-up latency. Oracle needs Java to sell enterprise software.Oracle contributing to OpenJDK may be required for Amazon cooperation (since Amazon is pushing its own JDK build) and probably helps the library ecosystem work towards native compatibility.Native support for reflection (used in many libraries) requires &#34;reachability metadata&#34;, maps of reflective API usage, at build time.  Anyone can do it, but enterprise requires authoritative sources.  Until authoritative reachability metadata covers the transitive graph of library+version dependencies in enterprise software, GraalVM native AOT builds are a PITA.- https://github.com/oracle/graalvm-reachability-metadata- latest release: https://medium.com/graalvm/graalvm-22-3-is-here-jdk-19-build...- graalvm &#34;community&#34; roadmap: https://github.com/orgs/oracle/projects/6(As a side note: Mark Reinhold has run the JDK team since 1997: is there any comparable example of such stellar leadership for broadly-adopted software across multiple technical and organizational eras?)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I refuse to praise Oracle for anything. But I could make an exception if they put Isolates in the CE version of Graal and not only the Enterprise one. :)Also, obviously Oracle didn&#39;t do this out of the kindness of their hearts, if they didn&#39;t contribute Graal into the OpenJDK the would risk to Graal never become anything other than a niche VM because most people, specially big clients don&#39;t want to change VMs and the CE version will be their new gateway drug to their Enterprise version of Graal."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’m sure not everyone came here to hear tech book recommendations, but I will add another vote for Designing Data-Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppman. It’s one of the best tech reference books I’ve ever read. It manages to explain SO much while requiring so little prior knowledge from readers.Another book that is relatively new that I loved was Designing Machine Learning Systems by Chip Huyen. I worked in productionizing ML systems for 3 years and this book equips you with exactly what you need to do so. It does a great job of explaining the whole ML modeling pipeline and some of the commonly overlooked nuances that can cause your models to fail spectacularly in production. I will be referencing this book for years to come."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"How the World Really Works by Vaclac Smil is one of the best book I&#39;ve read this year. It gives such a great perspective on how much energy and material we use.It&#39;s one of the most readable books by Smil and has gems like this :“Moreover, within a lifetime of people born just after the Second World War the rate had more than tripled, from about 10 to 34 GJ/capita between 1950 and 2020. Translating the last rate into more readily imaginable equivalents, it is as if an average Earthling has every year at their personal disposal about 800 kilograms (0.8 tons, or nearly six barrels) of crude oil, or about 1.5 tons of good bituminous coal. And when put in terms of physical labor, it is as if 60 adults would be working non-stop, day and night, for each average person; and for the inhabitants of affluent countries this equivalent of steadily laboring adults would be, depending on the specific country, mostly between 200 and 240. On average, humans now have unprecedented amounts of energy at their disposal.”My review is at : https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4708765021Another excellent book is Arbitrary Lines by Nolan Gray - which is a great book about zoning and why we should all be YIMBYs.My review is at :  https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4800787011How Asia Works by Joe Studwell is a fascinating look at why Japan, South Korea and China have done so well.My review is at : https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4806521204Another book I really enjoyed was Firepower : How Weapons Shaped Warfare by Paul Lockhartreview at : https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4417950705"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Non-Fiction / Self-Help:No Bad Parts: Healing Trauma and Restoring Wholeness with the Internal Family Systems ModelIFS for short.Written for normal people, not psychologists/psychiatrists. It has a very valuable core philosophy/teaching about who we are underneath all the masks of our personality(s). It closely resembles something I experienced during an Ayahuasca retreat in 2018, about the soul / inner child/god entity.For something a little more tangible that digs in closer to the mechanism/science, see Dr Tori Olds on youtube, she has 5 videos on the topic that is incredibly powerful in understanding your own behaviours. Will take less than 2 hours of your life but can change it permanently for the better!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s interesting to see some people are making it work living off these types of projects.&gt; I created a Patreon back in April of 2019. I felt a bit silly at the time, with thoughts like “who do I think I am” and “what am I even doing” echoing in my head. I still did it though. I was too curious to see what would happen, even though I expected nothing. Amazingly, a couple of people actually signed up!I&#39;m definitely relating to this experience. Feels hella pretentious and weird to set up donations. Was likewise surprised to actually get people sending me money. I guess the moral of the story is if you build cool things, people are willing to chip in."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ah, Andreas YT programming sessions. The length, the sincerity, the mood. The way he is able to communicate with us while being alone in a room. His very conscious effort to not get side tracked. And, of course, him just being a really effective programmer, while not being flashy or pretentious about tech or tooling in the least (and also probably because of it).Sometimes I watch and listen intently, and learn a lot. Sometimes I zone a little. It&#39;s perfect. If you are interested in programming in general I can just highly recommend checking it out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thank you for sharing Andreas! It&#39;s absolutely phenomenal how far along SerenityOS has come and it&#39;s also a peek at how FOSS is supposed to be - a way to learn, hack on something fun, share it with others but without any huge expectations.Building the next unicorn is awesome and all but in my opinion, this has it&#39;s own place. I am glad some people out there get to work on their dream projects and actually can make a living out it. Kudos to all the supporters, obviously.I also love how focused SerenityOS is and what kind of audience it caters to. Some people might say, &#34;make it for everyone&#34; but that doesn&#39;t work most of the time. Having a focused audience allows a lot of freedom in the way of UX/DX, docs, communication etc. So I am glad Andreas set that down upfront."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In this particular case, I suspect a trademark complaint against Google would make sense.Google misrepresented the ad as the product of the Gimp project, and were paid as a result.  They usually use an &#34;obeying the law would not scale&#34; type argument in court, but that would clearly be bullshit in this case.  They have a business relationship with the ad buyer, and should have verified their affiliation with gimp.org.  Also, a simple string match on the URL would expose the attempted fraud on Google&#39;s end.I&#39;m not sure how to check if Gimp is a registered trademark in the US.  This page kind of implies it might be (or that the author of the page does not understand trademarks):https://www.gimp.org/about/selling.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is also a huge issue with Blender and pops up on /r/blender from time to time.(Here&#39;s a few random recent examples: https://redd.it/xxkx5s https://redd.it/vvrxko https://redd.it/xwkky8 https://redd.it/vuqu1r)Ad networks and content providers get up in arms over widespread ad blocking but then allow stuff like this through."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think people are missing the actual issue here. Google used to have a clear distinction between what&#39;s an ad and what is organic.In these screenshots you have to pay good attention to see the top result is an ad.To keep their conversion numbers up they had to constantly reduce the difference between the ads and everything else. The fact that they can do this and we are so used to it that we don&#39;t first identify that as the culprit is quite interesting.I have ran a few Google ads in the recent years and the people who come through them, some of them, clearly have no idea that they have clicked on an ad. This might be good for business but I think it does more harm overall."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have said this countless times, and I will say it again - it is just marvelous how Lichess provides so much value being completely free (both libre and gratis).I would love to see more publicity of Lichess though - and seems like this move will help in that regard.I don&#39;t know for sure, but is there any other chess organization in the world of this scope that is truly non-profit? Sure, FIDE itself is non-profit, but profit-motives of its commercial counterparts and allies are controversial, to say the least."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While I think a US non-profit makes a lot of sense, I would exercise caution with the non-profit board.The board’s job is to provide oversight and to appoint a director [1]. In this case it would clearly be Thibault, but what happens in a few years when Thibault is ready to go? Does he have say in his replacement? Does the French organization take precedent over the US nonprofit when it comes to leadership and governance?I say this because Lichess is extremely valuable (even as a non-profit) and that will attract the wrong kind of people. Thibault should take every precaution to make sure he retains control of the org, with good people around him. I’m not sure if there is a non-profit equivalent of retaining voting rights, but I’d want to be sure he retains control until it’s well established as a non-profit and a succession plan is in place.The wrong board could evaluate his performance (which right now he says he works at his leisure and loves what he does) and say “we need more fundraising and appearances in the US at tournaments” and he could balk / want to focus on the product. They could then look to appoint a US director of the nonprofit and things could get awkward and extremely costly.It’s incredible what has been built and maintained with a small team. I think they will see extreme diminishing returns after they hit a certain level of governance. Whether that’s going international with a nonprofit status in the US or at another point is beyond my level of expertise.If someone more knowledgeable that I am can correct what I’ve written above and point out that my concerns are overblown, I’d be happy. I’d also ask that person to volunteer and help Lichess establish a presence in the US.[1] https://www.councilofnonprofits.org/tools-resources/board-ro..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Therefore, in 2016, Lichess was formally registered under French law as an association loi 1901. This type of association applies to groups with clearly defined purposes that benefit the public, similar to charities. However, it’s quite easy to form one - the total number in France is over 1.5 million!It is surprising that Lichess is a French charity, much like VLC. France also has a very low entry barrier for forming an LLC, so it seems to be a rather good approach all things considered.&gt; once we become an association of general interest, our French donors will be able to make tax-deductible donations, meaning they can reduce their individual tax burden through supporting us. In theory, this should also apply to donors who are citizens of other EU countries, but the last bit of legislation supporting EU-wide application was passed in 2009 and we’re still waiting for it to be cleanly implemented. Classic EU.It really is a running theme that EU member state governments have to be dragged kicking and screaming to implement beneficial EU directives as local laws while they at the same time blame the EU for everything unpopular they do themselves. If that&#39;s not a clear indicator that the Parliament should have more authority to assert itself I don&#39;t know what is. At least we get the &#34;project funded by the EU&#34; signs on random buildings to not make the good stuff completely invisible on the local level."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t at all object to code reviews/evaluation, but the thing I wonder about is this: I rarely open an empty file and write some big block of code. 98% of the time I&#39;m fixing bugs in legacy code or shimming in some new feature. It would be trivial to produce the diffs I generated in the past 30 or 60 days, but the volume of code isn&#39;t really a great metric for my productivity.There may be some three line change that was the result of eight hours of debugging and analyzing how to best fix the bug without disturbing the stuff that is working. Is that more or less productive than someone who cut &amp; pasted a 100 line routine they found via google?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked at Facebook and remember what it was like to first face the total complexity of the system.It’s really hard for me to imagine myself working at a company that deals almost exclusively with machine-generated data (as Tesla does) and being assigned to judge a social platform’s engineering qualify in one day. Cars and spaceships on a closed network are fundamentally “clean” compared to having hundreds of millions of people who produce dirty and often adversarial data.But I guess the point of this exercise isn’t really to judge code quality, but to drive fear at Twitter."</p>

especially Part 2, detailing the lives of Jim Slater, Tiny Rowland and
James Goldsmith who pioneered the hostile takeover, and the effect of
acquisitions and mergers on the overall global economy. Hard to
imagine that only 50 years ago this wasn&#39;t a &#34;done thing&#34;. Today I see
these same patterns play out in development and artistic communities
oblivious to 51 percent and Sybil attacks, unaware of who is holding

Anyone who has contributed to the gitea project more than 2x PRs is invited to be a maintainer. Every maintainer gets 3 votes.
Maybe there are some suggestions for improving - please open a PR.&gt; Describing the ways in which democratic decisions are to be made.Again, I&#39;m just confused what&#39;s being requested. Moving on.&gt; Providing accessible places where all relevant information can be found.This seems like the same request as above. Or maybe a request for better documentation. I agree. Open a PR, don&#39;t fork gitea.&gt; Establishing a DoOcracy that works and continue to improve it.I agree with this and I suspect that was the intention with the original reference to DAOs, but needs to be clarified.&gt; A non-profit organisation owned by the Gitea community is created.
&gt; The Gitea trademark and domains are transferred to the non-profit.
&gt; The name of the company is changed to avoid any confusion with the non-profit.Does anyone have experience with how this is typically handled? It seems like this is the only actionable request. What are some examples of non-profit open-source companies? Is that typical?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like the story from the announcement[1].&gt; We have a long history of trying to bring Factorio to other platforms, including consoles and mobile phones (not including April Fools). We even worked with some external companies, but the projects never even got to the point where they would run technically, let alone the complicated part of making the game playable using controllers or touch screen.&gt; We had some history of starting Factorio-related sub-projects that ended up in development hell for yearsThis reminds me of their post on good foundations[2].It sounds like they discovered the pain of growing tech debt and paralysis due to an aging stack, and the lack of results when you throw money at the problem (in other words, contract work to some external entity).What&#39;s also interesting is that this work ended up being a one-person project. It&#39;s just too hard to make progress fast when you add people to a project: people don&#39;t agree, they need to communicate not to overlap or to understand the changes added by others, this all slow things down. And if the stack is complicated, this can really put a stop to productivity.I think there&#39;s a real case for having one-person teams for the first X months on a new project. As long as the one person understands how they can later scale themselves. (This usually requires documentation, good architecture, good delegation, etc.)[1]: https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-370[2]: https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-366"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not sure why this pops up now, nothing new afaik, but I&#39;ll take this as a chance to leave a quick review ;)I bought one during the kickstarter, mostly for note taking; but also as a ereader &amp; perhaps drawing tool.
- For note taking: I prefer a simple paper notebook, as my notes are more procedural. I don&#39;t really look back often. It&#39;s fine. Just not better then paper for note taking imo. 
- As a e-reader, it is absolute dog shit. period.
- If you are not artistic, this will not change that
- The subscription model is terrible, I&#39;ve cancelled my &#39;grandfathered&#39; account and tried to sell my rm2 over it.
- Currently using it as exceedingly expensive notepad, no cloud crap etc.
- Battery life is kinda meh, either you have it go to standby and have to wait a few second to use it. Or it is constantly empty when you want to use it. Not the eInk experience I had expected.You can install custom software, as it is not locked down, that might solve some of these issues. I haven&#39;t tried. For me, this is just a notepad. And not a great one at that. I use it mainly because I paid for it tbh.I have several friend that have one too and enjoy it much more, but this how I experienced it, ymmv obviously."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am one of the original kickstarter backers and got mine at a very favorable price compared to what they are selling it for now. As a original kickstarter backer they also provided me with a free tier for their subscription service so I am not paying anything extra to have full functionality, this is very important to me because I am not very excited of subscription based software features - remarkable please take note of this!The remarkable unit is still a thing of beauty. It excels at what it does, and I bring it with me everywhere. I use the cloud features to pick up documents and use it to hold my PDFs and eBooks and it is an important device for my note taking. I have modded the unit a little bit by replacing the original back-ground pictures. To be able to access this device as root appeals very much to me, I very much feel in control of my device.From a security point of view, they still have some work to do. It is embarrassing when the unit goes into sleep mode and private notes are kept visible to everyone. I created a ticket in they support system, but they don&#39;t seem to take it seriously. There is also the issue with only having a 4-code pin to unlock the device. This means that you must be very careful with what you write and store on the unit. Sensitive notes should not be stored on the unit.There is also no way to deprecate the unit and the content if it is lost or it hasn&#39;t check in against the cloud.The software that is installed on your PC/Mac has very basic functionality.Overall, would still strongly recommend, 8/10."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I bought a rm2 a while back but abandoned it when I discovered it had extremely weak security: no fde, a weak remotely-resettable 4 digit pin, no local file syncing (doesn&#39;t appear as a mass storage device when plugged in as a usb, doesnt support standard file transfer protocols), non-e2ee (!!) cloud syncing (their company can see my notes unencrypted).Now I use an android tablet that I locked down + synching and i couldn&#39;t be happier. The only thing I&#39;m missing now is a good note taking app that writes my notes to a directory that can be synced with synching. Recent versions of android broke this for all apps except Google&#39;s Files app unfortunately."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Going off on a tangent, but the scale of production is very hard to grasp.  I&#39;m probably not the first person to observe this, but I once did some napkin math about steel production, and what I realized kind of blew me away.  About 1.9 billion tonnes in 2020.  Like with billions of dollars, I have no intuition for such numbers.  Context is needed.Global steel production just before WW I was about 70 million tonnes.  So production has increased about thirty-fold in one century.  That wasn&#39;t so shocking to me, at first.  But 1910 was not the beginning of the industrial era; things had been under way for more than a century then.  Railroads.  Ocean liners.  Factories.  Knives and rivets for fabric owned by hundreds of millions of people.  Dozens of skyscrapers in New York by then; the Brooklyn Bridge hung on thousands of tonnes of cable.  All made out of steel.Then it struck me.  A few million tonnes a year in 1850.  70 million tonnes in 1910.  All of it adds up to less than 1900 million tonnes.  Every single tonne of steel manufactured by humans from prehistory until about a century ago -- the entire output of the industrial revolution -- amounts to less than one year at current production."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The sad thing is that 100 years ago humans and livestock accounted for around 5% of the biomass (all zoomass, not land mammals only), 95% being the wildlife. Now the numbers are reversed.We&#39;ve stolen the land from the wildlife and dedicated it to a few species we consider edible (agriland is more than forests now, and 75% of it for animal agriculture).Is anybody surprised that we&#39;re living in the anthropocene, defined by massive die off of wild species?We have to (as a species) return the land to wildlife and let it repopulate the earth, otherwise we&#39;ll lose them. We don&#39;t even know what gems we&#39;re losing. I&#39;m not talking about some bugs, but about dna - those are millions of years of (computer) code generated by nature, code so precious we don&#39;t even have an idea how to simulate it, let alone understand it (at this point in our evolution).If we lose it, goodbye new medicines, new regenerative dna techniques, new technologies, and who knows what. We simply cannot know what we&#39;re stealing from future humans (this point was made for the selfish humans we are, better arguments could be made)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lets take in mind that there is a problem to compare two groups when one group is much easier to measure than the other. The error interval in the mammal biomass should be much higher. The actual real values are probably not so extreme.... I see, is just megafauna. The most competitive groups (rodents and bats) are deliberately excluded. The title is incorrect then."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"They need to re-free up the API. Early adopters and hackers really did some great work using the API until they walled-gardened it and rate limited it to make it unusable.  They need to do this for goodwill at the very least, but I think it will spark the fire to make it popular with techies again.Based on the recently published discovery chats we will probably see:* High def video* Focus on music publication* The highest revenue sharing cut from any social media platform for content creators to get people to switch.* Removal of twitter blue but some kind of subscriptions to edit tweets* Paid push DMs to followers (e.g. follow this account for drops, then the tweeter has to pay to tweet to this group)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In the spirit of trying to be high-information and add value:Where Musk is going, there are no maps. So it&#39;s very very hard to project. But we can predict likely developments.At a very high level, it&#39;s going to involve: bringing back controversial personalities like Donald Trump; increasing Twitter&#39;s commitment to &#39;free speech&#39;; assuaging skittish advertisers; retaining users who might be concerned, while bringing in new ones; managing the exodus of users (size:?) that will happen regardless; cutting a large amount of staff, while keeping Twitter&#39;s lights on; open sourcing the code, discussing the impending rearchitecture; and - long term - folding this into Elon&#39;s vision of America&#39;s WeChat, and ultimately expanding Twitter, under X.com.That&#39;s a lot. But at a high level, I think that&#39;s correct.I would expect Elon to take the fight to the media. Whether he&#39;s going to focus on neutrally spreading a message, going more on the attack on media outlets that would support him, or doing something in between, is unknown.Musk has an unusually large amount of media power: that&#39;s his unique value add, in a way. I would expect this to be a &#39;bigger deal&#39; as a story, as multiple stories, than I would for any other company undergoing a takeover. We&#39;ll be hearing a lot more about Twitter in the weeks to come, since the developments will keep piling up, and the press/public loves to read &amp; discuss stories about Twitter &amp; Musk.We&#39;ll see how it goes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"~5 years ago, I hired three Indian developers. They asked me if we could set up an Indian legal entity, so that they could just get regular salaries in India with tax payments, deductions etc taken care of. I agreed and we got it done.One of the worst business-decisions of my life. The amount of red tape, stupid rules, corruption, signatures, stamps, showing up physically in a certain office etc etc... Mindblowing.I will not tire you with all the details, but to this day, Indian tax authorities still hold money hostage, that they agree my Indian company is owed (GST refunds). But all attempts to actually get the money back falls on deaf ears. We have sent experts to the relevant tax offices etc, but the ONLY guy who can handle it is never there, refuses to deal with it, then says we need to go somewhere else - where we are sent back etc etc. Sent around in circles, basically - with everybody recognizing the money is in fact owed...I will never do business in India again. Happy to work with Indian developers (I still do), but they will get paid as freelancers and deal with the red tape on their end."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"India&#39;s obsession with paperwork is unceasing and baffling. Everything requires an application, even when everything can be done digitally. You need letters and stamps to get anything done.Case in point: the &#34;company stamps&#34; that are required for everything you do with your business. From getting a debit card to changing the maturity instructions for a corporate deposit, you need to sign your name AND stamp it with your company stamp.The company stamp can be made by anyone for $1-2. It has no bearing on security at all. Yet, you need to carry it with you if you want to get anything done.It&#39;s utterly baffling. I can access my corporate bank account online and make any number of transactions, yet if I want to apply for a debit card, I need my company stamp and signatures from all directors.Why? I have no idea!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Previously on HN: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24106545 (with a few comments from the author as well).The author had added a correction to the post (12th August 2020) stating that this was a mistake, and that the actual procedure was much less cumbersome:https://web.archive.org/web/20200812093618/https://superr.in...&gt; It has been bought to my attention that there was a mistake by an entry level employee.&gt; So the Revenue Department itself was supposed to get all the NOCs required by going to all those offices, but an entry level employee forgot to add my file to the list of NA’s to be done.&gt; [...] But PLEASE UNDERSTAND that “it was a mistake” in filing by an Entry Level Employee and normally this procedure takes less than 2 months and all the heavy lifting is done by the Revenue Department, Collector Office.Tweet from the author about the correction: https://twitter.com/mrohanshah/status/1293170591441104902But the correction was removed after a while, so maybe a bit of clarification will help."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Here is my competing take:The biggest problem I see in developer communication is what I call the &#34;assumed context&#34; problem.As in, you talk/write to people as if they know all about your code, except the detail being discussed. In reality, they usually have much less detailed understanding, and you&#39;re making no sense to them.I&#39;m pretty sure this is related to people &#34;on the spectrum&#34; often having low &#34;theory of mind&#34; capabilities. People without that will just assume people know what they know, and proceed to fail at communicating with those who don&#39;t.It also makes it easy to think of those who don&#39;t know what is obvious to you as idiots.The workaround, if you want to communicate with the idiots surrounding you, is to start conversations by fact finding. The question &#34;so how much do you know about the flurbigator system?&#34; can help."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This has little to do w/ being a developer vs. being human.People joke about the programmer in a dark corner plugging away and never talking to others, but that&#39;s actually pretty rare. In 20 years I&#39;ve only worked with a handful of developers who don&#39;t want to socialize, collaborate, or solve problems together.The truth is that people - regardless of discipline - generally all want the same things from their work: to work on something meaningful, to be productive, and to be recognized for that work (both output and input).That&#39;s pretty much it. If - as a leader - you can do those, you&#39;re going to generally have rather happy employees.When it comes to this article, the issue is that there are a lot of people who believe that documentation and effective communication ARE necessary, but that work ISN&#39;T recognized, and (because it isn&#39;t recognized) steals time that could be spent being productive doing something that is.If you want effective communication, documentation, etc. at your workplace, it&#39;s incumbent on leadership to create that culture. Nurture it, get better at it themselves, and help those less eloquent to find their [written] voice."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who went from engineering to product management, partly due to having developed a skill of communicating effectively in writing and in speech, I would suggest perhaps the most important part of communicating effectively is storytelling.  If what you are sharing does not have a clear and obvious narrative arc, people are going to disengage quickly.  This is not necessary for short bursts of information in a high-context environment, but any time you need to level set and share context before communicating the critical information, you should do so in story fashion.If you want to level up your technical communication, I&#39;d highly recommend taking classes in creative writing, participating in things like NaNoWriMo, or taking a class in improv comedy/theater.  All of these things emphasize construction of narrative arcs and how to draw people through a story, which are essential communication skills. This gets more important the farther up the chain of command in a company you are communicating with."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; … support persistent client-side storage using available JS APIs. As of this writing, that includes the Origin-Private FileSystem (OPFS) [0]This is really good news, and exactly what the OPFS was designed for.You may have seen “Absurd SQL” [1] which was a proof of concept for building a SQLite Virtual FS backend using IndexedDB. It provided full ACID compliment transactions. Incredible work but a hack at best.The OPFS supersedes all that and makes it possible to have proper consistent and resilient transactions.WASM SQLite with the OPFS is the future of offline first web app development. The concept of a single codebase web/mobile/desktop app with proper offline storage is here.What I really want to see next is an eventually constant sync system between browser and server (or truly distributed with WebRTC). The SQLite Session Extension [2] potentially has the building blocks needed for such a system.0: https://webkit.org/blog/12257/the-file-system-access-api-wit...1: https://github.com/jlongster/absurd-sql2: https://www.sqlite.org/sessionintro.html"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is not about the colors, FYI. This is about someone referencing a specific Pantone product as a spot color. And the automatic conversion from that spot color name to the regular RGB / CMYK color values is now gone. But if you embedded the actual RGB/CMYK values into your file, then it&#39;ll still open just fine and display those colors just fine.Edit: Also, converting from Pantone to regular RGB/CMYK is a lot more lossy than one would think. If I reference a Pantone product, that pretty much covers all properties of the printed surface, including things like reflectivity angles, fluorescence and phosphorescence. A cheap xRite will already measure reflectivity in 13 wavelength bands. And then it&#39;ll average those 13 characteristics into 3 RGB numbers. Professional color measurement tools can have hundreds of properties per ink type, thereby making reduction to 3 values even more lossy.If I give you RGB, that merely specifies the color at direct reflection under normal light. If I give you a Pantone ID, you also now how it&#39;ll look from the side or under UV light. RGB specifies an averaged wavelength mixture, Pantone specifies a chemical ink mixture.Edit2: You know these car paints that have fresnel reflections, meaning they appear to have a different color of you look at them from a different angle? That&#39;s an excellent example of a case where you need to specify a specific ink type like Pantone, because the RGB value changes based on the viewing angle."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The comments here seem to be mostly litigating whether Pantone ought to be allowed to license colour names. To me though, the scandalous thing about this is that a piece of software which you paid for can work fine one day can stop functioning the same way the next because of a change in the vendor&#39;s license agreements. Like imagine if you bought a song which uses samples and one day the backing track just disappears because the artist didn&#39;t renew the sample clearance."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you are in the USA, then what you received are unsolicited marketing phone calls under the TCPA, a law which allows you to personally collect up to $1500 per violation of the law or associated regulations, per phone call that you received. If your personal phone is on the federal &#34;Do Not Call&#34; registry, it&#39;s possible that there are at least two violations of the law per phone call you received.I would suggest sending a demand letter to Meta&#39;s legal department offering to settle for somewhat less than $1500 per violation. Here&#39;s an example: https://www.junkfax.org/w/images/0/0b/SampleDemandLetter.pdfIf they ignore you, be prepared to file a local case in small claims court (which you can do yourself without an attorney). The court can force them to pay you if you present evidence of the calls and the law(s) or regulations that were broken.Disclaimer: I am not a laywer and this is not legal advice, but I have collected money from TCPA legal settlements in the past, each without needing to go to court."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just to be clear...You&#39;re absolutely sure, 100%, this is Meta employees themselves calling you? And Meta sending you e-mails?Not spammers, of which there are many, and they get your contact info from all sorts of places? And which often lead you to believe they&#39;re Meta when they&#39;re really just scamming you or trying to sell ad placement consulting/optimization services?Because with &#34;multiple&#34; calls and emails... this sounds like 3rd-party spammers, not something Meta does. And while Meta has been loose in the past with walling off information internally (to put it mildly...), it&#39;s not like they sell your contact info to spammers or anything (simply because it&#39;s not worth the effort, the money&#39;s way too small for a company of their size). Third-party spammers, on the other hand, will get your personal info from anywhere and everywhere.For you to make a credible claim that Meta is using your 2FA contact info for marketing, you&#39;ve really got to be sure that it&#39;s 1) actually Meta contacting you and 2) that they got your phone number specifically from 2FA and not just from looking it up publicly the way salespeople do."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a feeling that Meta has some kind of internal system for slurping up everyone&#39;s contact info, and that some kind of bugs/criteria occasionally cross some streams.Meta recruiting somehow got a hold of my name@amazon.com employer email -- which I have never posted publicly -- and started sending me recruitment emails to my work email. This struck me as incredibly unprofessional, though I understand it&#39;s almost certainly an automated system doing it.I still don&#39;t know how they got the email address (though I guess it&#39;s just lastname+first initial, so they could have guessed?). I may have DM&#39;d it to someone in a FB messenger chat? Maybe I used it in an &#34;work email&#34; field during sign up for some industry conference whose data later got hacked? A colleague accidentally merged their work/personal contact list and uploaded it somewhere? Who knows."</p>

Not just release the hounds.Keep the advertisers happy, but try to reduce the reliance on advertisers.  Keep moderating content to reduce abuse, maybe eliminate the high profile banning but a person on the ground will have largely the same experience. (probably less action on more contentious issues, but you still can&#39;t use racial epithets and call for violence).  Evaluate most employees or teams on the merits, there will be layoffs, probably big layoffs but they&#39;ll be managed incremental and strategic.  Build more products and pivot the product strongly but again, not in the image of a Parler or a Truth Social.
Twitter won&#39;t become a cesspool because he understands that people need to be able to control what they see or they&#39;ll leave.  Essentially try to create more safe spaces on twitter, not less."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I got a 7 day ban for a tweet that included “political suicide pact” as an idiom.I then got permanently banned for including the line, “sending their children to die in Ukraine” in a tweet.The “appeal” button causes me to get a denied email within one minute. This tells me no humans are in the loop on any of this.I don’t think these tweets were controversial or require any diversity of viewpoints. They just require appreciation that you cannot automatically moderate anything accurately unless you are prepared to be very very VERY relaxed about the rules.I’m not sure Elon is even interested in fixing this kind of problem. He seems focused on the politics and “cancel culture” type issues (whether they’re real or imagined)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Potentially of intellectual interest: Some people here might be wondering about speech that is &#34;harmful,&#34; with the famous quote about &#34;you can&#39;t yell fire in a crowded theater.&#34; That quote from the Supreme Court is commonly used to justify why there need to be restraints on free speech.This is actually a popular misconception. The decision where &#34;you can&#39;t yell fire in a crowded theater&#34; was from was actually overturned in almost entirety in Brandenburg v. Ohio in 1969. And even then, it was only an analogy, and never actually was the law. You actually, theoretically, CAN yell fire in a crowded theater. Websites on both sides of the isle have admitted it is a terrible analogy for defending censoring certain content for being potentially harmful. It is, quite literally, a legal myth. A legal myth that still affects our Congress today while they examine how to prevent the spread of misinformation [1].https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/why-falsely-claiming-its-ill...https://reason.com/2022/10/27/yes-you-can-yell-fire-in-a-cro...https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/11/its-tim...https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/01/shouting-f...https://www.whalenlawoffice.com/legal-mythbusting-series-yel...https://www.thefire.org/you-can-shout-fire-in-a-burning-thea...[1] For an example (out of many) of why regulating misinformation is legally almost impossible, see United States vs Alvarez, which ruled that the Stolen Valor Act of 2005 (which criminalized faking having a military honor) is legally protected speech and the act was a violation of the constitution. Since then it has been extended with a new 2013 act which requires intent to gain something by fraud, which hasn&#39;t been struck down (yet)."</p>

After 3-6 seconds, the timestamps pop in. I don&#39;t know if this is intentionally or a result of lazy-loading - but seeing that the video thumb, title, author, view count, and age all load instantly with the page, I struggle to come up with a reason it could be unintentional.This bothers me because I like to know how long a video is before I commit the time to sitting down and watching it.

I think the techniques i list in the post combined with agg[2] or gifcast[3] to covert it to a gif would be a better solution for non-trivial cases.I&#39;ll add notes about agg and gifcast to the post this evening hopefully.[1]: https://weblog.masukomi.org/2022/10/11/recording_and_sharing...[2]: https://github.com/asciinema/agg[3]: https://github.com/dstein64/gifcast"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This looks super useful. Tempted to go and add CI-maintained gifs to a whole bunch of existing projects now.Some ideas for new features:* If the prefix of the tape file is unchanged, reuse the intermediate updates through that prefix from a cache (edit: hmm, upon further thought this seems more difficult than I initially imagined, since the state would need to be cached to save time, not just the images)* Allow an option for using real-time delays in the gif or user-selected delays (I think currently delays are constant unless user-selected, but I don&#39;t see a way to use the real runtime delay in the gif)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Egyptology is so fascinating. When I was in primary school, the teacher did a really special lesson I&#39;ll never forget. The classroom was decorated like a tomb - the windows were blacked out and the tables were arranged in a way that we had to crawl in to start the lesson. We went through puzzles and explored pyramids on the projector. When some pupils were distracted by the table tunnel, the teacher stayed in the character of an archeologist and warned them to keep away for the tunnel may collapse at any moment. Now that&#39;s teaching."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hands down, shell scripting is one of my all time favorite languages. It gets tons of hate, e.g. &#34;If you have to write more than 10 lines, then use a real language,&#34; but I feel like those assertions are more socially-founded opinions than technically-backed arguments.My basic thesis is that Shell as a programming language---with it&#39;s dynamic scope, focus on line-oriented text, and pipelines---is simply a different programming paradigm than languages like Perl, Python, whatever.Obviously, if your mental model is BASIC and you try to write Python, then you encounter lots of friction and it&#39;s easy for the latter to feel hacky, bad and ugly. To enjoy and program Python well, it&#39;s probably best to shift your mental model. The same goes for Shell.What is the Shell paradigm? I would argue that it&#39;s line-oriented pipelines. There is a ton to unpack in that, but a huge example where I see friction is overuse of variables in scripts. Trying to stuff data inside variables, with shell&#39;s paucity of data types is a recipe for irritation. However, if you instead organize all your data in a format that&#39;s sympathetic to line-oriented processing on stdin-stdout, then shell will work with you instead of against./2cents"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Use bash. Using zsh or fish or any other, will make it hard for others to understand / collaborate. Among all shells, bash strikes a good balance between portability and DX.I think fish is quite a bit different in terms of syntax and semantics (I&#39;m not very familiar with it), but zsh is essentially the same as bash except without most of the needless footguns and awkwardness. zsh also has many more advanced features, which you don&#39;t need to use (and many people are unaware of them anyway), but will very quickly become useful; in bash all sorts of things require obscure incantations and/or shell pipelines that almost make APL seem obvious in comparison.In my experience few people understand bash (or POSIX sh) in the first place, partly because everything is so difficult and full of caveats. Half my professional shell scripting experience on the job is fixing other people&#39;s scripts. So might as well use something that doesn&#39;t accidentally introduce bugs every other line.Most – though obviously far from all – scripts tend to be run in environments you control; portability is often overrated and not all that important (except when it is of course). Once upon a time I insisted on POSIX sh, and then I realised that actually, &gt;90% of the scripts I wrote were run just by me or run only in an environment otherwise under my control, and that it made no sense. I still use POSIX sh for some public things I write, when it makes sense, but that&#39;s fairly rare.I think bash is really standing in the way of progress, whether that progress is in the form of fish, zsh, oil shell, or something else, because so many people conflate &#34;shell&#34; with &#34;bash&#34;, similar to how people conflate &#34;Google&#34; with &#34;search&#34; or &#34;git&#34; with &#34;GitHub&#34; (to some degree)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Use the .sh (or .bash) extension for your file. It may be fancy to not have an extension for your script, but unless your case explicitly depends on it, you’re probably just trying to do clever stuff. Clever stuff are hard to understand.I don&#39;t agree with this one. When I name my script without extension (btw, .sh is fine, .bash is ugly) I want my script to look just like any other command: as a user I do not care what the language program is written in, I care about its output and what it does.When I develop a script, I get the correct syntax highlight becuase of the shebang so the extension doesn&#39;t matter.The rest of the post is great."</p>

Hundreds of millions of Indians probably use it and if the company were to suspend service because the Indian government mandated a backdoor all hell would break loose!For the same reason both Australia and the UK haven&#39;t as of yet forced WhatsApp to install a backdoor, even though legislation forcing them to do so is already in place there."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is my article from 2017.Here&#39;s a short update on what happened since then:1. DMCA takedowns did not destroy ad blocking (thank god), but there were a couple more times when it was tried, nothing huge though.2. Streisand effect is a thing and the domain in question was blocked by everyone and everywhere. There was even a special filter list and later a browser extension which only purpose was to block such domains. It got some traction but later got abandoned: https://github.com/paulgb/BarbBlock. If something like that happens again I am pretty sure it can be revived very quickly.3. The corporations still try different angles to prohibit ad blocking. The last example I know about is something like this: Axel Springer claimed that the web page and all its content (including subrequest) and ads is subject to copyright law. So when you modify the web page with adding new styles or blocking a web request you violate the copyright."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While the article is from 2017, the relevance is high today.Large adtech companies are coalescing and supporting a single browser framework that gives them a modicum of control around how adblockers are integrated into the extensions, while also funding directly or indirectly realistic browser competition through Firefox (sorry Brave and Vivaldi... still a ways to go market share-wise). The economist in me thinks there is formal and informal coordination to make this ad &#34;market&#34; exist (no one wants ads, really, they want search engines with relevant results) and there is exercise in market power to the detriment of businesses purchasing advertising (and waste to society writ large)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ad blocking is by definition attacking ads and all the companies and interests that revolve around that.So ad blocking is and always will be &#34;under attack&#34;, that was always expected, &#34;small&#34; players, like individual news sites for example have been fighting ad blocking for years, now big players are feeling the heat too and since ad blocking is an &#34;existential threat&#34; ( Meta just learned that ), they no longer ignore it or &#34;kinda deal with it&#34;.It always has been a war. And like every war, there are endless philosophical theories and discussions about the &#34;sustainability&#34; of the Web &#34;without ads&#34;, the  tracking, etc.But the reality is: It always has been a war."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is neither shocking, nor new.A decade ago I remember a friend who had a small business selling some niche collectors items. One day, he was scammed. The guy reported that the package was never delivered and, without even investigating, Paypal banned my friend&#39;s account and awarded the buyer their money back.Paypal has always, and will always be a shit company. Charging people $2,500 for wrongthink is simply asinine. They must be betting BIG on either woke politics being mainstream for the long term, unbreakable bonds with their existing customers, or both. I can&#39;t even think of someone around me that uses paypal regularly.I will be interested in reading the technical report on how they plan on implementing this because I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be silicon valley diarrhea. I am currently working out how to pay companies in a similar fashion to Paypal. I&#39;m looking at Privacy.com but something is off about it to me for some reason. Once that is solved I&#39;ll get this ape off my back forever.I wonder what happens if I just say &#34;lol, not paying&#34; to them. Would they put me in collections? It seems infeasible to even enforce this and it strikes me that clicking a button doesn&#39;t amount of a legal agreement."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"How exactly do conditions like this work in practice?I can go ahead and write a ToS or even a contract that says &#34;if you don&#39;t give me a blue M&amp;M on Saturday 29 October 2022, you owe me $1M&#34;. I can get a client to sign it, perhaps it&#39;s part of my conditions as a freelancer.I can&#39;t realistically see any court enforcing that.As far as I can tell PayPal can only get away with this nonsense because they hold your money anyway. It&#39;s exactly the sort of reason people are fighting against cashless/custodial financial systems."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, great news! Now everyone who says anything racist will have to put $2500 into the swear jar. I expect racism will disappear overnight, and we will have a plushappy society with institutionalized love for all. Thanks PayPal!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Something similar happened to my dad (USAF fighter pilot) in around 1961 or 62: He was test-flying a T-33 single-engine jet trainer assigned to his unit after it&#39;d had repair work. The engine quit and wouldn&#39;t restart. He ejected, but his parachute didn&#39;t deploy fully (much the same as in the article) and he got tangled in the shrouds. He said a quick Hail Mary just before crashing head-first in a muddy, fresh-plowed field. The pilot of another plane in the area saw the crash and radioed the tower to send the meat wagon and not the ambulance, but my dad walked away with just a headache — and with his helmet split open like a melon. The impact apparently damaged his inner ear: five years later he started getting vertigo while aloft, and soon afterwards got medically grounded. (That meant he lost the extra flight pay and was reduced to his base pay, with four school-aged kids while stationed in the Washington DC area — to make ends meet, my mother had to go back to work as an RN [registered nurse].)EDIT: What I remember was that when my dad crashed (see above), my mom came to get me from playing with the neighbor kids in their yard. Dad had called her from the flight surgeon&#39;s office and told her about the crash (very nonchalantly, she later said), and that he was OK. So six-year-old me blithely went on playing. Of course, my mom had been living with that possibility all their married life ...."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In a story of insane luck (and unluck!), the craziest part is definitely this&#34;  He said that if I had had a spleen, it almost certainly would have ruptured when I hit the water, and I would have bled to death. Of the 25 pilots in our squadron, I am the only one without a spleen. It gives me something to think about. Maybe it does you as well.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This happened in 1963.  Planes had only been flying for 60 years at that point; it really is pretty amazing how quickly we progressed on technology during those early years.  We still fly 737s, which are descended from a design that first flew in 1967.  As well as the C130, which was part of this story.  And don&#39;t get me started on B-52s, which are even older.We have made great strides since then, of course, but it does feel like 90% of the fundamental aviation technology we have today was created just in the first few decades."</p>

As you&#39;re probably finding now, you will hit AWS limits quickly.You might instead want to have a smaller pool of (larger) servers that you run co-resident VMs on with https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/.

Intel-based PCs are just one instance of it (and perhaps not even the most egregious one).Most hardware has evolved to effectively run the main OS under a sandbox where it &#34;thinks&#34; it is in control, but isn&#39;t.A nice talk on this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36myc8wQhLo"</p>

They make it sound plausible, and I think &#34;why isn&#39;t this talked about or investigated more?&#34; The section of the Wikipedia page that discusses the &#34;backdoor&#34; claim is frustratingly thin.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As others have noted, they still have an education focused robotics set, it’s just not called Mindstorms:
https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/lego-education-spike-prim...As a now-successful robotics engineer, I was the target age when the first Lego mindstorms set came out. Due to the cost it had to be a combined birthday and Christmas present (still obviously very privileged). The simple scratch-like programming system that kit used was great for me as a tween learning robotics.Today I am designing an open source farming robot as a non profit project! (See my profile)The early history of Lego Mindstorms is interesting. I didn’t realize Seymour Papert was involved but that makes a lot of sense! Especially with the name Mindstorms:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Mindstormshttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindstorms_(book)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I got the original Lego Mindstorms 1.0 kit for my 8th birthday - there was no programming interface, just a way to select one of 256 possible sequences of high-level actions the robot would perform in a loop. I paid for my first car by working at summer camps that taught kids how to use the Mindstorms 2.0 and NXT, and built my first 3D printer with Lejos (https://lejos.sourceforge.io/), Lego Technic parts and a tiny spindle router that could sculpt shapes into floral foam.While I&#39;m saddened by this news for nostalgic reasons, I personally believe that today&#39;s young learners are better served by the proliferation of hobby robotics platforms like Arduino/Raspberry Pi. Every summer camp I worked at would claim that Lego robotics teaches real-world engineering skills, while in reality the students were just happy to stay within the comfort zone of playing with Legos and using a block-based programming environment (one that has quite frankly gone from bad to worse to absolutely horrible with each product cycle). Also, FIRST Lego League does nothing meaningful to prepare students for FIRST - when I donated supplies and a few weeks of mentorship to my former high school&#39;s FIRST team, I was dismayed to see how much dead weight the team was carrying in students who participated in the middle school Lego league, who did not have even the basic coding/engineering skills to make any contribution to the high school team other than paying the membership dues."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sad to see this as someone who enjoyed these as a kid and entering robotics competitions based off of them; hopefully the new products will keep the spirit alive.There was even some decent FOSS tooling that developed on top of Mindstorms: I used NXC (Not eXactly C, https://bricxcc.sourceforge.net/nbc/welcome.html) which was a C-like language  for programming Lego Mindstorms. It looks like the last release of NXC was in 2011."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When people say they want career progression, and opportunities, what they mostly mean is they want more money. Unfortunately, most companies have fallen into the trap where if someone has a title of X they can only make up to Y, regardless of how good they are at their job or how long they&#39;ve done it. When that happens then the name of the game is getting a promotion in order to keep making more money. That creates a perverse incentive, and the result is political bullshit that is typically misaligned with the company&#39;s interests which further drives away your high performers.End the perverse incentives. Pay your people well if they&#39;re doing a good job, regardless of how long they&#39;ve been doing the same job or what their title is. Reward seniority and loyalty. Suddenly, you&#39;ll find that employee retention goes through the roof, and you don&#39;t have to worry about hiring new people all the time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Too many times in my career have I seen an employer lose an employee, who has a ton of institutional knowledge and performs adequately or even excellently, only to replace them them with someone that ends up costing much more money, and then takes a lot of time to get up to speed (which also slows the folks who help get them up to speed).It is like they haven&#39;t taken the time to even make a rudimentary calculation on the costs involved in keeping the employee versus replacing them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The hazard of retention is creating dependency. Dependency means, not just high bus factor, but opening yourself (the business) up to being vulnerable to another person&#39;s superior negotiation position. Then CEOs/boardmembers would have to spread their wealth rather than hoarding it all for themselves. Without a way to force CEO/boardmembers to spread their wealth (unions), I think we can expect companies to do what is in their best interest, maintaining a monopoly on power by ensuring no dependencies."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I used play soccer regularly, I&#39;d occasionally experience being &#34;in the zone&#34;. It&#39;s a blissful experience where my body is able to execute incredibly complex set of moves in perfect coordination as my mind enters a state of zen-like calm.The sensation is almost like a being spectator in my own body. My brain feels like it&#39;s been relieved of the task of managing the moment-to-moment decision. Instead I start noticing moves 3, 4 steps ahead as time slows to a crawl around me. I don&#39;t know if this type of experience is related in any way to the theory of consciousness, but it feels like the unconscious mind holds a lot of secrets that I&#39;d love to see unlocked in my lifetime."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a rumored experiment called the &#34;precognitive carousel&#34;, supposedly run by Grey Walter, where:(1) Subjects are told to push a button to advance a slide projector carousel, but not told that the button is inert(2) The carousel advances based on electrical signals measured by wires on the subjects&#39; scalp.(3) Subjects supposedly report the uncanny feeling that the projector advances &#34;just before&#34; they were about to push the button -- 300-400 milliseconds before, a pretty long time.I read about this a long time ago in a since-deleted post on an old timey internet forum (everything2).The writer suggested this research supports the idea that your body chooses what to do, then informs your brain, and your consciousness convinces itself that has decided to do what the body is about to do on its own."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I realize that the link between consciousness and quantum effects are far from proven but if you will entertain the idea that they are...Delayed-choice experiments demonstrate the seeming ability of measurements in the present to alter events occurring in the past. eg. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed-choice_quantum_eraserNow I&#39;ll throw out another completely unprovable thought...Perhaps consciousness has the ability to affect how wavefunction collapse occurs, perhaps it even has the ability to influence the observed outcome.I&#39;m not going to try to prove these two ideas but together they can help form an idea that perhaps observations on the past actually influence the past and perhaps despite this &#39;observation after the fact&#39; there&#39;s still free will.It&#39;s not provable but then neither is the &#34;there&#39;s no such thing as free will&#34; arguments that this sort of research leads to. The point of the above is to highlight that there&#39;s still a way out for free will."</p>

You are not fucking suppose to verify or reference check on me before I even had my interview or offer. So now my boss / management knows I am job hunting?5. By the time I get to the end of the application I am already exhausted depending how bad the day I had. And some form of PTSD from previous interview where i had to contain my thermonuclear anger or else going absolute animal against the HR / agent / interviewer. Because I have to be professional.6. My thought on why all these are so bad is because job application, listing site, social network ( LinkedIn ) all work for hiring companies, they are the ones who pay them. And not job seekers. Someone needs to figure out a way where we can turn this around and empower ( I hate this word, but I dont have anything better in my vocab ) employees."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I m one of these, i fill out the form, then i get the memories i had interacting with some of these companies, working at other companies. The Process-Dementia, the hostilitys, the relentless culture of using all things in human interaction as renegotiation ammonition. The relentless pressure, ignoring all social norms and employee health, to complete a task. The shallow friendliness, that ended as soon as your usefullness expired. The internal fights, silos and slightly drunk employees, who hated it there, but couldnt say it, cause big Brother Middle Management is everywhere.Its considered the &#34;good jobs&#34; in my area, as in well paid enough to own a house, but every time im tempted to apply and see the logos, and the memories come back, i abort these applications.Some companies are cesspools and its good to remember that and stay away from them. I also warn others to stay away from them. Some people hack these companies and get the easy life there, which is nice, but for people who actually want to work and not interact with such a culture.. not even as customers, if it can be avoided."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Recently I wanted to apply to a company. First they had you read some weird document telling you how they can’t pay high salaries, so you should be modest with your expectations.Then further down the form they require you to record a video introducing yourself and telling them why they should hire you.Ended up closing the form right there.Do these people not realize how annoying their process is and how talented people don’t have to put up with crap like this?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I first entered the working world as a programmer and administrator of an &#34;academic computing center&#34;, in the early 70s, you met men like Ray - ex-military, GI-bill educated, learned computers from the electricity on up in their mid-career, rather frequently, either as customer engineers for one of the big mainframe manufacturers (there were 7 or 8, depending on when and how you counted), or from the minicomputer upstarts who were then assaulting the mainframe world of computing with their smaller, cheaper, 12 and 16 bit newcomers.   Sometimes you&#39;d get the privilege of a lunch or dinner with one sent out &#34;from the lab&#34; who was actually designing and building the machines you were working on.It&#39;s hard to explain just how new it all felt, then.   But in 1973, even though we were sitting on the cusp of the single chip microprocessor and personal computer revolution, the commercial computer was less than 20 years old, and college recruiting materials might well brag that at their institution, there were not one, but two computers on campus.  I remember the day the total RAM at our institution passed the megabyte mark - closer to the end, than the beginning, of the 1970s.  The ability to &#34;program&#34; was a rare skill - even the people  who taught it were still just learning it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If the minimalist resume is appealing, can we also bring back walk-on hiring?In warehouse and construction work, if someone shows up at 7:30 AM on a Monday morning, odds are quite good that the foreman will have something for them to do. Maybe not that day, but maybe tomorrow, or maybe someone on the list above them won&#39;t show up that week and they&#39;ll get called. I made rent doing that in my early 20s and they even let me leave early sometimes to work on my internet business because I didn&#39;t have a family to support and maybe someone else had a bill they needed to pay and wanted my shift.Why again does boutique startup need to interview 500 overqualified people? Hire someone right away and let them quit if they want to and hire someone else. It&#39;s just business for crying out loud."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve had more ideas come to me after hiding in my office to take a nap than sitting at my desk. It got to be such a gold mine of solutions that I still to this day allocate 30 minutes of my day to a nap. Non-negotiable. So many hard problems that have been brought to me, or complicated needs for architecture, etc were solved by simply turning my active brain off. When I was in graduate school I&#39;d regularly get stuck on some stupid thing I didn&#39;t understand and slamming my head against the paper/book/whatever didn&#39;t help. Again, a quick nap and I was good (or at least better than I was).Performative work is a disaster. I worked in a stuffy IT office of a company before I got my degree and became a software engineer. It took YEARS to deprogram performative work. I still hide when I take a nap. I suspect that if my current company found out I was sleeping on the job they&#39;d still be upset with me. However, my output is so good the results speak for themselves. It would be difficult to fire me for napping."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Software development is creative work. Creative insight can come anywhere, any time. Better ideas can make difficult things easy. And make the impossible– possible.So the most important thing on a software team (or really any team creating high technology products or services) is an environment where team members feel safe to be themselves– psychologically safe, where they can try out new things, make mistakes, fail, and not be punished or belittled. Say their ideas and have them improved by others, not criticized. It&#39;s an environment where team members take care of themselves so they can be creative– sleep enough, exercise enough, be with friends and family enough, play enough.You have to be at your keyboard or lab bench or whatever enough to make things. But if you are there too much your creativity plummets. This is what I try to get across to my teams."</p>

The trend started in 3.10, and it already made a difference for me, my coworkers and students.But remember that while it&#39;s great to play with it freshly out of the oven, and that you might want to test your projects/libs with it, we should wait a bit before migrating production.Indeed, every first release of a new major version of Python eventually important bugs that get ironed out in a later patch. Also, some libs on pypi may simply not be compatible with it yet, breaking your pip install.I usually wait until the 3rd patch myself, after many years of paying the price of greedy upgrades."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"These bundlers do not do the same work as webpack. Turbopack is using swc for typescript which means it will not do typechecking during compilation which effectively makes it fairly useless as a compiler. Now, if you only want bundling and minification then sure but why would anyone want only bundling? Good luck having a sensible workflow when your type checking has to run separately and perfectly match whatever typescript version is hidden inside your bundler, good luck dealing with constant mismatches when there are errors on either side.EDIT: The responses pointed out that the author is the maintainer of webpack, I removed that part of the comment calling it deceptive. Maybe the entire intent is to deprecate webpack. I still think that it should be renamed to &#34;Turbopack: our webpack successor&#34; because calling it &#39;the&#39; successor is a bit presumptuous and the article doesn&#39;t even directly say that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s unfortunate that some of what made MacOS great for developers is now being phased out in favor of features that are lifted out of iOS. Apple has made developer-hostile moves over the years that seem out of line with it&#39;s old &#39;think different&#39; ethos. I hope Apple takes this customer segment seriously and reverses course here, but I&#39;m not super hopeful.The real problem is that there isn&#39;t a reasonable alternative. Windows is out of the question for me due to not being a POSIX-based OS. WSL isn&#39;t integrated deeply enough and is still a pain in the ass to use coming from MacOS. I experimented with using a mostly stock Xubuntu setup for a bit and also found the user experience to be really subpar. Call me old, but I have no interest in dealing with the amount of configuration and tweaking necessary to be productive in a Linux environment.Ultimately, I&#39;m just going to stick it out with MacOS."</p>

Let me explain why.This is how I understand all these posts. It’s fine not to like something. You don’t even need a good reason. That is what taste is all about. Just don’t pretend that your emotional response is grounded in objective and universal fact.Am I being facetious? Not really.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s so interesting, these waves of CSS improvements.Before the flexbox/grid arrival, there were years of near-zero progress.The flexbox/grid release, uniquely coordinated across browsers (for once), was an excellent milestone, but not really a movement.These last 2 years though feel almost like a revolution in comparison to CSS&#39;s history. Somebody is pushing very hard.These are some very serious improvements that address core needs and gaps. In particular scaling CSS in large applications, with things like @layers, @scope and container queries.The second goal seems to be to make CSS preprocessors obsolete.Compliments to whoever is working on this. My favorite upcoming one has to be toggle, controversial or not, the idea that for simple interactions you don&#39;t even require JS anymore is a good development.The luxury problem this creates is the slow adoption rate. Something extraordinarily powerful as grid is still barely used. Old habits die hard."</p>

Breakpoints will probably still be used for larger-picture layout, but container queries will help with the smaller parts especially in UI that have many moving dynamic parts.The rest are just icing and honestly I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it takes a while for many of them to become mainstream."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Great work!!!&#34;SQLite is extensively tested with 100% branch test coverage. We discovered this vulnerability despite the tests, which raises the question: how did the tests miss it?&#34;Tests only validate known behavior. They didn&#39;t have a test that exercised a large string. I don&#39;t know how their test suite works but I&#39;m curious if quickcheck might have possibly found this or if the 32-bit viewpoint of the programmer at the time would have also limited possible generated values?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;This bug is an array-bounds overflow. The bug is only accessible when using some of the C-language APIs provided by SQLite. The bug cannot be reached using SQL nor can it be reached by providing SQLite with a corrupt database file. The bug only comes up when very long string inputs (greater than 2 billion bytes in length) are provided as arguments to a few specific C-language interfaces, and even then only under special circumstances.&#34;Source: https://www.sqlite.org/cves.html#status_of_recent_sqlite_cve..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The root of this problem seems to be the widespread availability of 64-bit CPUs.≥ When this code was first written, most processors had 32-bit registers and 4GB of addressable memory, so allocating 1GB strings as input was impractical. Now that 64-bit processors are quite common, allocating such large strings is feasible and the vulnerable conditions are reachable.One has to wonder how much code written in the past 30 years has safety checks assuming 32-bit processors which now have vulnerabilities like this one. I&#39;d bet quite a lot."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a confusing headline. The judgement here is in NY state court, and pertains to employees of and in the City of New York, which enacted a vaccine requirement for employees of the city and later private employers in the city. Months later, Eric Adams was elected mayor of NYC, and he issued an executive order exempting athletes, performers, and artists from the mandate.Petitioners sued, saying that the mandate with the exemptions was essentially arbitrary, and the courts agreed. So what happened here is that Eric Adams sabotaged NYC&#39;s vaccine mandate."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Because it&#39;s confusing: the NY Supreme Court is just a trial court, it&#39;s not at all like the US Supreme Court. The top appellate court is called the Court of Appeals. It&#39;s called &#34;supreme&#34; because it has general jurisdiction, as opposed to things like traffic court."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Something I&#39;ve been wondering in recent cases where courts are overturning recent government action, whether unconstitutional bills passed into law, or unconstitutional executive actions that overstep authority, is where&#39;s the penalty for committing those actions in the first place?The state of New York famously responded to the outcome of NYSRPA v. Bruen, which overturned the defacto ban on concealed carry, by declaring nearly all public spaces &#34;sensitive areas&#34; in which licensed individuals may not carry for their protection. Regardless of one&#39;s opinion of said rights, how do courts blatantly ignore rulings and orders from higher courts with no repercussions?How do courts declare certain executive orders unconstitutional, and yet the perpetrators, who took an oath to uphold and defend said rights and values, face no consequences?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I came on board with the NeXT acquisition (or rather reverse acquisition as ex-NeXT often refer to)…So I do recall seeing a few times after we relocated to Infinite Loop, that Steve at first was just working as a consultant, and not as an employee. Thus at the time he didn’t have a badge to enter in IL1 (Infinite Loop 1: hold Apple HQ); many times when he was coming in the morning, he had to wait at the glass door to enter the campus, until some kind soul was letting him in (despite the policy only badged employees could enter or visitors with a printed tag). I saw it happening more than once while grabbing a coffee at the coffee booth in the IL1 building.Later on, after he came back officially as CEO (or iCEO), I remember clearly during a lunch with co-workers (at Café Mac, seating outside) watching at a distance Steve &amp; Jony walking inside the campus, then seating at a bench and Jony opening some carrying case/luggage, and let Steve pull the content out of it, so he could look at it in the sun: it looked like a piece of plastic… at the time, we had no clue what it was, except the color was orange. 
Many months later, Steve introduced the first iBook (which was the first Mac with Wifi): when I saw the orange color of the iBook I made the connection with what we saw back that day; Jony was most likely showing to Steve the first shell of the future iBook.Steve otherwise at work was truly laser focus at a time on different projects: I was working on backend web services development with public facing web site, so usually every 2 weeks our boss was presenting to Steve our progress (every week or even more while closer to ship): our boss usually was always coming back with clear feedback on what was good or terrible, which we obviously had to improve for the next presentation… stressful yes, but truly enjoyable.
More than once, Steve did cut some projects that were close to finish and you just had to go along since no one had a say in it, except Steve.Obviously I have a few more stories of that sort, since I spent close to 20 years at Apple (/NeXT).It was quite something to get the hard work you did for months presented on stage by Steve… I still miss the excitement from it even if it is more than 15 years ago.Edit: fixing a few typos"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was there in 1999 as OS X was being developed, and the beta was just about to be released. I was building another product that was released at MacWorld in 2000 (and still exists today)!I have a lot of funny stories.  Steve didn&#39;t like our data center rack mounts being silver, we had to pull them all out and spray paint them black, because silver just wasn&#39;t acceptable, in a datacenter. That was my first day at work. And no, I&#39;m not a datacenter employee, everyone on the team did everything, there were just very few of us.We had to work from about 10am to about 3 or 4 am every day to make the deadline, we sometimes got Sundays off. There was a lot of rage and anger at many management levels.Steve would get a question about a two button mouse at every company meeting, he was super pissed every time about the question. We enjoyed trolling him.Steve&#39;s attention to detail was unbelievable. I once witnessed him make a team work overnight just to move an icon 10 pixels to the left.The guy had a vision that seems unparalleled. He was able to figure out the concept of &#34;cloud&#34; well before its time, and make a shift towards that.Of course, he was an supernatural presenter. I witnessed him present through some really messed up errors in live demos and no one I asked in the audience afterwards even noticed the errors.It was an insane work environment, never seen anything like it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m really thankful I had a chance to work at 1 Infinite Loop during that time. I worked with other Developer Relations folks in IL3, with near-daily trips to IL2 to either meet with folks on the QuickTime team or just hang out. Occasionally I&#39;d get early glimpses at things like QTi and HyperCard 3.I vividly recall the day Steve introduced the iMac in the Infinite Loop quad. If I had to pick a day that telegraphed Apple&#39;s future fortunes, it would be that day. Rhapsody&#39;s potential was compelling, but as Macintosh OS it was still pretty Crapsody at the time. The iMac was a Real Thing — as friendly as computers get, that only Apple could&#39;ve created and sold."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My late father, who was a software developer by trade before his retirement, had a desktop machine set up running Windows 7 (probably?) that he used for checking email, and buying stuff online.A few years later, when he had been diagnosed with cancer and was on chemo, it updated itself to Windows 10 without his explicit consent. It completely fucked up the install, and was unusable for him from then on. He was too tired to go through the process of getting it sorted out, and was thus unable to book a vacation that he had intended to take to recover from that round of chemo.Microsoft&#39;s unfriendly us-first, customers-second process robbed him of his last holiday and I will not easily forgive them for it.If a seasoned developer can be robbed of quality of life by this flavour of bullshit, what chance do the non-technical types stand?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t get it. For a few more bucks they instantly get their brand connonated with slowness and being unreliable.How do manufacturers throw in all the crapware and expect a good user experience and happy customers? Oh of course, they don&#39;t care.I&#39;ve moved to Mac but back in days I used Windows, the VERY FIRST thing I did was to install a fresh copy of Windows, then install any necessary drivers which are absolutely required for proper function (I remember just finding the driver files and installing them manually from add hardware dialog instead of installing bloatware of the manufacturer).Wish things have changed in 10 years... apparently it didn&#39;t.And of course I&#39;m tech savvy. I don&#39;t see any less-savvy senior being able to solve this problem; it should be regulated in a way that there should be a mandatory and ugly label showing all the crapware included with the device while buying, perhaps even extra taxing for each crapware included, discouraging manufacturers from including them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These days I simply can&#39;t recommend anyone (especially nontechnical people) buy a computing device that isn&#39;t either:- An Apple device- First-party (Microsoft Surface, Pixel phone, etc)- Running Linux (assuming they can deal with everything else that comes with that)Even these aren&#39;t perfect, but everything else I assume to be hot garbage unless you&#39;re planning to install your own OS anyway. The problem, though, is that this mostly excludes the real budget-tier devices (at least for nontechnical folks), which is unfair to those who can&#39;t afford anything elseBurn it all down"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the things that has kept me out of the cryptocurrency space is that when their advocates discuss value, they speak in pure nonsense.A big part of that problem is that value is very difficult to discuss. On the one hand you have the classic goldbug that insists that gold has &#34;intrinsic value&#34;, which is some sort of platonic ideal thing that gold simply ambiently has and defies any attempt to nail down what it grounds out in. On the other hand you have cryptocurrency advocates claiming that all value is arbitrary and/or based entirely on scarcity. In that context, observing that my kid&#39;s doodles are scarce but not valuable is not a cute tweet; it is a complete and utter demolishing of the argument.(I think one of the things education can accidentally (mis)teach is that short arguments are always worthless and arguments must always be long. This is false. A good grounding in mathematics can help with internalizing this. It is completely possible to demolish entire massive argument edifices in 10-20 of the correct words, and the fact that the &#34;other side&#34; has deployed literally hundreds of thousands of words does not make them right if the foundation is rotten.)Value is intrinsically a dynamic process. It grounds out in human desires, which are intrinsically temporal, variable, and fickle, and this makes a lot of people uncomfortable as they seek either a more solid or a more completely ethereal/arbitrary base. However, there is no other sensible way to think about value, however complex and ever-shifting this may be, and it is neither mathematically solid, nor an amorphous vapor of no consequence subject to one strong person&#39;s Nietzschian will."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This has been a concern of mine for a while; I have also published absolute garbage just to see how far I can take it. I&#39;ve published music under various pseudonyms, books underneath different pen-names... the list goes on. I&#39;ve retracted such publications, but it is frightening if one person like myself had the curiosity to try, what is already out there, and, what a well-funded nation-state actor could do.----Post-truth, like post-modernism, does not mean an absolute absence of truth, but a decline in confidence in common knowledge, making your own truth the center of your life, rather than a set of values   shared by a community.We now believe that our own truth is somehow better than the &#34;centralized&#34; or &#34;official&#34; truth. We are now free from the institutions and authorities that controlled the truth. But this is an illusion, because the very definition of truth requires trust in something other than you.[1] https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/j5gyp5/the_sear..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think there’s a good chance it was ghost written by a content farm for someone who wanted to publish a book in a popular category to make a quick buck. I recently learned that this is a soft-scam technique advocated for by a couple of guys called the Mikkelson Twins. They say you can make money by publishing audiobooks on audible by finding a popular topic on audible, then hiring a ghost writing service to write your book, then hire a voice actor to record it, publish it on audible, and then you too can become fabulously wealthy as the Mikkelson Twins claim to be. Except what the Mikkelson Twins actually make money on is selling you on a “money making course” where they tell you to do the above. So there’s all kinds of people trying to follow this method out there, it seems.This excellent video [1] from Dan Olson at Folding Ideas is in my opinion a fascinating deep dive in to this whole scam. I don’t want to spoil everything in the video, but Dan does an exceptional job exploring how this ghost writing works, and why it produces the kind of nonsense writing that looks like GPT-3 but is actually being done by an overworked human who is trying to write an entire novel in three weeks or so on a topic they haven’t had time to properly research.[1] https://youtu.be/biYciU1uiUw"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Pigs were recorded in Domesday as having woodland to support them. Note that woodlands supporting pigs was primarily comprised of oak, since the pigs fed on the acorns they dropped.Source 1: https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/domesday/discover-domesd...In the modern world, you can manage about 5 pigs per acre. You should be able to do that many pigs or more per acre in the medieval world since the animals were physically smaller for the most part. So in an 80 acre pannage woodland, expect about 400 swine.Some tree types are far more damaged by pig foraging than others since, if they don&#39;t get the yummy acorns, they tend to dig up roots, eat the saplings and do other damage. So the oak and the pig are good neighbors. The elder or the olive tree, or even the wild apple tree, all tend to suffer far more damage when used as pannage.Source 2: https://acrcd.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Pigs-and-Trees...."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reminds me of a passage in Jesse Schell&#39;s game design book. Playtesters were confused seeing flags of pirate ships blow forward, toward the front of the ship. They were told that sailing ships have the wind at their backs, so everything blows forward. However, so many playtesters were confused and made comments that they just made the flags blow back.Maybe it was the same with the pigs; people just want to see pigs squealing around town, adding to the atmosphere of the game."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"While I really like their lightweight, SQL-like protocol instead of Elasticsearch&#39;s fat JSON, I really think that this project could have much more impact if it could be a drop-in replacement for ES.Even if it offers only a fraction of the features offered by ES, that may be fair enough for at least half of the use-cases out there.Sonic could have really had a strong selling point: &#34;Use an ES-alternative that works fine in most of the real-world applications, but it&#39;s written in Rust and it only takes a fraction of the memory footprint required by ES, and it shouldn&#39;t require you to change your application code&#34;.Instead, they are proposing yet another search protocol, that developers have to learn and adopt. That definitely increases the adoption barriers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow it&#39;s weird that this comes up, I&#39;m actually running a site I am going to repost to HN today that I want to use as a testbed for search engines (kind of like an extension to my recent collaboration with supabase[0]).Right now I&#39;ve got the site going on just Postgres FTS + trigram and it&#39;s pretty darn fast, looks like I need to test sonic too.Going to burn some midnight oil (in my timezone, anyway) and get it out -- though sonic isn&#39;t implemented yet!Anyway to make this comment useful to people, here&#39;s my short list of engines that I want to run in parallel:- MeiliSearch (https://github.com/meilisearch/MeiliSearch)- TypeSense (https://github.com/typesense/typesense)- Lyra (https://github.com/LyraSearch/lyra)- OpenSearch (https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch)- ZincSearch (https://github.com/prabhatsharma/zinc)- Sonic (https://github.com/valeriansaliou/sonic)There isn&#39;t enough out there comparing all these for the simple typical fuzzy search/search box usecase, so I&#39;m adapting a little podcast search site I made to try and use all of these at the same time. So far only Postgres though, will try and add Meilisearch today and post it!Like other people are pointing out, most of these engines won&#39;t have all the features of ES (or more accurately Lucene) but I am pretty convinced that most of the time it doesn&#39;t actually matter and if someone is searching on your site excessively maybe there&#39;s a problem with your UX (unless you&#39;re a search engine or repository of information).[0]: https://supabase.com/blog/postgres-full-text-search-vs-the-r..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve written a full-text search engine as well. I don&#39;t tout it as a replacement for Elasticsearch, but it does have a few advantages: it&#39;s fast; supports HTML documents; supports Polish inflection (via a full-blown morphological dictionary, not just a stemmer); and has a very compact on-disk format (pre-parsed HTML trees, Huffman-encoded over large alphabets). Oh, and it&#39;s 100% Clojure.It underlies a concordancer GUI called Smyrna: https://github.com/nathell/smyrna, https://smyrna.danieljanus.plI haven&#39;t touched it in six years, other than a few small changes. But I do plan on revisiting it when time permits."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Here in the ultra-dense Netherlands, threats to insects are magnified. As such, it&#39;s easier to point to specific causes.Butterflies: 50% reduction in 50 years. Beetles: 75% decline since 1985. Ladybugs: 50% reduction in 20 years. Across the border in Germany: a 75% decline in flying insects since 1989.It doesn&#39;t take much of a scientist to see the trend. I&#39;ve been hiking the forests here multiple times per week for 20 years. You can clearly see how some groups are disappearing whilst others remain.There&#39;s several root causes but the primary one is a lack of native plant diversity. Since agriculture over here is done in close proximity to forests, the soil becomes acid due to the nitrogen disposition. This benefits the growth of a handful of plants at the expense of all others. In some of our forests, the soil is now so acid that snails no longer develop a case and bird eggs collapse.In this plant monoculture, insects depending on a specific host plant disappear. Outside (protected) forests, things aren&#39;t much better. Even the tiniest of strips of grass that would normally produce wildflowers, are aggressively mowed down. People&#39;s gardens are designed to be as hostile to insects as is possible.Secondary reasons are invasive species and light pollution.It&#39;s a sad state of affairs and one we should be deeply ashamed of. We&#39;re not talking about some iconic predator requiring hundreds of acres of wild forest just to survive. We&#39;re talking about insects that require little space, healthy soil, a flower, and for it to be left alone. We can&#39;t even offer that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article is  pretty characteristic of the chemical industry influence trying to muddle the waters.I&#39;ve watched recently a conference[1] by several renowned scientists. They affirm that neonicotinoids / neonics are responsible of at least 80% of the decline.They also affirm that the &#34;merchants of doubt&#34; are working their best to muddle the evidence with things like &#34;there are multiple factors&#34;, &#34;it&#39;s complicated&#34;, &#34;we need more research&#34; etc.But just like the overwhelming majority of lung cancer comes from smoking, the overwhelming factor in insects decline (and its consequences like birds decline) is PESTICIDES and neonicotinoids in particular.[1]: sorry, in French : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQT7b2ExP4

								<p class="story__comment_others">"To everyone replying “aerodynamics”, I’ve had the same car for about 9 years now and the drive along the 5 from Bay Area to LA feels like there’s fewer bugs on my windshield (granted not recorded diligently for scientific purposes but whereas before I’d need to scrub the windshield at least once halfway these days I can drive all the way and still don’t need a wash at the end)Same goes for the argument that bugs have evolved to migrate away from the roads - the 5 has been a busy thruway for a long time with lots of cars and trucks.The article is short but says scientists have clear data that populations have plummeted and the larger vehicle consumer trend + more people on the road means that there’s fewer bugs to encounter per windshield on top of that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why are plastics 3-7 allowed if they are unable to be recycled? Also it seems to me that a tax on plastic might incentivise glass and metal usage.  Plastic is only used for convenience and cheapness, let&#39;s make it less convenient and cheap than glass and metal."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Perhaps the best way to prevent pollution of the environment with plastics is to ban the export of plastics as garbage. Currently, much of the plastic pollution is due to dumping in 2nd world and 3rd world countries where rules on disposal are very lax. So, while many people are actually quite conscientious and dispose of their waste in the appropriate manner, the garbage then just gets exported and not disposed of in any way that is responsible. Stopping the export also forces the originator of the garbage to deal with their waste creation... so dual benefit.Of course, eWaste is also a sizable contributor to plastic pollution and most people don&#39;t even think about disposable of these items. They either sell them, or they toss them in the garbage... sometimes with lithium batteries still in them which is extremely hazardous."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a Linux idiot, just got sick of Windows, and took the plunge in 2016. (After some ill-fated tinkering in 1996 with Slackware, but we don&#39;t speak of that.) I started with Ubuntu and had a pretty good time for a year or two, until a dist-upgrade broke everything. Luckily /home/ was easy to restore from backup.So I was fine for another two years on Ubuntu until another dist-upgrade broke everything again. Sensing a pattern, I decided to give Pop a try.I&#39;m now about a year into Pop and sure enough, a few weeks ago a dist-upgrade broke a lot of things, but unlike Ubuntu, I was able to find System76&#39;s tech support page, I ran the commands it suggested, and everything&#39;s fine again!https://support.system76.com/articles/package-manager-ubuntu...Miraculous, I tell you.I still can&#39;t figure out why there are multiple versions of some things in the Pop Shop, but they all seem to work, so I&#39;m not complaining, it&#39;s just weird. Someday I&#39;ll figure out this whole tiling-windows thing, but I think that&#39;s for people with bigger screens so I turned it off so my alt-tab reflexes work again.In general, it just works, and that&#39;s more than I can say for Windows or Ubuntu at this point."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really like Pop Os. I&#39;ve always liked Debian descended distros, and prior to this I was using Ubuntu. While I like it, I always found a lot of rough edges esp. when it came to proprietary drivers, etc. where things didn&#39;t always work without some tweaking. Pop Os on the other hand seems to &#34;just work&#34; - it is like a polished version of Ubuntu with a nice selection of apps in the Pop Shop. Theme is pretty nice as well as a bonus."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am quite a fan of their Pop!_Shell. I wanted to improve my desktop efficiency by using a tiling window manager; I tried i3wm and XMonad, but none of them really clicked with me. Finally, I decided to try the Pop!_Shell tiling mode and it was awesome. (Hardcore tiling window manager fans might not agree but Pop!_Shell is a lot more newbie-friendly.)Furthermore, you don&#39;t even have to install Pop!_OS to get Pop!_Shell. For example my preferred distribution is openSUSE Tumbleweed with GNOME, so I just need to    sudo zypper install gnome-shell-extension-pop-shell
    wget https://github.com/pop-os/shell/raw/master_jammy/scripts/configure.sh
    # configure.sh mostly configures keyboard shortcuts. Inspect it before running.
    sh ./configure.sh
    
And then enable it. That&#39;s all."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The update is cool but the update process was not.  -Update available, wanna install?
  Sure
  -OK don&#39;t mind me I&#39;m gonna need a while
  OK
  -HA HA I LIED I&#34;M READY TO TERMINATE EVERYTHING BYEEEE
  WTF
  5 reboots with just an Apple icon and a progress bar
  The progress bar also moves backwards sometimes
  I guess it&#39;s a metaphor for life, which is how long this seems to be taking
  -OK hello I am back but I need 10 minutes of alone time
  -Here is some unfamiliar wallpaper but you can log in I guess
  -Oh it&#39;s you again, do you want to share analytics with us
  -OK here is your familiar desktop, I am not telling you what has changed
  Um preferences
  -Oh hai I&#39;m called Settings now and I reorganized everything
  Yikes but OK this is sorta well laid out I guess
  -Hello I am Stage Manager, I put a desktop on your desktop so you can work while you work
  Sorta neat, can I configure some things differently though
  -No
  
Funnily enough I had just started reading the Ars Technica review when the upgrade took place so that helped with navigating the changes but it was an oddly jarring transition. I get that Apple doesn&#39;t like burdening users with too much technical information (as in &#39;any&#39;) but given how significantly the Settings app has changed I&#39;m surprised there was no Release notes or feature tour of any kind."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So the real complaint is dynamic pricing, which is essentially raising prices to what the market will bear, instead of having (what was formerly artificially) low prices that get scalped. Now the extra money that used to go to scalpers goes to TM instead, and the downside is that some % of fans that could previously luck out and get cheap tickets no longer can.Isnt this...not a bad thing? There&#39;s fundamentally just a supply and demand problem, with more people wanting to see these concerts than there are concerts. The article mentions that Garth brooks solved this by doing more concerts (e.g. 9 in a row in the same city!), but that&#39;s obviously not viable for everyone. Is there a better solution? Even if there were 5 different companies selling concert tickets, wouldnt they inevitably move to dynamic pricing for the same reason?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I sometimes wonder why venues choose Ticketmaster; large as Ticketmaster is it&#39;s not the only option, and how did they come to be the main player? My only conclusion is that the venues (and bands) are benefiting.Here&#39;s my theory:Venues and bands know that for PR reasons they can&#39;t jack up the price of tickets, but they don&#39;t want to miss out on the revenue from people willing to pay scalper prices. So they set tickets at a nominal price but reserve huge blocks of tickets for the band and venues. Nominally these are &#34;family and friends&#34; tickets, but in practice the band and venue put them immediately for resale. This way the bands and venues can get that gigantic revenue. Meanwhile a small number of tickets are sold at face value and immediately sell out.  Ticketmaster profits from fees on the ticket sales and resales.A &#34;known evil&#34; company like ticketmaster is now a benefit, as &#34;obviously&#34; the jacked up costs are ticketmaster&#39;s fault. Meanwhile ticketmaster is really just a service to take the heat off of bands and venues for what would otherwise be seen as price gauging."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lots of comments here from people who haven’t read the article and don’t know about the scalper-eliminating on-demand pricing it’s actually about. Or that it addresses supply-and-demand near the end with some interesting comments on Garth Brooks:Country superstar Garth Brooks—who has called out dynamic pricing as well as suggested that the secondary market should be “illegal,” has more or less solved the problem for his fans with one simple trick: He adds shows until they no longer sell out. In recent years, on single tours, Brooks has done the following: He played nine concerts in a row in Edmonton, Canada. He played a dozen shows in Chicago. He played six in Kansas, nine in Tulsa, and eight in Denver.Indeed, the headline doesn’t seem particularly supported by the actual article to me."</p>
