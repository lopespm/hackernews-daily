								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Awesome! Takes me back :)My 8 yo son is playing it now, he knows all the modern consoles, but this is challenging him. He is frustrated things are hard from the beginning, jumps don&#39;t work right away and he stopped after a few minutes. I remember my perseverance as a kid.I was thinking about that lately, I see my kids don&#39;t have this strong motivation as I had, not for anything. Everything works for them and is layed out. For example, when I was young I had a lego technic motor, but the wires sometimes got oxidatid or just broke, and I had to fix it. My son has a new lego set, and the motor always works, except when the wireless remote runs out of battery. 
Same with gaming, it always works, while in the past even getting a game to run could be a challenge on its own. And when he gets stuck in a game he watches a YouTube. No hours of frustration and endless searching and figuring for a solution.I see my kids don&#39;t have much of these challenges, everything works for them.Don&#39;t know how this will affect them on the long run. Now it&#39;s only my observation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great job! It&#39;s amazing to be able to feel again the sensations I had 30 years ago while developing the Atari version of this game. Thanks again!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So many memories playing this, thanks!I expected after finishing level 1 to see the “page 4 line 2 character 6” challenge room, where you were supposed to prove you owned the official manual.When I was a kid we had it on floppy disk but never had the original book, and I remember diligently filling in a table of failures each time I drank the wrong letter and died. Eventually I got them all!Because of this I remember level 1 extremely well :D"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In the late 2000s, as a teenager, I was gifted a Runescape account. This account had level 80+ woodcutting, allowing one to chop magic trees - which would produce the most expensive lumber in the game. It took a staggering number of real hours to achieve this skill level, we&#39;re talking several hundred hours minimum.At some point I had realized that there were different sketchy websites that would buy and sell the in-game currency, gold pieces or GP. It was something like $10 to 1M GP. I could chop enough magic logs in about 4-6 hours to make $10.I had a breakthrough. What if I wrote a macro to record my cursor and clicks during my route from the &#39;bank&#39; (where you can deposit any amount of any material) to the nearby respawning magic tree forest?Weeks went by and I had passive income. Runescape eventually introduced the Grand Exchange, a literal in-game stock market that allowed power users like me to sell much larger quantities of certain items instantly, across all Runescape servers (referred to as Worlds) simultaneously. This required a standardized pricing mechanism, like an order book, where prices of any item would fluctuate based on buy and sell orders.Suddenly, I now could see a +-10% change on the value of my digital assets, on which my passive income was built.I could go on; Runescape in fact taught me much about economics. What&#39;s extraordinary is selling Runescape gold led me to Bitcoin, and I&#39;ve watched cryptocurrency for nearly a decade, seeing trends from a MMO propagate throughout the world. It seems human nature to innovate and stagnate, and the more immediate our collective feedback loops, the quicker these cycles are."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A thought exercise you should undertake if you&#39;re thinking about / talking about crypto/NFT/web3-related projects:  If the financial instrument that underlies the project were to stop going up in value XX% per month, would you still be interested in the project?I do this a lot because I&#39;ve made the conscious (and perhaps financially foolish) choice to stay away from everything crypto/blockchain related (for now, at least).  So I have some perspective in being able to ask myself &#34;Why is this interesting?&#34; without any emotional-financial attachment.  I do this little exercise every time I read about some new brain-twisting scheme to move money around and capture some of the XX%/month rise.Play-to-earn seems to fit the same mold:  You can talk all you want about how play-to-earn is &#34;the new new&#34; and how it&#39;s helping people out of poverty and changing the dymanics of gaming and yadda yadda yadda.  But just ask yourself:  If the money music stopped tomorrow, would you play the game?Is there a &#34;there&#34; there without an underlying token that&#39;s gone up XX% in the last N months and everyone hopes will still go up XX% in the next N months?It sounds like the answer, at least when it comes to Axie Infinity, is no.  It doesn&#39;t sound fun.  It doesn&#39;t sound compelling.  It DOES sound like an opportunity for people to extract money from the crypto system that&#39;s fundamentally based on the assumption that the crypto system will continue rising in value forever."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I didnt read much of the thread but I will assume that most of the people here is aware of how every single NFT game is just a ponzi.But I&#39;ve lived myself, what the author mentions as a &#34;way to lift people out of poverty.&#34;, from the era before NFT or &#34;play to earn&#34; games existed.I come from Venezuela, a full 3rd world country and I was &#34;lucky&#34; to play an MMO (lineage 2) during my young days and somehow I was good at it, i invested so many hours on it and managed to get into top tier guilds and worlds 1st event, and somehow, my character and my items were worth thousands of dollars in the market, and suddenly i went from being a 14 y.o boy sitting in pc, to bringing more money in 1 week to my family, than my entire family together for 1 year.I could understand that, while all other people on the game were playing for fun, it became my job, a job that actually got me and my family out of poverty...At the time (2007) there were a lot of chinese &#34;farmers&#34;, and people used to make fun of them, not only fun but the rest of the players were blantantly denigrating towards them, at 1st I didnt understand but once that I became a non-chinese farmer, I realized how It was a really good thing to do.Eventually I started botting, I bought more PCs and had a full army of bots, I kept making more and more money, and it helped me and my family leave the country and pretty much bought a house, a car and paid my family expenses for like 4 years out of lineage 2 adena farming.Also, scripting the bots pretty much got me to learn programming and english, so what I am now it&#39;s pretty much the result of some guy from chicago offering me 20$ in paypal for an item i had in my inventory that i got it while killing a monster, it all started there, that litle forbidden transaction in an MMO, changed my life completelySo, even tho it was like a job for me, I never saw it like a job, even tho it gave me a lot of money, i never got into the game as a way to get money, i was just a young kid trying to have some fun..But now, I get really sad everytime I see those ponzi NFT games, that only sell the idea of getting rich, and I get even more sad when I see tons of venezuelan youngsters fall for it, honestly, they are just playing with their desperation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"People choose platforms because of their functionality, not because of their code licensing status - see the case of Scala, linked in a different sibling comment.  Matrix and Zulip, even after years of chasing, still sadly haven&#39;t caught up to Discord functionality- and UX-wise; until that happens, people won&#39;t have a good reason to budge.Regarding IRC, Drew is kind of famous with his ascetism, claiming that the impossibility to share GIFs, videos, files, use threads, have internal chat history, are all features rather than limitations[1]. The thing is, people don&#39;t care about it, they&#39;ll simply vote with their own legs. Mail and mailgroups face a similar UX challenge. Not everyone is willing to endure the pain of learning and using mailgroups and IRC just because they&#39;re FOSS.[1] https://drewdevault.com/2019/07/01/Absence-of-features-in-IR..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On a related note, I’ve found myself actively seeking alternatives (edit: to the project itself, not just to chat) when an OSS project only has a chat-based community as opposed to forums or mailing-lists, for two (edit: three) reasons:- it’s impossible to search chats meaningfully, whereas forums/DLs let you quickly figure out if you’re facing a common issue (and finding resolutions easily)- asking about something in chat and tracking replies a day or two later (because you will quite likely not get a quick reply to complex issues) is also quite hard unless you just happen to be awake at the same time as a core dev and can actually spend the time together (although that usually devolves into “file an issue with more details and tag me”).- I don’t want to sign up for a dozen different services or private forums to even access that info.Not to mention that (depending on community) you might just get a lot of irrelevant chatter thrown in, or just plain “this is the wrong channel” replies because there are no signposts."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Disregarding closed source issue I find Discord, any chat, unsuitable as a public user-developer interface.Why?1. Asynchrony. User needs time to collect data, write a bug report and so on. Developer needs time to reproduce the issue, work on it. Finally there are a lot of timezones - people ask/answer at different points of time.2. Long lasting. Communication can take days, weeks and even months as new details emerge. Accessing a year old thread should be as easy as accessing a thread created yesterday.3. Publicity. You want everything written to be as public as possible. Read access should be available to everyone without registration. Read access should be available via web browser. So that other users (who often experience the same issues) can easily find existing communication on the topic, and if they can&#39;t find it themselves you can at least send them a link which brings me to permanence.4. Permanence. Each individual communication (message) should be accessible by a URI which never changes. Each individual communication page should have links to thread/parent/children/references.5. Searchability. Follows from (3) and (4) but the easier it is for a user to find past discussions - the less noise you&#39;ll have.Chat systems such as Discord, Slack or Matrix are fundamentally incompatible with these requirements as they are focused on synchronous, ephemeral communication."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"related: Ask HN: How did my LastPass master password get leaked? https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29705957"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"LastPass has had a history of security incidents (no company can completely avoid incidents, but if security is literally a primary part of your value, you shouldn’t be having so many).Even worse, they have a history of doing hand-wavy corporate non-explanations for what actually happened in these incidents. The antithesis of being responsible and respecting users in the modern day."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is framed so negatively toward LastPass, which is unfortunate. They stopped all usage of correct passwords they believed were compromised, which is exactly what I&#39;d want them to do in this situation. Them warning users their master passwords are compromised is a good thing! Yet it&#39;s framed as though they&#39;re admitting to something.&#34;However, users receiving these warnings have stated that their passwords are unique to LastPass and not used elsewhere.&#34; That&#39;s really hard to verify. I think most users would say that rather than admit they re-used passwords (or used similar passwords that were easy to reverse engineer). Since there only seems to be 2-3 reports of this, and they&#39;re self-reported and not cited, it doesn&#39;t seem like LastPass was compromised.I&#39;m not saying I like LastPass (I use 1Password and find LastPass to be much worse), but I haven&#39;t seen any indication at this point that LastPass has been compromised at all.(To be clear, it&#39;s very possible I&#39;m wrong and this message won&#39;t age well. But so far, it seems like LastPass is doing its job, and I&#39;d want to see more than this before jumping on the blame-LastPass bandwagon.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Recruiters love phone calls and don’t like doing things over email or text. This means that it is very easy to get overwhelmed by the number of recruiters trying to call you, and we will explore time management a little further down the text.This has been my experience as well, and while I understand the desire for introductory &#34;sales mode&#34; type calls, I think it&#39;s progressed past that point to something nearly pathological.As an example, I recently had a recruiter that I was previously in contact with over email cold-call me while I was skiing, trying to schedule a meeting with a hiring manager (I picked up the call because I thought it might be one of the people in my group that I didn&#39;t have in my contacts). When I requested she please send me an email to schedule the meeting, as I was out of the office, I got an email where she sent an email to schedule the phone call, to then schedule the meeting over the phone. It was 100% the least efficient way to do this, and only happened because of this illogically strong preference for phone calls that recruiters seem to have..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When looking at his LinkedIn, I only see one job with tenure over 4 years almost 10 years back and most other jobs are well below 2 years. It seems like he definitely is able to find new jobs very efficiently so I think his advice here is valuable.However if I were hiring for an engineering leader, I would probably pass him over. I don’t see anyone being an effective leader by only sticking around for less than 2 years. Having tenures less than 2 years especially at senior roles doesn’t give a lot of positive feelings of leadership in my opinion."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Independent headhunters and recruiters are a valuable resourceI had an experience with an independent recruiter that went so poorly that I haven’t been able to take those kinds of people seriously since.A few years back, I was recruited to an up-and-coming startup in the healthcare space in a senior role. It was a massive pay increase, meaningful equity, and a company name I was proud to put on my resume.An independent firm reached out to me about the role and I was definitely interested. One thing I noticed while doing my independent research was that lots of people had very poor Glassdoor reviews of the company, basically comparing it to Theranos in terms of its culture, constant firings, cult-like CEO, etc. I reached out to several former employees to discuss their experience and could not get one to talk to me about working there. Meanwhile, I was hearing from the recruiters that they hired a new exec team and most complaints were not relevant to the current situation there.I brought the complaints up with the recruiter and the company during my interview process, and they both told me it was just a couple disgruntled former employees trying to make the company look bad. The recruiter offered to put me in touch with others they placed at the company, but I couldn’t view them as objective sources.I started the gig and it took me all of two weeks to realize the company was in fact firing people constantly and I had been completely lied to by the recruiter and the company.As much as I want to believe that there are recruiters out there that look out for devs, the reality is that software talent is the product in that relationship and there aren’t a lot of financial incentives to ensure transparency going into these professional relationships. Recruiters get paid when you sign, which creates an inherent conflict of interest when you’re looking to them as a trusted resource."</p>

I am happy for the OP to correct me, but thought I&#39;d mention this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thinking aloud here, it does seem like (as we&#39;ve always known), anyone doing eCommerce online is effectively beholden to their payment provider.Given Stripe is pretty popular, it feels like for many it is becoming the &#34;S3&#34; of payments in terms of an API. Would it be viable for others to implement the same API on the basis of compatibility, portability and interoperability?In the past, I recall dealing with systems where you&#39;d have multiple backend processors for major external functions, and you&#39;d load balance which provider was used. Some might have more favourable pricing, and be a preferred partner, while others might be potential future preferred partners being tried out (see how many failures you get from them, compared with the current preferred partner).It seems that, if this was possible to implement (card tokenization obviously being an issue here), you could have multiple independent backend providers implementing the Stripe API as a provider, and you load balance across them.Just like how you could use another S3 API provider for storage if one is giving you hassle, or not offering satisfactory performance or support. Sure, you have migration work to do, but having the same API and underlying properties should speed things up and let you get new transactions onto the new storage ASAP.ACME is like this for SSL - there&#39;s now multiple CAs implementing the one API. Could we get there for payments too?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"100% atheism. Was raised some kind of protestant I forget which one, and derived tremendous spiritual and psychological relief when I realized all of that was absolute nonsense at the age of 9. I knew I was gay at the time and wouldn&#39;t come out until I was 18 or so, but my life just got a lot easier when I removed religion completely. I also recall discovering increased moral agency -- as a Christian I had been taught I could simply confess whatever and it would be forgiven (an idea I found laughable), and that the objective basis for making moral judgements comes directly from god (another idea I found laughable). As an atheist I was suddenly responsible for making my own moral judgements and conclusions (I had to decide upon my own objective basis for making moral judgements), and forgiveness was something I had to work towards myself (as in I had to forgive myself for things, which is not easy, but is incredibly rewarding) versus simply getting it for free from some nonexistent deity. All in all, was an incredibly positive change in my life, and I do believe there can be a weird sort of spirituality to 100% atheism that people don&#39;t really acknowledge."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am a practicing Catholic. I have four kids all under 7. My normal day consists of feeding them, bathing them, calming tantrums, losing my temper, getting bitter at my lack of time for hobbies, and growing resentful of my lack of time for reading the Bible, praying, etc.But then I remember that this is a true dying to self. Not only a dying to self, but a dying to the world too as each of these sacrifices, failures, and victories occur hidden away from the world. Thus I commend myself to this daily humbling, this emptying, and also trust myself to the daily prayer of the monks, whose prayer and sacrifice are also hidden from the world and whose labors I suspect are also just as arduous, frustrating, and challenging at times.&gt; For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find i"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Day starts with prayer and studying scripture by myself for awhile, then briefly as a family before everyone goes their way. Part of the personal prayer time includes seeking direction on who I might help that day. Throughout the day I try to take little breaks for a brief prayer, longer if I&#39;m stuck on a programming bug whose solution eludes me and for which I need extra inspiration. Also I try to go on a daily walk to appreciate nature and to recognize blessings in my life. Each meal includes a prayer of thanks. Before bed there&#39;s a brief family scripture study and prayer, then a prayer with my wife, then a personal prayer to round out the day where I try to reflect on how things went and what I hope to do better tomorrow."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Employees not succeeding at disconnecting from work is often unintentional, and caused by subtle, pernicious effects of middle managers simply existing and following basic incentives (such as &#34;my boss just sent me an email after dinner, guess I should act/forward it along&#34;).Forcing companies to write down their policy on this seems like a pretty good idea, because it forces HR to actually decide how they want their employees to be treated, and enables middle managers to be held accountable for their actions along this axis."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"PSA: In a lot of country, non-competes agreement are illegal, at least in the form they usually take. In many jurisdiction,  non-compete will only apply when specific condition are met. For example, in France[0], all non-compete have to have :- a &#34;reasonable&#34; time limit- a specific geographic region (i.e: only in France, U.E, etc...) -&gt; this is very often omitted, and &#34;the whole world&#34; is not valid.- The non-competition has to be for a specific activity. This is often not understood and instead you find something like &#34;not work for our competitor&#34; or &#34;not work for a company in this field&#34;. This is not specific enough and will be thrown out in court.- There has to be a financial compensation.Despite this, almost all the company that I worked for in France had non-applicable non-competes agreement in their contract. None of them offered a financial compensation and none had a specific region.As far as I know, this is not a France-only thing, and non-competes creeps in almost any employment contract in the world, especially in the tech field. Learn your rights.[0] https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F1910"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reading the text, they didn’t actually create a right to disconnect from work. They only require employers to write down their policy and share it with employees:&gt; The legislation offers no guidance as to what must be included in the policy, and simply provides that the policy must include &#34;such information as may be prescribed.&#34; This was apparently intentional as noted in the legislative summary in an effort to offer employers flexibility to develop a policy appropriate to its operational needs.So unless I’m missing something, a company can write down “Employees must be available as needed” or something equally vague and they comply with the policy.In practice I would expect most employers to write a lot of vague wording about how employees aren’t required to be active online in their off hours, but they’ll leave the door open for emergency communications as needed. No sane company is going to write down a legally binding policy that nobody is going to contact anybody else at certain times. Imagine how easy it would be for a manager to break such a restriction by accidentally tagging an employee name in Slack at the wrong time of day, for example.The “right to disconnect” seems largely symbolic.On the other hand, banning non-competes is a big deal. They are effectively banned in my location (and several other states in the United States) and it’s great to not worry about it at all."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I feel a bit disappointed by the number of people suggesting that an NFT would somehow help here.An NFT is just a fancy signed receipt. I can mint an NFT saying the OP owns a bunch of Ubisoft games and give it to him, but his account will still be closed. Ubisoft could mint an NFT saying he owns a bunch of games and give it to him, but his account will still be closed. (He probably still has the receipts from when he bought the games in his inbox somewhere, but of course, his account is still closed.)We can store whatever records we like in a fancy distributed database, but his account will still be closed. The only fix here is Ubisoft needs to not close peoples accounts.Somewhat amusingly Ubisoft is in the process of launching an NFT system (https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/12/ubisofts-first-nft-pl...) and as anyone paying attention would no doubt expect, it doesn&#39;t solve anything related to this; up to an including the fact that if you get banned you...lose your NFTs.There is no technological problem to solve here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article is a great example of why we need legislation around ownership of digital items. I generally hate getting the government involved in things, but if you&#39;re paying money for goods, there needs to be a way to be credited or receive your digital goods in a way that still works without your &#34;account&#34;.Personally I always get kind of nervous around buying things on PSN, Xbox, Stadia, Steam, Oculus, etc. If they ban me, do I lose my thousands of dollars of games? That doesn&#39;t seem right (and no, I don&#39;t really care too much about what the Terms and Services say)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; We may also close long-term inactive accounts to maintain our database.How many kilobytes takes too store ownership data? I can just imagine that tracking data is thousands of times bigger.&gt; The crazy thing about this is that it’s perfectly legal for video game companies to delete your account regardless of whether you’ve spend zero or a thousand dollars on their gamesIt&#39;s a shame that we are going to fight for our digital rights because currently we have almost none because  justice does not understand technology."</p>

To be honest, at the moment the algorithm doesn&#39;t return any sensible results for anything (at least that I can find), but I hope that you can find a way past this as it&#39;s a great place to have a project.I&#39;ve included some search terms below that I&#39;ve tried - I&#39;ve not cherrypicked these and believe they are indicative of current performance. Some of these might be the size of the index - however I suspect it&#39;s actually how the search is being parsed/ranked (in particular I think the top two examples show that).&gt; Search &#34;best car brands&#34;Expected: Car ReviewsReturns a page showing the best mobile phone brands.then...&gt; Then searching &#34;Best Mobile Phone&#34;Expected: The article from the search above.Returns a gizmodo page showing the best apps to buy...  &#34;App Deals: Discounted iOS iPhone, iPad, Android, Windows Phone Apps&#34;&gt; Searching &#34;What is a test?&#34;Expected result: Some page describing what a test is, maybe wikipedia?Returns &#34;Test could confirm if Brad Pitt does suffer from face blindness&#34;&gt; Searching &#34;Duck Duck Go&#34;Expected result: DDG.comReturns &#34;There be dragons?

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; We plan to start work on a distributed crawler, probably implemented as a browser extension that can be installed by volunteers.Is there a concern that volunteers could manipulate results through their crawler?You already mentioned distributed search engines have their own set of issues. I&#39;m wondering if a simple centralised non-profit fund a la wikipedia could work better to fund crawling without these concerns. One anecdote: Personally I would not install a crawler extensions, not because I don&#39;t want to help, but because my internet connection is pitifully slow. I&#39;d rather donate a small sum that would go way further in a datacenter... although I realise the broader community might be the other way around.[edit]Unless, the crawler was clever enough to merely feed off the sites i&#39;m already visiting and use minimal upload bandwidth. The only concern then would be privacy. oh the irony, but trust goes a long way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A laudable effort. Two questions:1. What is the rationale behind choosing Python as a implementation language? Performance and efficiency are paramount in keeping operational costs low and ensuring a good user experience even if the search engine will be used by many users. I guess Python is not the best choice for this, compared to C, Rust or Java.2. What is the rationale behind implementing a search engine from scratch versus using existing Open Source search engine libraries like Apache Lucene, Apache Solr and Apache Nutch (crawler)?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A few days ago I finally stopped doing something very similar.As fascinating as the data could be (I never managed to transform it like this), the constant recording of every single thing made me stop enjoying things. It made me hyper-conscious of everything going on in my body as the primary goal was to figure out some health issues. Everything I felt or did seemed to have an &#34;event handler&#34; attached to it.I now just stick to one line a day in a spreadsheet as a sort of diary.To anyone attempting it:1. Figure out what you want to do with the data first. Even if you just want some pretty graphs, create some random test data and set everything up so you can see these graphs. Don&#39;t just throw data into a black hole for years.2. Make sure recording the data is as easy and comfortable as possible. That android app from the article looks good, but you have to be absolutely sure it&#39;s okay to use many times a day. Be aware that there&#39;s no good answer to &#34;why do you keep reaching for your phone all the time?&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been using Daylio [0] for the last 2 years to track my mood and activities. It&#39;s less comprehensive than the system described here but much simpler to implement. It lets you set up a reminder with a mood selector, and you then select the activities you have accomplished. The activities are completely configurable. I&#39;ve started by tracking just a few habits and I&#39;ve added more along the way.I can&#39;t praise this app enough. Main pros:- all your data is stored locally not in the cloud, but you can easily back it up on Google Drive- it lets you export your data anytime- It comes with nice dashboards, weekly, monthly and yearly reviews. It let&#39;s you see the impact of each activity on your mood. It really gave me some interesting insights on my mood patterns.My only complaint really is that the only numeric value you can track is your mood, everything else is yes or no.A year or so ago, I&#39;ve also started using Clockify [1] to track the time I spent on each activity. Again, I don&#39;t track everything, only a few habits I want to improve on. It has a mobile and desktop app. The UI could be improved but all the features I need are free, and most importantly data export.It&#39;s the perfect time of year to set up a tracking system. My recommendation is start small. Track only a couple of activities first and add more as you build the habit.[0]: https://daylio.net/[1]: https://clockify.me/"</p>

I then suddenly remembered that this has happened before, but very long time go, maybe half a life-time ago."</p>

Most of these programs are just using the pywidevine library along with some key that&#39;s been leaked (if you know how to navigate Github search you can find one in a couple of minutes) and then integrating the streaming site&#39;s API.  I wrote mine in Go because I got sick of the pywidevine hegemony and I felt it was unnecessarily complicated.  The annoying thing is that key revocations are happening pretty frequently now.  It&#39;s another one of those pointless cat and mouse games."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I lead the Microsoft Open Source Programs Office team. I&#39;m sorry this happened.We have merged a pull request that restored the correct LICENSE file and copyright, and are in touch with the upstream author Leśny Rumcajs who emailed us this morning. We&#39;ll look to revert the entire commit that our bot made, too, since it updated the README with a boilerplate getting started guide.The bug was caused by a bot that was designed to commit template files in new repositories. It&#39;s code that I wrote to try to prevent other problems we have had with releasing projects in the past. It&#39;s not supposed to run on forks.I&#39;m going to make sure that we sit down and audit all of our forked repositories and revert similar changes to any other projects.We have a lot of process around forking, and have had to put controls in place to make sure that people are aware of that guidance. Starting a few years ago, we even &#34;lock&#34; forks to enforce our process. We prefer that people fork projects into their individual GitHub accounts, instead of our organization, to encourage that they participate with the upstream project. In this situation, a team got approval to fork the repository, but hasn&#39;t yet gotten started.To be as open as I can, I&#39;d like to point to the bug:- The templates we apply on new repositories live at https://github.com/microsoft/repo-templates- The bug seems to be at this line of the new repository workflow: https://github.com/microsoft/opensource-management-portal/bl...- The system we have in place even tries to educate our engineers with this log message (https://github.com/microsoft/opensource-management-portal/bl...): &#34;this.log.push({ message: `Repository ${subMessage}, template files will not be committed. Please check the LICENSE and other files to understand existing obligations.` });&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The attitude in these threads always boggles my mind.  When YOU, your teammates or someone else you know makes a mistake, then it’s just a mistake.     But when someone at Microsoft makes a mistake it’s because Microsoft is evil and by extension so is the person who offended.“It’s a big company”, you say.  They should have a process!  And I’m sad to say, they do/will have a process exactly because of this attitude.  Then, everyone wonders why it takes forever to fix that bug they’re furious about or why features are slow to come.Full disclosure: I work for MS, though have nothing to do with this.  It’s a huge company. I know hundreds of people and most of them are upstanding and try to do the right thing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t think that just because some &#34;bot&#34; did this Microsoft is to be excused. Someone decided that using a piece of software to automatically alter license files. This is a genuinely stupid idea. And they already fucked up in the same way with the CUPS project. Will they learn without someone taking them to court over this? I don&#39;t think so."</p>

I lost almost everything. Job, 7-year relationship, my mental health.Feeling that I&#39;m not only alone but inadequate to have a life like anybody else.I&#39;m still alive, so there&#39;s that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thank you for this post, I spent the majority of Christmas &#39;19 and &#39;20 alone and it was in the middle of a very challenging time of my life. I&#39;m very young and grateful for the friends and others that included me in their holiday celebrations, and having time alone to reflect and come to the realization that Christmas doesn&#39;t come from having family to share it with.While most traditional Christmas stories and many people focus on celebrating children, love and family, material goods, etc it&#39;s also about looking on the bright side of life, counting your blessings, and carrying on traditions. A happy Christmas is a choice, and my advice to all who are alone today is this: Build your own traditions, buy yourself something and wrap it up nice, decorate a tree, make gingerbread houses, or cook a meal you really like, whatever appeals to you.I&#39;ll leave you with the last line from How the Grinch Stole Christmas and a link to an In Our Time episode about (A Christmas Carol)[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0012fl5]:&#34;Welcome Christmas, bring your cheer. Cheer to all Who&#39;s far and near Christmas day is in our grasp, so long as we have hands to clasp. Christmas day will always be, just as long as we have we. Welcome Christmas while we stand, heart to heart and hand in hand.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This year, after a tumultuous breakup (that quite literally plunged me into my deepest crisis to day), I’m practicing being alone. Mostly because what lead to said breakup in the first place, was me being a relationship-addict, which at this point in my self-awareness journey I understand to be a transgenerational issue. Thus being with family does not help at all (even though I did my fair share of being with them yesterday). As opposed to OP, I’m less than happy about the whole thing understandably.What helps is hiking, I guess, trying to get a grip on whether doing it alone or with others helps more.I guess this is close to being rock bottom for me at this point, hope you guys feel at least a tiny bit ok."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are lots of people for who Xmas isn’t a thing — different background etc.I always thought it would make sense to let us handle Xmas duty so others — people for whom it really, really matters - can do their Xmas stuff.I used to try to volunteer for this when it was relevant (really, it’s not a thing for me), but I rarely saw a systematic opportunity to do so.I think it gets harder as time goes because the replacement day (say a random day in Jun) isn’t as quiet because the rest of the economy is not turned off."</p>

This new coworker has lately been shattering that. This person not only posts in the evenings, weekends, and sometimes into the graveyard shift, but does so in a cloying, overeager, performative kind of way.&#34;while that job was running I took the opportunity to go learn this new skill!&#34;&#34;I finished this step of the process. Now I&#39;m gonna go do the next one!&#34;...and updates on what they&#39;re doing and their reachability, at all hours.&#34;I&#39;m going to have dinner because I haven&#39;t eaten anything today, but I will have my work computer and work phone with me so feel free to ping me&#34;.Even today, on Christmas morning, there was more from this person in slack, posted after midnight on Christmas Eve.I do my best to push it out of my mind, but I can&#39;t deny this adds a layer of stress for me. I don&#39;t want work conversations to stretch into nonworking hours. I don&#39;t want this to become part of the culture in my team or company. I don&#39;t want to see this kind of behavior become the expectation. I hope nobody ever asks anyone else to be more like this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There are so many super cool aspects to this!- it&#39;s always fun when a new equation or formula is discovered, doubly so when it is very practical- actually really easy to wrap your head around it- seems very computationally efficient. Basically boils down to sorts and distance- not limited to strict numeric fields ( integers and reals). Anything with an ordering defined can act as your Xs/Ys: characters, words, complex/vectors (under magnitude). I think you could even apply it recursively to divide and conquer high dimensional datasets.- looks useful in both LTI and non stationary signal analysis- possible use cases: exoplanet search, cosmology in general, ecology, climate, cryptanalysis, medicine, neuroscience, and of course, someone will find a way to win (more likely lose) money on stonks."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"About 14 years ago, at my first job, I worked with a colleague[1] who introduced me to the wonderful world of open source: the culture, the philosophy, how to submit patches to open source projects, etc. He also introduced me to Debian GNU/Linux which I use actively to this day.One day, he began working on certain audio/video encoding problems that needed to be solved for our project. He chose FFmpeg as the primary tool around which he began building his solution. After having spent several days with FFmpeg, figuring out and documenting various ways of using FFmpeg to solve all our audio/video encoding problems, one day, when we went out for lunch, he declared to the team,&#34;FFmpeg is awesome! If you give me a shoe, I will turn it into a video file!&#34;[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=topa"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think it is worth posting Tom Vaughan [1]( Father of x265 )&#39;s reply here.&gt;FFMPEG is a media processing framework. It&#39;s great for simple media processing jobs (builds a graph, runs the graph). A build of &#34;FFMPEG&#34; includes that media processing framework plus dozens of open source libraries (filters) that do the actual work (x265, x265, libav, etc).&gt;So &#34;FFMPEG&#34; gets a lot of well deserved credit (it&#39;s the framework that lots of applications and well-known services run), but the core FFMPEG is probably a tiny fraction of the development man-hours in a build of FFMPEG. It&#39;s all the linked libraries that make it useful.It is also worth stating this is from 2020. I am not sure why this is submitted now.[1] https://twitter.com/tmvn/status/1258610308962111490"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There’s a lot of good stuff in here, things I’ve used in my personal life to great effect.The really important thing here (that’s hinted at towards the end) is moderation.Do some of these things. A little at a time. Find what works and what doesn’t.Saying the truth no matter what the cost is extremely dangerous advice to follow literally.Pick battles you can win. Know when saying the truth matters and when it doesn’t. Know when your “truth” is just another opinion no one around you at that moment agrees with.As my dad always told me, “you can be dead right.”Life is too short to be miserable trying to obtain someone else’s goals. It is too short to optimize everything. Remember that happiness in the moment matters. (But not at the expense of the future.)You’ll never find me reading a book I don’t like or skipping using GPS, because things cause more stress than benefit.Having a car break down and having a magical moment because of it? Do the opposite. Actively seek those moments by finding people to help instead of waiting for the moment to happen.If I have any advice to add, it is be honest and be kind. Fight when you need to fight, make peace when you don’t. You don’t need to fix everything, just make the world better by being in it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Liked most of this except #1&gt; Discovering and living out a sense of calling — a personal vocation, or something you are uniquely meant to do — is the ultimate way to cut through the mimetic noise of the world and begin to shape both a moral and a vocational compass.There are on the order of 7 billion human beings on earth. We don&#39;t all have a personal vocation or something we are uniquely meant to do. One of the keys to leading a happy and fulfilled life is being able to be content to live within the bounds that most of us operate in. Most of us are not uniquely gifted, not particularly special, not here to do one thing in this world. But we can be kind, be helpful, try to do as little damage to other people and the world as we can, to find value in things that last and do not cost the world very much, to enjoy our lives regardless of what we do for a living, not because of it.It may be a gift from the Renaissance to believe in individuality in the way that #1 clearly does, but it&#39;s a gift that doesn&#39;t scale to huge populations (it may not even have been right with much smaller ones). It&#39;s wonderful to live in a society that allows for individual self-discovery and self-expression, but we should not blind us to the reality that almost all of us are not on a unique, singular mission."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s hilarious that this is standard self-help advice designed to make you a better worker, packaged up as something subversive or &#34;anti-mimetic.&#34; I am reminded of Mark Fisher:&#34;Witness, for instance, the establishment of settled &#39;alternative&#39; or &#39;independent&#39; cultural zones, which endlessly repeat older gestures of rebellion and contestation as if for the first time. &#39;Alternative&#39; and &#39;independent&#39; don&#39;t designate something outside mainstream culture; rather, they are styles, in fact the dominant styles, within the mainstream.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"But ads in real life do not prevent me from going on about my day. There is no analogy to interstitial pages with ads like in Forbes some time ago with the button Continue to your article: it would be infuriating if you had to view an ad before being able to use the subway ticketing system. You also don’t have ads on at the airport timetable screen. You don’t have pinkertons following you to learn your habits and show you “relevant” ads. If you walk into a grocery store wearing sunglasses, the clerk will not stand in front of you and say “I am sorry, please remove your shades before continuing because ads support our store and you need to see them.”But yes, unhealthy amount of advertising IRL should be limited as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I cycle to work on an ebike. About 25 km each way. One of the major issues is the lack of proper infrastructure and awful attitude by drivers, in particular service drivers.Advertisement company vans are a prime example. There are rolling advertisement posters  in most bus stop shelters. These drivers will park up on the footpath blocking pedestrians and those using the bus to update the advertisements, often in the mornings during rush hour. They will park on the cycle lanes and force cyclists out into fast moving and unaccommodating aggressive traffic.The same goes for delivery drivers. Legally they are permitted on double yellow ‘no parking’ lines on the street but the perception is no not hinder car traffic so they park up on the footpath instead.During the pandemic there was a lot of temporary work on cycling infrastructure, mostly lazy efforts such as painted cycle lanes and plastic bollards. These drivers simply drive over the bollards or if wide enough down the protected lane. If you challenge them they are verbally abusive.The attitude of all persons in a mechanically propelled vehicle is that this is not their fault. They are just doing their job. Their companies trot out the tired line that they take safety seriously bla bla bla…So in regards physical advertisement is public space, for me this is a symptom of a wider problem of perceptions of ownership of our cities public space. We forget that cities are for people. We let cars dominate the majority of the available space. We let oversized vehicles make deliveries in medieval city streets. We use cars for short inappropriately short journeys such as for bringing our kids to school, often because it’s too dangerous to let them walk or cycle because there are too many cars.We need to start treating our cities like parks with a focus people and figure out ways to remove ICE powered vehicles and limit the space all vehicles occupy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Advertising as it is done presently has at least three faults, which is just as much a fault with the ethics of society for allowing this to go on:- adverts seeks to hijack your attention away from whatever you were doing, which is a mental burden resulting diminished performance (in the case of a work environment), is downright dangerous in the case of traffic environments and lessens the enjoyment in the case of leisure activities.- there is little to no ethical restriction on content; the advert that gets displayed is likely not that of the best product: it is the one whose owner paid the most money, and the ad that gets the most traction is the one that tells the best story, so perfused with lies by omission and other forms of deceit that we don&#39;t even notice any more.- the ubiquity of ads causes an perpetual escalation of the struggle for  attention, to the extent that we might credibly expect to get ads implanted in our brains eventually if we don&#39;t say enough is enough.The solution seems simple enough to me: we need to establish a code of conduct for advertisers which at the core means that they may no longer shove ads down our throats at every junction; instead adverts should be freely displayed in separate spaces (like a dedicated page on each website) where people voluntarily could look for products and services that they need (or just to browse), much like the ad pages in newspapers of days now long gone by.All we need is a mechanism that promotes this behavior, and sanctions breaches."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Ruby now has “punning.”&gt; Values in Hash literals and keyword arguments can be omitted. [Feature #14579]&gt; {x:, y:} is a syntax sugar of {x: x, y: y}.&gt; foo(x:, y:) is a syntax sugar of foo(x: x, y: y).This is going to be controversial and take some getting used to, but I think eventually everyone will love it. It’s not an easy syntax to learn - I remember when this came to JS it took a while to get my head around all the different ways this shorthand was used in the wild.It’s hard to come up with new syntax that can peacefully coexist with the established language. I think in hindsight it would have been helpful for Ruby if it had done something like square braces instead of brackets for hash literals, or not allowed brackets for blocks. The most ambiguous syntax all involves hash literals vs blocks… this adds to that cognitive load.But typing out a long hash literal just to capture a bunch of local variables or methods is so common, and the duplication is quite annoying, so on the whole I’m glad this was added and am sure I’ll use it a lot :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;The following default gems are now bundled gems.&#34; Great to see slow removal (or carve out) of rarely used stdlib stuff.Ruby would benefit from a trimmed down stdlib, where effort could be spent keeping a smaller footprint stdlib more polished than it is today. Turning them into opt-in gems is a good first step.A few examples:- `rss` to parse RSS documents/streams- `win32ole` for Microsoft Windows OLE Automation- `dbm` for DBM databases- `abbrev` for finding the shortest unique abbreviation amongst many stringsThis page has more details:

								<p class="story__comment_others">"My wife is an astrophysicist here in Australia and had been looking forward to this launch for over a decade. She plans on using James Webb and gravitational lensing to observe galaxies at extremely high redshifts. Basically one looks behind single or clusters of closer galaxies for very young galaxies in the early stages of forming, not long after the Big Bang. The gravity well of the closer cluster acts as a giant lense, acting as an additional optical element to the telescope propelling us even further into the distant past.As we watched the launch I asked her what James Web means to astronomy. Her answer? &#34;It will fundamentally change what we know about the universe&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It’s surprising and disappointing to me that this—titled “ADHD Accommodations Guide”—buries accommodation recommendations under sub-links and all of the remaining content is advice for, presumably, those of us with ADHD who are trying to work around lack of accommodations.That said, there’s plenty of good advice even if it’s a little inconsistent. It’s also fascinating how much the social part overlaps with challenges faced by Autistic people[1].For ADHD folks who find some of the advice on multitasking/focus in meetings wanting: it’s absolutely okay to stim (perform some stimulating, often repetitive action) when you find your ability to stay focused isn’t what you need or what’s expected. I have a reputation for spending most of my time in meetings playing minesweeper. It’s not because I’m not engaged, it’s because it helps me stay engaged. I happily stop or mute my mic if the clicking sound is disruptive, but otherwise I’ve continually established with teammates and even clients that having that part of my focus on something mostly mechanical helps me stay in the conversation and productive.1: Which I increasingly feel confident in the idea that there’s no meaningful distinction and ADHD should/likely eventually will be considered part of the spectrum, but that’s not why I’m commenting."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a useful post, thank you.I have only recently become aware of what it means to try to work with someone who has ADHD. I’d heard of ADHD but I didn’t know what it was or what the implications were.Then, a project went terribly terribly wrong. I tried to make sense of it through empathic modelling of my colleagues circumstances, but this only made it worse. I was baffled by that, which is when I realised I needed more information about ADHD, because just placing myself in my colleagues shoes didn’t help when we were using very different thought processes.Without a model of ADHD thought processes my attempts at empathy were counter-productive.I’d try to put myself in my colleagues position in order to understand my colleagues feelings but because we have different thought processes this didn’t work at all.I think I’m seeing the limitations of empathy for the first time. Until I have a better working understanding of ADHD, articles like this with practical tips are my best guide."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The thing that most (if not all) people who have ADHD want is to be normal. This works against them, similar to other people with disabilities, in that asking for accomodations feels like admitting defeat. Like you will never make progress in your lifelong struggle. Like you have an incurable disease.While it&#39;s cool that workplaces can make such accomodations if requested, it would just be better for fucking everyone if these were available to everyone. That&#39;s the real problem with being disabled: you&#39;re treated abnormally.Sure, there will always be exceptions, but just recognize humans are not fungible, and be kind. Don&#39;t make folks lives harder than they already are."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I would really say that &#34;running your own email&#34; is a set of things that can be done independently:- Getting your own domain and using a provider such as fastmail or proton is a first step that gives you lots of security fom arbitrary. Because you own the doorstep, you can change provider without having to inform all your contacts of the move. You&#39;re also more secure from unilateral moves from your provider.-Hosting your own mail server means that you are responsible for the persistence of your mail. It&#39;s a nice artisanal thing to do, and you may be satisfied to know that no one is reading your mail.-Sending your mail yourself is the real hard part, because you need a stable IP that is accepted as a legitimate mail sender. Moreover, you need to monitor this property in the long term. Every mail server has their own way to choose who is a legitimate mail sender, and it&#39;s an ongoing pain to check that.You&#39;re not forced to go all the way, you can simply pick a domain to secure the frontdoor, or you can host your mail server without sending mail by yourself, etc. You can also self-host, and change your mind later without much impact.I personally would incite everyone to do at least #1 for safety reasons, #2 if you want to fiddle with the system to know how it works, and to avoid #3."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Someone should try &#34;artisanal email server&#34; using cloudron or yunohost !
the bigger problem is that &#34;authoritative&#34; email monopolies such as Gmail, 365 and the other big ones arbitrarily define and impose what is a legit email server or not and even with better score than gmail an &#34;artisanal&#34; email server can suffer from being classified into spam by the big tech players just because they can and will do anything to maintain their monopoly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yeah I stopped running my own. I kept getting blocked by Microsoft in particular (mainly consumer recipients at live.com and outlook.com, strange enough not corporate O365 users!). I&#39;m 100% sure I did not send any spam, the only emails going to those addresses were legit from a family member. DMARC and SPF were all set perfectly, relays blocked, I was not on any spamlist and I never have been either.Literally every month I got blocked again because my server did not have enough reputation. Kept logging tickets to get it unblocked and then a month later it was back. One time I did manage to get a personal email back from a guy in India. Said that it was because my mailserver did not send enough legitimate mail for their algorithm to trust it.So the lack of spam is not enough anymore to be blocked. You actually have to send a load of legit traffic to build up &#39;reputation&#39;. Now just being a small time sender is a problem. This way the big players can just carve out a bigger market for themselves. They basically break the decentralised concept of email by doing this.In the end I moved to O365, which felt bad because I didn&#39;t want to reward them for their behaviour. But we moved to it at work too and I wanted an instance with full admin rights to explore. My contract is up next year so I may change then if I can find a party that does it well and ideally cheaper."</p>

I decided not to use any JS on my personal site, but you can still have:+ collapsible sections with `details` and `summary`[0]+ footnotes, with navigation to/from with anchor tags. You can even apply CSS on the currently selected footnote.[1]+ Semantic web that is compatible with everything and has sensible defaults so you can focus on what you&#39;re actually doing!+ Tiny deploys and page loads. Single KBs (with brotli compression) for long blog posts. Just `scp` and Nginx keeps serving.I can&#39;t think of anything else I want.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is something I&#39;ve always wanted for virtual textbooks. A single .html file with all the JS, CSS, images as inline data blobs, etc. For most physics, math, CS, etc books, this should be possible. It would make it trivial to download the book for offline use and share it with others. Other than the raster images, the entire content of these types of books would probably fit in a couple MB of text. The use of #anchors or other smart URL manipulation would also make it easy to share internal hyperlinks if you want to tell a friend to look at chapter/section #foo_bar of the book."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well, TiddlyWiki[1] has been going it for 17(!) years. It&#39;s a very mature, polished, and extensible engine for wikis, blogs, and personal knwledge bases.The entire thing (including the editor!) is a single .html file. By default, even images are embedded.For my ADHD Wiki[2], a resource that talks about ADHD with a copious amounts of relatable memes intertwined with the text, I chose to just use images in the same directory instead of embedding them; so you might need to do some work to download that page (I think File -&gt; Save as.. can give you a readable static version on some browsers).Anyway, somewhat surprising that people are stumbling into how much you can do with just one well-crafted .html file. Look ma, no node.js, no (no)SQL database, no nothing except for one file for one website (and that file isn&#39;t even that large, given what TiddlyWiki allows you to do).TiddlyWiki can be run on node.js, but I don&#39;t see much reason to. If I want to make changes, I use the built-in editor, and then the &#34;Save...&#34; button generates me the .html of the updated version. Save it over the old one, upload over ftp, done. No deployment process to speak of.And, at that, the feature set rivals (and, at times, exceeds) that of, say, Wikipedia.(And for math nerds: it supports LaTeX via a KaTeX plugin. Maybe you can&#39;t copy-paste your entire thesis, but it&#39;s pretty damn close to real-time full-featured LaTeX).[1]https://tiddlywiki.com/[2]https://romankogan.net/adhd"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"“How to change your mind” by Michael Pollen.I read a lot of books, and this is one that caused a change in my life. The succinct summary is that psychedelics are misunderstood and there is more and more research showing their potential, especially in the treatment of trauma.I had a difficult childhood. It’s something I still struggle with personal interactions because of this, even after years of therapy. After reading Michael Pollen’s book I thought this might be something that could move the needle on my day-to-day quality of life.I found a shaman and did an 8 hour blindfolded mushroom trip. Similar to what’s outlined in the book. Previously I’ve never done anything more than weed occasionally.It had a profound impact on me. The way I describe it is like jumping off a diving board into a deep dark pool, and the pool is you. Then spending hours there.I don’t know if I’d do it again but I learnt a lot about myself. I won’t proselytize here either, because the research is still early. There’s also risk because you put a lot of trust in someone who’s there with you while you’re high. But I do recommend at least reading the book."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Dispossessed, by Ursula K. Le Guin.It identified so many of the &#34;edges&#34; of society and how I think about and interact with the world, on a daily basis.Without a doubt one of the best books I&#39;ve ever read. Maybe even the best.The only other book that came close this year was Robert Sapolsky&#39;s A Primate&#39;s Memoir."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just finished a re-read of the &#34;Commonweal&#34; series by Graydon Saunders, which begins with The March North:https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MoIOAwAAQBAJI&#39;ve never been sure how to sum up these books. They&#39;re thoroughly strange fantasy books, oddly written and frequently chewy reads. They have an interest in politics and metaphysics; but they also have magical railguns, the sorcerous application of FOOF [1], and a five-ton battle-sheep named Eustace.The first book is fairly straightforward: A quiet backwater of the Commonweal is under threat, and its only defense is an understrength territorial battalion, a handful of experimental artillery pieces, and three of the mightiest sorcerers of the age.Then the second book (A Succession of Bad Days) isn&#39;t at all about the military, and is more like the weirdest going-to-sorcery-school book I&#39;ve ever read. It also has an extended, detailed section on using sorcery in canal construction. If you ever wanted a book about the best ways to use magic in the service of civil engineering, this series is your jam.These books really aren&#39;t for everyone, but I kind of love them, and they aren&#39;t widely known, so I&#39;ll always take an opportunity to shill them.[1] https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/things-i-won-t-wor..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Charlatans begone.  2x is a fashion statement and Ive been learning at a much faster rate for quite some time.The real answer to speed learning, is to watch the video at 200x, in a concrete room buried ten meters deep, with your nose pressed pensively to a 50&#34; flatscreen surrounded by a frigid black ocean of PA speakers and amplifiers.  Ive found that in five to seven hours, Ive fully comprehended the video as it &#34;repeats twice&#34;, ad infinitum.now, the volume is critical as it is not to concede 110db at any time.  this promotes learning at 200x the volume of the original video.  At the end of your learning session it is important to remain unclothed, as this promotes the knowledge to absorb into your body fastest whilst the room leaves you in inscrutable darkness, to succor a distant memory of the learning materials interdisciplinary themes and objectives.Once youve climbed from the pit --and washed the learning jelly from yourself--  then you will have attained full and complete knowledge of how to properly tie a tie, or water a houseplant, or whatever you should need to learn.  The pit will remain there for you should you ever dare to utter another question in wonderment."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m a bit puzzled by the recurring apparition of articles about learning faster on HN.I don’t think I have suffered from the speed at which material covers a subject since I left school. Finding interesting material, properly structured with a good balance of introductory and in depth coverage and giving solid insight into a topic remains challenging — it already was when I was a student to be fair. Good teaching ressources are the exception rather than the norm. Finding the time to properly conceptualise and deeply think about what I’m trying to learn has been challenging. But the speed at which I can consume teaching material is not something I remember being bothered by this past decade. Thinking about it more often than not I wish I could actually go slower rather than faster.I’m curious about how the experience of others commenters differ here as it’s obviously a topic of interest to some in this community."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"(Note: full study PDF is on researchgate)I would take this with a giant grain of salt:1.)  N is in the hundreds of students, all with similar backgrounds - likely a highly specific population.  It may not generalize well.2.)  The videos were pretty short: 3-15 minutes long.3.)  The overall effect size is pretty miniscule - it would make little practical difference.4.)  The video topics were roman history and real estate appraisals.It will be interesting to see if this generalizes (to longer durations, more technical topics, more diverse population, etc.), but given the above I wouldn&#39;t change any personal habits based on this study."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What I find most amazing about it is that this has been about a decade in the making - Valve started their Linux compatibility initiative back when Microsoft threatened to hurt Steam with Windows 8 and Microsoft Store requirements.How dedicated they are to this effort is impressive - they first failed big with the Steam Machines when support was very half baked, but now they&#39;ll try again with the Deck just as compatibility is coming along much better.I guess Linux gamers can largely thank Microsoft for this one!As a Mac user I&#39;m a bit disappointed they stopped their efforts on that front, since the new processors are quite capable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Starting at Win7 the telemetry and invasive advertising ramped up to the point where I don&#39;t feel I can customize the Desktop to what I want without heavy tweaking.And if that amount of tweaking is necessary why not go Linux instead.So got rid of my Win10 install, went with KDE Neon+Steam. And now I wonder what took me so long.I haven&#39;t tested my entire Steam library yet but my top 10 games run perfectly, some times with some changes to the Proton version but beyond that even workshop mods are available.I am seriously impressed and can&#39;t imagine myself going back at all.If only Adobe would release their software in Linux, then, I could ditch MacOS too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My daily driver is Ubuntu 20.04, and I stopped dual booting with Windows back in December 2019, which up to that point had been the way I did all of my gaming.I haven&#39;t looked back since.Sure, there have been some games that haven&#39;t worked. Some of those just needed some tweaking, and for some I just waited a bit until Proton caught up. For the rest that still don&#39;t work, I am content with just shelving until such time that they work.I have been consistently surprised at what games actually work through Proton. For instance I played Titanfall 2 &amp; Battlefield 1 without any issues this year. On Linux.I probably spend around 200$ each year on video games, and this initiative by Valve will be the sole reason I will continue to do so (and not having to run a Windows instance in my home)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the article, some 20min into the reading:&#34;...The mere existence of a separate union for Black police officers rubs many in Little Rock the wrong way. White officers, some city officials, and many white residents see the Black union as unnecessary, a stubborn refusal to move beyond the city’s ugly racial history. Black officers said that sentiment reveals a misunderstanding of why the union exists: It isn’t to win special rights for Black officers, they said. It’s to demand they be treated equally.&#34;This passage should have been earlier in the report. Before, the report emanated a stench of trying too hard to find racism behind every rock.Instead, the reporter later describes a story of a bureaucractic racket - primarily driven by state powers and labor, to promote corruption &amp; nepotism, which has disproportionately impacted black officers."</p>

I&#39;ve read through his books on Doom and Wolfenstein and never would&#39;ve imagined he&#39;d start looking at sprites for Street Fighter II.This is really great stuff and I think important as &#34;developer archaeology&#34;. The 80s and 90s don&#39;t seem that long ago (to those of us who were around), but it&#39;s easy to forget people back then didn&#39;t have the sophisticated tools we have today. That said, people did have tools, so it&#39;s awesome to be able to get a glimpse into the workflow of folks back then."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I absolutely love learning about the clever tricks and their long-tail effects that came out of dealing with incredibly resource constrained computing environments and/or where some quirk of hardware ended up inspiring a lot of fabulous creative misuse.This is a fantastic article!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was one of the developers on this game in the 90s:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lubyi79e6SYIt was meant to be 100% 2D, and the programming and art went down that path for a few months before it was realized that there just wasn&#39;t enough RAM on PCs of the time to store all the possible sprites for the characters in every rotation.  The numbers get out of hand very quickly when you have four main characters, each of which can walk in 8 or 16 directions, can also run, walk up stairs, climb ladders, crawl, fire one of 20 different guns etc. The isometric backgrounds are all sheets of 2D tiles, laid out just like in Street Fighter and every other sprite based game.So, several months into development it was decided to change all the characters to 3D to save RAM. I switched the entire game over in two weeks, including creating all the tooling to convert from 3D Studio to.. whatever the fuck, because there were no rules in those days. When that game was started there were almost no 3D accelerators, and I don&#39;t remember if you needed specific SDK for them. I seem to remember our game couldn&#39;t use them, perhaps because of the way the 3D and 2D were composited in the frame, which was very unusual - most games were either 2D or 3D, not a combination.Are there any easter eggs hidden in the sprites for SFII? There were various ones in Abomination, mainly written in the graffiti around the cities.And then there are ones like this (TFT) that we can&#39;t talk about:

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The key to this solution isn’t really the .txt file or the formatting.It’s the ritual. Any productivity system can be made to work once it becomes a habit and therefore your default action.I think .txt files or Org mode are attractive to devs because they feel like something we’d be doing anyway during our day. the same system will work with a paper journal or even a fresh piece of paper every morning if, and only if, it can be integrated into your natural daily workflow as an automatic habit. I personally found that paper is better for me because I get to it before unlocking my computer and being confronted with work and communications and notifications that compete with it. However, I have a lot of peers who couldn’t hang on to a paper journal or TODO list during the day if they tried, so digital formats win.The real key is to make it a habit and learn to stick with it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve always kept a text file or spreadsheet of things to do, priorities, etc... My biggest problem isn&#39;t keeping a list and getting organized, it&#39;s remembering to look at my list. I tend to space out for days working on a problem and forget to look at my list.I&#39;ve experienced a big productivity boost by using the desktop background of my 43&#34; monitor as a whiteboard (blackboard actually). I have an jpg the size of my monitor that I jot things down on as text on the image. I can store meaningful small images the trigger my memory to do something. I&#39;ve become so used to visually thinking about what I&#39;m doing that I switched my text file todo list to markdown so I could store images in it.It&#39;s surprisingly quick to keep my large jpg open in paint and jot or paste things to it and then reset it as the desktop background. I learned later this is called a &#34;vision board&#34;Still, I&#39;m so bad at spacing out that I need more than looking at my vision board monitor all day, so I use the Windows system scheduler to bring up a daily, weekly and monthly html file that reminds me to do things."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used a plain text file for about 5-6 years before finding org-mode in 2009.  Of course, I technically still use a plain text file since that&#39;s what Org uses, just with some extra features that make organizing things specific to productivity easier.That said, I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d exclusively use a plain text file or even Org if I had to break my day down into as low as 15 minute chunks like this guy.  I find the text-based approach to work best for longer-term planning/strategizing and just keeping yourself from forgetting stuff over the course of days.  It also works better if you&#39;re already on your computer and using your text editor all day and/or SSH-ing into a box with the file.  If I need to remember to make it to 4 meetings today at very specific times, something that pushes notifications and upcoming meeting warnings might accommodate that better.I&#39;ve had meeting-heavy jobs, and split off the meeting management into Outlook (or similar) with good results.  Useful info that flows out of meetings can still go into your notes to be organized later though.  Then I make my GTD list &#34;task-centric&#34;, meaning that it focuses on getting discrete activities started and completed, with less focus on times/dates.  That requires some level of freedom to manage your own time though, so it&#39;s not for everyone."</p>

On my service we don&#39;t even have tools to do it and the security controls are very tight and getting tighter all the time.  It&#39;s a big fucking deal, if not the biggest fucking deal, besides KTLO.Posting to get ahead of some of the comment here on security posture."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Okay, opinions up front: I don&#39;t think this is worthy of &#34;declaring a security incident. Having some experience working behind the scenes, just because this policy was changes this way doesn&#39;t mean &#34;All AWS Support personnel had unrequited access to your S3 objects.&#34; To me, this reads as Twitter inflammatory nonsense. Here&#39;s why:* KMS Encrypted objects would not be accessible because the support personnel would need permission policies that grant `kms:decrypot` permissions to encrypted objects. The only way this could wind up happening is if you are granting the AWS Support principal access in the KMS Key Policy.* Objects with a default-deny bucket policy could not have been circumvented with the support team&#39;s escalated privilege. So if you have a policy that looks something like this, that data was not exposed:{  &#34;Action&#34;: &#34;Deny&#34;,

  &#34;NotPrincipal&#34;: [...]

}* Internal Checks. AWS has a lot of protections and checks in place to prevent their support personnel from accessing metadata about S3 objects. They don&#39;t have tools to fetch the actual objects unless your really high up the food-chain. Think like, people with a legal or security related reason to need to review data.Nevertheless, I&#39;ll share some nuggets of wisdom I&#39;ve accrued over the years, in a hopes to save y&#39;all some time:If you have an NDA with AWS, I&#39;d recommend reaching out to your TAM and asking them about what the potential exposure was; and make sure to ask about the internal access control mechanisms.But everyone who&#39;s concerned and DIDN&#39;T set up data access logging already: 1) Consider turning that on to trace potential disclosures in the future. 2) Open up a case with Premium Support under the CloudTrail, state that you have a security incident and you need to retrieve data events for the time of 2021-12-23 to 2021-12-22. If granted to you, save that sucker in S3 and query it for requests coming from `support.amazonaws.com` in Athena. [0]Hopefully this helps some of y&#39;all.[0] https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/analy..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Such concerns specifically led to my decision of only uploading sensitive data to S3 with client side encryption. Since the aws cli tool only supports server side encryption with keys stored on amazon servers (where the non-default managed keys cost like 1 USD per month), I decided to simply symmetrically encrypt the backup of my syncthing data volume with AES256 using gnupg and only then pushing it to the S3 bucket."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For five years, I ran a network of Twitter accounts promoting local tech events. They were (uncreatively) called the &#34;Tech Events Network&#34; and included ATXTechEvents, DENTechEvents, NYC_TechEvents, and 50+ others that would broadcast local meetups, even supporting basically unknown tech communities like Albuquerque with ABQTechEvents. All received massive traffic, engagement (RTs &amp; likes specifically), and became an active megaphone for their respective communities.. gaining almost 300k followers.More importantly, the meetups and events they tweeted saw attendance rise and more people know about them in general. It was great for everyone and I had hundreds of thank you tweets, emails, and DMs.But Twitter&#39;s repeated, bizarre, and unexplained API limitations hobbled the system more times than I can count. They&#39;d suddenly suspend one for &#34;API abuse&#34;, I&#39;d get it manually reviewed and they&#39;d release it.. only to have 10 suspended the next day. I even started asking followers to tag @TwitterSupport on our behalf and zero progress.After dozens of suspensions, I finally shut it all down. I haven&#39;t come up with a theory beyond Twitter hates tech communities but that feels off.."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A couple of months ago some colleagues and I submitted a very basic request practically begging Twitter for access to users’ follower/following graph on the new API. The use case was super-simple and obvious (allow people to import their followers into a new app) and didn’t involve any sort of data mining or spam or anything.It took days? weeks? to get a generic rejection message from a “no reply” email address. Meanwhile — much irony — A16Z can help apps like Clubhouse get super-access since they were also a huge investor in Twitter.All of this pro- and anti-web3 stuff is a sign that all of these inter-connected webs of egos in our industry are jostling for power in an ecosystem that doesn’t need them very much. Meanwhile, there are lots of people in other verticals who completely missed the boat on the web investment play who are beginning to realize this is their opportunity to jump in and scale their capital alongside the people on the ground. A major investor / operator shakeup is about to take place."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Fun fact about SpeedCrunch history, the software descends from an off-hand blog post by Roberto Alsina, a KDE developer, complaining about KCalc usability [1]. Back then developers were often just unthinkingly cloning &#39;skeuomorphic&#39; interfaces like Apple used back then, designing user interfaces that resembled physical objects instead of taking advantage of the opportunities afforded by computers.His blog post elicited several rapid responses from developers taking his PyQt-based mockup and turning it into a &#39;real&#39; application ([2], [3]). One of those was Ariya Hidayat&#39;s &#34;SpeedCrunch&#34;, which has been actively maintained up to the present day. I can&#39;t find Ariya&#39;s original 2004 announcement, I think the original link was http://ariya.pandu.org/blog/archives/2004/10/calculator-feve... but that&#39;s dead now.But it&#39;s really neat to see how this all started from a day or two of hacking on a solution to a simple problem.[1] https://ralsina.me/stories/33.html

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Have to say as a football fan, it&#39;s a scandal that they&#39;re running the world cup in Qatar. A winter world cup pushes the schedules way off what&#39;s normal and traditional. That is of course not the only concern, there&#39;s also stories about dozens of people dying building these stadiums in the desert heat.There&#39;s also a heck of a lot of stories about how Qatar was able to get the world cup in the first place. It seems that FIFA isn&#39;t exactly free of corruption, which is a shame because they&#39;re supposed to be in charge of the world&#39;s favourite sport. Of course there&#39;s no accountability in any way, who even knows who their national FA rep is? I guess that&#39;s one of the perks of running a sport with that much history, people will still feel compelled to watch.One thing that&#39;s positive is that ordinary people are not ignorant about this situation. You&#39;ll find in every FB post about this there&#39;s a load of voices expressing what I&#39;ve just expressed. So whatever the Qataris think they&#39;re buying with this massive outlay, they&#39;re not getting it.On the sporting side it appears they&#39;re making a decent effort of building a home grown team that isn&#39;t going to totally embarrass them, which is quite the challenge."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The tendency by FIFA and especially UEFA to prioritize money for its partners and for its officials above principles and sport has turned me away from organized football. I find it repugnant that when BBC and The Guardian (among others) reported back in 2013 on Qatar’s labor conditions in sweltering heat, the deaths, and what is essentially slavery to build stadiums, it was met by the football community and larger news media with a resounding thud. It wasn’t until the last few years that footballers who had nothing to lose started to speak their minds. It’s honestly disgusting to me to the point where I don’t know when I’ll ever want to watch the World Cup or Champion’s League again.I used to get excited by these events because the sport still seemed to be prioritized and people got genuinely excited by seeing talent rise to the level. I came of age hearing just how good Messi would become after his early appearance for Argentina in 2006 I think. His rise has witnessed the transition to players representing teams and entire brands. It hardly feels like sport but lifestyle, prestige, and entertainment, something Qatar is desperately trying to purchase as their oil money starts to dry up.https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-europe-24394971Maybe there was earlier reporting on this but this was the best I could do on my phone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;In August, Amnesty released a report that documented that at least 15 000 migrant workers had died since Qatar was awarded the World Cup hosting rights in 2010.&#34;If these figures are true, then no matter how &#39;successful&#39; the World Cup 2022 turns out, it will always be tainted by these shameful figures."</p>

This is affecting availability and connectivity to EC2 instances that are part of the affected data center within the affected Availability Zone. We are also experiencing elevated RunInstance API error rates for launches within the affected Availability Zone. Connectivity and power to other data centers within the affected Availability Zone, or other Availability Zones within the US-EAST-1 Region are not affected by this issue, but we would recommend failing away from the affected Availability Zone (USE1-AZ4) if you are able to do so.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve built out many 42U racks in DC&#39;s in my time and there were a couple of rules that we never skipped:1. Dual power in each server/device - One PSU was powered by one outlet, the other PSU by a different one with a different source meaning that we can lose a single power supply/circuit and nothing happens
2. Dual network (at minimum) - For the same reasons as above since the switches didn&#39;t always have dual power in them.I&#39;ve only had a DC fail once when the engineer was performing work on the power circuitry for the DC and thought he was taking down one, but was in fact the wrong one and took both power circuits down at the same time.However, a power cut (in the traditional sense where the supplier has a failure so nothing comes in over the wire) should have literally zero effect!What am I missing?I&#39;ve never worked anywhere with Amazon&#39;s budget so why are they not handling this? Is it more than just the imcoming supply being down?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Every time a major cloud provider has an outage, Infra people and execs cry foul and say we need to move to &lt;the other one&gt;. But does anyone really have an objective measure of how clouds stack up reliability-wise? I doubt it, since outages and their effects are nuanced. The other move is that they want to go multi-cloud... But I’ve been involved in enough multi-cloud initiatives to know how much time and effort those soak up, not to mention the overhead costs of maintaining two sets of infra sub-optimally. I would say that for most businesses, these costs far exceed that occasional six-hour-long outage."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As an immigrant I can tell you that the USA is basically Jurassic Park. The monsters are mostly predatory companies. It can be a lot of fun but it’s very easy to do worse than die - to end up a slave for the rest of your life to one of the predators. Along with bullshit like making options trading available to kids, debt is probably one of the velociraptors.It is a trap sprung at the very start of your adult life when you’re most vulnerable, as a student loan.It’s sprung when you’ve lost your job, are vulnerable and are about to become homeless.It’s sprung when you’re already in debt and vulnerable, by other lenders.Anyone see a pattern here? Debt preys on the vulnerable, turns them into something that delivers returns for decades to the holders, and wraps all that up into tidy looking financial products.The business of debt is the financial equivalent of the US pork industry: Everyone treats it as part of American life, but the details would make most people throw up.Anyone remember microfinance? That was the same play: usury with a fresh coat of paint.I’m seeing posts here making it sound like 36% APR is acceptable. Look up usury folks. This is it. Debt that is intentionally structured so that it can never be repaid and keeps the borrower harnessed to the cart.It’s incredible how folks, particularly in the US, have become this morally uncalibrated."</p>

As alleged in the complaint, in reality, as tens of thousands of LendUp’s customers climbed the “LendUp Ladder,” they failed to qualify for larger loan amounts and continued to be offered similar or higher interest rates compared to previous loans.While the initial founding direction seems well intentioned, it sounds like they were scamming customers, or unable to actually follow-through on the promise to consumers.  Glad the regulators are actually enforcing some of the rules."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; LendUp has been subject to multiple enforcement actions by the CFPB. In addition to ordering LendUp in 2016 to stop misrepresenting the benefits of borrowing from the company, the CFPB sued LendUp in 2020 for allegedly violating the Military Lending Act and obtained a judgment against LendUp in that action. In September 2021, the CFPB filed this third action alleging that LendUp:So YC funded a payday lender that targeted active duty military service members?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"GUI algorithms like these are not well documented anywhere (except, of course, all over the web and in source code! :-) ...Would be nice to have a site, maybe a wiki, dedicated to this kind of thing.Other interesting problems in this area:* Layout algorithms* Automatic assignment of keys for navigation (for nav w/o

								<p class="story__comment_others">"In cases when the boxes overlap, there are ways to choose an arrow which will not cross the boxes. But this is prevented by the constraint that the starting and ending points must be on the midpoint of a box edge. If the midpoint of the a given edge is occluded by a box, or occludes a box, then that edge is not considered, even though it is partially visible and has a viable point for the arrow.E.g. if we could start an arrow in the middle of the small protruding &#34;ledge&#34; of the bottom box, we could do this:    ,-------.
   :         :
   :         v
   : +----------------+
   : |                |
  +----------------+  |
  |                |--+
  |                |
  +----------------+

It&#39;s not written in stone that box-and-arrow diagrams must be connected by edge midpoints. That can&#39;t even work well any time you have multiple arrows emanating or terminating on the same edge.Very good first iteration round, though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I enjoyed reading this because it reminded me of a moment of hubris as junior developer. I was working with a complicated data structure I wanted to visualize, so I decided to write some quick code to basically read the data structure and output a graph as rectangles and lines connecting them.I was chastened by the complexity of just drawing the lines between boxes so that they didn&#39;t overlap (as much as possible) and were drawn on facing sides (one of the later problems discussed in the article). I don&#39;t recall how I did it, but I do remember a sudden refresher on matrix multiplication.It drove home how simple things can be more complicated than you might expect.EDIT: also, I appreciated the way the article was written. No cruft."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; So I reach out to the manager and ask what is going on. This is a simple task, I said. Why does it take an entire quarter for your team to deliver? He doesn&#39;t have an answer.Your simple task, which you think would only take a few days to implement, is probably one request in a long queue of requests that team is dealing with. That means they won&#39;t be able to start on it for a long time.That team probably set up the onerous Google Docs process to gate requests because they get so many!When they do start working on your request, maybe it will only take a few days -- or maybe you underestimate the level of effort required because you are new to the company and you don&#39;t understand the complexity of the systems you are dealing with.Take this as a learning experience: don&#39;t assume that you are at a startup where people will drop everything to handle a request from you right away. Instead, assume that people are dealing with a lot of other requests, from a lot of other people. Learn how the system works, and learn how to be effective within that system.I know for sure that it&#39;s possible to be highly productive at a large company with a lot of bureaucracy -- but I also know for sure that new employees who try to bypass process and question the priorities of other teams, before they learn the ropes and build credibility and trust with other people, do not succeed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Is this how it&#39;s like at all large companies?Not all, but a lot.&gt;What should I do?Short term: Mentally check out.  Embrace the Zen of just doing what&#39;s asked of you. It&#39;s not your job to be a go-getter anymore.  Half because of institutional complexity/inertia, and half because in a tall organization hierarchy the middle managers don&#39;t want anyone below them swimming outside their lane (even if it would be to their unit&#39;s benefit and they can take every ounce of credit).You&#39;ll notice that many people in this thread explaining why you shouldn&#39;t expect this or that from other teams.  And they&#39;re not wrong, but none of them are acknowledging or explaining why those reasons weren&#39;t automatically communicated in your conversation with those teams.  You&#39;re not only not seen as a problem solver anymore, you&#39;re also too low on the totem pole to be owed an explanation.So follow the official processes to adapt their system to your product, and your product to their system.  Keep your management in the loop about the time cost of both options, it&#39;s their problem to fix, not yours. Pour your mental energy into something outside work.Long term: Decide if you like being checked out or want a new job."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of people have talked about the issues with this post, but I wanted to call out one specific thing:    The first engineer I talk to doesn&#39;t even attempt to answer my question but redirects me to their manager. Ok, that&#39;s odd, I think, but whatever.

This is definitely not odd. The whole point of managers is that they&#39;re there to protect their engineers from getting off track with every random request that comes up. I understand that it may feel bureaucratic, but as an engineer, someone who insists on talking to me directly without going through my manager is always going to mark themselves as someone who doesn&#39;t respect my time and doesn&#39;t understand that they&#39;re not the center of my universe.This feels like a rant of someone who isn&#39;t willing to put themselves in the shoes of the other team and understand the real complexity of deploying and maintaining large infrastructure systems over long periods of time. Any &#34;small option&#34; that the deploy team adds today is most likely going to be an option that they&#39;re still maintaining 5, 10 years down the line. As the saying goes—&#34;an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure&#34;. In the best case, taking a few days to get the requirements right up front is (hopefully!) going to save months and months of cumulative man-hours down the road for maintaining the system later, or making future changes. In your case, if I understand right, your work got approved within *two days*—hardly an onerous wait time.I&#39;ll admit that the &#34;for compliance reasons, you can&#39;t see our codebase&#34; thing is kind of odd, and it would strike me as a bit of a red flag, but I&#39;ll also admit that, personally, if I was in that manager&#39;s shoes, I wouldn&#39;t want you anywhere near my codebase either. Just purely based on the way that you treat other engineers&#39; time as worthless &amp; fail to consider the possibility that the business has broader priorities that extend outside of your own personal tasks."</p>

I&#39;m also in a much better place emotionally, if you&#39;re staring at your phone constantly waiting for box to message you, that&#39;s not good for your mind. Your mind. It makes everything 10 times of stressful, for fraction of the benefit.When I actually meet someone, It was always someone who is in their mid-20s to 30s without a job.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"IMO, if your market share is bigger than ${some number}, you shouldn&#39;t be able to deny service without a documented reason, it should have some sort of time-to-live (i.e 1 year), and there should be an appeals process.  In a functioning marketplace, companies would be naturally incentivized to care about customers but that stops working in uncompetitive industries (which currently describes most of the economy)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Co-Founder and CEO here. We started Codecademy and launched on HN 10 years ago. I&#39;m so thankful to this community for helping us to get started and to see up the momentum! We&#39;re committed to making sure that the product stays as great as the one you&#39;ve used for years (and gets even better!)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"First time I ever programmed was using Codecademy around 2013.I was always an average student in school. Never had the motivation/curiosity to study since I felt it was all pointless.  Never had any programming/computer classes in school.I completed the python course that was available at the time that eventually guides you to build your own version of battleship with 2 players. It was an eye-opening experience for me.I started to view all my math/chemistry/physics problems as “programming problems”, it really made learning fun for me. My grades changed drastically for the better with little extra effort. And more importantly Im now working as a SWE years later.So thank you Codecademy :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I learned the very basics to become a developer from Codeacademy. Back in 2015 I was a front line support technician at a small hardware startup who did Codeacademy in my free time, which was considerable. My first daughter had just been born and that really gave me motivation to learn and achieve my full potential. My boss was the only software engineer at our company and so was often overloaded with work, so he gave me small tasks to do, starting with learning regular expressions to massage a few thousand lines of data into something useful, and then getting to make PHP edits to Wordpress, and even some Visual C++.I more than doubled my income from that job to my next job, propelling me to the middle class, and have since achieved consistently high pay raises over the last seven years without much difficulty.As someone who dropped out of high school due to family issues and lack of motivation, I hope free resources like Codeacademy always exists on the internet and will be a pathway for those who have the aptitude to learn to code. For my personally it totally transformed my life as I was basically destitute before I got my first job as a web developer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Surprisingly I found myself not preferring the OS 9 versions nearly as much as I thought. I have always thought of the OS 9 UI and the late &#39;90s to early 2000s as representing the peak of OS UI design before everything went skeuomorphic, but a lot of the general aesthetic of that time just doesn&#39;t seem to have aged that well.  I still miss the crisp lines and clear affordances of actual buttons and other elements of that time, but there was also a LOT of visual clutter that we no longer need. There&#39;s much to say about modern design fads, but we have also come a long way.The author has certainly done a great job of capturing the zeitgeist of the era (the garish bevels on the Spotify app are spot on!), but I would love to see how the OS 9 UI would hold up in modern times, on a retina screen with more than 256 colours, modern anti-aliased typography and much more screen real estate."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"incredible work (really) but this is obviously not a realistic user experience: I can tell what&#39;s clickable on the screen easily and things are generally too consistent and simply make too much senseI mean, neat concept, but really lacking in the user hostility that today&#39;s users demand"</p>

The level of press coverage was off the scale compared to what Teams got for far worse issues.The vulnerabilities werent nothing but they werent even in the same ballpark as the MS teams vulnerabilities foisted on us for &#34;security reasons&#34; like this howler they tried to cover up https://www.techradar.com/news/microsoft-may-have-downplayed..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I work with several large organisations, all using Teams.In every instance, the previous solution (Slack/Zoom/Discord) was replaced by Teams following higher management making the switch for reasons like &#34;it&#39;s included in Office 365&#34; or a new hire influencing the migration to Microsoft solutions.In every instance, the application was/is not well received by the employees - it&#39;s slow, buggy, crazy complicated and generally doesn&#39;t feel &#34;right&#34;.Microsoft is good at channeling security topics for their PR, but at the end of the day they make software, just like everybody else (and this software is subject to bugs, just like everybody else).It&#39;s really disappointing that the vulnerabilities have not yet been addressed..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One in this temperament: try accidently pasting a very large amount of data in the chatbox in Teams. Then spend the next 40 minutes re-starting Teams to try to remove the data from said box while your laptop tries to fly away and Teams keeps many processors and gigs of memory lit trying to parse your data.Microsoft should (but won&#39;t) reconsider the idea that one chatbox to rule many underlying types of software is a good idea."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s definitely a great time to build websites, but saying they _NEVER_ have been easier to make... I&#39;m not 100% sure about that.Yes, tailwind might make css a lot easier, and github copilot might make coding a lot faster... but is this really easier than in the early 90ies, when you could just type &lt;html&gt; into notepad and make a website that didn&#39;t require any CSS or images or JS or even more than just the most basic html tags?When it comes to reading a blog or article or consuming any other form of textual information on the internet - I find myself increasingly enamored with &#34;Reader View&#34; in Firefox, which basically ditches all the crap, and displays the web-page in a default-style, as if it was just the most basic html - just like that we did write in 90ies.Of course this doesn&#39;t hold true for any webApps that do more than just present textual information (and the occasional image) - but why do project like ViewPure exist? There seems to be at least some demand for getting rid of all the clutter.Is tailwind really easier to work with something like - let&#39;s say - pico.css? Of course if you want to do super-elaborate layouts, then probably yes - but if you embraced a more minimalist approach?Isn&#39;t Hacker News itself a really great example of a website that successfully uses only very basic html with very, very little styling and fancy extra features?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m also developing for 25 years, I also really really like websites and coding, but not for the reasons the OP sums up. For me, it&#39;s not about all kinds of solved or unsolved technical questions.Today is a very good time to build websites, because a good website is the only way to push back to Big Tech and it&#39;s practices. Your website can be build on techniques invented in a time where the dream of the internet was not yet shattered by Big Tech.Of course you can choose to put your website on AWS and svck on the bolls of Jeff a little. But you don&#39;t have to! And that&#39;s what all kinds of young devs just miss.Oh, and RSS is not dead. Not at all (thanks WordPress, for putting a feed on every instance). RSS is the only workable way to make the web social again."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not trying to defend TP-Link or anything, but I recently bought a pair of mesh router from them and they work very well.BTW, this hidden network probably uses another protocol (for the OneMesh). It is the 802.11s (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11s), that uses its own encryption method based on Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE) (yeah, that is the same as WPA3, however it came before it). It shows as hidden network on Wi-Fi Analyzer, but the network is not actually hidden in the same sense of a hidden Wi-Fi network: this simple happens because 802.11s has no concept of SSID.The authentication of new devices happens when you pair a new router using the application available on Android/iOS (it has a web interface too but AFAIK it doesn&#39;t allow adding new mesh routers to the network). So it seems pretty secure for me, at least sans some security bugs that I am sure that the device should have. Doesn&#39;t bother me too much considering that most bugs that I saw on those consumer routers generally comes from the security from things like administration pages and not the Wi-Fi network itself (unless it is something like KRACK that affects all devices implementing the protocol).Yeah, it is still pretty sh*t that they enable this by default, but if the router from the author of blog post is from one of their lines of mesh routers I do think this is kinda of made by purpose, because using multiple routers devices is kinda of the idea of a mesh network."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This type of whackery is (the primary reason) why I try to buy computing devices on which I can flash a clean OS (OpenWrt/DD-WRT for routers)[1]. It sucks because it limits my choices down to a few, but at the same time I feel like I don&#39;t throw out money at abandonware.[1] don&#39;t even get me started on TP-Link releasing routers with the same name but v2/v3/2020/2021 update where it&#39;s hard to even know if I&#39;m buying the one that supports the custom OS flash."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those curious about the &#34;Wi-Fi spam&#34; comment: even though nothing is connected to the network and it&#39;s a hidden SSID, it still has to broadcast beacons every 100ms. The 802.11 standard says beacons must be sent at the lowest rate the AP supports, so your ~350 byte beacon at 1mbps (2.4 GHz) uses around 5% of the frequency. It doesn&#39;t take many SSIDs on the same 2.4 GHz channel to make the throughput fall through the floor. Beacon spam is one of the reasons why 2.4 GHz is practically unusable in dense environments these days.Thankfully for 5 GHz this isn&#39;t as bad since the lowest rate is 6mbps and the signal penetrates less. Some routers have the option to disable 802.11b which raises the minimum 2.4 GHz beacon to 6mbps as well, but unless everyone does this it won&#39;t make much difference."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This may be unpopular, but after using Kodi and similar software for many years (and enjoying it!), I just gravitated back to the basics. Want to watch a movie? Navigate to it in my file manager and play it with VLC. Music? Just use Winamp 2 or Audacious. I realized I was messing with odd HDMI passthrough issues, database issues, audio sync, broken plugins, stressing about tagging, etc etc every movie night much more than just enjoying my media. My friend (Plex and Kodi user) had the same issues, we&#39;d usually spend an entire beer at the start of the evening troubleshooting things. The most lasting thing from those days was setting up a proper NAS, first to house my media, then everything else.The main thing I miss is wireless controller support, but KDE Connect on my phone has completely obviated that. It even integrates with streaming sites, youtube, VLC, Audacious, almost everything that exposes a media API. So I can sit on my couch or walk around and control my KDE machine with minimal effort. My PC audio playback even pauses when I get a phone call. If I need more control I can use my phone&#39;s screen as a touchpad mouse. You can&#39;t easily remotely compose playlists with this setup but I usually listen album by album or on global shuffle, and that&#39;s good enough for me.Am I just old school? What are people&#39;s favorite &#34;killer apps&#34; for software like Kodi? Is it just convenience and I&#39;ve have had bad luck?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I honestly can&#39;t keep track anymore. I&#39;ve used plex for a number of years and it&#39;s &#34;fine&#34; but they keep spending time developing things I don&#39;t want and ignoring things the community would like in an effort to &#34;go commercial&#34; and &#34;legitimatize&#34;.I want a media center that can do these things:- access from phone or tablet: remote is nice to have, but on my own network is a must- can chromecast everything- can scrape metadata reliably (I don&#39;t mind fixing a few things here and there)- supports movies, tv shows, random videos- automatic subtitle downloading- supports music formats, podcasts, and audio books and understands they are different things, and can grab them as needed- supports not only mp3s, oggs, etc. for music, but supports stuff their underlying media libraries already support like amiga mod, chiptune formats etc. (a major gripe of mine with plex). right now I need to convert to mp3 for this need, but the media libraries plex uses already supports these formats, it&#39;s just the damn gui and library indexing bits don&#39;t- support for photo libraries- ebooks, pdfs, cbz, cbr, etc. (I need extra apps for this)- emulator support would be a super sweet stretch goal- has smart tv apps would be also great, but chromecast support is fineDoes Kodi, emby, jellyfin, whatever support all this?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Kodi is the perfect example of how amateurs (in the good sense of the word) can make something long-lasting and provide an alternative that is better than whatever the &#34;industry&#34; wants to shove down our throats."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So why does Europe have such hard time popping new software ventures like the US? Is it market fragmentation? Languages? Is it capital allocation related problems?I feel that the ability to bootstrap projects in all the large EU countries is way harder than the US, or smaller euro ones (like the Netherlands or Estonia).In Spain for example, the cost of something similar of an LLC is way higher than in the US, not to mention that you have to pay almost 400€/month (at minimum) just for owning the company as Social Security fee, even if I&#39;m also working for someone else paying my social security through my salary.It&#39;s a huge burden if you&#39;re in my situation, which is having an average salary, not a lot of savings and you don&#39;t have a family that bails you out.Also, this listing lacks a few more that I listed here: https://iagovar.com/mapas/european-web-hosting-alternatives"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why does the US dominate digital products?1. Enormous internal market2. Extremely wealthy3. Well-developed capital markets for investmentSo it&#39;s an enormous, wealthy country where there is lots of investment. Obviously there are other factors but these seem blindingly obvious as starting points.I find the UK&#39;s inability to compete with the US web giants depressing. I don&#39;t like the idea of relying on a few American companies for search, cloud infra and so on. I&#39;d love to see us build a British Google for example. I don&#39;t like the guy at all, but I agree with Dominic Cummings that we should focus our efforts on something like this.I&#39;m not arguing for web service nationalism but, for economic and security reasons, way more nation states should be looking to encourage the building of their own web backbone companies. It would also be good for general Internet resiliency to not have so few companies and single points of failure."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not sure if it&#39;s listed or not but one I&#39;m pretty happy with is smallPDF based in Switzerland. 
https://smallpdf.com/I got pissed off when I wanted to rotate a PDF 90 degrees on my dad&#39;s computer and adobe wanted to charge for it, then I found that smallPDF could do that and a whole lot more like edits and signature collections. I ended up subscribing him but the free tier already does several things that adobe would charge you for so I encourage anyone to use this service."</p>

We also host regular meetups (and have hosted summits and a camp) related to the Decentralized Web.

Because of exactly things like this they prevent UWP apps from connecting to localhost by default and make it very annoying to circumvent and from my experience, the circumvention is not exactly a stable setup. So they really don&#39;t want you to do that, and somebody thought enough to make it extra difficult. So, they have UWP, all those well thought-out policies, then make an editor ecosystem out of web technology and throw everything out of the window. No surprise from a $T company with more teams than countries on Earth that not everything is coordinated, but they should have a guy with the required knowledge and sensibilities on any major product team. Apps installed from their &#34;store&#34; are relatively safe, but then they put a (extension) store inside their app again, which is unsafe :/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m all for this if the person reviewing my code will know the context, history and all the details and conversations we had as a team. 
But in order for that to work, I&#39;d probably be taking most of this reviewer&#39;s time. And obviously in order for them to get up to speed with our practices, conventions, architecture, code style and whatnot, they&#39;d probably need to start by doing a whole lot of development on our project first. At least several months. They could probably not do anyone elses code review then. So we&#39;d have to pay them... one full time salary to be this coder-and-reviewer type person. I wonder what this service should be called.I think I might be onto something here. &#34;Full time developers as a service&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This entirely misses the point of code review.Say it with me: Code review is a knowledge transfer exercise.Finding bugs, security vulnerabilities, and keeping the code maintainable are merely side effects that we appreciate along the way.The primary purpose of code review is increasing the bus factor of the given piece of code and facilitating organic knowledge transfer. That&#39;s it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Having on-demand engineers look at code, without broader context on the project it is in my view the same as something that can be automated either or both via static analysis and custom ci/cd workflow checks. This can probably makes sense on a project with more junior engineers where many basic improvements can be supposedly suggested without needing broader context? I would be keen on hearing the use case"</p>

And welcome Isaac, I loved his Zig+Wayland screencast [1], where he explained very engagingly how Zig is able to embrace and extend a pretty hairy C library and make it more memory safe, without forcing the implementor to rewrite or painfully try to bend it to the strict or idiosyncratic rules of the language, as it may happen with Rust or even Go.I can&#39;t wait for 1.0!

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting how the three separate R/G/B images are taken independently a few ~seconds~ milliseconds apart, with a different color filter placed over the image sensor.I assume this is to maximize resolution, since no Bayer interpolation [0] is needed to  demosaic the output of a traditional image sensor that integrates the color filters onto the sensor pixels themselves. As these satellites are not intended to photograph things in motion, the color channel alignment artifacts seen here are a rare, small price to pay for vastly improved resolution and absence of demosaicing artifacts.[0] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_filter"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m impressed more by the comments than the article itself. Some people insist they make progress and listen 3x, but nobody showed any practical measurements of own skills.A personal example: I used to listen to a famous linguist, and everything seemed nice and clear, but then I decided to go in details on one particular question (I think accentuantion), and opened his book. It was like if you showed your programming code to a farmer: incomprehensible stream of linguistic terms. My complacency was shattered in 1 minute.There&#39;s some scientific evidence as well:1. Lectures are proved to be a bad way to learn things. https://www.science.org/content/article/lectures-arent-just-...2. A nice experiment showing that if you enjoy a lesson, it usually means you make no progress, meanwhile hard practice actually does make you progress: https://www.pnas.org/content/116/39/19251I suppose, those who insist they learn something, do make progress at memorizing trivia, but not at practical skills or any systematic understanding.This kind of knowledge feels firm only until it&#39;s tested by practical task or by serious questioning."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I get the point you&#39;re making - but honestly I have to raise the counter argument, which I think is equally valid. Take for example, the average lecture video. The information density is so low, that I&#39;d imagine that a 60 minute video could be compressed into 10-12 minutes without any loss of information. It really depends on what you&#39;re listening to/watching."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The few podcasts I listen to, I do so in 0.2x speed or even less. Not by slowing the playback speed, obviously, but by pausing and rewinding very often to think about what has been said and even take notes if I find something that resonates with me.Most podcasts though I listen to at infinite speed, meaning I don&#39;t listen to them at all. You can go through them 2-3x speed because there&#39;s really nothing there.It&#39;s like code: if it&#39;s boilerplate you can just skim it but if it&#39;s really doing something you have to read it slowly multiple times. And just like the saying: nothing of value is easily gained.If you find yourself speeding though things - in general, not just podcasts - I would ask myself if they&#39;re worth doing at all."</p>

Also how on earth is Postman a $5.6 billion dollar company - I am super curious to see how much money Postman actually makes from enterprise sales - it must be a lot from the looks of that valuation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My family used to do this all the time when we were kids. We&#39;d go along the ditches on the side of the road and make a family outing of it on weekends. At the beach my brother and I would drag big plastic garbage bags around and collect as much as we could from people who were happy to help some kids out and also happy to be rid of the bottles and cans. You could make some decent coin at it, but that was also in the 80s when 5c a can and 10-20c a bottle was worth something.It gets into your bones. Even today with 25 years software dev experience under my belt, I still feel the twitch whenever I see a discarded bottle or can."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have not thought about collecting cans in a very long time. Decades ago you could make a decent bit of cash collecting aluminum cans. It was a common past time for poor people and undoubtedly contributed to the very high recycle rate for aluminum since it was a source of income for many people. This was widely known, so people would often go out of their way to make their aluminum trash easily available to be collected. It was kind of low-key charity of sorts.At some point this just kind of dried up. I suspect it coincided with municipalities selling the rights to collect recyclables to waste management companies."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here is a story of a man who collected cans and bottles for cash and invested the money he got in the stock market, he died a millionaire.&#34;Curt Degerman, known to many as &#34;Tin Can Curt,&#34; Degerman spent nearly 30 years roaming the streets of Skelleftea in northern Sweden collecting tin cans and bottles for cash. Those who passed him by simply assumed he was another ordinary street bum.But to the surpise of many, when Degerman died in 2008, he left more than $1.4 million to his cousin. In between collecting cans, Degerman spent a lot of time in his local library reading business papers and studying the stock market. &#34;He knew stocks inside and out,&#34; said his cousin.By immersing himself in an education of thrift and smart investing, Degerman used his tin-can earnings to purchase mutual funds. He bought 124 gold bars and also expanded his cash with a savings account. By riding a bicycle and not having a mortgage on his house, his savings were made even easier.But in 2008, Degerman died of a heart attack, leaving his entire estate to a cousin who had visited him regularly during his last days. He died a millionaire.&#34;Sources:https://www.nydailynews.com/news/money/tin-collector-dies-mi...https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-WHB-2895https://archive.md/kB5F4"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am not sure how relevant this is, but I recently published a proof a concept library  that converts SVG documents into simulated machines. See the link below.https://www.getlazarus.org/videos/physics/blueprint/The rendering in my library relies upon OpenGL and the NanoVG library. My library is called Tiny Sim. All of these nano tiny and vg names seem to be colliding adding a bit of confusion in my opinion."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are many other popular vector graphics formats beyond those mentioned here. Lottie has already displaced SVG for animation/motion graphics, and for static content IconVG exists and is backed by Google. There&#39;s also PDF, PostScript, Flash, the glyf format in OpenType, etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A small nitpick as the resvg author: the repo located here https://github.com/RazrFalcon/resvg I&#39;m not sure why the author linked some random, outdated fork. If you&#39;re trying to beat SVG, you should have done a better research.But yes, SVG is extremely bloated and under-documented. Especially SVG 2. The core resvg codebase is close to 20 KLOC, while the whole package is like 50 KLOC.On the other hand, resvg is an exception, because it doesn&#39;t rely on any system and/or 3rd party libraries. 95% of the code in the final binary was written by one person (me). Not because it was strictly required, but because it was fun. resvg is basically an epitome of RIIR."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I used to think exa was a good ls replacement, but I found out that it&#39;s significantly slower than ls[0]. Heck, it&#39;s even slower than lf[1]. Quite frankly I didn&#39;t know what to think, but I removed the alias ls=exa.0: https://asciinema.org/a/454216 vs https://asciinema.org/a/4542171: https://asciinema.org/a/454213"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Non-positive opinion ahead.Personally I can’t find a use for it. Colors are so vast that I can’t figure out which means what (and they rarely play nice with a custom bg color). And then, all I have to know is whether a file is “-&gt;”, “*”, “/“ or “”. Tree+git view could be useful, if not node_modules, .git and other tree spammers. Of course there is an option to ignore, but then my .bashrc grows again while all I need in a project dir is covered by git status -s (yes I can read these capital letters since svn).It is modern in a sense of presentation, and I see how it may appeal to someone, but not in a sense of ls being old or something. It feels to me like a strange tool that does everything but nothing specifically, as if someone always wanted a nice gui file explorer, but had no courage to admit this “lameness”.Why spend your time squinting at black and white text?*I usually spend time on colored output trying to read blue/lightgreen/etc on #444, and because my b/w tools are separated by colored PS1, which emphasizes important* things like hostname, user, cwd, exitcode and puts a newline so that each command is lined up and ends with an additional \n. File being a green file or a blue dir is not as important as me patching a wrong instance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I always find pitches like this a little obnoxious:&gt; You list files hundreds of times a day. Why spend your time squinting at black and white text?Uh, `ls` has colors, if you know how or some benevolent distro-maintainer did.Now there&#39;s a ton of value in sane defaults and cutting out cruft and targeting specific use-cases, so not here to criticize the tool, at all. Just the marketing. Why not talk about what&#39;s actually special and different about it?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is news just because it&#39;s an Apple device being used for something that was already trivially possible.GPS trackers designed to be magnet-attached to a car which report their location via cell signal cost ~$20 on Amazon. You then tend to need to pay for either a SIM card or a subscription to the device maker&#39;s service 
-- bringing you up to about the cost of an AirTag. These are much harder to detect, as you might imagine.The Apple device does try to make itself less useful for abusive purposes. Nearby iPhones will notify you if there&#39;s an AirTag following you. Apple released an Android app to scan for them (manually -- it&#39;d probably be nice if they released something that did the same passive scanning as iPhones get, but there&#39;s battery trade-offs there, and obviously most people won&#39;t have that app). AirTags will also beep if they&#39;re separated from their owner.In fact, this is news we&#39;re hearing about because of the steps Apple took to make it harder to use these devices for bad purposes. The tweet author got a warning about the device following them.It&#39;s tricky to make something that lets you find where you dropped your keys while walking the dog that can&#39;t also be used for nefarious purposes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While it’s theoretically possible that this happened, I think this particular story was made up. For a number of reasons: 1) How did the stalker know that that’s her car? She said she was on a night out. Unless she went back to her car all the time, he must have seen her arrive in it. 2) Sticking an AirTag to the inside of the front wheel well isn’t easy. There is dirt and grime there and the surfaces aren’t flat. The stalker would have had to use a very strong adhesive to make the AirTag stick while the car was moving. 3) While it’d be a smart idea to not drive home while a foreign AirTag tracks you, who is alert enough after a night out AND happens to have friends in the vicinity that you can wake up at what must have been a very late hour? 4) Her friend who found and removed the AirTag took no photo. Really?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The interesting thing is that I have seen multiple reports of this ( think this is is the third), but in every case, they have destroyed it, lost it, or thrown it away before hand - not given it to the police.Apple can&#39;t tell who the devices is from signals in the wild, but they can figure out who it is if someone gives them the physical device. (Apple tracks the serial number of the device, and from what I understand, can provide purchaser/activator information based on the serial number)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Background: I&#39;m a qualified accountant, and have taught courses on accounting and finance.My thoughts on OP:I read through the first two parts of the first course on this site:- Part 1 Introduction to Accounting Basics, A Story for Relating to Accounting Basics- Part 2 Income StatementBased on what I read, I could not recommend this. You could get to the end of the &#39;income statement&#39; part, without encountering any definition of &#39;profit&#39;, which is the very thing that the income statement is meant to show.If you want a solid introduction to accounting, I&#39;d recommend Frank Wood&#39;s book &#34;Business Accounting 1&#34;. You don&#39;t need the latest (15th edition). The principles haven&#39;t changed. I used the 10th edition: Business Accounting Volume 1 https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0273681494/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a software engineer who moved into freelance consulting a few years ago (I do back-ends and front-ends for mobile and web, nothing finance specific other than occasional credit card payment integrations). It&#39;s been a roller-coaster in many regards and one of the highlights is having learned a lot about bookkeeping, taxes, financial planning and everything that comes with running a small business in general. (Aspects which I initially despised but now I&#39;ve accepted as necessary and doing them as routine.)During these years I started playing with the idea of training myself in basic/intermediate accounting and/or finance. The motivation is twofold: run my own business better (and maybe stop paying an accountant to do my taxes) and maybe work on software projects in finance (where I suspect there is good money to be made).I&#39;d be interested hearing stories from fellow software engineers who did similar training!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are other online resources to learn accounting. A lot of them are listed on https://hledger.org/accounting.html#accounting-links .https://www.dwmbeancounter.com/ is often mentioned on similar threads. People also like to link to beancount&#39;s manual http://furius.ca/beancount/doc/double-entry .But I agree with mindslight&#39;s comment. They all kinda suck. Reading an actual textbook like the top comment suggested is probably better."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am Lithuanian; Lithuania&lt;-&gt;Taiwan&lt;-&gt;PRC conflict is frequently a topic of discussion these days among my peers.My position, shared by a few others, is that this is the next best thing that happened in Lithuania after leaving USSR: the first being joining NATO and EU in 2004.Everyone in the world can (and almost everyone do) endorse PRC. &#34;You won&#39;t get fired for picking IBM/Oracle/PRC&#34;. While very few countries have the guts and the internal political structure that allows opening a Taiwanese representative office. Lithuania shows that it prefers dealing with a country that takes the human rights into account; being the first one &#34;in the party&#34; to do so bring us significant advantages. Both Taiwanese investments and Lithuanian exports to Taiwan are picking up pace.This will hurt us in the short-term, sure. It already does: packages(/containers) from PRC are delayed or cancelled, invoices are not being paid, we are losing business there. In the long term, if we don&#39;t change our mind (not impossible), I think this is for the better."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A Lithuanian hereMoral questions aside (as everyone here seems to focus on it), the people are split into roughly three camps: 
- Anti-vaxers: hate anything government because Vax-Pass, including the China oriented diplomacy
- Libtards: love anything government and worship the leader of the main party. They celebrate this and openly bash China because their Leader said that it is good 
- Non-involved people - worry about the economic consequences to businesses and people&#39;s lives. Most of them would have a hard time finding Taiwan (probably even China) on a blank map.In my opinion:Our Minister of Foreign Affairs went into this without really understanding what it would mean to the CCP and what possible counter-actions they can take. Lithuania was hit more than the politicians expected and we are, essentially, alone in this fight (save for endorsements and pats on the back). I guess that we will be in a pretty rough spot in short-term, while mid/long term can go either way depending on how the western powers and Taiwan will act."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This looks great, I love the clean GTK for this user interface. Say what you will about GTK and Gnome... for beginners on an operating system such as Ubuntu, having a consistent application concept is very important.Curious how this compares to Lutris[1]. I can see it has support for it as a runner, however as far as I can tell it achieves the same thing by maintaining separate wineprefixes.[1] https://lutris.net/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m confused...Crossover (a commercial product using Wine as its backend and contributes back to the Wine project[1]) uses the term &#34;bottles&#34; for its container-like method to install Windows apps on Linux and macOS. Is this an offshoot or extension of Crossover, or is it a blatant ripoff of their already existing service and name? Codeweavers (the makers of Crossover) have been using the term &#34;bottle&#34; in this paradigm since at least the late 2000s[2].[1] https://www.codeweavers.com/crossover#linux[2] https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/crossover-and-bottles.5..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Looks like a replacement for ye-olde PlayOnLinux, which if I ever move to Linux Desktop[0] was going to be something I would write my own tooling to replace[1].It is not clear from looking over the website, but since bottles appear closely related to Flatpak I am wondering if they support being installed to a different path than the default. Flatpak doesn&#39;t allow you to do this in a piecemeal way[2], but it does allow you to set up more than one entire Flatpak environment to different paths[3]. I&#39;m hoping bottles can at least manage that?[0] There are dozens of tools on my list for this, mostly around application and container management.[1] I am a very vocal critic of the way Linux Desktop does things, but Windows is becoming worse at an alarming rate so it will probably be the least-worst option in a few years.[2] A regression from features we had in desktop OSs since the 80s.[3] Not that any GUI frontend for it pays attention to that. sigh"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There are three kinds of web developers:- Those who don&#39;t care about performance, as long as it loads within a few seconds on their own beefed up system on the LAN. This article is for them, and we can only hope they will listen.- Those who care about performance, and work for people who care. They are already doing great work (or are about to), producing those rare low-friction, high-speed, content-is-king sites which we all love.- Those who care about performance, but work for people who don&#39;t. Since the developer doesn&#39;t get to decide what to work on, they can either get cracking on feature #357, work on performance on the sly at the risk of losing their job, or quit. Not much of a choice, really, unless you have some other-worldly lax schedule and minimal oversight. And don&#39;t forget, if you are allowed to work on performance the burden is on you to prove how much faster things are with your changes (which can be really hard to show conclusively) and that your N days is worth more than Bob working N days on that sexy ticket #357.Substitute &#34;security&#34;, &#34;UX&#34;, or anything else you want for &#34;performance&#34;, it works the same way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; British soldiers in World War I were equipped with a Brodie helmet, a steel hat designed to protect its wearer from overhead blasts and shrapnel while conducting trench warfare. After its deployment, field hospitals saw an uptick in soldiers with severe head injuries.&gt; Because of the rise in injuries, British command considered going back to the drawing board with the helmet’s design. Fortunately, a statistician pointed out that the dramatic rise in hospital cases was because people were surviving injuries that previously would have killed them—before the introduction of steel the British Army used felt or leather as headwear material.I&#39;ve seen this same story except with warplanes during the War. Story goes that an allied air force tried to improve the percentage of planes that would return from a bombing raid, so they inspected returning planes, found the places where they had holes in them and added extra layers of steel to those areas for the next bomb run; but this had no improvement on the percentage of planes that returned.That is until a &#34;statistician&#34; realized that all of the places on the plane that they found holes in were actually parts of the plane that could get hit and survive and return. They then started adding extra steel to the parts of the planes they found no holes or damage assuming that if those parts were hit the plane would get shot down and not return. After this change they started seeing a dramatic increase in the amount of planes returning from a raid.Does anyone know the true source of these stories?Regardless, it really opened my eyes to how changing your perspective on the cause of the problem can help find the best solution, and to this day I still think of this story when solving a problem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s not just developers, and it&#39;s not just about speed, it&#39;s also designers / UX bods who need to heed this. My decently powered work laptop from job 1 has a fairly rubbish screen, which means that a lot of the subtle hover effects, 1 pixel light grey on lighter grey divisions and skinny fonts either aren&#39;t visible or are incredibly difficult to see. A good trick if you&#39;re working on a large, hi res screen is to have a small and crappy second monitor hooked up if you&#39;re doing any UI work so you can see what it will actually look like to a lot of your users."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think this sounds more like some sort of fingerprinting attempt. It good to see that random access to these kind of resources fails due to new(er) browser controls. However, this does not mean that the fingerprinting actually failed.There is probably some way to determine if the request was denied automatically by the browser or manually by the user (e.g., time to get &#34;response&#34;), which is definitely something which can be used for fingerprinting.Which reminds me of fingerprinting by tiny differences in the audio API provided by browsers [0]. Super interesting, but also a bit depressing. Also works for things like canvases and WebGL.EFF allows you to check how fingerprintable your browser is [1]. Do note that the results may not be very accurate.[0]: https://fingerprintjs.com/blog/audio-fingerprinting/[1]: https://coveryourtracks.eff.org"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is not google, but a third party ad network serving ads through google.Google tries to sandbox the creatives in an attempt to prevent issues exactly like this, and develops browser features to prevent issues exactly like this.This is likely a script that somehow avoided google&#39;s malware scanning pipelines.This is definitely not google&#39;s malintent.Disclaimer: Ex googler, worked in ads, dealed with problems like this all the time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author is concerned that an ad might be able to surreptitiously turn on the camera or microphone, but these are not accessible by default. In this case, it isn&#39;t even getting as far as a permissions prompt because the default Feature Policy doesn&#39;t allow camera or mic access in cross-origin iframes. (Ex, for Chrome: https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-se...)   Instead, I think the most likely thing happening here is that an advertiser is running a script that is trying to do fingerprinting, and which is blocked by the browser protection.(That it&#39;s an iframe running on https://[random].safeframe.googlesyndication.com tells us it&#39;s an ad served through Google Ad Manager, and the contents of the iframe are supplied by the advertiser.)Disclosure: I work for Google, speaking only for myself"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of people mocking the author or others for being scared and worried are basically blaming the victim here, and I would like them to stop.The nature of legal practices in the USA is such that the answers to &#34;Are you totally in the clear legally?&#34; and &#34;Will you lose significant amounts of money proving in random courts that you are in the clear legally?&#34; are often both yes.As a result, any researchers who send out thinly veiled legal threats as a &#34;research experiment&#34; are firmly in the wrong ethically, and should be called out by all the people to whom they have issued these veiled threats. Review boards that approved this experiment should be themselves subjected to an audit and potentially dissolved."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Can someone help me understand the ethical problem here? If I as an ordinary citizen contacted the webmaster with a similar worded email, the result would have been the same. The fact is that this “experiment” did not create any more or additional stress than is created for normal citizens/businesses simply engaging in normal legal activities. If submitting such a request has the potential to cause such undue stress, shouldn&#39;t society create protections or disallow such requests?Edit: It&#39;s not that hard to see that there are potentially some social problems here e.g. &#34;the message is easily construed as a legal threat&#34; or &#34;the message was mass mailed in a spam-like nature&#34;. However, my comment is in response to the title of the blog post which implies that the webmaster believes there&#39;s an ethical problem that this &#34;experiment&#34; was even run in the first place. For the purpose of this thread, assume the email was worded perfectly and the university was very thoughtful and deliberate in who they contacted. I&#39;m interested in discussing the ethics behind how a perfectly legal and reasonable thing can in one case be ethical and another case be unethical simply by virtue of the context in which the action was carried out."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Well, it is a workers market right now.Professionally there is nothing special about me except that I really enjoy working, but for the last two remote jobs, the offer letter I received was more than what I verbally agreed on with HR. Since I am also 70 years old, I take this as good evidence of how pro-worker the job market is right now.I offer free mentoring (see my web site) and always talk about the importance to having a beginner’s/learner’s mind. I think that what companies want is: prioritizing the company’s interests, being flexible, and being observant looking for opportunities to improve the business. Fairly straightforward strategy.Good luck reaching your financial goals/salary number but also please remember money isn’t everything, and is much less important than our relationships with other people."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You just need to apply for roles with public companies that offer liquid equity. Very few of us are getting 250k+ on base salary alone. Most of us have the salary bands you’re already in, but have additional equity pay on top. It doesn’t have to be a FAANG either. There are loads of public companies out there hiring engineers at 250k total comp."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Leverage.If your work improves the productivity of 100+ other people, you&#39;re surely worth the price.If your work saves $500k+ in annual costs, you&#39;re surely worth the price.If hiring you cripples key competitors, you&#39;re surely worth the price.If you can enable new revenues streams through knowledge that only you have, you&#39;re surely worth the price.If hiring you does not increase productivity, reduce costs, fend off competition, or bring in more revenue, then you&#39;ll be fighting an uphill battle to justify that salary. But if you do, talk about it. People gossip and those companies who have the biggest multiplier to benefit off your work will be working hard to reach you.In my opinion, remote or not is less important than you think. The key decisions will be based on whether hiring you at that price is a net positive for the company or not.EDIT: And if you&#39;re outside of the US, set up a local LLC so that US-based companies can treat you like an independent contracting business. That&#39;ll make it much easier to hire you across borders. And at that price, you can surely afford the $1000 annually for a tax advisor retainer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As someone who has lead a devops team, and still has a devops team reporting to me, I have also struggled with the idea of having a team called devops, since it does go against the devops philosophy of devs owning their software in production.However, in our case (and probably many others), our devops team is responsible for creating and maintaining the tools and processes that allow the dev teams to manage their systems in production. At a larger organization, it doesn’t make since for each individual dev team to have to create and maintain their own deployment and management systems… that would end up with a lot of duplicated effort and a wide variety of systems that would need to be maintained. Devops creates the tools and procedures, and dev teams use them.You might say this is just sysops, but I think the key difference is that the dev teams are the ones who are using the production management tools, not the sysops team. Devops is not the ones who are paged if a system has an issue, the dev team who owns it is paged. Devops is only paged if the tool that the dev team is using to handle the issue has issues itself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m frankly astounded at the complexity around modern development due to dev ops and how much worse developer experience is because of it.  I used to develop in a great IDE with debugging, right click re-run failed tests, I could follow the console right there in a nice, clean window integrated with my IDE, click on stack traces, etc.Now I&#39;m running my app via multiple docker images, trying to get a buggy remote debugger protocol to work (no local variables, wtff?) where I have to coordinate the container and the IDE, command line wrangling / using print debugging in the container to chase down stuff, digging around through multiple log files, copying-and-pasting stack traces into my IDE to analyze, which kinda works in some cases since the file paths are different, and on and on.DevOps came and took my nice dev environment away, and I am mad."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had to basically give up my full time role as a Data Engineer who is supposed to solve &#34;big data&#34; problems (Storage, Streaming, Machine Learning pipelines) etc, and had to solely focus on DevOps because there was no other expert in the team.We (a colleague and I) basically learned Terraform, then Kubernetes, and then Helm in an extremely stressful environment. I wouldn&#39;t recommend that to most people. (Also, I can hear &#34;you don&#39;t need k8s&#34;, but tbh, it makes the difficult things possible, and that&#39;s what we needed).I&#39;ve done Ops in bare-metal environments before, and at least there, even if there were new skills to learn, the environment just wasn&#39;t so hostile for beginners, and the learning curve was simpler.The YAML (or heaven forbid, jsonnet) does *not* help. TBH, I&#39;m convinced if the IaC bits were done in a regular Java/Go/Rust SDK style instead of mixing and matching YAML glued together via labels and tags, I would have had a much easier time.The positive side of that is that now the IaC bits are mature enough that even the Data Scientists in our team write their own Terraform code, and I&#39;ve upskilled myself quite a lot. I&#39;m slowly going back to solving Storage/Data/ML issues, which I enjoy a lot more.Maybe I&#39;m just becoming a cranky Software Dev as I enter my 30s. I do _not_ enjoy reading YAML."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For me, the special part is truly viewing any job as just that: a job.I no longer assess my worth as a person as a function of job title, salary, or anything else.I take contracting work primarily and expect absolutely nothing more than a paycheck. Work is a transaction and I deliver what I can and am not a jerk.Almost every disposable penny goes toward physical fitness. My spouse happens to be cut from the same cloth, which is a big plus.We don&#39;t live extravagantly unless you count the money for fitness, but we consider that to be an investment and not a frivolous expense.Satisfaction in life for me comes from every angle EXCEPT my job, and that&#39;s my secret."</p>

Become an artist, author, clown, or build some awesome technical system because you want it to exist. GPL it.Don&#39;t ask for anything, especially not happiness, from your &#34;career&#34;.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I will just add one point regarding health and sedentarism. Going completely remote saved about 2 hours a day from commute. This is big. This is not just 2 hours, but at the end of those 2 hours you won&#39;t be in a mood to do pretty much anything. I ended up working out for 30 mins and going on a long 90 min walk everyday. People tend to think 2 hours of physical activity is a lot and &#39;too much&#39;, but given how sitting oriented our jobs are - I don&#39;t believe this is the case. I don&#39;t even walk to get a lunch, once you wear a fitbit or some such device this becomes so clear how much of a sitting oriented life we have acquired. Also when I was monitoring weight, bp and other such parameters - nothing other than 2 hours made any dent. So 2 hours it is. Just wanted to add this perspective. Hope it helps."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m going to put some of the blame on the Denver government/police for this, but not for a lack of enforcement. If your bike is impounded or stolen and recovered it is nearly impossible to retrieve it. You cannot call to see if it was picked up. You cannot look for it online. You have to show up to their sketchy office during business hours, wait in line, and ask the guy to go look through all the bikes and try to find yours. With hundreds of bikes it almost certainly will not be found.The government auctions off some of the bikes and gives or sells the rest of the bikes to charity.Two years ago my bike was locked in a location it should not have been downtown along with many other bikes. When I came back to find my bike missing the police officer said all of the bikes were impounded. I called around, went to the impound place twice.. but my bike was never found.In short, great investigation work by bike index. But their efforts are hindered by the city."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In early high school, we&#39;d ride bikes to the local coffee shop, lean them against the big windows out front and hangout. Somehow, no one noticed when mine was snatched one evening. I was pretty devastated.My grandfather drove me around the town the next day to see if I could spot it. When we were about to give up, I noticed a bike leaning along side a house near the shop. I could see it from the street. It looked exactly like mine. It had the same replacement seat and even a curly bike lock coiled around the handlebars on the same side I left it. But it had been hastily spray pained.We called the police, they arrived and a kid inside noticed the commotion and came out. They had found the bike at the shop and took it. I went to inspect it. I was very surprised when I found the small yard behind the house was packed with around fifty bikes. To the cop, I said something like, &#34;there&#39;s tons of bikes back here!&#34; I then remembered another friend had theirs stolen as well.He didn&#39;t look for himself, and said I couldn&#39;t just take the bike. There was no proof it was mine. So, I said, &#34;what if I can unlock the bike lock?&#34; I could and was allowed to take it, but it had been ruined. My prized shiny bike had been banged up and spray painted.The following week my mother read me a letter that had arrived. The town would not be prosecuting the kid. I was confused. I did nothing wrong and stayed out of trouble myself. Did their actions not warrant any consequences?My mother ended up going to the police department and insisting the town prosecute, which they ended up doing. I&#39;m not sure what happened. Did the consequences dissuade them from stealing a 51st bike? Their family had failed them, would their community? If not for religion, what hope did they have?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I looked to see if they have been sentenced, but instead found this about the fence of the group:&#34;Adrian Rocha Chairez is charged with 31 felony counts including racketeering. Police say he headed up an organized crime ring responsible for more than a million dollars in damaged property and stolen cars and bikes. He was indicted in Denver, where a judge set bond at $500,000.A Boulder judge knocked it down to $10,000. He walked out even after prosecutors noted he had weapons and ties to Mexico.&#34;[0] https://denver.cbslocal.com/2021/12/08/boulder-pr-bonds-murr..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"HN represents a wellspring of deeper reading than is generally afforded by the current entertainment cruft portals of the web - reddit, FB, insta, USA today, financial times, etc etc down to the SEO hellholes of recipe sites, youtube product placement; you get the idea.  Let&#39;s appreciate HN for the quality of reading material and its curb on our drift to the rest of the &#39;popular&#39; web.  And I don&#39;t think I&#39;m alone in always keeping an eye out for the next serious hub of real reading material!That said I don&#39;t read nearly as many books as I did in high school.  Books are wonderful things and can be a portal to a novel frame of mind.  But then again my life is much busier these days and there are more demands on my time which are not responsibly ignored... So I cherish HN as a flourishing intellectual community, in easily digestible chunks.  A bit like the &#34;periodical&#34; era of newspapers a century or two ago."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The way to cure this is to develop a habit that severely limits undirected online browsing and socializing. Part of it is just an education of your own aesthetic sentiments. I read James Clear&#39;s &#34;Atomic Habits&#34; (not that this is a special book, I was just on another kick in which I really needed to improve my productivity and picked up a suggestion to use a physical counter of some kind to make a habit stick.I bought a bunch of marbles, and for every bloc of time that I avoid undirected browsing or social media use, I move a marble from one container to the other. My goal every day is to get through an arbitrary number of marbles (160 right now), after which I can do whatever. If I slip up and open a social media page, HN, or start browsing newspapers, I dump all the marbles out of the container, which generally makes it impossible to meet the day&#39;s goal unless the slipup is very early in the day.This has been nothing short of amazing for my life. One issue that I had is I had a physical twitch that would start developing after a couple minutes doing one thing, like a work project, at which I would feel the urge to check the news or social media. This twinge would show up and I would type into a browser window to relieve the sensation. Instead I more or less replaced that twinge with moving the marble from one container to the other. It&#39;s made it a lot easier to focus. Over time, I stopped caring as much about the news and became more easily satisfied by very briefly reading summaries every few days.I think a lot of web addiction is less driven by thoughts or brain issues and more by physical habits akin to nail-biting or cuticle-picking. Most of the attempts that I&#39;ve made to stop addictive behavior have not worked: they were based on schedules, timers, articulated goals, and other things like that rather than recognizing the physical trigger for the habit, the result of that trigger, and just redirecting the stimulus with another physical action rather than trying to suppress it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Socrates famously hated the written form, not because it was technologically advanced for its time, but because it was &#34;dead&#34;: you can&#39;t have a conversation with a piece of writing, or ask the author to explain something that&#39;s on the page.I disagree (and agree, indirectly, with the OP): deadness is a feature, not a bug. The problem with Internet writing is not just its addictive nature, it&#39;s groupthink. It is too much alive. You have to either follow popular opinion, or oppose it vehemently; tangential or orthogonal thinking is almost impossible.Books, because they are not part of an immediate, global conversation where people share opinions and judgements and signal their virtue to one another, are something very different and allow for a very different experience than any written text found online.Maybe books will slowly fade; but I think it&#39;s unlikely they would ever completely disappear, as they offer something unique not found anywhere else."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From the study&#39;s FAQ[0]:&gt; Did an Institutional Review Board consider this study?&gt; We submitted an application detailing our research methods to the Princeton University Institutional Review Board, which determined that our study does not constitute human subjects research.From the social experiment[as reported by OP&#39;s link]:&gt; I look forward to your reply without undue delay and at most within 45 days of this email, as required by Section 1798.130 of the California Civil Code.I&#39;m pretty sure most people would find that to be a thinly veiled threat of a lawsuit. I&#39;d like to know if the review board considered the text of the email that the &#34;researchers&#34;[1] intended to send and the fact that they were likely to send it to individuals instead of solely publicly traded companies.[0] https://archive.md/cSDGT[1] Seems to fall more under experimental psychology to me https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_psychology?wprov=..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It is interesting in the study web page (https://privacystudy.cs.princeton.edu/) that they consistently mention contacting &#34;websites&#34; instead of &#34;people.&#34; As if a website is some autonomous thing that can communicate with a researcher.I wouldn&#39;t be sleeping well if I were involved in this study. There is no way an IRB could determine that this is not human subjects research if you&#39;re emailing people and asking them anything.If I want to ask random people about the weather and publish the results in a journal, that qualifies as human subjects research and IRB protocols must be followed. Emailing people asking about privacy policies is definitely human subjects research. Either they misrepresented the study in their IRB application, or the IRB didn&#39;t do due diligence reviewing the application."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Author here! A few updates since this was published two years ago:- The service mentioned (now called https://webapp.io ) eventually made it into YC (S20) and still uses postgres as its pub/sub implementation, doing hundreds of thousands of messages per day. The postgres instance now runs on 32 cores and 128gb of memory and has scaled well.- We bolstered Postgres&#39;s PUBLISH with Redis pub/sub for high traffic code paths, but it&#39;s been nice having ACID guarantees as the default for less popular paths (e.g., webhook handling)- This pattern only ever caused one operational incident, where a transaction held a lock which caused the notification queue to start growing, and eventually (silently) stop sending messages, starting postgres with statement_timeout=(a few days) was enough to solve thisPrevious discussion: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21484215Happy to answer any questions!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had thought about using postgres as a job queue before, but I couldn&#39;t figure out in my head how to make sure two processes didn&#39;t both take the same job. The &#34;FOR UPDATE&#34; and &#34;SKIP LOCKED&#34; were the keys to make this work in the article. Essentially, as far as I can tell, &#34;SELECT FOR UPDATE&#34; locks the rows as they&#39;re selected (locks are apparently visible outside the transaction), and &#34;SKIP LOCKED&#34; skips over rows for the select that other transactions have locked. Cool stuff.The below article goes over some downsides to using postgres for a job queue: namely that the data model isn&#39;t optimized to find and send new jobs to large numbers of subscribers. Actual messaging systems like Kafka/NATS are better at this.https://www.2ndquadrant.com/en/blog/what-is-select-skip-lock...Also, there are things that the dedicated messaging systems give you that postgres won&#39;t, such as transparent error handling and retry logic. If your worker grabs a job from postgres and fails (in some kind of transient way such that the task should be retried), you&#39;ll have to implement the retry logic yourself. A streaming platform like Kafka or NATS will notice that you haven&#39;t acknowledged the message and deliver it to someone else.This is something you could pretty easily implement yourself with something like a process that just scans over the &#34;processing&#34; jobs and looks for timeouts, resetting them as it goes. But there are probably a few of these little papercuts that Kafka-like (…Kafkaesque?) systems would handle for you.So, I guess if you already have postgres set up in a reliable way, and there&#39;s no one around whose job it is to set up new production systems like Kafka, and you don&#39;t already have something like Kafka, and you only need basic job queue requirements or you&#39;re okay with implementing whatever you need on top of postgres yourself, and your incoming job rate is fewer than maybe a thousand per second, and you have fewer than maybe tens of consumers… postgres is probably a decent job queue.The above paragraph seems snide but it probably does describe many people&#39;s environments."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the key concept here is atomicity. If some API is responsible for creating a job, storing it in the database AND publishing it can never be an atomic operation. Both the database and pub/sub servers are separate network connections from the application server. For example, if you save the record first and then publish, It&#39;s quite possibe that you save the record in the database and then lose the connection to the pub/sub server when publishing. If this happens, you can never know if the pub/sub server received the request and published it. In systems where it&#39;s critical to guarantee that a record was saved and guarantee that it was published as well, the only way to do that is by using a single external connection - in this case to a Postgres DB. We&#39;ve used the same setup on an AWS RDS t2.medium machine to process over 600 records/second."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There seem to be two camps here:- Bose is an evil megacorp who recklessly endangered its customers by selling dangerous and poorly designed products.- Accidents happen and when a device explodes on your head you should accept it as a fact of life and move on.  The chemical burns are nothing and OP is a pussy.I think the reality may be different.  My take on it is that Li batteries possess inherent dangers and it is incumbent upon manufacturers to take reasonable steps to mitigate the dangers while informing their consumers of the risk.  Unfortunately, even when presented with the risks, most folks are unable to comprehend the probabilities and consequences and will nearly always choose convenience, features and value over the avoidance of danger.  It seems we, as a society(not as individuals, as some will surely object) have chosen Li technology and deemed it safe enough to deploy ubiquitously.I hope a review of this incident will shed light on the safety practices followed by Bose and will inform future engineers of unforeseen risks, giving us all safer, convenient devices.Overall I find the discussions in this thread unbecoming of the types of folks I thought frequented HN.  I hope we can all strive to elevate the dialogue and treat each other with a moderate amount of respect."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It would be good to see an autopsy, to find out if it&#39;s actually the battery that went into thermal runaway, or something else that shorted and dumped all of its energy.I have no idea how much heavy metals I&#39;ve been exposed to by inhaling the toxic smoke. I don&#39;t know how much smoke my pregnant wife inhaled. I worry how much chemical residue is on my desk, floor, walls, how much is getting recycled by my HVAC system, how much exposure my pets had.That sort of paranoia doesn&#39;t help. In fact it may cause psychosomatic symptoms (nocebo effect). You&#39;ve probably inhaled far worse if you&#39;ve ever been to a barbeque, gas station, or just took a walk in one of the more crowded areas of the city."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you&#39;re up for it, I suggest:1) Find a lawyer. I&#39;d guess that personal injury lawyer is the right kind, and that you can easily find one who works on contingency.2) File a complaint with the consumer product safety commission, and any other applicable government agencies. The lawyer may be able to help with this.You deserve compensation for this, and I wish you all the best with extracting it. I hope you recover soon.Also: Take photos and document everything. A massive number of photos, of the damage to your house and your body and anything else you can think of. This will help with the lawyer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So, I genuinely do not get the &#34;controversy&#34; over the Veritasium video. AFAIU, the entire point of the video was to show that electricity travels not through wires but via electric fields (&#34;through the air&#34; so to speak).To illustrate this, he sets up an experiment with parameters such that the conclusion can only mean that some electricity has traveled to the bulb before any could arrive through/around the wires.He sets up the parameters so that the bulb would turn on by that little electricity; but that is obviously just a visual sign, and his point is valid no matter how much electricity traveled to bulb under whatever different parameters.It kinda feels like most people are missing the actual point of the video."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The first signal is a close RF transmission, billions of people rely on it everyday, a current disturbs the electromagnetic field and and an antenna, sometimes thousands of kilometers away, detects a very small variation in the field (-120dbm @ 50Ω = 0.2μV). This is how our cellphones, wifi, GPS, RFID works. So, even if you disconnect the bulb and the switch you can create  a current in the bulb by turning on and off the switch."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This Veritasium video was the first instance of clickbate 2.0We&#39;re going to see more and more this type of video.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I picked up a Kinesis a few month ago and it&#39;s been a life changer. I&#39;ve struggled with shoulder pain since as far back as I can remember. I&#39;d done PT, dry needling, massage, etc etc. I&#39;d even sprung for a personal ergonomic assessment. I&#39;m a cyclist and and keyboard jockey, so most of my waking life is spent in positions that seemed to make it worse. At times it prevented me from sleeping, doing things I enjoyed, etc.  I wear a 42 jacket, so I&#39;m not crazy wide or anything.I&#39;d never seen anything that suggested that split keyboards were a good solve for the shoulder pain but I&#39;d reached that point of just throwing shit at a wall because it was that, or find a new career and hobbies. Moving my keyboard so my forearms can sit slightly wider than perpendicular to my chest has almost completely resolved the shoulder pain and the impact was almost immediate."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In addition to all the comments from Advantage fans here, I also wanted to add that Kinesis has been an awesome company. I tweeted about some mods I made to my Advantage keyboard a long time ago, and they invited me to their office and donated a bunch of keyboards to the nonprofit I work for, to give as prizes to students (even before they launched the gaming-focused brand)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have been a Kinesis user for 8 years, starting with an Advantage USB, added a classic PS2(with a usb adapter) as a backup and then was a tester for the Advantage 2 which I ended up buying. A company I worked for gave me a choice for keyboards when I joined so I tried a Ergodox EZ with the RGB backlighting.General observations:1. Overall I prefer the Advantage over the Ergodox. The big reason is the contoured design and the fact that the Ergodox tends to walk around unless you have a solid desk pad underneath it. Also, the Ergodox never felt as comfortable as the Advantage. Yes the Advantage is not as easy to travel with but still....
2. I like the new design, but there are a few things that would have made the pro perfect. PBT backlit keycaps like they offer on the Ergodox-EZ and RGB backlighting...and maybe a set of f-keys (on the fence with the last one).One other thing... A mix of o-rings and QMX clips made a huge difference with the feel of the keyboard for me. I have been a cherry brown user from the beginning though and different people have different preferences with that.Kinesis is also really good about providing parts and service. I&#39;ve had them send me replacement switches and have seen them offer up in-expensive replacement boards to repair and keep older models going.I&#39;m going to buy one of these, but given that I already have 4 high quality mechanical keyboards and I have yet to have one die I am starting to feel guilty having all of these laying around. That said there is a side of me that is curious about the Keyboard.io :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I remember the sense of deep satisfaction and virtue when I defragged my hard drive. Then I learned FreeBSD. I kept trying to figure out how to defrag the partitions. When I learned that the filesystem took care of it continuously my mind was blown."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Brings back good memories... I used to go directly to the electronics section at Walmart while my parents shopped, start defrag on all the computers and then watch from the CD aisle with a smirk as an associate would come across them, exclaim &#34;my god!&#34; and restart the computers with a power off and on."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For a long time now for me youtube-dl downloads YouTube videos at 50kb/s, which makes it impractical to use in conjunction with mpv. I need to leave youtube-dl running in the background for several hours to then watch the video in mpv.Now from the comments I&#39;ve found out about yt-dlp[1] which claims to fix this issue[2]. Will check it out.[1]: &lt;https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp&gt;[2]: &lt;https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/issues/29326&gt;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"So there is a bug in the Twitter video download. When Twitter went to 280 chars it started showing up. 280 chars is too long for a file name (on Windows at least.) I sent YouTube-dl a pull request with a fix but not only did they not accept it, they brushed me off in a way that gave me the impression they didn&#39;t want fixes from the outside. I&#39;m fairly old and this was my first attempt at contributing to open source. Is this the way it goes typically? I imagine they get a lot of people with b.s. pull requests so they get jaded. It&#39;s understandable I suppose.The bug still exists in yt-dlp. I run a local copy with my fix for those times when I need it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Thanks to all Log4j developers. As users of your free software since ~20 years, we&#39;re sure that, if this vuln disclosure had been better and there were no sign of widespread in-the-wild exploitation, you would have done a better job at patching it, and a single release would have been enough.We won&#39;t hold a grudge against you; open source means collaboration, and you don&#39;t blame hard-working people that give away their software for free for honest mistakes. Your software still did far more good than bad to the software world.Thanks!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If information security people would spend the same amount of time they are spending complaining about this vulnerability trying to educate their organisations on the importance of supporting open source solutions they depend on we wouldn’t be in this situation.
 I am sick of reading of very senior people complaining about the impact this vulnerability has had on their week when their companies don’t even contribute a penny to open source projects."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I see plenty of comments about security teams that should be doing this or that.I do not know about your security teams, but my security teams are now sitting 9 days straight trying to stop that shitshow. With teams complaining that they have to patch instead of doing Great Things.After that these security teams will be back to invisible work and forgotten again. Until the next issue.If your company has a truly different approach to security, tell it here - you may get really talented people knocking in because they are fed up with the security theater at their current job."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Chatting with my gf, we came up with a new section (mostly her):=== General Inquiries ===- Answer a question other than the one being asked. Feign misunderstanding.- Give incomplete answers. Do anything you can to almost but not completely answer the inquiry
.- Delay answering as long as possible.- Answer with a question.- Request more information than required to answer an inquiry.- Attempt redirection to other people or resources.- Involve as many people as possible- Rebuke the inquirer when they follow up on a previous unanswered inquiry within an arbitrary time window (days, not hours).- When asked multiple questions, answer only only of them, ignoring all others. Wait to be prompted to answer each question individually.- When asked multiple questions, answer the least important or time sensitive question first.- Ignore all information provided besides the single question being answered.- Prefer slower or more onerous communication methods
  1. snail mail
  2. email
  3. text messaging
  4. audio call
  5. video call
  6. in-person meeting- Mix multiple communication methods- If contacted using a lower ranking method, upgrade."</p>
