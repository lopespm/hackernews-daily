								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Ah, we actually have one of these at Caddy: https://caddyserver.com/docs/architecture(The filename on disk is literally &#34;architecture.md&#34; -- it is a Markdown file rendered by Caddy&#39;s template handler: https://github.com/caddyserver/website/blob/master/src/docs/...)It could use some improvement, but it&#39;s been really great for helping people learn how Caddy 2 works at a high level. Beyond our docs, I always encourage new contributors to thoroughly explore the godoc and code: it&#39;s very well-commented and organized, especially once you know how it all comes together. A single document will never be sufficient. But it can help you map between concepts and code.Code search is also invaluable for this; I recommend Sourcegraph: https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/caddyserver/caddyEdit: One other valuable piece is explaining why the architecture is the way it is. Our architecture.md doc links to a video that explains how I arrived at Caddy 2&#39;s architecture (and why it&#39;s not arbitrary): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhJO8giOqQs"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a similar advice, but I will go one step further: add README.md to other folders as well. It is dope to have a map of your whole system in an Architecture.md (or a README if it&#39;s not too long), but it&#39;s even more dope to be able to click through it and have submaps of how other components are structured.Displaying the folder/file structure and explaining what is what is a must. An example from Diem[1]:  consensus
  ├── src
  │   ├── block_storage          # In-memory storage of blocks and related data structures
  │   ├── consensusdb            # Database interaction to persist consensus data for safety and liveness
  │   ├── liveness               # RoundState, proposer, and other liveness related code
  │   └── test_utils             # Mock implementations that are used for testing only
  └── consensus-types            # Consensus data types (i.e. quorum certificates)
  └── safety-rules               # Safety (voting) rules


I recently digged into dependabot&#39;s code, and I found it extremely well structured. For example you have an Architecture section in the first README[2] with a diagram (how awesome is that!) and with links to the README of all the sub components, which themselves live in the subfolders[3].What I dread the most is going through a new codebase and not seeing any documentation in internal packages. Like how the fuck am I supposed to understand anything in there? By reading all the code?[1]: https://github.com/diem/diem/tree/master/consensus#how-is-th...[2]: https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core#architecture[3]: https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/blob/main/comm..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love architecture docs, but find they&#39;re often written using a funny process:  1. Spend a long time writing the doc.
  2. Wait for a person to chance upon it.
  3. Hope you anticipated their questions.

It seems like the most important thing a person can do is reverse this:  1. Say who the doc is for.
  2. Find that person. Ask them to try a lil contribution.
  3. Frantically write / revise the doc.

IMO it&#39;s a lot like creating a presentation. The earlier the feedback the better!"</p>

Some works for comparison would be; Land of Lisp, Realm of Racket, Clojure for the Brave and True, Learn you a Haskell for Great Good!, Learn you some Erlang for Great Good!, and Why&#39;s (Poignant) Guide to Ruby. There may be more I am not aware of. On the topic of cats programming there is also JavaScript for Cats, which is great too."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I like spyder a lot for the variable explorer, which makes it feel more like Matlab.  However the constant bothering about installing Kite got annoying. Unfortunately there isn&#39;t a way to use Kite and have it not constantly annoy you about upgrading to the enterprise edition. If Kite had a no ads plan for like ~ $10  a year it would make a lot more sense to integrate it in spyder."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It often causes a double-take for me when I see projects on HN with the same name as projects I once worked on.Way back in time, maybe around 1998, a friend an I worked on a steganography tool that we called Spyder. I don&#39;t remember where it was published or under what license (probably freeware), but the algorithm was incorporated into Hide4PGP (http://www.heinz-repp.onlinehome.de/Hide4PGP.htm), and we stopped work on it.This post just caused a bit of nostalgia. I can still remember my co-developer taking a break jamming on a bass guitar while we tried to figure out the striping problem (the solution was to compress the data to increase entropy first)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Can I get the following behavior from Spyder (last time I tried I couldn&#39;t find a way) - for some keyboard shortcut like Cmd/Ctrl + Enter:- the shortcut sends the selected code to the terminal (this is possible)- if I hit the shortcut when nothing is selected, the line where the cursor currently is gets sent to the terminal and the cursor moves to the next line of code- if the cursor is at the beginning of a block of code like an if-statement or a loop, the whole statement is sent to the terminal and the cursor moves to after the statementRStudio has this behaviour by default, I find it very convenient and I haven&#39;t been able to replicate it in other environments."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve seen many possible explanations mentioned. Most common seems to be that raising daughters is more stressful than raising sons (for various reasons) leading to more arguments etc. Most intriguing might be that sons conceived into tenuous marriages don&#39;t even make it out of the womb. I&#39;ll add one more: mother/daughter friction. I can&#39;t even count the number of families I&#39;ve seen in which a mother feels betrayed when her daughter doesn&#39;t follow her example in everything, and lets those feelings show. I&#39;ve seen the same with father/son, though less so perhaps because mothers tend to be more active parents. It would also be foolish to ignore the issue of daughters growing into their adult bodies and becoming sexually active right when many mothers are feeling insecure about their own attractiveness. We can argue about causes, but the effect is real.When mothers and daughters fight, it always puts fathers in a difficult position. A dad who consistently sides the mother might get credit for being a good co-parent (usually not) but be alienated from their own child. A dad who consistently sides with the daughter is likely to lose all contact with either due to divorce. All this, regardless of who&#39;s right or wrong between the two. Again, a bit of this happens when fathers and sons are in conflict, but it doesn&#39;t seem quite as severe and has different potential outcomes because of how &#34;family&#34; court works.That&#39;s just one possible factor, affecting some cases, but it seems worth mentioning along with all the others."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; parents of teenage daughters argue more about parenting than do the parents of sonsFrom my own experience. When my daughter hit 12 it was a fucking nightmare. The hormones hit girls hard and they can become incredibly difficult. That said, now she’s 13 things are much easier and look to be getting easier by the week. Although my wife and I both have to be very understanding and on the same team to deal with difficult behaviour — we have a lot of strategy meetings.Lacking empathy, and wanting independence without responsibility are part of being a teenager. But 12-year old girls can sometimes be super charged griefers.On the flip side, teenagers are actually awesome to hang out with and total joys full of creativity and fun — if you work through the refusal to clean their room, general lack of hygiene and the drama."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Anecdotal, but I have three sons and four daughters. In my experience boys are harder when they are younger (wild, causing mayhem and physical destruction in their wake, solving problems using fighting, etc.) but in their teenage years prefer to hang out quietly in their rooms. Girls on the other hand tend to be calmer in their younger years, but then in their teenage years become argumentative, moody, causing lots of emotional and psychological strife. It takes until they are in their early 20s for things to calm down. Though by then the damage has already been done. In an ideal world I&#39;d like to raise girls when they are young and boys when they are older."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One thing I haven&#39;t seen mentioned here is that Homebrew forced people use Ruby to write formulas (ie packages), whereas MacPorts forced people to use Tcl. This one decision, plus hosting formulas on Github, was a major contributor to their present success.As much as I sympathize (deeply) with all the criticism of Homebrew here on this thread -- I used to use MacPorts religiously and love it -- I don&#39;t think Homebrew took the field purely through sneaky marketing or n00b decisions alone. They leveraged the momentum of a lot of new devs coming to OS X and provided an easier path for people wanting to help out.I hate to say it, but if this was a race (?), Homebrew won. Thankfully we all still have the choice to use MacPorts if we want, but there&#39;s no point in being mean about Homebrew at this point either."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Dear Homebrew maintainers,one simple effing thing: thank you! For all the hard work and the sheer pleasure Homebrew adds to the experience of developing software on a Mac."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The majority of the ports and software I want installed are essentially Unix/Linux/GNU environment tools.Macports has always seemed to me to be a more &#34;unix-y&#34; way of doing that, and it works politely with Apple&#39;s ways on top of the Unix core (eg locking down the system volume).It also has a very nice &#34;select&#34; and &#34;variants&#34; system that allows you to have multiple versions of a package as well as packages with more or less functionality (eg integrating with the MacOS keychain etc).When I first got into Macs (only around 5 years ago), I looked at both homebrew and macports and as soon as I saw homebrew blasting stuff into /usr/local while macports neatly put everything in /opt, I was convinced to go with macports. I also had previous experience with the BSD&#39;s port systems, which helped push me towards macports.But I&#39;m open to being convinced about homebrew, although I&#39;ve never needed something that it had that macports didnt."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is one of the most insightful Q&amp;A&#39;s about Steve that I&#39;ve read.  I especially appreciated the part about the risers for the gumdrop iMacs not working perfectly smoothly: he was pissed even though the audience couldn&#39;t possibly see the stuttering risers and even though the keynote was successful.One might think Steve Jobs was an arrogant, perfectionist prick.  But you realize in this small story, that the whole keynote could have been torpedoed, could have gone sideways and been ridiculed, if those mechanical risers had failed.  The big moment for this product that could (and did) save the company, might have been a laughable sad trombone even though Steve had warned Wayne that it was a problem that needed to be fixed.The work of hundreds of people, and hundreds of millions of dollars, were pitted against shitty mechanical hand-cranks -- that&#39;s why small details matter, and why Steve was pissed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It’s always interesting to watch other companies give presentations in their attempt at Apple style. Google comes to mind as being the worst.It’s like everyone has analyzed or identified certain little nuggets of a good presentation and then sprinkled them in... versus truly and innately understanding how to deliver a cohesive performance to an audience. The most famous example of this is the way everyone started to use “we did x y and z and you’re going to love it!” which was thrown around like peanuts on a domestic flight.Richard Feynman’s quote on cargo culting comes to mind."</p>

I don&#39;t run a blog thats very popular, but it has been quite easy to integrate (I use React, Gatsby/ static side generation, and Hyvor Talk has a react component). An example of the system is at the bottom of that blog post. There used to be a free tier, but now there isn&#39;t. I am only still using it because existing customers have the free tier and haven&#39;t bothered to look for alternatives. Unfortunately, you can&#39;t get it free anymore. I would love to see free tier reintroduced.I did find some bugs with the React component itself, but it wasn&#39;t bad enough to make me stop using it."</p>

Currently, only the assembler is implemented, but in my personal opinion, I think it showcases the beauty of F# for domain modeling.

My eventual goal is to have the entire software stack built using F# that can than be run on an FPGA implementation of the CPU.https://github.com/bmitc/nand2tetrisTypes to model the instructions and source file expressions: https://github.com/bmitc/nand2tetris/blob/main/dotnet/Nand2T...The full assembler, mainly consisting of the parser and translator: https://github.com/bmitc/nand2tetris/blob/main/dotnet/Nand2T..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If there is one thing I certainly wouldn&#39;t just play around with it&#39;s the immune system. It&#39;s incredibly dangerous and easily capable of causing all kinds of harm to yourself up to killing you outright.A vaccine is designed to produce an immune response of the right magnitude. Too low and it doesn&#39;t work, too high and it&#39;ll cause damage. At least one of the vaccine candidates in development was put back to the drawing board because the immune response wasn&#39;t strong enough. So this is not an area that is entirely predictable, you have to carefully test this to know if it works.I&#39;d also be very careful about the inhalation route. Inhalable insulin is a well-known failure, in part because of side effects due to the inhalation. And that is a protein that isn&#39;t designed to activate your immune system.I also hope the synthesized peptides were carefully purified, you really don&#39;t want to inhale e.g. residual trifluoracetic acid."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is an impressive amount of hubris. Does the author assume that all the certifications and testing stages were for show?I don&#39;t hold the highest view of LessWrong and the whole rationalist shtick. This post exemplifies why. Underneath this post is the assumption that the author is so much smarter than everybody else because they are Rational with a capital R and can therefore harness the power of science to make a vaccine[^1]. Again, that&#39;s an incredible amount of hubris. If there&#39;s one universal truth about science, it&#39;s that it is extremely specialized. Just because someone knows a lot about chemistry doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re qualified to talk about biology. There is no magic Rationality that can have amateurs making vaccines a good idea. Unless you are an expert in vaccines a priori, you cannot suddenly become one in a few weeks.Heck, I&#39;m skeptical of doctors who are not infectious disease experts giving advice. I still hear a lot of  &#34;well my sister&#39;s neighbor&#39;s brother is a pediatrician and he said XYZ&#34;. Doctors are certainly more educated than the average person, and if this was a minor medical problem I&#39;d certainly take a random doctor&#39;s advice. But this is a pandemic with a novel disease. Listen to the infectious disease experts.[1]: Quite honestly this feels like a plotline from Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"TLDR: I attempted to make a COVID vaccine. It was cheap. I have no proof that it worked. Other risks are unknown.The story reminds me of Barry Marshall, but with less science behind it. https://jamesclear.com/barry-marshall"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For those defending this practice, consider carefully the implications of what you are advocating.On one hand you have a government deciding who can and cannot refer to themselves as adherents of a particular religion (by declaring that Ahamadis cannot call themselves Muslim).On another hand you have Google and Apple, yet again, being the complicit chokepoints of “free speech”, with regard to app developers.These may seem fair to you, but that may be because these practices have not negatively affected you...yet.But consider: Would it be fair if England declared Catholics “unChristian” and banned their use if the term?  Or what if the USA declared hasidic jews “Unjewish” and banned their use of the term. Or what if Apple caved to pressure theoretical from Israel to ban Jehovah’s Witnesses from using the term “Jehovah”?What next?  Government declaring who is and is not “white”?Oh wait......"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I keep thinking about infamous Telegram &#39;war&#39; with russian cenrosship agency, RosKomNadzor. Telegram was blocked via russian ISPs, but was never removed from Russian sections of Google Play and Apple Appstore.We now see that Apple and Google, time after time, easily submit to the will of local governments and remove questionable apps. Yet, Telegram was NOT removed. Russian media agencies claim that RosKomNadzor asked Google&amp;Apple to suspend the app, but the source for all media publications was always the same press-release by RKN. So it keeps me thinking: what if the world was played and all this &#39;blocking&#39; scandal was just a publicity stunt to raise Telegram&#39;s profile as a service that does not give up data to authorities?Does anyone know if we can confirm via Google &amp; Apple that they were asked to remove Telegram from play stores (and refused), or... they weren&#39;t really asked at all?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Meanwhile, offering high quality FMT transplants is a huge startup opportunity. People who need FMT are very sick, desperate, and willing to pay thousands of dollars to get it done. Recently, I have spent $2000 to order poop from the internet.Finding a high quality doctor is extremely difficult for a normal person. You have to find someone who is young, athletic, very healthy, never taken antibiotics, and then do some medical tests on them (pretty much everything that&#39;s wrong with a person can be transferred through FMT). Finding such person, bringing up the subject with them, and getting them agree to help is very hard.A company who could find and screen high quality FMT donors could make thousands of dollars just selling poop. Hundreds, if you&#39;re willing to drop prices to help people.All you have to do is find a healthy person who matches the criteria, and spend $2000-$3000 doing a number of blood/stool tests (and retest them every few months). Also figure out how to freeze/package/ship the transplants in a way that does the least harm to the microbes.If you are a healthy person who fits the description (or know someone who is), and are willing to help - please send me an email - fmthelp@protonmail.com"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; We believe privacy is paramount and free speech essential, especially on social media.this, from their &#34;technical difficulties&#34; notice, should have been enough for him to be fired on its own.  requiring some users to provide government identification, building such weak security that anyone can read and archive private messages, and not stripping out damaging meta-data from media posts are three ways to not provide privacy.if this was truly their mission, then their platform was already doomed, and a full housecleaning of most of the leadership should probably be done, not just the CEO.I don&#39;t care what side of a political spectrum you come from, or whether you support the site&#39;s mission or what it became, these failures should be unacceptable in any company."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Odd dynamic there as unfortunately, standing on principle means getting martyred, and the quote from the former CEO of, “Over the past few months, I’ve met constant resistance to my product vision, my strong belief in free speech and my view of how the Parler site should be managed” is not CEO level strategic.His investors and board hired him to win, not to pick a principled hill to die on. Martyrs are cheap and nobody making investments can afford cheap things. The irony is Parler positioned itself as less radical than Gab, and it was that very position of bargaining with its platforms is what killed it. How can 4chan, Gab, and the even darker parts of the internet manage to persist online with hardly any money, but someone with Mercer level backing can&#39;t keep a site online? The lesson is an example of things we already know, which is that anyone who needs platform permission do to a disruptive startup is already dead.We absolutely need alternative platforms, and our societies need tools that can survive popular histrionics. Getting owned by some sanctimonious prick at Amazon is not pro level play."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Parler was poor quality because it was a product of extreme political grift. People who work in politics unfortunately don&#39;t understand the mindset of actually high quality products or services. What they&#39;re interested in is quick and loud splashes to attract a huge amount of attention, pull in a bunch of capital/resources, and then underdeliver in the extreme in the hopes that the attention of the crowd will move on and ignore the failures.This is of course a bipartisan trend, but as far as I can tell affects Republicans more.It was absurdly poorly run--literally on Wordpress with very little security and obviously no bug bounty program. They probably have never even heard of the concept of a bug bounty.All around disappointing. The next iteration, if it is to work at all, will require a complete mindset switch."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Just do away with tips. It&#39;s a terrible and stupid system. If you want to do it as a customer, go ahead, but it should never be considered as part of the employee&#39;s compensation. If people aren&#39;t willing to do the job for the hourly wage alone with no tips, raise the wage until they are."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The FTC alleges Amazon changed the way it paid drivers in late 2016, lowering the hourly rate and then used customer tips to make up the difference. Amazon continued to tell drivers they were receiving all of their tips, even after receiving hundreds of complaints from drivers, the agency said.How is this not simply theft? Why does this attract civil charges and not criminal ones?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Previous: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26003836I appreciated samizdis’ comment, which I’ll just copy in full:FTC Commissioner Rohit Chopra has also put out a statement [1], titled Regarding the Deception of Delivery Drivers by Amazon.com Commission File No. 1923123Some extracts:&gt; In total, Amazon stole nearly one-third of drivers’ tips to pad its own bottom line. ...&gt; ... Amazon executives chose not to alter the practice, instead viewing drivers’ complaints as a “PR risk,” which they sought to contain through deception. ...&gt; Today’s order provides substantial redress to the families victimized by Amazon’s anticompetitive deception. However, this cannot be the only action we take to protect workers and families from dominant middlemen. ...&gt; I also agree with Acting Chairwoman Slaughter and Commissioner Phillips that preying on workers justifies punitive measures far beyond the restitution provided here, and I believe the FTC should act now to deploy dormant authorities to trigger civil penalties and other relief in cases like this one.[1] https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_statements..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi, from Iran with love!First of all, thank you moxie and signal team for this proxy.Until 2018, many Iranians used telegram but Iran&#39;s regime after Russia blocked this messenger. telegram released mtproxy and this proxy was helpful. Russia lifted the ban on telegram but this app is still blocked on my country. but with VPNs, many iranians still use this app. after 2018, second most popular messaging app in iran was whatsapp, until facebook&#39;s new privacy policy, like all of you, many iranians switch from whatsapp to signal. mullah&#39;s regime removed signal app from the iranian app stores and started blocking all signal traffic in the country, but they don&#39;t block whatsapp. I&#39;m not a paranoid but it is difficult to understand for me why they didn&#39;t block whatsapp after 2018? can they break whatsapp encryption?I have a suggestion for signal team: please put tor in the signal, tor is better than any proxys or vpns."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a big fan of the idea of independently-run proxy servers.Caddy has a secure forward proxy plugin born out of a research project at Google that does something similar, but works with any clients that let you configure HTTP proxies, and doesn&#39;t terminate TLS: instead it tunnels it over TLS. The proxy server itself can also be probe-resistant, i.e. difficult to detect that a website is acting as a proxy.I&#39;m hoping more people can help test the patch to support Caddy v2: https://github.com/caddyserver/forwardproxy/pull/74(Edit: Disclaimer - Don&#39;t use this in situations where your personal safety or freedom could be at risk... not yet. Not until more people with more experience can vet its implementation for bugs, and a very clear threat profile can drawn up. If you have experience with this, we&#39;d love your help.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s an irony how American companies try circumvents another country&#39;s law (regardless of whether you call it censorship or not, it is still a law) and boast about it.Yet, in the US these companies help the mainstream narrative to enforce censorship by banning (Google and Apple App market) or simply not offering other point of views basic hosting services (AWS).I am an Iranian and don&#39;t agree with all of our government actions but I can clearly see a tech neo-colonialism/neo-imperialism here. I am sure Signal&#39;s intention and people wanting to help is genuinely good but this does not change this double-standard.I would like to see your supportive reaction if an Iranian company offers hosting to Parler. I imagine you would call it foreign intervention!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Pangloss, who was as inquisitive as he was argumentative, asked the old man what the name of the strangled Mufti was. ‘I don’t know,’ answered the worthy man, ‘and I have never known the name of any Mufti, nor of any Vizier. I have no idea what you’re talking about; my general view is that people who meddle with politics usually meet a miserable end, and indeed they deserve to. I never bother with what is going on in Constantinople; I only worry about sending the fruits of the garden which I cultivate off to be sold there.’ Having said these words, he invited the strangers into his house; his two sons and two daughters presented them with several sorts of sherbet, which they had made themselves, with kaimak enriched with the candied-peel of citrons, with oranges, lemons, pine-apples, pistachio-nuts, and Mocha coffee… – after which the two daughters of the honest Muslim perfumed the strangers’ beards. ‘You must have a vast and magnificent estate,’ said Candide to the turk. ‘I have only twenty acres,’ replied the old man; ‘I and my children cultivate them; and our labour preserves us from three great evils: weariness, vice, and want.’ Candide, on his way home, reflected deeply on what the old man had said. ‘This honest Turk,’ he said to Pangloss and Martin, ‘seems to be in a far better place than kings…. I also know,” said Candide, “that we must cultivate our garden.’-- Voltaire, Candide"</p>

I let them vote on the more experimental ideas.I get happily excited for each new subscription, and it all feels earned, a stark contrast to how I felt about my biweekly paychecks at corporate life.The product [0] launched on HN a year ago, and I&#39;ve worked on it almost every day since then, and after having reached some threshold of MRR, I&#39;ve since felt that I can keep working on it forever.Tonight, I&#39;m up late releasing another feature [1].

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is far too low. A fine large enough to destroy the company (as was effectively done to Purdue) would have been the only palatable outcome. And even more importantly, legal repercussions for all their employees who were personally responsible for this.All this settlement achieves is &#39;a cost of doing business&#39;, as they say. It&#39;s not punishment or deterrence. McKinsey and other companies like them will do similar in the future, and simply pay it off, again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know someone who worked for McKinsey for a few years, and some of the projects he described were straight up slimy. The one I recall right now was helping a big payday lender (read: large scale loan shark) figure out how to get their money back from people who were behind on their payments. The problem was that they can only attempt to withdraw so many times from someone&#39;s bank before they&#39;re banned, so the agreed solution was to estimate the best time of the month when the client had received their paycheck, but before they had used it to pay rent and other expenses.This person is no longer working there, and I&#39;m not surprised."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The absolutely most fascinating part of this is learning how McKinsey has long argued that making recommendations that businesses may or may not act on does not create legal liability (until this).I’m trying to see that argument applied in any other instance and it becomes totally ridiculous.“You see, your honor, I merely suggested to my client that he kill his neighbor in order to take his land, I didn’t think he’d actually DO it!”"</p>

When I was rescuing the last batch of burned CDs from my teen years a few years ago I unsurprisingly had some with lots of read errors. Googling around only lead me to forum threads where people recommended certain drives that would be very good at error recovery, but I thought it might be even better if you could get the raw stream from the disc and then do all the EFM reversal etc in software with more advanced analysis, brute forcing etc. But nothing of this kind seemed to exist."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I hope no one is saying Privacy Sandbox is worse than third party cookies, or is trusting this article to form an opinion about it. Web advertising was a $319 billion dollar industry in 2019. Does anyone wonder who may be lobbying their government to scrutinize Google and offer themselves for interviews for articles like this? Does anyone think the result of beating up Project Sandbox will be more radical privacy protection?No, I don&#39;t think this article has anything really to do with a better privacy outcome and everything to do with watering down Google&#39;s stance to something more status quo for the advertising industry.There are no actual critiques of Privacy Sandbox&#39;s APIs here. There&#39;s no mention of what critics stand to lose if Privacy Sandbox becomes the standard. There&#39;s merely hand wringing of &#34;but do you trust Google?&#34; Everyone who&#39;s made themselves available for quoting in this article is a web advertising professional, including the ones who come off as not[1][2]. None of them care about you.[1] James Rosewell is cited as director of &#34;Marketers for an Open Web.&#34; He&#39;s also the CEO of a company that specializes in device detection. His LinkedIn headline reads &#34;THE  Fastest and Most Accurate  Device Detection = more  profitable websites&#34;[2] Alan Chapell is sarcastic about Google attempting to do this openly through the w3c. He&#39;s cited as running a privacy law firm. Their web site says they represent tech companies navigating privacy issues. They aren&#39;t actual privacy advocates. https://chapellassociates.com/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google&#39;s way of leveraging their browser dominance to use 3rd party cookies as a way to gain competitive advantage:Step 1: Implement a whole new browser functionality where Google alone can track people.Step 2: Eliminate 3rd party cookies so Google&#39;s competitors have to create increasingly unethical and invasive fingerprinting techniques to remain competitive.Step 3: Increase advertising rates since they are the only company able to effectively target adverts on the web. (Profit)Did I miss anything?Google in their enthusiasm to prevent Microsoft from dominating the web has become worse than Microsoft was in its heyday."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So if I understand this correctly, then killing off 3rd party cookies is anti-competitive, leaving them in is anti-privacy, and putting out a privacy-enhancing alternative is also anti-competitive.  Is there anything that can be done that would satisfy all regulations?Also, this reminds me of a story I heard years ago, that a California oil change location needed to store oil above ground due to EPA regulations, but needed it stored underground to satisfy the fire department regulations.  So they were constantly getting fined from one or the other, and had to just include those fines as a cost of doing business."</p>

I feel slightly validated that I&#39;ve also been wrapping these by hand, since it&#39;s kind of quirky to try and auto-generate these while keeping the same usability and such as their original incarnations.For those interested in a Rust variant, I&#39;ve been hacking on one for awhile: https://github.com/ryanmcgrath/cacaoI wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s yet ready for production use, but so far it&#39;s working pretty well for me. Been dogfooding it by building an app I&#39;ve wanted for a bit - a proper magic-wormhole macOS app.One of the things I&#39;ve really wanted to keep to is the delegate pattern, since I think it actually works really well for Rust&#39;s model. A fun example I finished yesterday is ListView cell reuse:https://twitter.com/ryanmcgrath/status/1357097991081844737/p...Ultimately I view this as one of the last pieces needed for a cross-platform Rust UI framework to actually work."</p>

I was part of the demoscene way back in the late 80s-early 90s, and I just clicked randomly on some of these fonts and one of them looked familiar. However I couldn’t tell if it was one that my friend (in our demo group that I’ve long since lost touch with) had made or if I saw it in someone else’s demo... this was not a time where we concerned ourselves with archiving our work for future generations to watch. And it would be impossible to find out since my parents kept asking me whether or not to keep my old Amiga that was sitting unused for years ... and I ignored their questions and eventually they threw it away... I’m just glad Bitcoin hadn’t been invented yet — haha."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"No one is talking about the very big risk associated with this, that mental health professionals can commit you against your will with no trial, which is an erosion of civil liberties (incarceration without trial). Having known several friends who got committed and held against their will in psych wards when there was no good reason to, because their insurance was good, this is an issue.Notice they don&#39;t give any stats about outcomes, but the primary cited issue is &#34;mental health&#34; which is very vague and a subjective assessment.We should not create an extra judicial system that has no checks and balances. Otherwise we will head towards medical authoritarianism which could easily be abused by those in power (psychiatrists and others) for their own personal gain.See https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/rosalindadams/intake for an example of what I mean."</p>

Things like people walking into a business naked or sleeping in the doorway of a business, these guys get called. It&#39;s a big percentage of 911 calls in any city where you have homeless people.Usually they can help people out, but if people do get violent or belligerent, they call for police backup. That&#39;s pretty rare.Overdoses, sick homeless people, people shouting random shit at people in front of businesses, pretty much anything non violent, these guys talk them down give them a little help, drive them to a clinic, or whatever they need. It&#39;s a lot cheaper and more humane than arresting them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Germany is pathetic and spineless for letting the EU-China deal go through. Never again never meant shit, it was just virtue signaling, a lie, a fraud. Because it is happening again and Germany is using the same old spineless appeasement tactic that was taken with Nazi Germany.If you are a German citizen you really need to ask yourself how you can change your voting behaviour to ensure that the people who made the EU-China deal happen never have political power again.If good people stand by and do nothing while genocide is happening, they are not good people because good people don&#39;t tolerate genocide.And the pipeline deals that Germany have with Russia is also messed up. Western Europe has to find a backbone and soon, and stand up to totalitarian regimes and dictators. If Europe fails to be a bulwark against this scourge then it will consume Europe also.EDIT: Just to be clear, I don&#39;t suggest the west should  invade china or it&#39;s proxies, or start wars, or start proxy wars. But is not making deals with a genocidal state that much to ask? Is maybe sanctions too much to ask for? Is clear an unequivocal support for Taiwan with mutual defence pacts too much to ask for?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think my digital life would be a mess without an RSS feed reader. Because of its existence I do not need to touch Twitter, Reddit, YouTube[1], or any Mastodon instance, for example, as I can just have the updates that interest me from these networks in the comfort of my Feedbin[2] feed.While Hacker News does not provide an interface that notifies you when someone replies to you, hnrss.org provides an RSS feed for that[3], so I know when I get a reply. I also have a separate feed for Ask HN[4] and Show HN[5], so I never miss anything that may interest me, even if other people do not care about it. Heck, I found this post because it showed up on my feed reader!As a system administrator, I can use RSS to keep up to date with security issues in Ubuntu Server[6], WordPress[7], and CVEs in general, but also to follow commits in SourceHut repositories[8] and releases for pieces of software I use daily, but do not have repositories for my Linux distribution.I sure as heck hope it never go away.[1] In the YouTube case, with RSS, mpv, and youtube-dl, I never even have to see their web interface.[2] https://feedbin.com/[3] https://hnrss.org/replies?id=${YOURUSERNAME}[4] https://hnrss.org/ask[5] https://hnrss.org/show[6] https://usn.ubuntu.com/usn/rss.xml[7] https://www.exploit-db.com/rss.xml[8] https://git.sr.ht/~${USERNAME}/${REPO}/log/rss.xml"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve mentioned this on HN before, one pattern I&#39;ve noticed is a lot of sites tend to truncate their RSS feed so you have to click through to see the full article etc. This is mostly OK but kinda frustrating, as in the before-covid times I used to ride the London Underground a lot where no celluar signal is available in the tunnels - so my offline RSS reader would be useless.So I wrote a little web service accepts an RSS feed, and then crawls each link in it, parses the HTML to extract the text using one of those text extraction libraries, and then &#34;republishes&#34; a new version of the feed (with the full article) which I then subscribe to in my RSS reader so I can read the articles offline, e.g.example.com/rss?feed=foo.net/artcles/rssI&#39;ve never open sourced it though because I guess it&#39;s a bit of a grey area - the sites want you to go to the full URL so they can show you ads etc"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I provide an RSS feed for my blog. From my access.log, I see that there is a decent number of subscribers to my feed. Here is the data I could pull from it:  Feedly           91 subscribers
  Inoreader        16 subscribers
  Feedbin           6 subscribers
  NewsBlur          4 subscribers
  The Old Reader    3 subscribers
  BazQux            2 subscribers
  WordPress         2 subscribers
  -------------------------------
  Total           124 subscribers

I get about 4000-6000 hits to my website on a normal day. It increases by 5 to 10 times if a post hits the HN front page. When I publish new post, I see from the HTTP referer information in the logs that about 30 or so hits come from users who find a link to my post in their feed reader. These are very small numbers but they are good enough to keep the feed alive."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A long time ago, due to an improbable sequence of events, I found myself teaching Computer Graphics at my alma mater, a year after I took the class myself. Over the following five years or so, my approach to the subject evolved, and I really got the hang of it.
After I stopped teaching, I took my notes, handouts and slides, and made them into a series of articles that I put on my website, where they remained in relative obscurity. Hacker News managed to find it every once in a while, and it was generally well received, but nothing came out of this. Until April 2019. It made the HN front page again [0], except this time it caught the attention of an editor in No Starch Press [1].Long story short, today I’m incredibly grateful and excited to tell you that CGFS is coming out as a real book, with pages and all [2]. The folks at NSP graciously agreed to let me publish the updated contents, the product of almost two years of hard editing and proofreading work, for free on my website [3]. But if you’d like to preorder the printed or ebook version, you can use the coupon code MAKE3DMAGIC to get a 35% discount at https://nostarch.com/computer-graphics-scratch.I’m still somewhat in disbelief that my work is getting published as a book, and this genuinely wouldn’t have happened without your support. So once again, THANK YOU :)[0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19584921[1] http://nostarch.com[2] https://nostarch.com/computer-graphics-scratch[3] http://gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hey HN,I’m the author, Haven has been my side project for a little while.  The core idea is that we should be able to make it easy for anyone to host their own private webpage as an alternative to centralized social media.A lot of the decentralized community seems to have chosen federated models as the solution to “self-hosting is hard”.  I’m trying something different.  With core web technologies as the foundation, my mom or my wife’s grandmother can visit my site with any web browser and I’m still able to exclude the rest of the world.  For technical people, self-hosting is made easy with a one-line AWS deployment script, and an install script for the Raspberry Pi Zero W.  I’d like less-technical people to be able to use this too so I’m exploring providing paid hosting as a service.I think of Haven as a Facebook-alternative, but probably not a Twitter alternative.  I see Facebook as selling itself more as “stay in touch with your friends and family” where Twitter is more about “see what interesting people are saying”.  The latter has discovery as a core component.  With Haven everything is private so discovery wouldn’t make any sense.There’s nothing new here in terms of technology--server-side rendered web pages using Ruby on Rails, no javascript frameworks, RSS using HTTP basic auth.  But also no analytics libraries or ad-tracking.  Pages are lightweight and load really fast.  I’ve even provided a limited ability to add custom CSS so you can really make your page your own.I would love any feedback you want to share.  Both from a technical or installation side, feedback on the public webpage, as well as thoughts on communities that might be interested to learn about Haven.Thank you!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem I have with this is that it makes people create and manage an account. My 90 year old grandmother is not gonna manage that.I made a little hack for wordpress that lets you run a wordpress blog and have a shared security question that lets people access content. A simple question like &#34;What is the name of the family dog?&#34; or &#34;What is grandpa&#39;s nickname?&#34;, something like that. Not industrial strength security, but enough to keep it sorta private and out of search.The nifty part is that with wordpress and Jetpack, people can sign up for posts by email, so every time you post, your friends/family can get an email with the updates. No need to even visit the blog. Perfect for grandma.Here&#39;s the two files that make it work, in case anyone is interested:
https://gist.github.com/justinph/f0fb937d1ee418a45bfb85e91e4..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Love the idea. We&#39;ve got kids and try to keep their likenesses off the public / data-slurping internet (Google, FB/WA/Insta, etc) by sending photos to friends and family via Signal.The downside is that everything&#39;s ephemeral. I&#39;ve long thought there was room for a private network where you can pub/sub to people you care about.  Sort of a simple and private Livejournal / Blogger.FWIW I think the self-hosting bit isn&#39;t where the opportunity is.  It&#39;s in hosted private sharing. One thing I&#39;d do is create landing pages for people who want to share privately and have $$. Parents are the first group that comes to mind.I wish you success - the world needs what you&#39;re doing!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Arrow is the most important thing happening in the data ecosystem right now. It&#39;s going to allow you to run your choice of execution engine, on top of your choice of data store, as though they are designed to work together. It will mostly be invisible to users, the key thing that needs to happen is that all the producers and consumers of batch data need to adopt Arrow as the common interchange format.BigQuery recently implemented the storage API, which allows you to read BQ tables, in parallel, in Arrow format: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/storageSnowflake has adopted Arrow as the in-memory format for their JDBC driver, though to my knowledge there is still no way to access data in parallel from Snowflake, other than to export to S3.As Arrow spreads across the ecosystem, users are going to start discovering that they can store data in one system and query it in another, at full speed, and it&#39;s going to be amazing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Excited to see this release&#39;s official inclusion of the pure Julia Arrow implementation [1]!It&#39;s so cool to be able mmap Arrow memory and natively manipulate it from within Julia with virtually no performance overhead. Since the Julia compiler can specialize on the layout of Arrow-backed types at runtime (just as it can with any other type), the notion of needing to build/work with a separate &#34;compiler for fast UDFs&#34; is rendered obsolete.It feels pretty magical when two tools like this compose so well without either being designed with the other in mind - a testament to the thoughtful design of both :) mad props to Jacob Quinn for spearheading the effort to revive/restart Arrow.jl and get the package into this release.[1] https://github.com/JuliaData/Arrow.jl"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great work! It makes me wonder if a few things could be possible:1. Make the surface of the ball a multitouch trackpad surface so you could pinch zoom in and out and two finger scroll up and down, all on the ball itself. Make it only work when the ball is not pressed on hard enough to move.2. Make the ball slightly squeezable, which registers as a click. That way you could roll it around on your desk or on the base. This honestly would also be a great kids computer toy so they don&#39;t have to get their hands near the device itself.3. Add electromagnets inside on all sides and place the ball on a magnetic trackpad or base. When squeezed it would turn on the downward-facing electromagnet in the ball to make it harder to move, so you could engage in finer detail work.Probably a materials challenge to do any of these but it would be really cool to see these new input frontiers explored."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The more absurd thing is criticism of Yellen on this part is being defended - by the White House press secretary no less - as a woman&#39;s right to use her skills to make money. Yes, women should absolutely be able to rise to their talent and ambition, but it&#39;s a clear conflict of interest for government official. It&#39;s a disingenuous use of the most vacuous forms of language to defend open corruption.But then again, if we wanted finance experts to chair the Fed and be the treasury secretary without any prior monetary relationships with banks and hedge funds, we would probably have just some academics. A lot of academics in economics/finance get paid for legal testimony on behalf of companies and such, too."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Regulatory capture is a gigantic problem, especially in finance.It’s obvious that we don’t have the right incentive structure with the SEC, either. If you can make 20x more using the skills you’d need to investigate companies trading instead, the talent pool is reduced to those motivated by power/ideology. I’ve always thought financial regulators should have some kind of incentive structure that closes this gap but it’s not clear how to do that without skewing the enforcement priorities."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;The nice thing about options is that there isn’t just one way to lose money. No, you can lose money in many different ways – far more than I can write on this page.This is the most important lesson of options. It&#39;s never just a coin flip. You have an unimaginably huge number of factors riding against your success. It&#39;s not even remotely close to a 50/50 win/lose scenario. There are a million ways to lose, and just a few narrow ways to win. You literally have better odds going to the roulette table and placing a bet on red."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Building an online course[1] has been one of the easiest ways to make money in my personal experience. Other things I&#39;ve tried building: SaaS, Trades business, Freelancing business.I&#39;ve made over $8k since I launched last month and it&#39;s been a great stepping stone into other ideas. The main problem I see going forward is getting consistent traffic. Building the course was the &#34;easy&#34; part and now I&#39;m focusing hard on SEO to keep consistent traffic going to my page. Long term I think I can make $100-$300 a day with it.I floundered trying to build SaaS and other types of business for years before making some money online. Selling a one time purchase can be a game changer for those looking to go independent. Look at the stairstep approach[2] for reasons why this works so well.Overall, if you invest a few days and put something out there, I think an online course can be a great way to build some income.[1] https://www.vim.so

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is good advice. I wrote a bunch of novels, got a degree - a Ph.D. in philosophy to make sure I&#39;ll never make any money and people who have money wouldn&#39;t want to give it to me -, and did some Internet advertising. Not very surprisingly, I&#39;m fairly poor. However, I&#39;ve still managed to save a little bit of money so maybe I should start trading now."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It is such a shame that nowadays even these high priced devices are contributing to the enormous e-waste we are all piling up.It used to be like this: You spend A LOT of money for really nice headphones and use them (potentially) your lifetime. Or hand it down to your kids as your hearing gets worse. Sound doesn’t change much and the plug has been around for ages.Nowadays it goes like this: You buy your expensive Apple headphones. And even though Apple is probably supporting these longer than your average earbuds, after a while the bluetooth version will be obsolete and eventually the battery will have reached its end or inflate and become a safety risk.But because this was expensive and Apple supported it longer, it will have maybe lasted 10 years and one or two (pricey) battery replacements. This is still much worse than audiophile „analog“ headphones and I feel like this change is not adequately addressed.I would really hope to see more approaches like Shure‘s „Aonic 215 True Wireless“ which is an arguably quite ugly attachment to the drivers that have been around for a long while and just adds the wireless capabilities and bluetooth. It can also be used for any other Shure driver afaik. This way you keep the good old sound producing piece while swapping out the stuff that will degrade over time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a detailed, well-written review, but like most mainstream headphone reviews it makes me cringe a little. Though masked somewhat by self-deprecating remarks, there&#39;s audiophile &#34;woo&#34; peaking out from behind the corner (e.g. the comment about lossless compression). More importantly, it&#39;s missing the most important part of a headphone review: a measurement of the frequency response curve!It&#39;s fairly well known that above the ~$100 price level, headphone sound quality differences mostly disappear once equalized properly [0]. The real test is not stock AirPods versus H9i (as done in the review), it&#39;s AirPods versus H9i once they&#39;re both equalized to a common frequency target. Otherwise you&#39;re testing the manufacturer&#39;s tuning as much as the actual quality of the hardware.Certainly, there&#39;s something to be said for the manufacturer getting it right in the first place so you don&#39;t have to bother with EQ when listening on a mobile device, etc. But I think the following two points are likely true:1) People will score the AirPods highly in subjective listening tests;2) The performance in those listening tests has more to do with the frequency tuning of the AirPods than anything about its hardware, and you could get a virtually identical listening experience with a $100 to $200 pair of Sennheisers and an EQ app.[0] See e.g. http://seanolive.blogspot.com/2017/02/twirt-337-predicting-h.... Sean Olive has a bunch of papers on this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;It is, therefore, my sworn duty to be skeptical of consumer technology companies encroaching on the territory of high-end audio equipment built by companies with decades of experience.&gt; but their track record with audio hardware is inconsistent. Somehow, the company that makes the HomePod—a marvel of mono speaker engineering—is also the company that continues to make and sell Beats products.When Beats were acquired by Apple. Especially with Jimmy Iovine in charge of Apple Music ( initially ). I was extremely worried that any of the crap Beats made infect Apple&#39;s Audio. Turns out Apple has Firewalled their department pretty well. I remember reading one of the story about HomePod team asking Jimmy Iovine&#39;s opinion on its audio quality. His reply was his usual &#34; You need more Bass&#34;.Apple audio engineering teams consist of many engineers from Bowers &amp; Wilkins . One of my favourite brand in Audio Equipment. ( I think, I could be wrong, Steve Jobs likes Bowers &amp; Wilkins too ) And you should notice their taste of Audio have many similar traits.So Beats continue to make crap, they did improve somewhat since Apple&#39;s purchased them. And Apple, continues to be Apple.But that is only with Audio, the AirPods Max Hardware Design is very much modern Apple and non-Bowers &amp; Wilkins. The weight and comfort issues. Something about Apple&#39;s Design Department changed ever since Steve Jobs is not there to be the Editor to edit things. Things like Keyboard, TrackPad or Headsets. User Comfort and usage are no longer the 1st priority. Instead it is aesthetics and design goals, that could be material ( the need to use Metal ), thinner or colour.Design is how it works, not how it looks. Hopefully recent Mac changes meant they learned a thing or two."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; This journey began some 27 years ago. Amazon was only an idea, and it had no name.Jeff&#39;s pitch at the time (1997); so on point, so precise: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWRbTnE1PEM&gt; The question I was asked most frequently at that time was, “What’s the internet?” Blessedly, I haven’t had to explain that in a long while.Here&#39;s Jeff explaining the Internet (at a TED talk): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMKNUylmanQ&gt; Invention. Invention is the root of our success. We’ve done crazy things together, and then made them normal... If you get it right, a few years after a surprising invention, the new thing has become normal. People yawn. And that yawn is the greatest compliment an inventor can receive.Jeff speaking about innovation, invention (based on first principles), making data-driven decisions (and also when to not trust data), learned helplessness at Stanford (2005): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhnDvvNS8zQ&gt; When times have been good, you’ve been humble.Heh. Reminds me of this 2008 lecture where Jeff is selling AWS to startup school students: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nKfFHuouzA Classic.&gt; Amazon couldn’t be better positioned for the future. We are firing on all cylinders, just as the world needs us to.Not sure about that last part, Jeff.So long, and thanks for all the fish."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"According to a post in the comments, the author is 18 years old which means that I&#39;ve been using Linux longer than the author has been making use of the blood in his veins. But that does not mean that I didn&#39;t learn something from his post!While the technical accomplishments and understanding are commendable, I think that the main takeaway for me is the excellent approach to learning. Keeping it simple and taking an open-minded approach to learning (as exemplified by his attitude toward systemd) is an approach that more people could stand to take. So often we complicate things in our heads to the point where they seem unknowable and so we assume that they are too difficult and we don&#39;t try. I have seen this in myself at times and I see it others as well.I&#39;ll be sharing this post at work so that the people who I work with who don&#39;t really understand Linux so well can appreciate the approach that was taken and hopefully also glean something from the excellent write-up itself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The first thing I did was to read the entire Wikipedia page on UNIX.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Projects like these is exactly what university use for teaching too! You&#39;re way ahead of the curve.For example CMU also makes you write your own shell. The main focus is implementing job control like: jobs, fg, bg, and various signal handlers in order to understand how forking child processes work.I see that your shell doesn&#39;t handle much other than cd so this might be a nice next step if you want to continue working on it. (I can&#39;t find a good public link for it but you can probably follow along using: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15213-s02/www/ap...)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; In the case of Wayland, the “vague authority” are a bunch of volunteers who have devoted tens of thousands of hours of their free time towards making free shit for you.That does not mean anyone is under an obligation to like it.&gt; Maybe Wayland doesn’t work for your precious use-case. More likely, it does work, and you swallowed some propaganda based on an assumption which might have been correct 7 years ago.If you insist on disregarding people&#39;s use cases, don&#39;t be surprised they don&#39;t like your software. I&#39;ve been down this road a lot with FOSS software: &#34;I don&#39;t use it because it doesn&#39;t do what I need&#34;, &#34;sure it does!&#34;, &#34;no, it really doesn&#39;t&#34;, &#34;well you don&#39;t need that anyway!&#34;...On the whole however, I can certainly understand the frustration at having to deal with a community that gets annoyed at anything that changes simply because they&#39;re already so used to the garbage pile they have that they now hold the delusion that it&#39;s actually not garbage.In my admittedly somewhat distanced opinion, Wayland&#39;s biggest mistakes were not launching with a coherent strategy for replicating functionality like screen sharing, screenshots, and to a lesser extent remote desktop/applications. They just punted and said &#34;that&#39;s a compositor problem!&#34; as though that was supposed to make it ok. People have thus harbored some inherent resentment ever since."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have no beef with Wayland specifically and I agree that if you are harassing maintainers of any project you&#39;re probably an asshole. However,&gt;Maybe Wayland doesn’t work for your precious use-case. More likely, it does work, and you swallowed some propaganda based on an assumption which might have been correct 7 years ago.I&#39;m a game developer. None of the software I use works reliably or at all on Wayland. None of it. And I&#39;m completely fine with that, I&#39;ll keep using Xorg and you can give me a call when my &#34;precious use-case&#34; is handled."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m using a Dell UP2718Q (3840x2160, 144dpi, 60Hz) and a Fujitsu Siemens P17-2 (1024x1280, 96dpi, 75Hz) side by side, and without Wayland this setup isn’t even possible to get working properly. Sadly, KDE still doesn’t support it nicely under Wayland (so I moved to Ubuntu Budgie), but under X11 it’s entirely impossible to run it properly, as except for Qt nothing supports mixed DPI, or mixed refresh rates properly.Once proper wide color gamut and bitdepth support is added, it’ll be even better, as the monitors are 10-bit Rec.2020 and 8-bit sRGB. Which under X11 isn’t even possible to support, as again, Xorg only sees one single screen it’s drawing on, and it’s up to the lower levels of the stack to split that.EDIT: Answering the most common question which is asked all the time as my comment is getting some visibility here:Now why does wayland break screenshot and keyboard tools? Because &#34;every program is a keylogger by default and can see any event, look at the contents of any window&#34; is a major security issue, especially as it means the entire security model of screen lockers or containerized applications is useless.Under X11, basically every application you run can trivially escalate itself to root. As even your Zoom client can just listen to your key events when you unlock your screen or use sudo in your terminal, save your password, and tada it can elevate itself. Under X11, there is no security whatsoever, and no separation of privileges.EDIT2: Why is sandboxing applications important? (a) more and more proprietary software is also released for linux, which you probably shouldn’t trust. And (b) if e.g. your XMPP client is compromised, you don’t want the attacker to gain root.EDIT3: Yes, screenshot tools and screensharing still works. I can use KDE Spectacle under Budgie or Chrome, and Slack, Teams, Discord, Jitsi all work just fine. OBS requires a patch, but also works nicely. It’s not impossible, it just requires software using it to be updated."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I review a lot of technical software documentation. This is one of my go-to resources for explaining how docs should be organized. These ideas are generally accepted among software technical writers; you may just hear them use slightly different words for each doc type. E.g. I use &#34;overview&#34; instead of &#34;explanation&#34;. I&#39;ll also mention that this framework isn&#39;t comprehensive; there are other types of critical documents that aren&#39;t explained here, such as release notes. I think the key breakthrough with Divio&#39;s framework is getting authors to think about docs in terms of desired goals and outcomes: learning-oriented, problem-oriented, etc.Edit: I suppose you could argue that release notes fall under the category of reference-oriented, but when I look at the guidelines for reference docs it&#39;s clear that the Divio people were thinking about API references."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of the origin of this work is from Jacob Kaplan-Moss who did the original refactor of the Django documentation. He wrote up the concepts here in 2009:https://jacobian.org/series/great-documentation/Daniele Procida built on this and formalized it through this resource, which is really amazing and definitely the best resource for writing docs that I know of."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Sites are not detecting a portrait screen and deciding that they&#39;re displaying on a phone.  Someone who switches their monitor to portrait, or resizes a window to be taller than it is wide, is still going to get the desktop view.In this case the author is scaling their resolution, and so their browser is presenting itself to sites as 720px wide.  Sites see that and show a layout optimized for a screen of that width.  Those sites are acting correctly.The author&#39;s proposed solution is for sites to use DPI instead, but this would thwart the preferences of users who use scaling because they want the whole site to look bigger."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like I must be missing something, because I don&#39;t understand this author&#39;s point at all.&#34;Lots of websites think “Vertical Screen == Mobile User”!&#34;
No, they don&#39;t - They think a 720px wide screen is a tablet user, which is probably a fair assumption.I could equally write &#34;Just because I browse zoomed in 500% doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m on a mobile&#34;When you zoom in, things get bigger, so fewer of them will fit on the screen... You have a choice between horizontal scrolling, or the website showing you the version of itself designed for smaller viewports.Looking at the &#34;How it should render&#34; screens - I just checked the Guardian site, and that is exactly how the website looks at 1080px wide. The author admits that because of their zoom solution they are running at an effective width of 720px, so maybe just.. don&#39;t do that??The proposed solution doesn&#39;t seem to solve anything, because physical size of the screen isn&#39;t the full story, it also depends on how far away from the screen the user is - which the browser can never know."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a product manager, my immediate response is... not worth the time.You&#39;ve chosen to have a unique setup, which is fine, but your use case represents some absolutely miniscule fraction of users. On top of that, it&#39;s not even that websites are unusable, just that they&#39;re not ideal.When you decide to do weird/special/unique stuff, don&#39;t expect the world to adapt to you. You can rotate your monitor back or live with it. The idea that companies should spend engineering/QA/PM resources to deal with this is... vain."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The author&#39;s success commercializing something that he needed chimed with me.I feel like this is a common thing - kinda like the old adage you&#39;d hear at school that goes something like &#34;if you have a question about something, chances are at least a couple of other people in class have the same question&#34;.I wonder how many startups that are &#34;think of it as an uber-for-....&#34; are there because of actual genuine &amp; real needs that people have, or just that people think will make them rich.A decade-plus ago I was in the same situation as the author - a problem that I had and no obvious simple solution that I could find.  I ended up admitting that the thing I was looking for didn&#39;t exist, so I made it (website in this case so very small risk/outlay).  It made a boat load of income from ad revenue back when CPMs were better (still exists these days but revenue is way way down on what it was - perhaps less than &lt;5% - and my regular work salary these days  totally eclipses even what it was at its peak anyway).There must be so many of these sorts of stories on HN - someone scratching their own itch, only to find out that others have the same."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Author here. Happy to answer any questions or take any feedback about this post.HN has been a huge part of my experience bootstrapping my business. I&#39;ve learned a great deal from articles and discussions here, and I&#39;ve received tremendous support and advice when I share updates about my projects. I hope you enjoy this summary of my third year."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just read your whole journey since quitting google and it was very inspiring, thank you :) Glad to hear you still feel like it was the right choice.
I am now where you were 3 years ago: I just quit my well-paid SWE job without any concrete backup plan and all I have been dreaming of for years is being an entrepreneur.
It either happens now when I&#39;m still young, or never, I figured.However, I am still quite unsure how to actually get the ball rolling. 
My current game plan is to just brainstorm for a week or so and then start building the best idea I came up with during that week, then give myself a release deadline of one month for an MVP and see if I can raise some interest.But after reading the paragraph about ideas[1] I am not sure anymore if this is a smart approach or not... 
What do you think, what&#39;s the best thing to do to get to that initial spark?[1]: https://mtlynch.io/solo-developer-year-2/#pursuing-the-right...(sry, non-native speaker)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Regarding the first paragraphs where luddism is mentioned several times; Lord Byron, father to Ada Lovelace the first programmer, was one of the few on the House of Lords to defend the Luddites:&gt; But the police, however useless, were by no means idle: several notorious delinquents had been detected; men liable to conviction, on the clearest evidence, of the capital crime of poverty; men, who had been nefariously guilty of lawfully begetting several children, whom, thanks to the times!—they were unable to maintain. Considerable injury has been done to the proprietors of the improved frames. These machines were to them an advantage, inasmuch as they superseded the necessity of employing a number of workmen, who were left in consequence to starve. By the adoption of one species of frame in particular, one man performed the work of many, and the superfluous labourers were thrown out of employment. [...] These men never destroyed their looms till they were become useless, worse than useless; till they were become actual impediments to their exertions in obtaining their daily bread.There is a lot of proganda use of &#34;luddites&#34; as anti-tech when luddites main grief was regarding income and inequality.[1]: http://www.luddites200.org.uk/LordByronspeech.html[2]: https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/byron-was-one-few-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A comment I made on this when it was posted a few days ago:I am surprised that this was regarded as a close decision. I guess a lot depends on wording, but when one person is predicting the dollar will be worthless, and the person in the role of judge claims that given global economic uncertainty, it&#39;s a &#34;close&#34; question, I wonder if they&#39;re just saying that to be diplomatic.Obviously there&#39;s a lot of uncertainty, but one way to think about it, is that it can get so much worse than it currently is. And it seems like the predictions being wagered over were pointing to the &#34;so much worse&#34;. I think the same holds for the environment, and for the proposed war between rich and poor.I get the temptation to treat those as close, because there&#39;s tensions that you could imagine leading to some worst case scenarios. And so one might want to acknowledge the tension, and you want to put that acknowledgment into some sort of partial credit. But I think that way of thinking gets all confused and hair splitty, and comes from a place of thinking everything&#39;s a trick question, and not wanting to be perceived as overlooking nuances.Anyhow, credit to all parties involved for formalizing their discussion and getting a bet out of it. I think those kinds of conversations are valuable, and I think it helps to get people thinking about what it takes for beliefs to be true over the long run."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Has Tech Destroyed Society?I recently watched the documentary The Man Who Saved the World[0], about Stanislav Petrov, who one day in 1983 made the decision to ignore the early warning system computers telling him the USA had fired 5 missiles at the USSR.[1] It seems had he followed orders, a report to his superiors would have resulted in mass retaliation. The decision was in his hands.In the movie, as well as a reenactment of the incident, the real Petrov visits the USA to speak at the UN, and visits Kevin Costner, his favourite actor. Costner asks him how many people would have died if not for his actions that day. You expect him to say millions.  Petrov explains that everyone on the planet would&#39;ve died.They visit a disused missile silo in the USA and Petrov explains to a guard there that just one of those missiles had more explosive force than all the weapons used in WW2. According to this page[2], in 1985 the USA had 21,000+ nuclear weapons, USSR 39,000+.It&#39;s very chilling, to say the least. It makes humans seem so very crazy, to create the possibility of that situation in the first place. Petrov explains emotionally to the guard that the Russian people wanted peace, and thought the USA wanted to attack them.I can&#39;t help thinking about that, reading about Whether Tech Has Destroyed Society?[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_Who_Saved_the_World[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983_Soviet_nuclear_false_alar...[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_nuclear_weapons_sto..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Anybody knows if Scaleway it&#39;s better than the parent company?I was an online.net costumer for a lot of years for a personal project, and a happy one, but then they changed the contract unilaterally, which included the billing going up almost 75% with another changes in the ToS. And look I get it, sometimes prices rises, and you can always change providers, so the problem was not that... but the customer service and poor communication.I only notice the change, after my credit card notified my of a higher charge than the ones I&#39;m used to. There was not notification about it in the dashboard. And after a lot of tickets with representatives, they told me under the excuse of &#34;ram / hdd prices are going up&#34; the notice was send through email, and probably gmail mark it as spam... and then the nightmare to cancel begin.After telling them to cancel the account, they told that under the new contract (that I didn&#39;t accept) they could only do it if I got charged another extra month, even if from the start you always payed one month in advance, plus paying the setup fee at the beginning.Look I get it, hardware it&#39;s messy and prices can go up to stay in business, but this attitude of &#34;I am altering the deal, pray I don’t alter it any further&#34; was the one that made me look for another solutions, and be skeptical about Scaleway despite in paper being a good alternative to Digital Ocean (that let me tell you, DO customer service it&#39;s gold in comparison to what I got from online)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sounds great, but I will not go for this the second time, Scaleway.Two years ago I purchased a server there, configured everything and started handling workload.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"1) I am a big fan of the general philosophy of Solid. But as others have mentioned, I&#39;ve found it extremely difficult to understand specifics of the proposal or to see concrete progress, based on publicly available resources.The best place I&#39;ve found is Ruben Verborgh&#39;s blog (he&#39;s a researcher who&#39;s affiliated with Solid). For example here&#39;s a nice post which goes into more detail on the ideas behind Solid:https://ruben.verborgh.org/blog/2017/12/20/paradigm-shifts-f...2) In terms of applications, I&#39;d personally like to see more of a focus on productivity applications, rather than so much focus on social media. Better interop between cloud SaaS apps would be valuable to businesses and professionals, and would sidestep many thorny challenges like decentralized moderation.As a concrete starting point: what if I could store my Google Docs text files on my own storage layer, and edit them in realtime using a variety of editor apps? This would resemble my ability to edit a .txt file on my computer in vim or TextEdit, but would port that metaphor to the world of modern online collaboration.Here&#39;s a short Twitter thread I wrote on this topic:https://twitter.com/geoffreylitt/status/13552551626260684823) I&#39;m very curious to see more incremental paths from the current web to a decentralized approach. For example, what if we could start annotating existing websites with private data and sharing those annotations P2P, rather than starting over from scratch?I&#39;ve explored this a bit with my Wildcard project, where users can store annotations in a &#34;spreadsheet&#34; that is linked to a web page:https://www.geoffreylitt.com/wildcard/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Every now and then this gets shared again and every time I am struck by what a terrible job the front page does of explaining what Solid is and why anyone would want to use it. Like, okay, yeah, &#34;control my own data&#34; is a nice pitch in this day and age I guess, but... what can I do with it? &#34;Any kind of data can be stored in a Solid pod, including normal files like you might store in Google Drive or Dropbox&#34; - that sounds kinda useful, where&#39;s the link to SolidFile? Is there even a SolidFile app or is that just a thing someone could make with this protocol?Hell, where&#39;s the front page link to check out the list of any apps using Solid? It&#39;s like two or three random clicks to find this page (https://solidproject.org/apps) if you are curious, and it&#39;s super uninspiring - why does one of the apps in the &#34;Showcase&#34; section at the top not even have a description?Solid always just feels like a solution looking for a problem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This post[0] by Ruben Verborgh helped me understand the problem Solid is trying to solve:&gt; In December 2019, Google and Facebook proudly announced a major milestone, which was echoed in news media all around the world: it is now possible to copy a picture from Facebook to Google Photos. This news came in mere months after we celebrated the 50th anniversary of another technological feat: the moon landing of 20 July 1969, when millions of households witnessed Neil Armstrong take a giant leap for mankind.&gt; So let me get this straight: two of the largest tech companies in history make headlines because in 2019, they move a single photo over the whopping distance of 11 km it takes from the Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park to the Googleplex in Mountain View, whereas in 1969, we sent live video signals from 380,000 km away on the actual moon?&gt; If those two companies, both widely hailed as pinnacles of technology, genuinely consider this to be innovation they are proud of, the only logical conclusion is that data-driven innovation today is fundamentally broken.&gt; The problem is widespread and not limited to technology or social media. Any sector that requires personal data to deliver services, from retail over insurance to health, suffers from the damaging effects of siloization. Companies increasingly need more access to data, but they won’t get there if they keep on collecting that data themselves.[...]0. https://ruben.verborgh.org/blog/2020/12/07/a-data-ecosystem-..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is mostly nonsense. There is nothing wrong with there being more shares short than shares outstanding. It just seems problematic, until you think it through.Person A has 1 share of company Y. Person B borrows 1 share of company Y from person A, and then sells it into the market. This is called a short sale. But person B just sold their borrowed share. Now that share is owned by person C. Person C can now lend it back out to person D, or to person B again, and the process can repeat infinitely. The idea that short interest is constrained by shares outstanding is just a fundamental misunderstanding of how the short market works.Shorting behaves the same way that fractional reserve banking does, and there is a &#39;money multiplier&#39; like leverage effect in the process. There is nothing nefarious about this, and it certainly isn&#39;t &#39;countfeiting&#39;. Short sellers provide an important service to capital markets, maybe the most important service: they help to identify mismanaged or fraudulent companies. The idea that attacking short sellers is attacking wall street is completely backwards. Most of Wall Street hates short sellers, because they drive down the prices of companies and confidence in markets (in the short run, in the long run, they increase it)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, it seems like none of the top commenters here have put in at least minimal effort to read and understand this.The author does not complain about short sellers per se or about the fact that more than 100% of a stock&#39;s float can be shorted. That is all nice and fine. Instead what the author does complain about is that fact that the (supposedly regulated) mechanisms for shorting a stock are fraught with loopholes and exceptions that make it possible for brokers and the DTC to create stocks &#34;out of thin air&#34; for the short sellers and never neutralize. This dilutes the company&#39;s stock in the process and thereby damages the company&#39;s shareholders.It is an issue that, if true, should absolutely be brought to public and regulator&#39;s attention."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author seems to be really upset about this, but I don&#39;t understand why. Nothing they are describing, if you ignore histrionic language like &#34;counterfeiting&#34;, seems especially nefarious. Maybe I am misunderstanding. Basically, a short is when A borrows from B a share of corporation C with the promise to return a share of corporation C at a later time, plus some cash interest. A naked short is where instead B gives cash equal to the value of a share of corporation C minus some interest to A, with the promise that at a later time A will deliver a share of corporation C to B. The second activity seems functionally equivalent to the first, and I don&#39;t understand why I&#39;m supposed to be outraged by either."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t have any questions directly, just wanna say that I love VLC, it&#39;s one of the first programs I install on any computer, and I will continue to use it as my primary media-viewer for the foreseeable future.The number of features that the devs have packed into VLC is staggering; I&#39;ve been using VLC for almost 15 years now, and I still find new things about it occasionally. Fun fact (though probably not as surprising to an HN crowd as it is to most people I tell this to), VLC can also be used to convert media to different formats, AND works as a quick ad-hoc media server if you want to display something on a TV.  This can be really handy if you have a video file in a weird format and want a way to quickly watch it on a device that doesn&#39;t support weird formats.I think I&#39;m going to donate.  Keep up the good work folks!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"You guys rock and the entire Linux community owes you big time.
Once you installed videolan you were ready for all media formats.
It was so tiresome to tell the people you convinced to try Linux that no, by default they couldn&#39;t play their media, that they needed gstreamer this and that.
You made the transition to Linux so much easier to lots of people by offering a simple to use very feature rich application everyone needs and uses.Thank you!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Oh my god, they don&#39;t even bother implementing the app any more...It reminds me of my first App Store experience. I made an app that was somewhat successful (about 2000€ a month, enough to pay for a students living expenses).Within short time, a chinese speaking developer cloned it. They copied the icon (slighlty different color), they copied the UI, they even copied all the text in the dialog boxes. They released the app with a slightly different name.I contacted Apple to complain about the obvious copyright infringement, but they only forwarded my complaint to the developer. Interestingly enough, the developer actually replied to me. They sent an email threating legal action. I asked them to at least change the icon, and they did. But until today, the rest of the cloned app is still on the app store and competes with my app.It&#39;s not comparable to your case, since in my case the competitor wasn&#39;t a scammer, just someone with a very lose interpretation of intellectual property.But it makes me feel that Apple really doesn&#39;t give a shit what goes on in their store, as long as they make their 30%. (or 15% from small fish like me now)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"FYI, in situations like this the best way is to:1. Register your videos and images with the USCO. It&#39;ll cost &lt;$100.2. You can now file DMCA takedowns. Send one to Apple with the USCO registration ID and a copy of the image and a link to the app in question.3. Apple will either immediately remove that fake app, or be liable for up to $350k in punitive damages for wilful infringement and lose all DMCA protection.4. If Apple didn&#39;t react a week later, approach a lawyer. They&#39;ll likely be willing to work purely for 50% commission, because it&#39;ll be a slam dunk in court.5. Repeat the same with Facebook / Youtube if they advertise there with your images or videos. Take Screenshots and write down the url and date and time.Of course, one would hope that Apple will do the right thing, but it&#39;s also reasonably easy to force their hand.That said, I don&#39;t know anyone for whom app development worked out financially if you fairly price your own labor. So maybe just stay away from cheap apps in general."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m dumbfounded at Google&#39;s lack of planning on this. I tried Stadia, and they had (have?) so few games that they seem to have neither search nor pagination on the list that you can play. None of the games are ones that I care about.It feels like they could have—at the cost of short-term profit and pride—partnered with Valve and shipped something mind-blowing. But instead we&#39;re left with a bunch of AAA games that feel half-baked (Hitman crashes on first boot and complains about a lack of a controller) and a bunch of indie games that feel like a sad attempt to squeeze a few extra bucks out of a middling title (the Hello Neighbor hide and seek game) and titles released half a decade ago (superhot).Minecraft is on every console imaginable—except Stadia. What about Roblox? Fortnite? Factorio? Among Us? Any Sid Meier&#39;s game? Any Paradox game? Every genre of game that I actually put time into is completely absent on their platform. Every game from the top 10 (perhaps 20 or more?) on Twitch right now is absent on Stadia. I don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing, but whatever it is, it&#39;s wrong."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know Google/Stadia recently partnered with LG to bundle the Stadia app with LG TVs, but I wonder why Google doesn&#39;t do this with every TV manufacturers (save Sony.)If I were Stadia&#39;s marketing chief, I&#39;d1. Bribe the TV manufacturers to include the Stadia app2. Advertise that the TV includes _a game console_ during TV commercials.3. Allow the TV users to pay a bit extra ($20?) to buy a basic game controller.4. Have all the store demo units to auto stream Stadia playing video games and explicitly explain you don&#39;t need a xbox/playstation to play these games.5. Buy out Witcher 3/Call of Duty 4/Project Cars 2/other older games and make them free for TVs with Stadia bundles.Most smart TVs these days are more than fast enough to stream HD broadcast. I don&#39;t understand why Google doesn&#39;t push this.Fiddling with my phone to play Stadia on my TV is pretty crumple some. It&#39;s just too much work for normal folks. People just want to turn on the TV and start playing.Edit: I guess monopolistic abuse is a concern. However Sony and MS have their own streaming services. Google can just advertise &#39;play games with Stadia and Playstation Now and Xbox Cloud on your TV!&#39; I am 100% if players switch to playing games on TV without game consoles, it hurts MS/Sony a lot more than to Google."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is totally the right move.  I am a (very happy) user of Stadia. If you haven&#39;t tried it, you really should...it&#39;s an amazing piece of tech. I can find myself with 20-30 minutes worth of downtime during the day, fire up Cyberpunk 2077 or Hitman or Assassin&#39;s Creed in moments from my browser *on a macbook* and play at high settings with no noticeable lag.Obviously you need a strong, steady internet connection for Stadia to shine, but I&#39;d guess that the HN crowd skews towards that.If you&#39;re an old gamer who wants to play newer games but doesn&#39;t have a ton of time and don&#39;t want to drop $1k+ on a gaming rig, check out Stadia.The game library does leave a lot to be desired, no question about that. But this decision seems to be the right move to mitigate that by giving developers better access to getting their games on Stadia rather than Google trying to be both the platform and the content."</p>

The only reason to not use it would be if you are literally pushing the boundaries of NLP or building something super specialized.Hugging Face and Spacy (also Pytorch, but duh) are saving millions of dollars in man hours for companies around the world. They&#39;ve been a revelation."</p>

Would it still be interesting for me?"</p>

You can read a lot more about it here: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/alternatives/If you have questions or problems, you can ask in GitHub issues: https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/issues/new/chooseThere&#39;s also an official Discord chat: https://discord.gg/VQjSZaeJmfAnd finally, if you use FastAPI, I would love your input in the first user survey (you could win stickers ): https://tripetto.app/run/RXZ6OLDBXX?s=hn"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Huge FastAPI fan here.I use it for my projects (and one project even makes enough revenue that I sponsor Sebastián’s work through GitHub sponsors at $250/mo) and it for sure has increased my development velocity.It’s an absolute joy to work with. The automated interactive docs are great for iteration. Type hints as first class citizens is an awesome developer experience that I didn’t think I wanted.Using the auto generated OpenAPI you can even generate client side code and typings to interact with your API.It feels like flask but with lots of quality of life improvements.[1] https://www.vim.so"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"FAST Api is a nice library, but it uses code-based api specifications. It&#39;s generates the spec from code. So you need to write your API code by hand first, and do serialization manually...This is an important distinction and might not be what you want.Using spec first API design makes more sense IMHO.
You first spec your API (Either in OpenAPI or GRPC or whatever Interface Definition Language you use). This allows Backend and Frontend developers to change the API definition.From there you generate all type-save model objects, client and server stubs, and fill in the implementation with full type hinting.At my current company, we wrote OpenAPI specs first, no need to know Python. And use https://openapi-generator.tech/ to generate both the Python server, python client and typescript client. We&#39;re looking into generate Kotlin and Swift clients too...I&#39;m a big proponent of spec first API design. It&#39;s much cheaper to agree on a spec first before you start coding.But it depends on what you are doing.Personally I like GRPC best, since the code generators are top notch.Very good article on this principle:https://medium.com/apis-and-digital-transformation/openapi-a...First, stop writing interface code for your APIs by hand.
Second, stop writing interface code for your APIs by hand.
Third, stop writing interface code for your APIs by hand.We&#39;re living in 2021... Every time I see somebody manually mapping an objects to a JSON dictionary I&#39;m crying in the inside. It&#39;s like writing machine code by hand."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wow, how has nobody noticed this before? This looks seriously rotten:&gt; Michigan-based entrepreneur Robert Simpson decided to see what would happen if he bought the entire stock of one company. Using a single broker, within a couple of days Simpson had paid a little over $5,000 for 1,285,050 shares in OTC bulletin board property-development company Global Links. According to Simpson, these shares were delivered into his account shortly afterwards. Yet the following day 37,044,500 Global Links shares were traded on the bulletin board. The next day, 22,471,000 shares were traded. On neither day had Simpson traded a single Global Link share, he insists. And events surrounding Simpson&#39;s investments became yet more confusing. Global Links had only ever issued 1,158,064 shares. Simpson had managed to acquire 126,986 shares that did not exist. How he had managed to be sold more shares than were in issuance is exactly the question Simpson hoped his foray would raise."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Recent events have a lot of people confusing high short interest with naked shorting.A stock can have short interest greater than 100% without any naked shorting.How is this possible? The textbook definition of a &#34;short sale&#34; is that someone borrows stock and then, literally, sells it short. The buyer of the stock is free and clear to do whatever they want with the stock, including re-lend it for another short sale. Wikipedia has a good primer on how this works: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_(finance)This has created a lot of confusion on WallstreetBets, where many participants have come to believe that Gamestop&#39;s short interest of 113% means that there are 13% more shares shorted than long positions to cover. It&#39;s not true, though, because the long interest is always greater than the short interest."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Summary:Every so often, someone gets very steamed about short selling, often with no real reason. Back in 2005, someone got very steamed about short selling, and then got a journalist to write a somewhat confused article about it. It&#39;s not clear anything was actually wrong then, but in any case, the rules have been changed a few times since then, so there doesn&#39;t seem to be any obvious relevance to current times.It&#39;s also worth noting that there&#39;s no real theoretical basis for why naked short selling would be harmful, no real empirical evidence showing it is harmful, no general laws against it, and the structure of the market allows and expects it to take place in some specific cases. If your mental model is that the stock market is a tool to allow people to trade a fixed number of concrete objects back and forth, this probably seems odd, but since that&#39;s not really a good model of how the stock market works or is intended to work, it&#39;s not clear that means much."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Summary: if you have an index on a column which is mostly NULL, consider using a partial index covering only the records where it&#39;s non-NULL."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Partial indexes are amazing but you have to keep in mind some pecularities.If your query doesn&#39;t contain a proper match with the WHERE clause of the index - the index will not be used. It is easy to forget about it or to get it wrong in subtle ways. Here is an example from work.There was an event tracing structure which contained the event severity_id. Id values 0-6 inclusive are user facing events. Severity 7 and up is debug events. In practice all debug events were 7 and there were no other values above 7. This table had a partial index with WHERE severity_id &lt; 7.
I tracked down a performance regression, when an ORM (due to programmer error) generated WHERE severity_id != 7. The database is obviously not able to tell that there will never be any values above 7 so the index was not used slowing down event handling. Turning the query to match &lt; 7 fixes the problem. The database might also not be able to infer that the index can be indeed used, for example when prepared statements are involved WHERE severity_id &lt; ?. The database will not be able to tell that all bindings of ? will satisfy &lt; 7 so will not use the index (unless you are running PG 12, then that might depend on the setting of plan_cache_mode[1] but I have not tested that yet).Another thing is that HOT updates in PostgreSQL can&#39;t be performed if the updated field is indexed but that also includes being part of a WHERE clause in a partial index. So you could have a site like HN and think that it would be nice to index stories WHERE vote &gt; 100 to quickly find more popular stories. That index however would nullify the possiblity of a hot update when the vote tally would be updated. Again, not a problem but you need to know the possible drawbacks.That said, they are great when used for the right purpose. Kudos to the author for a nice article![1] - https://postgresqlco.nf/doc/en/param/plan_cache_mode/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Partial indexes can flip query plans if the covered part becomes so small that it won&#39;t be represented when sampled by the stats collector. The planner could then decide that the index scan isn&#39;t worth it and could try an alternative less efficient index if one exists."</p>

Release integration should be trivial to implement.Release integration is trivial for anyone. It&#39;s the easiest and most irrelevant part of the app stores.&gt; Unlike Google they actually listen to their users. They were awesome during youtube-dl debacle.And controversial on others, like shutting down Popcorn Time&#39;s repository. As any other, they&#39;ll listen if there&#39;s enough outcry.&gt; Backed by Microsoft. Microsoft has been playing good by the developers for years now. I trust them more than Apple and Google.This is situational and opportunistic. It can change any day. In fact, managing an important app store is exactly one way to re-(un)-balance this relationship.&gt; They could finally give the desktop the app store it deservesMicrosoft won&#39;t have GitHub compete with the Microsoft Store and its newer efforts like winget. It would unermine their unifying vision that has been in the works for years for no benefit.&gt; This is a minor but users will be able to raise issues with developers directly instead writing comments over app pages which I think you would agree completely suck.Sure, lets pipe user feedback directly into GitHub issues. Good luck with that if you have a hundred issues a day.I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a single angle that would paint this as a good idea. Phone manufacturers like Samsung are in a much much better position to try. And indeed they have been trying an failing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sounds like a great way to create incentives that undermine githubs mission while simultaneously taking a huge amount of developer resources for a product that will have niche interest at best.Building app stores is hard. Moderating app stores is hard. Both are significantly different from running GitHub.While I appreciate the author&#39;s intent here, this just doesn&#39;t feel like it was deeply thought out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Or we could just stop using app stores.Honestly, I&#39;ve yet to find an argument for the existence of an app store that holds water. Let people install what they want. Provide reasonable paths to update and upgrade and cut out the middle layer.The layer of control that Google and Apple exert over people is anti-competitive. But the answer isn&#39;t competing app stores. I don&#39;t need someone to tell me what I can or can&#39;t install on the operating system on my device."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Everyone assuming a conspiracy theory needs to read this.Keep in mind that Robinhood also gives everyone a margin account by default. They also let people invest on margin before their inbound bank transfers arrive (Robinhood Instant). The influx of new traders sending money to Robinhood or selling other stocks to buy GME quickly drained their credit lines, reducing the capital they had available for collateral.Keep in mind that when someone sells a different stock to buy GME in the same day, they&#39;re buying GME on margin. Stock trades don&#39;t settle until T+2, so any new purchases using those proceeds are done on margin.This was a capital crunch at Robinhood due to an unexpected herd of new traders all looking to do the same thing in unison. It violated the assumptions of their business model, and the only way to keep the platform from grinding to insolvency (or violating regulations) was to slow down the unexpected event by slowing meme stock purchases.Is it really so hard to believe that such an unprecedented mass movement would break the underlying business assumptions of a pre-IPO startup that was heavily dependent on their credit lines?The biggest problem is Robinhood&#39;s poor messaging. It&#39;s clear their highest priority was to avoid admission that they were running out of money. They didn&#39;t want to trigger a bank run or shake the confidence of their newly acquired users, so they tried to obscure the message as much as possible. As a result, the popular narrative assumed some sort of evil conspiracy theory."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">",,Robinhood legally could not submit trades on $GME until they could muster the deposits for GME that they needed. &#39;&#39;This sounds like a liquidity issue, but Robinhood&#39;s CEO said in the interview that there was no liquidity issue.The why doesn&#39;t matter at this point because Robinhood CEO was caught lying by contradicting himself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Similar explanation was posted Jan 28 on twitter by Silent Cal[1]. This article and the twitter thread do paint a very plausible explanation. And is easy to accept.OTOH, a potentially far more nefarious, yet plausible, underlying motive was posted on /r/wsb today [2] that links GME to counterfeiting shorts.Given Steve Cohen&#39;s numerous scandals through the years as detailed on wikipedia [3], needing to cover up for counterfeiting shorts also seems like a plausible explanation.I hope the finance committee investigations AOC called for take place and consider both points.* - Not invested in GME, and prohibited from doing so by my employer.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I realize this is a site about the past, but I really hope this is the future. I want an internet of specialty sites, browsable curations, diversity of offering, freedom of choice, and full of the quirky/unusual. It might have to do with growing up in the 90s and experiencing that kind of world wide web, w/o walled gardens.Several years back, perhaps even via an HN post or comment, I came across a blog, hosted on a university network (IIRC, perhaps related to media studies). The page consisted of a group of possibly graduate students contributing some of the weirdest and most obscure media I&#39;ve ever seen online. Nothing obscene and nothing seemingly new/current, so it was rather hipster in that sense, but I kick myself for not having saved the URL.Nothing says I need to use walled gardens or get my news from the big networks, but I often feel I&#39;m being pointed that way. In the end, I just want something different than what&#39;s usually being served up.(It doesn&#39;t escape me that this 90&#39;s TV site is full of walled garden/big network type content of the time)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I tried polyphasic sleeping for a while when I worked at an IBank. I remember it as one of the most productive periods of my life but it was incredibly anti social and got the strangest looks from management.I&#39;d do 35 minute naps with an alarm at 0430, 0830, 1230, 1630, and without an alarm at 2030 and 0030 (on the basis that I thought my body would sleep through if I was &#34;doing any damage&#34;).It made going out at the weekends or playing poker in a casino incredibly difficult so after 3 weeks I had to pack it in.I was lucky to live a 5 minute, folding, bicycle ride from the office but I also had a little card I&#39;d leave on my desk for the corner that said, &#34;I have not collapsed I&#39;m having a nap.&#34;The one thing I&#39;ve kept from those days is that I still wear a sleep mask to bed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I use this concept of a &#34;billable nap&#34; ... it gets to the midafternoon and I&#39;m deep in a programming problem, and my thought process gets far too fuzzy.  So I can either spend a couple of hours or more struggling through, or I can shut my eyes for a bit  20 minutes idelally, and then nail the problem down in a much shorter time than without the nap."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find if I&#39;m working on a difficult problem, I feel like I can make more rapid progress if I take a &#39;nap&#39; early afternoon in that post lunch drowsy period. I often start thinking about the problems again immediately on waking, and typically find that is the most productive period in terms of breakthroughs and making mental connections.I put &#39;nap&#39; in quotes because I don&#39;t set an alarm (unless there is specific need to), and for me that usually means a 2 hour sleep! I figure that is made up of 90 mins of one sleep cycle, and some time either side for falling asleep and waking.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_cycleAll made possible by pandemic working from home."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s interesting to me that this delineates between facts and personal experience as if personal experience doesn&#39;t occupy the same space as facts. Perhaps a more useful way to think about people&#39;s relation to truth is one of proximity. For a given individual, their personal experience is entirely factual, and because it is also most proximate to them, it is weighted the most highly. Intuitively, I think we understand this, so we tend to weight other people&#39;s experiences similarly, knowing that those are as proximate to them as our experiences are to us."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Key point:&#34;The problem is that facts—at least today—are themselves subject to doubt, especially when they conflict with our political beliefs (21). In the past decades, America has seen a decentralization of news and information (22) that has allowed people to gather their “own facts” (i.e., alternative facts; ref. 23). Most recently, claims of “fake news” allow people to distrust any information that fails to align with their political beliefs (24, 25) and to trust fake news that aligns with their beliefs (26).&#34;This is the epistemic crisis we&#39;re currently facing. Up until about the late 70s we had 3 news networks that were all pretty much middle of the road politically. Newspapers could have more of a discernible political leaning, but even there most of the mainstream ones we&#39;re pretty centrist. People who hewed to an extreme political position in either direction were ostracized and thus had a very small audience. We had more of a common narrative which is now gone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A personal experience is a fact. It is a fact we can be pretty sure of, and we know the context of that fact. Obviously, once we extrapolate from that experienced fact, it becomes bias.A fact that is not a personal experience is difficult to trust. Even if I trust the source of that fact, I am often not sure if I understand the fact properly. Anyone who has ever tried to understand a math theorem might relate.It is entirely rational to trust more in your personal bias. In fact, I would argue that the only way to trust a fact is to make it somehow into something that you can personally experience. For example, to understand a math theorem, it helps to look at lots of different kinds of examples where it holds (and where it doesn&#39;t)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I believe this kind of thing is a big contributor to Amazon&#39;s hegemony in online shopping. I&#39;m reluctant to order from other sites because there&#39;s a whole new set of dark patterns I may fall victim to. At least I&#39;m familiar enough with Amazon to know I&#39;m not getting charged for things I didn&#39;t intend to order, the low stock warnings are somewhat legitimate, etc. I&#39;m not saying Amazon doesn&#39;t have its own issues, but at least it&#39;s a known quantity.If it weren&#39;t for Amazon&#39;s dominance, other sites would be able to compete without resorting to these dark patterns, so this is a self-perpetuating cycle: people only shop on Amazon -&gt; the only other sites that can survive are the ones that engage in deception -&gt; trust in non-Amazon shopping sites decreases -&gt; people only shop on Amazon -&gt; ...I don&#39;t mean to cast these scammy shopping websites as victims. My concern is more about how the legitimate sites that could exist don&#39;t because they&#39;re crowded out by Amazon (and other big players like Walmart) and the scammy shopping sites this article discusses."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is interesting - I feel like the site should separate dark patterns that add information from ones that lie or obfuscate. In my experience, consumers feel differently about these categories.I&#39;ve sat in on a few dozen user research sessions for ecommerce. This was qualitative research that included their general shopping habits, and additionally testing new features. The most interesting thing that I learned is that consumers (a) are generally pretty aware of when they&#39;re being pressured, and (b) are fine if it&#39;s transparent and accurate.A classic example of this were low-stock notifications. The shoppers were generally okay with being told that something was low stock if that was really true. Many people could name specific items they lost because they were sold out. Some could also name instances of when they had bought something &#34;1 item remaining&#34; and seen it on sale the next day. They preferred having the information because it helped them make an informed decision. It turns out that lots of people browse the same items for a while, and use sales or almost-out-of-stock as a &#34;now or never&#34; moment.The most interesting user session I ever sat in on was for a countdown timer for a sale ending. The designer refused to design it at first, and then was like, &#34;fine, I&#39;m going to design the hell out of this and then show you in user research that nobody wants this.&#34; And then she showed it to 5 people in user research, who were generally okay with it on the condition that it counted down to the actual sale ending. Some said they actually liked knowing, because when they&#39;re just looking on their phones they might not be in a good position to buy it, and want to know how much time they have later to get it. They said that they&#39;ll often refresh the page to see if the timer resets, because if it starts ticking from the same time, they feel like the site is just scammy and they&#39;ll leave.Anyways, I&#39;m not trying to defend lots of these patterns. Most of them are clearly wrong, and the ones that I mentioned above can also be used to lie and deceive. But I wouldn&#39;t put them all together - in my experience, consumers generally want accurate information even if they&#39;re aware that the company is doing it to pressure them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;&gt; The solution to this problem: “uniwidth” typefaces, sometimes also called “equal-width”, “duplexed” or “multiplexed” typefaces. And no, I am not talking about monospaced fonts here.I&#39;m not into web design but I think the core problem here is lack of accepted terminology and even awareness that this type of font is a thing.The article certainly brings awareness to something I didn&#39;t know is a thing but seems very useful.My mind wants to say &#34;weight invariant&#34; or &#34;style invariant&#34; but those suggest the thing doesnt look any different rather than just the size not changing with other characteristics.It&#39;s probably obvious that I don&#39;t like &#34;uniwidth&#34;, but at the moment I can&#39;t think of anything better that isn&#39;t super wordy, like &#34;font with style invariant width&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is not a monospaced font used for code:&gt; also called non-proportional font, is a font whose letters and characters each occupy the same amount of horizontal spaceinstead, it preserves the width if you apply a weight like BOLD:&gt; Uniwidth typefaces, on the other hand, are proportionally-spaced typefaces, but every character occupies the same space across different cuts or weights.This allows visual cues other than color in interactive text such as the :hover CSS pseudo-class."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ahh, very satisfying to learn the name of this property.It’s especially important in data tables when coupled with tabular numbers (essentially mono spaced numbers) so you can e.g. bold a cell without having the thousands or decimal separators get out of alignment in a column of numbers. Spreadsheet programs use fonts with this property."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So we got notified by the developer console at 21:45 UTC that the app had been suspended, but still haven’t had an email to explain why - it’s 02:24 now.Our assumption that this is due to someone reporting abusive content in Matrix to Google, and Element catching the blame — although this is currently speculation.To be clear: Element is a Matrix client just as Chrome is a Web browser, and just as it’s possible to view abusive material via Chrome, the same is true of Element.However, we abhor abuse, and on the default matrix.org server (and other Matrix servers the core team maintains) we have a fairly strict terms of use at https://matrix.org/legal/terms-and-conditions#6-play-nice-cl... which we proactively enforce. Meanwhile we have a comprehensive toolset at https://matrix.org/docs/guides/moderation to help folks moderate, and are making good process with decentralised reputation to empower users and admins to filter out stuff they don’t want to see, as per https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/19/combating-abuse-in-matrix....So, it’s very unfortunate and frustrating that we’re in this position - hopefully Google will explain what’s going on shortly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is this google starting to test the waters when it comes to arbitrarily kicking out software they personally don&#39;t like? (open source, decentralized, privacy oriented etc.) I might of course be exaggerating a bit here, keep that in mind.- Element and Matrix are growing but still not equipped to fight back at large against this, so it is unlikely to create too much negative press- If Google starts to catch too much critique for this decision they can put it back and always blame $errorI believe Element will be back soon, the problem I see here is that it will be framed as an &#34;honest mistake&#34; and then become forgotten until they pull another stunt like this.Even if these removals are temporary, they can still hurt growth. Let&#39;s assume a bit more malice: Couldn&#39;t Google just monitor and analyze metrics of an undesirable app (downloads, usage, hype), pick a critical point in its growth then &#34;accidentaly&#34; remove it for a few days, causing damage that isn&#39;t immediately apparent, but nonetheless long lasting?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I believe that removal of Element from Google Play Store is a violation of EU regulation 2019/1150. Element has legal entities in Britain (which is affected by Brexit but has similar law) and France. Google is LEGALLY required to provide a justification for removal 30 days before application removal.Anyway, you may try contacting Google using EU regulation 2019/1150 violation procedure, see https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/9969397 for more information. This may be more effective than using a regular contact procedure, as it would show Google that you are aware of this regulation and they are unlikely to win.Note that I&#39;m not a lawyer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you read the other threads it&#39;s clear what&#39;s happening is that robinhood&#39;s product isn&#39;t designed to cope with high volatility[1]. Is this a flaw in their product? Yes. But then again, they are a discount brokerage for a reason. It&#39;s not any different than any other consumer product that shits the bed during 99.9 percentile events.[1] Specifically, they&#39;re required by the DTCC to put up a deposit on every trade their users make. During periods of low volatility this is fine because they can come up with the money, but when volatility goes up so do the deposit requirements, which can cause them to become insolvent. This is further compounded by the fact that their product invisibly hands out margin, eg. &#34;instant&#34; deposits of $1000, or giving you the money before it settles (2 days later)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; &#34;And though traders may be outraged by the surprise, Robinhood’s terms of service grant it permission to close a trader’s position under a number of circumstances.&#34;The terms of service for EVERY service we use are entirely legal jargon for &#34;we can do whatever the f*k we want to do with any data on our service, and you have no legal recourse.&#34; No matter what the company says about &#34;privacy&#34; or any other rights you think you have, buried in there somewhere is a clause that says that no matter what happens, you can&#39;t sue. What do you expect when you&#39;ve abdicated the right to sue the company for something you think is illegal or injurious? It&#39;s supposed to be the bastion of last resort, to keep everyone honest. When the safety net of the legal system is gone (e.g., forced arbitration) -- or only used for one side, there&#39;s nothing to restrain these humungous companies which are running the world now. We&#39;re a long way past needing a legal reset on &#34;terms of service.&#34;"</p>

A sustained short interest does not necessarily mean that the shorts are holding their initial position, they could have closed and reopened at these elevated levels.The narrative has changed so quickly from this being a value play, to a short squeeze, to now militant activism via buying stock as a means to sticking it to the man.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I often question the motives of my company. It has only 100 or so employees. Has been in business for 25+ years. But we are on a continual drive to increase sales, hire new people, add size to the facilities. But it wasn&#39;t always this way. It only happened once it went public. Now we are working for the investors. They need to see an increasing return on their investment. Management choices are no longer about the customer or providing a great product/service. It&#39;s about squeezing margins and duping the customer to join our mailing list or accept cookies. Otherwise &#34;the list won&#39;t grow&#34;. And how can we market to more and more people if we can&#39;t track how many pages they&#39;ve viewed?I&#39;ve gone a bit off track there, but the point being, there IS no answer when I&#39;ve explicitly asked &#34;why&#34; with regards to these things. Nobody knows. They just know they have &#34;targets&#34; and the targets are constantly moving./rant over"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I once worked at a company where I didn&#39;t understand why they took certain decisions. In the end, it all became very clear. My mindset from &#34;these guys have no idea&#34; shifted towards &#34;wow, they are smart, I didn&#39;t get this part&#34;.Basically, they were acquiring customers faster than anyone could follow. Our development goal was &#34;fast and opportunistic&#34;. As you can expect, the product was full of bugs, and customer support had their hands full. It was a shitty product with a lot of customers.I didn&#39;t see how this would ever turn into a success story. We were digging a grave. But I didn&#39;t realize 1 thing: we were not selling a product, we were selling the company.In the end, a huge Canadian competitor wanted a foothold in the European market, and so they bought us (and our customers). They were going to introduce their own product to the customers, and so our product was thrown in the wastebasket.In the end, it all ended as planned, and the founders walked away with a lot of money. Basically they built a customer base in EU, and sold that one to another company. Big eye opener for me.Looking back, it is also very interesting to see how they positioned their company within that market, to be acquired."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Go big or go home&#34;.  This seems to be a uniquely north-American attitude.  Germany, or maybe Europe, is full of so-called &#34;Mittelstand&#34; companies that are good in what they do, have 500-ish employees, have been in the same family ownership for generations and provide a good solid living for everyone involved.  What is wrong with that?  It goes without saying that staying mid-sized doesn&#39;t mean staying complacent, but you can innovate without growing huge.Here in Ottawa, there was a debacle a few years ago.  A typical such company, Swiss Pastries, changed ownership or at least management.  The new attitude was &#34;grow at all costs&#34;, they overextended themselves, went bankrupt, and Swiss Pastries is no more.  Ottawa now has no local source of soft pretzels along with other delicacies that they made.  It&#39;s almost a scorched earth approach.  If you can&#39;t make the company huge, you might as well destroy it, because not being huge means you&#39;ve failed.The previous paragraph is based on reading a few news articles at the time.  If I&#39;m wrong, I&#39;m guessing it still makes a textbook example of &#34;go big or go home&#34; going wrong and I&#39;d love to see more details."</p>

I could do better.Why didn&#39;t I? That was my very first thought. The reason was, I had to work halftime to pay tuition and buy food. I was mired in working to live. Ol Bill had a family to support him as he bought resources (ads in magazines etc), recruited staff, took meetings etc. Always a hot meal on the table when he got home from a big day.One result of a Basic Income: more folks can be entrepreneurs, if they&#39;re willing to live off that few dollars a month.

They both sat on the board for United Way[0].It really struck me how these kinds of connections are less of a twist of fate, and more about environment and proximity.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Fair warning. Buying stocks with high short interest is, over the long run, a terrible investment strategy. Mountains of academic research has consistently found the most heavily shorted stocks to significantly underperform the market[1] (to the order of 10% per year).Heavily shorted stocks tend to be the companies with the most negative cash flow shocks[2], low quality earnings statements[3], negative earnings revisions, and future bad news[4]. In other words, when a company is heavily shorted it&#39;s almost always for a good reason. (Like being a brick and mortar video game retailer, that&#39;s losing mountains of cash with no turnaround plan.) High short interest is a tell-tale warning of a bad investment.This shouldn&#39;t be surprising. Research has consistently found that short-sellers are the most sophisticated and well-informed investors in the market[5]. There activity strongly predicts soon-to-be released negative public announcements[6]. Short sellers are exactly the type of trader, you do not want to be on the other side of.[1]https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/0022-1082.00...

This is the list of companies that Big Money is betting heavily against.In 99% of cases you don&#39;t want to take the other side of the bet against these big funds. They could be right and the company is actually a loser, or they could just have way more money than you and the market will never reflect anything but their perspective.GME is a really fun ride (and I&#39;m rooting for the WSB crowd) but it is a result of a uniquely heavily shorted stock and an even more unique groundswell of popular interest."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Once again, this insistence on viewing &#39;Wall Street&#39; as a monolothic entity. The largest asset management firm on Earth holds over 9 million Gamestop stock, none of the big banks that received bailouts in 08 are affected by this, 99.9% of hedge funds are not affected by this, high frequency traders are probably making a bundle. Institutional money was long Gamestop before this story entered the public consciousness. The idea of governments stepping in to bolster hedge funds is ludicrous, the whole point is that the government and SEC is hands off with them.Ultimately, a few medium-sized hedge funds were caught doing something stupid and the market has rightfully taught them a lesson. It&#39;s great that retail investors got in on a high-level play like this and made money."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They are blocking buying, and only allowing selling GME, BB and others.How is this not evidence of a corrupted free market system?  A CEO of one company can call up his connections in retail trading platform firms, CNBC, and Nasdaq and protect his profits?  Why is Reddit the scandal and not that?Reddit is full of rocket emojis and YOLO jokes. But what we see here, especially with the moralizing about gambling, is an elitism on full display.The people are sick of it."</p>

It&#39;s people that are frustrated with the 1% getting bailed out time and time again and them not seeing a dime at their tax dollar expense."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;To continue operating, it drew on a line of credit from six banks amounting to between $500 million and $600 million to meet higher margin, or lending, requirements from its central clearing facility for stock trades, known as the Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation.&#34;Non-zero chance had they not haulted trading on those symbols they would&#39;ve been insolvent by close of trading today, depending on the size of their credit line.I watched the CEO on CNN tonight, and while I found him pretty difficult to watch, this is a very difficult position to be in. If you admit on TV that your company is experiencing liquidity issues -- even if temporary in nature such as with clearing custodianship requirements -- you run the risk of triggering a greater panic through customer withdrawals/redemptions.This could turn into a run on the brokerage pretty quickly, and probably already has in some measure, especially after a day of massively lost customer trust. He certainly didn&#39;t help it by going on TV and lying about their liquidity issues. They probably would&#39;ve been better off by issuing a statement and keeping him off TV."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don’t understand how all of a sudden the shift was made onto the insolvency of RH and that the discussion is less about the original conditions that led up to this.I just finished watching a video from Louis Rossmann [1] as well as one from Bruce Fenton [2]. In his video, Rossmann covers the technicalities and systems behind actually __making__ a trade with an app like RH. The videos were very informative and I learned quite a lot.With the exception of his recent interviews, it isn’t exactly clear what Robinhood was supposed to do differently. If my understanding is correct, clearing houses required more money up front to perform trades - RH didn’t have it so they stopped the trades unidirectionally. People got upset that they couldn’t buy but could sell which made it seem like RH wanted to manipulate the price - but isn’t it better than the alternative, the inability to both sell and buy would seem to me worse than what was done. Imagine them closing both and preventing people from selling if a crash occurs. The discussion would simply be « Robinhood stole our gains and wouldn’t let us move our funds ».Now, should it be the case that more money is required up front, intuitively it makes sense, I mean, who is supposed to front the bill on those 5000% returns? The hedge fund that just went bankrupt? Where exactly does this money come from?Isn’t RH just trying to play within the realities of the current system?Genuinely curious.[1]: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MAqxQe0l4g0&amp;feature=youtu.be[2]: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RQTC5f_VR9I&amp;feature=youtu.be"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Okay kids, story time.After the crash of 2008, I spent some time working with Dick Fuld. Yes, the former head of Lehman Brothers. Yes, the one people describe as “disgraced,” among other terms. Here’s the irony, though — Dick was one of the only people I encountered at that level of business/finance who wasn’t a scumbag. Unlike so many virtue-signaling Silicon Valley darlings, the guy behind the curtain was an honorable dude. And again, that’s a direct account from someone who has no vested interest or a book to sell or anything of that sort.Dick and I worked closely together, one on one. After enough time, after he trusted me, I finally got to ask him about what the hell actually happened. The man had a ton of PTSD — and probably still does — but eventually it became clear that the real story was completely, utterly, unbelievably stupid.Yes, Lehman was doing a bunch of stupid stuff, and the management under Dick were behaving like cowboys. But at the end of the day, that was the entire market at that time. What sunk Lehman was, in the end, a decision by all of the other big banks and the regulators that they’d let Lehman die because of something that might be best summarized as “lol idk sorry Dick but we’re just gonna let you go and let the Fed bail the rest of us out sorry bro lol.” Like really. That’s how it went behind those closed doors in the lairs of the lizards that control the universe. Lehman had already  suffered near-death in 1994 — the world has now forgotten that Dick was the hero that saved the firm back then — and now it was to be made a sacrificial lamb for everyone else’s benefit.Why am I telling you this story? What is the point? Well, what I am trying to say is that these supposed “adults in the room” who are so much smarter and better than the the “retail investors” are pretty much the same sort of immature, self-centered children as the other side. The difference is, they’ve got the regulators  and the politicians in their pockets. So when they say “lol oops” and literally blow up the global economy to save face, nothing happens to them. But for some reason when it’s the retail guys, a moral panic ensues.In my eyes, the Internet-connected retail investor is learning the power of what I call “massively multiplayer liquidity.” Yes, there’s some growing pains, but let’s not kill this wild new phenomenon before we learn what it can do. Because, from what I’ve seen from the other side of things, I doubt these self-styled “retards” will ever end up as depraved and corrupt as the people they’re disrupting.Play ball, kids. And as Dick always used to say, “don’t get left with nothing other than a ham sandwich.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There’s a long history of similar occurrences that follow along a common line: whatever appears to support individual investors will be the path taken by politicians and regulatory bodies.Right now it appears that the public wants to be able to trade on their terms because there is this narrative that the little guy is finally sticking it to the big bad hedge funds. In reality there is probably very little truth to this. However, support for the individual investor plays extremely well which is why you see politicians from both sides joining forces on this issue. A rumor makes it halfway around the world while the truth is still putting its pants on. Nobody is interested in the subtleties around these issues where there almost certainly should be regulations in place or at least warnings from those who do actually know better. But late in bull markets when speculation is running wild those who try to be the voice of reason are run over by the masses until they shut up and go away.Galbraith wrote about this in the 1950’s and if you read his account of the 1929 crash the parallels are eerily similar. Nobody wants to be told they aren’t making money due to skill but because they’re caught up in a dangerous bubble. In the aftermath of a crash when tremendous sums are lost, nobody blames the speculators, they always find another scapegoat- the regulators, the brokerages, the hedge funds- whomever. It doesn’t matter so long as the speculator is held up as a victim. I expect this to end no differently."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Dark patterns are everywhere and I&#39;m afraid not enough people are raising a ruckus about them. For example, the &#34;Google Pay&#34; app in India, which works via the UPI system, shows its own &#34;scanner code&#34; in the app as opposed to the standard UPI QR code. Furthermore, you can&#39;t discover where the UPI QR code is, if you want to pay using BHIM - an app that works directly with UPI payments. If you&#39;re using GPay too, then you can access the scanner code. If not, you used to be able to select the UPI QR code from a menu and scan that. However, later updates have hidden that - not eliminated it, mind you, deliberately hidden that. You have to &#34;swipe left&#34; when you see the GPay scanner code to get to the QR code - not at all a discoverble act. My wife discovered it by accident after we were puzzled a few times about where the QR code that used to be accessible went (both of us use BHIM). As a consequence, folks who use GPay do not know about UPI. This is, in my books, malicious design. Hanlon&#39;s razor would ask me to try &#34;stupidity&#34; first. But no. This isn&#39;t stupidity. It is downright malicious (the benign term being &#34;dark pattern&#34;) to do this .. at least at Google&#39;s level."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s also worth mentioning that the misconception of thinking UX as being solely related to aesthetics is getting dangerously more and more common, even among professionals referring to themselves as UX designers.Aesthetics is important, but, in some sorts of systems, it has much lower priority than other non-functional requirements, like overall speed, maintainability, testability and so on.I don&#39;t know if my experience is the same of most of you, but I&#39;ve seen more and more systems getting aesthetic pleasant but painfully slow and/or buggy these days. It&#39;s easy when you can simply quit using the software, but when your bank, your broker, your airline, your accountant, the company that operates the subway ticket machines, when those sorts of businesses start to embrace such vision, things start to get complicated.And, unfortunately, all those examples I mention here are real and this is not an exhaustive list.Besides, I&#39;m not sure those companies (at least the ones in my examples) do that as an attempt to exploit users. I believe they do that due to plain lack of competence."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d actually argue otherwise - UX has gotten tremendously better in the last decade. Online products have been moulded perfectly towards improving the use case for their customers.The main issue though is that you aren&#39;t the customer anymore.Look at Facebook - they&#39;ve done an absolutely incredible job becoming a dream experience for advertisers. Youtube has catered to these advertisers as well and blocked controversial content that wouldn&#39;t look good next to their brand. It&#39;s a golden age to be at the head of a marketing team with a large ad budget. These companies have made golden escalators for getting sponsored content in front of the productized consumers.If you want UX to succeed and become something that benefits you as a user, then you should focus on platforms where you truly are the customer. Look at Square or Patreon - in both platforms you are truly the customer, and their UX is incredible."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This has always been my pet peeve with jobs that won&#39;t hire people without &#39;5-7 years experience with X&#39; - the vast majority of these jobs do not need an EXPERT on language x, or framework y. If they do, the rest of this post does not apply.You can learn enough of a language to be dangerous in just a couple weeks. Enough to be productive in 2-3 months. However, there are 3 other things you have to learn:1. How the code for the project you are hired for works. How it&#39;s laid out. All the weird shit about it.2. How the framework/libraries used by the project works. Nothing to do with the project, but maybe you haven&#39;t used Angular, Swing, or Boost before.3. How the data is laid out, and how it gets in/out of your system. What database tables are there, what&#39;s the workflow.Those 3 things are the hard part and what take 6-12 months. Learning Javascript, Ruby, or whatever language is the least of your worries."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Glamorous Toolkit (https://gtoolkit.com) by feenk, which embodies the thesis of this blog post, is in my opinion the most exciting working development environment in decades. I think in 5-10 years people will be pointing to it as having a huge impact on the industry.I implore anyone serious about changing how software development works to digest Andrei Chis&#39; thesis Moldable Tools: http://scg.unibe.ch/archive/phd/chis-phd.pdfOnce you understand the consequences of reducing the cost of specialised tool development by orders of magnitude, it becomes obvious that a qualitative change in experience follows, that brings us much closer to what people like Engelbart were searching for."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some of us (me, for example :) have to spend multiple weeks a year to draw the design architecture of certain parts of the product. During engineering meetings everybody raised the same question: i commit to new area in product, how can I understand what are the components and how to do certain things? You can ask your colleagues but they might know it as well.So I decided to document main flows and designs in PlantUML diagrams. having these diagrams greatly improved onboarding process, cause you can quickly glance what component does what and what are the dependencies (the code base was in JS, so it is usually quite limited on refactoring/figuring out wtf is going on).But the problem with such approach is: diagram quickly gets out of date. Someone makes the change and the diagram makes no sense at all now. With what I saw in Gtoolkit, you can always query the real source code and build custom dev tools that always produce current and real overview of the system. I would love to have a starter kit for JS projects that you can drag and drop and start building your own tooling for your product."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"FWIW I ran a startup that provided you with a program (single binary) that allowed you to run natural language queries on your database across most schemas. It had a full semantics layers which translated your query into a mixed-lambda calculus-prolog query, which is then translated into SQL as needed - you can see a sample of the semantics layer here: https://youtu.be/fd4EPh2tYrk?t=92.It&#39;s deep learning based with a lot of augmentation. Going from the OP&#39;s article to actually being able to run queries on any schema is quite a bit more work. I&#39;d love to see GPT3 handle arbitrary schemas.p/s: the startup failed. deep research based startups need a lot of funds."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Woah. I never gave it my database schema but it assumes I have a table called &#34;users&#34; (which is accurate) and that there&#39;s a timestamp field called &#34;signup_time&#34; for when a user signed up.I am definitely impressed by the fact that it could get this close without knowledge of the schema, and that you can provide additional context about the schema.  Seems like there is a lot of potential for building a natural language query engine that is hooked up to a database.  I suppose there is always a risk that a user could generate a dangerous query but that could be mitigated.Not related to the article but what exactly is &#34;open&#34; about OpenAI?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a use case where AI-powered SQL is a solution in search of a problem, and introduces more issues than just doing boring SQL. For data analysis, it&#39;s much more important to be accurate than fast, and this article is unclear how many attempts each example query took. GPT-3 does not always output coherent output (even with good prompts), and since not 100% of the output is valid SQL the QA and risk tolerance of bad output affects the economics.OpenAI&#39;s GPT-3 API is expensive enough (especially with heavy prompt engineering) that the time saved may not outweigh the cost, particularly if the output is not 100% accurate."</p>

I guess it must have been &#34;journalists&#34; who didn&#39;t want to put in any time playing the game.Congrats to them on reaching 0 bugs and 0 open issues - I can only dream of achieving that one day!For people wondering why they see Factorio updates on HN when no other game makes it, I wrote about what makes this game appeal so much to HN users - https://blog.nindalf.com/posts/factorio-and-software-enginee..."</p>

And that&#39;s clearly what&#39;s happening here.And we&#39;re seeing politicians jump on the bandwagon so they can get-- so they can start trending on Twitter. But in reality, what&#39;s going on is that there is a two-day settlement between if you buy the stock today, those brokerage firms that you bought that stock on have to fund that trade with the clearing central house called DTC for two whole days.

This just seems so outrageous that there must be some sane rationale that I&#39;m not seeing.Why do Robinhood, Reddit, Discord, etc feel like they have to respond to this?  Whether the investments being made are responsible or not, it doesn&#39;t seem like it should be their place to intervene.If the hedge funds over-shorted GME and WSB recognized that and traded against that bad analysis, then that&#39;s great!  If the pendulum swung the other direction and WSB is trading into some momentum, how is that any different than the hedge funds doing the same with shorts?  Why should Robinhood pick a winner (siding against their own customers)?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The failure (our failure) to make the ideals and ideas of freedom in the digital age accessible and present in politics is a disaster. FOSS ideas, open culture ideas. What the world wide web actual is... It&#39;s not even that they disagree, they aren&#39;t even aware.We spent decades fiddling arguments with one another while  events just took their course. Politicians don&#39;t understand or care about any of these ideas. The public doesn&#39;t either. When &#34;something must be done&#34; about this or that... because digital culture progresses to some point, the deep well of ideas that dominated web culture have zero impact.Ultimately, the encryption argument is being had between spooks and tech monopolies. Politicians are bystanders. There is no &#34;freedom of speech&#34; equivalent, no idea of the current technological age to guide them. No flag for the public to rally to.The right to privacy is great, but we can&#39;t just keep arguing by analogy. We need modern age thinking to define this for modern circumstances."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I always say if politicians want to ban encryption being absolute (by making it insecure): you first. Lets see how well it works by implementing encraption in your systems and email and seeing if your backdoor deals and illegal activity winds up in the public eye for all to see."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Put simply, the resolution is no different from the previous proposals which generated a wide backlash from privacy-conscious companies, civil society members, experts, and MEPs. The difference this time is that the Council has taken a more subtle approach and avoided explicitly using words like ‘ban’ or ‘backdoor.’ But make no mistake, this is the intention. It’s important that steps are taken now to prevent these proposals going too far and keep European’s rights to privacy intact.”"</p>

I was apprehensive about adding the closed-contribution policy but I&#39;ve seen overwhelmingly positive support for it since I released.Some commenters have noted that I could use another free code hosting platform. That&#39;s a valid criticism. However, I like the tools and workflow that GitHub offers personally. The GitHub Discussions feature in particular has been a nice step toward improving communication. GitHub Actions have been really nice for a CI workflow too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Github really needs to allow people to disable the &#34;Pull Request&#34; tab on repos, to reduce the stigma around not accepting pull requests.https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/1191 3 years and counting.Some people are resorting to adding bots which auto-close PRs with a message like &#34;Sorry, I&#39;m not accepting PRs at this time&#34;, but that only triggers once the person has put in the effort to patch your project, at which poi t they may get annoyed to be suddenly told that PRs aren&#39;t welcome.Best solution is to keep code somewhere other than github. Is sourceforge still around?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This was a problem for us and the lack of the ability to switch off PRs continues to cause problems.Community submissions are virtually always throw away, particularly on a complex code base. We ended up saying it&#39;s a legal problem [1], which it partly is. But throw away not only because of quality issues, always because of project scope issues.Yes, you feel the project is completely useless unless emoji icons animate in diagrams. That&#39;s great, fork the project and kill ours off by adding the feature (which they won&#39;t and it won&#39;t).When you know what the project scope is, tight enforcement of that scope is critical to prevent the complexity of the project from running away and ultimately killing the project entirely.https://github.com/jgraph/drawio"</p>

As I&#39;ve commented before[1][2], discussing protocols and advocating for them is a popular topic but it does not make progress.The real issue is funding and trying to make humans do what they don&#39;t want to do.If HN is overrepresented by vanguards of decentralization and free speech, why are a lot of us here on HN instead of running USENET nodes and posting to a newsgroup such as &#34;comp.programming.hackernews&#34; to avoid being moderated by dang?If most of HN knows how to set up git and stand up a web server, why do most of use Github instead of running Gitlab on a home pc/laptop/RaspberryPi or rent a Digital Ocean vps?It&#39;s because &#34;free &amp; open protocols&#34; weren&#39;t really the issue!A lot of us don&#39;t want to run a USENET node or manage our own git server to share code.[1] the so-called &#34;open&#34; internet of free protocols: 
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20231960[2] free &amp; royalty free protocol like Signal still doesn&#39;t solve the &#34;who pays for running the server&#34; problem:  https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20232499"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;After a decade or so of the general sentiment being in favor of the internet and social media as a way to enable more speech and improve the marketplace of ideas, in the last few years the view has shifted dramatically—now it seems that almost no one is happy.&#34;10 or 15 years ago people looked at web 1.0, saw many good communities and valuable conversations and said &#34;we need to protect free speech&#34;.Today people looks at Twitter/Facebook/YouTube/Reddit, see mismanaged cesspools and declare that we need centralized speech control.This is understandable, but highly reactionary and irrational. Speech control is facilitated by big tech at their own discretion. Advocating for more of it means you&#39;re advocating for giving more power to the companies who fucked up the system in the first place."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I read, and re-read the article and I am yet to understand how a protocol will help what the author describes in the first few paragraphs. (BTW very nicely walked around that hot bowl of mess!)First, Usenet was just as much of a dumpster fire as Reddit et al. in some branches (alt. I am looking at you).  The rest (comp. soc. sci. etc) were heavily self moderated.Second, I am not sure the author is clear on what is the primary product of social media, as I see it. We, the users are the product.  By moving to a protocol, there is little to no opportunity to capture private information about the product. (Not complexity, too big, or filter bubble.)Why would a platform give up such income stream?Am I misunderstanding what the author means by protocol here?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation settles most listed securities transactions in America; in 2011, it did $1.7 quadrillion [1]. You&#39;ve never heard of it unless you&#39;re a professional trader, but it&#39;s actually quite fascinating to read up on.Trading looks instantaneous. But settlement takes a few days. In between are a series of credit agreements. From your broker to you. From the clearinghouse to the brokers. DTCC is the clearinghouse. Robinhood is the broker.There are rules and contracts between DTCC and its members, including Robinhood [2]. Those contracts ensure that when you buy shares through your broker from a Robinhood customer, if Robinhood falls down two days later, there is collateral sufficient to make you whole. Those collateral requirements change in reference to, amongst other things, the volatility of the security. (If a broker falls down, the clearinghouse liquidates their collateral and makes their counterparty whole. More volatility means more chance the collateral will be insufficient.)In this case, collateral requirements on GME went up. Because of its volatility. So while before Robinhood had to pony up collateral for a few shares of GME for every hundred it traded, it now had to, at close of business, pony up one hundred shares&#39; worth of collateral for every hundred it traded. That creates a cash crunch. One that exacerbates itself with every additional trade in the security. If Robinhood fails to satisfy those collateral calls, they go out of business overnight. Into receivership. Done.Most brokers have policies for these situations. Higher brokerage fees for securities on a schedule. Not making shares and cash from trades available until the trade settles, sort of like what banks do for large cheques. But I don&#39;t know if Robinhood is able to do that quickly. So instead they pulled the plug.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depository_Trust_%26_Clearing_...[2] https://www.dtcclearning.com/products-and-services/settlemen..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I suspect this will be lost in the hysterical clamour, but yes, it is in fact true that trading platforms have to worry about systemic risk and their ability to work with certain capital obligations. The idea that this just boils down to some good old boy phoning up RH and asking them to pump GME doesn&#39;t stand up to very much scrunity at all. But such is life- the baseless conspiracy is easier to believe if you don&#39;t spend time understanding how these companies work."</p>

Nobody is buying the &#34;hate speech&#34; &#34;adult sexual exploitation&#34; whatever arguments, and honestly it just makes facebook look like liars.Just delete the group and say: &#34;It violated our terms of service&#34;.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The RH apologists are going on long winded explanations about clearing houses (and to some extent there’s elements of “it’s too complex for your little brain”). But even to the extent it’s true, if I put in 5k from my checkings into RH and buy stock, why does Rh need all this liquidity to get orders filled? I understand turning margin accounts off, but that’s it . Past that, at best robinhoods business model is highly flawed , at worst it’s fraudulent. Because ultimately, all the finance whiz bang talk doesn’t change common sense that only allowing trades in one direction is unfair, and is incredibly bad optics when that direct benefits a huge player filled with conflicts of interest. But honestly I think the “robinhood is committing fraud” is being underweighted amongst “serious “ discussion."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s been a while since I did this, but last time I transferred shares from one brokerage to another, it took several days.It seems to me that if you are holding GME, the last possible thing you want is being stuck in a position for a while.For this particular case, it might be a better choice is to liquidate your position, cash out and just open another brokerage account. I know this is the total opposite of what the WSBs are looking for but the alternative is transferring a position with $50k and when you can trade again its only worth $500."</p>
