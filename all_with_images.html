								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Crypto people love to say “it’s the early days.”But it’s not. Bitcoin is 13 years old. At that age, Windows was on &gt;90% of the world’s computers. Java at age 13 had taken over enterprise software and was about to conquer mobile via Android. Cryptos are used by maybe 0.1% of computer users (if we’re very generous about what exactly constitutes usage). Considering the amount of investment they are an expensive failure by any normal metrics like monthly active users.It’s not the early days. Rather these are the last days for VCs to sell you this tired old thing before the novelty wears off, and that’s why they are so frantic about pushing it via Hollywood celebrities and whoever else they can muster with money."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nothing in here that hasn&#39;t been said in the last 10 year. It&#39;s tempting to dismiss it as a bubble. But; most bubbles don&#39;t get 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th... etc. chances. Every time bitcoin crashes people say &#34;this one is different, this time it&#39;s dead for real&#34;, then it bounces back. It&#39;s proving to be far more cockroach like than anyone anticipated.In the more distant future, if bitcoin survives, its utility will just be one thing, it will be regarded as a unit of measuring transaction value independent of any government. It will not be a replacement for any sovereign currency. Just this extra tool out there in the ether of finance. Notions of store of value, blockchain, proof of work etc. will be regarded as implementation details of achieving a global unit of account. Think of it like the SI unit of value, kilogram, meter, bitcoin. It&#39;s still far too illiquid to serve that purpose now; but, once it has at least an order of magnitude larger market cap it may."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the biggest drawbacks for blockchain is that transactions can&#39;t be revoked after the fact (with the only exception being costly forks of the entire ledger), and there&#39;s no additional human oversight (like I&#39;d get when sending a large amount of money through a bank) to protect me.If someone steals my credit card, I have my credit card company to give me some level of protection. They can block transactions if they think it&#39;s stolen, and if I report it as stolen I can claw back money from fraudulent purchases.If I purchase something and don&#39;t get what I paid for, I can contest it with customer service or my credit card company.With crypto, a software flaw used to steal crypto can kill an entire company. They&#39;re largely powerless to stop it once the transaction has gone through.With crypto, a xss attack or a misplaced password can cost me all of my coins.With crypto, I have to triple check the address I&#39;m sending coins to because I can&#39;t undo it.With crypto, I have to spend what&#39;s sometimes a significant amount of money just to complete a transaction, and transactions can take minutes or hours to complete.I think there&#39;s a future in crypto but we&#39;re in the dotcom boom days of it where most of the value is in speculation (and I suppose illegal purchases on the darknet). I&#39;ll wait for crypto 2.0."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t think this is limited to Russian oligarchs, I thought that because of its trust and crown dependencies system, London is a popular place for people to hide this kind of stuff. Russian oligarchs and other unsavory individuals like corrupt leaders in Africa, the Middle East and the developing world all dump their ill gotten gains into the opaque system away from prying eyes. The stuff you can actually see, like mansions in Knightsbridge are probably just the tiniest tip of the iceberg, everything else is held in such opaque ways that nobody even knows who it actually belongs to. It is so blatant that you couldn&#39;t really call it a dirty secret."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"London is known as &#34;The Laundry&#34; in Russia. No one in power has cared for two decades and only care now because it serves their interests to. Maybe they will crack down on it, maybe it will get swept under the rug again if the Russian invasion of Ukraine dies down as an important news story, either way, the root issue of why this was allowed in the first place won&#39;t be addressed and it will continue to occur with nationals of other countries."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am realistically wondering now, what changes does this bring. 
If London won&#39;t be interesting anymore for oligarchs, what will happen with prices of accomodation in center? 
If Switzerland is not a neutral country anymore, where will the money go?There should be prisoners dilemma and therefore some country should emerge to fill this &#34;market need&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The scary thing is that it&#39;s easy to see how something how like this could drive a market boom and bust cycle. I&#39;m imagining a scenario where two iBuyer companies try to outbid each other algorithmically, driving the prices further and further out of reach of people who are looking for a primary home.Tangentially related, I talked to a friend who works on geospatial data for one of the big vacation rental companies, and he was remarking how many homes in many desirable areas are now rentals. It&#39;s not that uncommon to see nearly entire neighborhoods converted to short term rentals now in some areas where they&#39;re still legal. Hearing that really depressed me.We often talk about automation in terms of replacing various types of labor, but I&#39;ve become really interested in automation creating adverse market incentives for smaller market participants because that&#39;s exactly what buying real estate right now feels like.It&#39;s honestly quite scary how I&#39;m in the top 2% of income earners in my generation and yet I could barely afford to buy a small place in a semi-desirable area.   I can easily see myself not being able to compete in algorithmically dominated markets flush with venture cash in the future and I earn more than just about everybody I know today."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recently bought a home. We toured a Zillow home, and I can understand what they were going for and where they failed.We were able to pull up to the driveway, book a tour for that minute, and walk in the front door. It was almost a magical experience compared to the process of finding and going to showings. The listings were clear and thorough. The experience was extremely compelling.The downside: the homes were absurdly overpriced. I bought a home for about 10% less than the last Zillow listing. For less, I got three times the land, 40% more square footage, a better location, updated appliances, new carpets, landscaped back yard, horseshoe driveway, two car garage. Almost zero effort had been put into modernizing the Zillow home and it showed.I suspect if I had come in with a very low offer, they&#39;d have accepted it. But for what?If I was Zillow, I&#39;d have licensed the tech to realtors. I&#39;d definitely be inclined to buy a home through them if they weren&#39;t the ones selling the property directly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was at Zillow for many years and left in 2020. On the tech side the pivot into iBuying was absolutely bonkers. The message from senior leadership was basically: I have no idea what your teams should be working on but it’s definitely not what they are currently working on so stop that and figure something else out.This has nothing directly to do with their market failure but they probably are driven by the same leadership problems."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is very interesting, but I can’t help but feel that a glass bottle with a metal cap (and one of those Dutch condiment spatulas) would be just fine for all these applications and also be more easily and effectively reused and recycled.I re-use jam jars for food storage, drinking glasses, mini herb gardens, etc. and could incorporate bottles, jars, and other glass containers into a variety of needs around the house if they were designed with second and third lives in mind.Add in health effects of microplastics/chemical leaching and glass is again a winner.Transportation costs and breakage are perhaps higher, but maybe that’s a cost we should accept?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"C&#39;s most infamous parsing difficulty is:    A * B;

Is it A multiplied by B, or B declared as a pointer to A? It can&#39;t be resolved without a symbol table. But there&#39;s another way that works very well: it&#39;s a declaration. The reason is simple. The multiply has no purpose, and so nobody would write that. C doesn&#39;t have metaprogramming, so it won&#39;t be generating such code as an edge case (unless using the preprocessor for metaprogramming, in which case you deserve what you get).But there&#39;s a worse problem:    (A) - B

Is it A minus B, or casting negative B to type A? There&#39;s just no way to know without a symbol table. One might think who would write code that has a vacuous set of parentheses around an identifier? It turns out they don&#39;t, but they write macros that parenthesize the arguments, and the preprocessed result has those vacuous parentheses.D resolves both issues with:1. if it parses like a declaration, it&#39;s a declaration2. a cast expression is preceded by the keyword `cast`and D is easy to parse without a symbol table."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; My problem is that C was elevated to a role of prestige and power, its reign so absolute and eternal that it has completely distorted the way we speak to each other. Rust and Swift cannot simply speak their native and comfortable tongues – they must instead wrap themselves in a grotesque simulacra of C’s skin and make their flesh undulate in the same ways it does.Lol at this. Love this eloquent style, and pretty much agree. However, C&#39;s reign is not absolute. Virgil compiles to tiny native binaries and runs in user space on three different platforms without a lick of C code, and runs on Wasm and the JVM to boot. I&#39;ve invested 12+ years of my life to bootstrap it from nothing just to show it can be done and that we can at least have a completely different userspace environment. No C ABI considerations over here. It can be as romantic as just you and the kernel in Virgil land. Heh."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article is hard to parse because it doesn&#39;t present any alternatives that the author considers better.- You have to speak the C ABI to talk to the OS -- yes, if you want an OS to support more than one language, or you want multiple languages within a single process, you need a common ABI of some sort.  What is the alternative that doesn&#39;t involve a common ABI?- C has too many ABIs -- yes, there are a lot of different kinds of hardware, and sometimes multiple software ecosystems evolved in parallel on the same hardware (eg. Windows and Linux).  What is the alternative?- ABI changes are hard to make in a non-breaking way -- yes they are.  It&#39;s fundamentally a hard problem.  You could compile everything from source every time, but the open-source world seems to have decided that there isn&#39;t enough time or CPU power to &#34;live at head&#34; and build from source every time, like Google does: https://abseil.io/about/philosophy#we-recommend-that-you-cho...  (Disclosure: I work at Google).- &#34;You Can’t Actually Parse A C Header&#34; -- this is, IMO, the most actionable objection that the article raises.  You could imagine a subset of C that does away with macros, typedefs, etc. in order to be easier to parse, and in doing so forms a more accessible ABI specification language.  That seems eminently doable.  But parsing is only part of the overall battle: actually implementing the ABI for 176 triples seems like the bigger problem.  Especially when you add the ABI-impacting function attributes mentioned in the tweet.As a C fan, it&#39;s hard to see the language itself blamed for what are (in my view) just fundamentally difficult problems."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A few years back I was in a role where it was my job to maintain a small but non-trivial open source project (~1500 github stars, 5 core contributors). I burned out after about two years in that role. People repeatedly demanding help in the github issues without even providing repro steps.  Hate mail to the project email list from users angry we didn&#39;t implement the feature they want in the latest release. We had people second-guessing all the time if we didn&#39;t ship the things they wanted or they disagreed with the decisions we made. Some people just like to get in touch to let you know your work sucks.The worst was the CEO of a small competitor company repeatedly hassling me over slack DMs and in github issues threads shamelessly trying to get me to prioritize free work that he wanted for his clients. Separately, over a period of several weeks, this same person asked me a ton of support questions and then compiled my answers without edits or attribution into a &#34;white paper&#34; he used as a resource to get people into the marketing funnel for his consulting shop. I came to hate that guy, such an asshole, but I couldn&#39;t totally block him because his company was a member of the open source foundation governing the ecosystem of tools my project was under.Honestly, it was hell. The most stress and irritation I&#39;ve ever had in any job. When I started the job I thought it was a dream getting paid to do open source, but now I consider that an anti-goal for any future role."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Most of the comments here remind me of the famous Neil Gaiman quote, &#34;George R.R. Martin is not your bitch.&#34; [1] But I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the right framing. People buy the first book because they hope there will be a second, even though they haven&#39;t paid for that second book and hence are not entitled to it. People use your open-source project because you said, hey, here&#39;s this exciting new thing, try it out, so they assume you&#39;d also want to listen when it doesn&#39;t quite work as it should. That&#39;s not about a false sense of entitlement or callousness on the part of your users at all. It&#39;s also not about freeloading, because a lot of those pull requests and issues on Github will be coming from people who publish their own open-source software. Instead, it&#39;s about managing expectations, like the post does. Put a big &#34;this project is not maintained&#34; warning on top, and nobody will bother you. Although I do understand that for larger active projects, it can be hard to explain to users exactly where on the spectrum between &#34;don&#39;t bother me&#34; and &#34;I&#39;ll fix your problem yesterday&#34; you are, and the bigger a project gets, the more likely you&#39;ll be to encounter people who enjoy exploiting your free labor.[1] https://journal.neilgaiman.com/2009/05/entitlement-issues.ht..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So much this. I&#39;m glad he put this out there. I&#39;ll start linking to it too.There seems to be a common misconception about open source. When I release software as open source, it does not mean I work for you for free, need to provide you with anything, even need to be nice to you. I may. Or I may not.When I release software under an open source license, then we have a very specific deal. You are entitled to do certain things with the software, for example use it free of charge, or change it, or redistribute it, and I&#39;m entitled to certain things in return, for example you keep attribution, you publish changes that you made under the same license, etc. Nothing more, nothing less. I could be an individual that hacked something in their free time, or I&#39;m a multi-national mega-corp. Does not matter. It just means we have a deal.It&#39;s nice if a community emerges, and if I feel like it, I may participate in it. And accept pull requests or help with troubleshooting or implement new features. But I don&#39;t have to and I don&#39;t have to feel any obligation whatsoever. Anybody who thinks otherwise has misunderstood the concept or is maliciously misusing it.That&#39;s it.This is misunderstood not just by users, but even by creators themselves. They feel pressure, they feel bad if they don&#39;t respond in time, or implement new requested features, or accept pull requests. They shouldn&#39;t. Open source just means I published it once with a very specific deal. I may continue to do so if it makes sense to me, but I can also just stop doing so. I implement features when I have a reason for it, for example I like to have them in the software so I can use them myself, or maybe because I&#39;m a corp that sees a business need. But implementing them for free just because somebody asked for it, that&#39;s just asking for trouble. If you do that regularly, and not mostly because you think it&#39;s fun, but because you want to &#34;support the community&#34; or whatnot, you are taking steps towards burnout, and ultimately are not just hurting yourself but even the larger community, because you are fostering the expectation that that&#39;s what open source devs should do. No, they shouldn&#39;t. That&#39;s not what open source is about.It&#39;s about a specific deal. Nothing more, nothing less."</p>

We have a few roundabout ideas to try(ie call the family on WhatsApp and be on speakerphone), but we’re wondering if anyone has experience doing this or knows of any agencies on the ground that are providing help around this?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Zotero is one of those pieces of open source software that has really improved my life. I first discovered it as a teenager and it revolutionised writing papers and managing sources. Sadly I don’t find myself using it that much in my job.I always got a kick out of introducing it to my friends in the humanities and blowing their minds. I have no idea how anyone writes papers without zotero or another similar tool.
Keep up the good work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been using this in beta for quite a while.  The PDF reader is really very good, and I love the fact that my highlights and notes are not added to the actual PDF file.  (I don&#39;t want to mess up the original PDF file, because I like to keep those files in pristine form so that e.g. I can share them with students.)Some people here are asking about paying for storage for the PDFs.  My solution to this is to store my PDFs using Dropbox, and to use links in Zotero.  That way, even if I give up on Zotero, I still have the files.  And I already pay for Dropbox, and just don&#39;t want one more bill to pay.And, woohoo, an iOS app!  That&#39;s very sweet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not just for scholarly reference management: Zotero is a great tool to keep track of the books you have if your personal library exceeds one or two Billies in volume. For books printed after 1970 the ISBN alone is enough to have it fetch the most relevant metadata for any book published anywhere from online catalogues. I find Zotero particularly useful when going to a book-fair; it is easy to export a list of titles and authors of books you own so you can easily reference it to see which books from a particular author or series you already have."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I recently discovered VisiData and I&#39;m on a huge TUI kick right now because of it.  I know GUIs have their advantages and I use them, but opening a file in vim or VisiData at light speed feels so good compared to firing up IntelliJ or some spreadsheet program.  Good keybindings make working in the program a joy.  These tools are often made by hackers/for hackers, not some corporate structure trying to pad their resume with whatever new feature looks good but works like shit that nobody asked for.  When people developing the tool are also using the tool you get a good tool; this isn&#39;t exclusive to TUIs but it&#39;s common and it&#39;s one of the reasons that when they work they work so well.https://www.visidata.org/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like the low-power aspect of TUIs, but the problem I have with using them over GUI software is there is no launcher or start menu functionality for TUI (re)discovery. I&#39;ll often find a cool TUI posted here, install it &#34;for later&#34; and then proceed to forget I ever installed it. When &#34;for later&#34; finally comes around, I have to guess the name using tab completion or open my browser, search my history and hope it&#39;s there.Is there such a thing as a TUI launcher out there? Something that allows fuzzy search of program names, tags and a short description (using something akin to .desktop files for the application metadata). Then, when I suddenly need a program for a certain task, I don&#39;t have to hope I memorized the correct command. I just open my TUI launcher, type something related to my task and get a list of some TUIs that could help."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For anyone who wants to add graphics to their TUI, notcurses is pushing the boundaries of what&#39;s possible and viable in a terminal. Still could use some bindings for higher-level languages and ergonomics. It also degrades pretty gracefully depending on terminal capabilities.Check out notcurses-demo and see what you can pull off in a terminal. My only gripe is that tmux degrades significantly. Regardless, dankamongmen is an awesome dude bringing back the demoscene vibes.https://piped.kavin.rocks/watch?v=dcjkezf1ARYhttps://github.com/dankamongmen/notcurses"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Author here. Thanks for all the feedback.I&#39;m aware that Lapce lacks lots of basic stuff. It&#39;s a personal project so the initial set of features and key bindings are tight to my personal preferences.I&#39;m currently working on the missing pieces, like multi cursor support(in master but not released yet), mouse support, sane default key bindings(probably I&#39;ll stick to an existing editor), basic UX etc.Feel free to submit a feature request or bug report in Github Issues or leave your feedback here."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just tried it, on Linux.
Pro:- a single binary you can drop in ~/bin- native Linux version- really, really fast- git branches in the top bar by defaultCons (beside being super new and lacking ecosystem):- Use a custom window border, which is also pretty ugly IMO- cannot use arrow keys in the command palette (or any file dialog). I guess it&#39;s a bug?- default key bindings are... weird? ctrl+f doesn&#39;t prompt a find box for example- cannot make syntax highlight work even on common formats like MarkDown, JSON or YAMLSo, it feels very immature but for sure it is a great starting point, if I get good syntax highlight and code completion with a LSP (although it should already work) I might see me switching from VS Code to it, at least partially."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; The court only confirmed what we already know – that &#34;open source&#34; is a term of art for software that has been licensed under a specific type of license, and whether a license is an OSI-approved license is a critically important factor in user adoption of the software.The court confirmed no such things. The decisions expressed in these two documents regarding the use of &#34;open source&#34; as a description of the product in question hinge upon the fact that someone else&#39;s software was released under a new license by Defendant, who had no authority to do so.The court did not care to define open source, except to clarify that a license used previously by the Plaintiff is an open source license, and a license used subsequently is not. The court also did not consider any license-approving practices, let alone those of the Open Source Institute, of whom I find no mention in either document used to justify OSI&#39;s claim."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the salient point of the article is this:&gt; However, the court held that it was improper for the defendants to remove the Commons Clause, and therefore the defendants’ claims in advertising that its ONgDB software was open source was false advertising.&gt; Even though the AGPL has a clause specifically allowing downstream recipients to remove &#34;further restrictions&#34; like the Commons Clause, the court stopped the defendant from doing just that.The decision of the trial court reads:&gt; Section 7 of the Sweden Software License only permits a downstream licensee to remove &#34;further restrictions&#34; added by an upstream licensee to the original work.&#34;Sweden Software License&#34; here refers to the AGPL+Commons Clause.Archive link: https://web.archive.org/web/20220317154012/https://opensourc...AGPL: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"IANAL, but it seems to me that the court has only decided that if you fork software, and break it&#39;s license by removing clauses that aren&#39;t permitted to be removed (think removing one of the 3 clauses in a 3-clause BSD license), then you&#39;re distributing the software under a license that is a lie, and thus invalid, and thus not &#34;open-source&#34;.Could this be used as precedent if you release software and claim that it&#39;s open-source, but don&#39;t provide full source or even any source at all? Probably not IMHO."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m posting anonymously for obvious reasons.I&#39;ve been working at Mozilla since its inception. And eventually left the company 2 years ago.And I&#39;m so mad.Mozilla is not the Mozilla that was created almost 20 years ago. It&#39;s not the same people there. After the Firefox 4 nightmare, they started hiring product managers from big corp. We started seeing some ex-twitter, ex-microsoft, ex-amazon joining the company. People with more professional ambitions. We didn&#39;t know how to react to Google Chrome and the smartphone revolution. We all trusted the upper management, but upper management was slowly becoming non-mozillians.And an absurd mechanic started: original engineer were busy writing difficult code. upper-management was morphing into some BS silicon valley gang. New young engineers were hired, and they thought the core of Mozilla values lied in these upper-management people. And slowly the original engineers started leaving, leaving behind this BS people with these young engineers.Marketing became &#34;how to show we&#39;re good people&#34;. LGBT, women right, etc etc. Who gives a shit about Mozilla standing for these values? It&#39;s all marketing. The real only value, the manifesto, burnt a long time ago.Don&#39;t get me wrong, LGBT and such are important, but that&#39;s not the job of Mozilla.The last blow: getting rid of Brendan. Maybe he didn&#39;t have the same values employees had about LGBT, but fuck this. People in the silicon valley *love* being offended. And that thing was just too good of a fight for them. Brendan was the last bastion standing.I&#39;m so so so mad.Mitchell trusted the wrong people. We were seeing all these ambitious silicon-valley-puppets taking the position of PM, director, etc etc…Got damn, all we wanted is to make Gecko amazing, light, in a lightweight simple browser. But all these stupid features that were landing on our head…I&#39;m so mad…Rant over."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Suppose you want to do something anonymously.1. Download installer from Mozilla from your home network - Mozilla now has your home IP and installer ID.2. Transfer it via USB key to a secure, anonymous computer - one not linked to you, on a network not associated with you, such as public WiFi.3. Install Firefox using that installer on said computer. It transmits the installer ID to Mozilla, which matches the one given to your home IP, thereby deanonymizing you.4. Mozilla receives a warrant for this information, or it is hacked, or the organization is infiltrated by a single government or corporate spy.Edit: It gets worse. Suppose a newspaper IT department takes care of providing Firefox and other trusted software installers to their reporters. Now Mozilla can determine who that newspaper helped with IT, such as journalists or sources. Or if you provide trusted software to your friends, Mozilla gets part of your social graph."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They seem to be trying to gather a lot of telemetry to measure how they can boost popularity of Firefox. I wonder did they tried to measure how the measurement itself influences popularity? Social measurements are like quantum ones, they change reality.There was a funny story of a Hawthorn Experiment[1], which tried to find ways to boost productivity but at the end managed to state just that the very attempt to conduct an experiment boosts productivity. It seems to me that with Mozilla the effect has a opposite sign and any attempt to measure decreases the target variables of decision making. And therefore they need to find ways to measure &#34;non-invasively&#34;, not to measure every little thing they can measure.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne_effect"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the things I love about Deno is that since it implements standard web APIs, many libraries built for the browser just work. For example, I recently made a simple static site generator with Deno to make my blog, and I found that I could use Marked for markdown support simply by importing it like this:  import &#39;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/marked@3.0.7/marked.min.js&#39;;
  // now I can use window.marked()"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I cannot help but root for Deno whenever it features on here. It offers such a wonderful potential future for JavaScript. It&#39;s not fully-baked yet, but man, it solves so many problems in one fell swoop."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; You can log and style CLI output the same way you do it in the browser’s developer tools: using what you know with console.log&gt; console.log(&#34;%cHello World&#34;, &#34;color: red&#34;);TIL, neat! If anyone else did too - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console#sty... looks greatUsing alert/confirm/prompt for CLI tools is nice too, makes a lot of sense to build that in and use the web APIs for it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"So what is the practical use of this?Let&#39;s say that I&#39;m not an engineer or a researcher or a coder, but would like to set some of these units up to collect water. How do I do so? Do I approach someone to build this for me (who?)? How much can I expect it to cost?In other words, how can I actualize this vision:&gt; So the H2E team asked: “What if you could put the power to generate daily drinking water into the hands of individuals, no matter where they live, by creating an affordable, easy to use device that harvests water from the air and is powered by the sun?&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So, it sounds like, this guy worked for CorpCo, found a security issue with OtherCo&#39;s app, and explored their APIs (maybe from CorpCo&#39;s network?), including accessing at least one CC number that was not his.Someone else later discovered the same issue with OtherCo and stole a bunch more card numbers, and used them to commit fraud.OtherCo looked through their logs, saw the initial exploration coming from this guy at CorpCo, assumed he was also responsible for the subsequent fraud, and contacted CorpCo which ultimately fired him. The fraud was substantial enough for OtherCo to convince authorities to pursue criminal charges.It&#39;s a sad story - but it&#39;s not unreasonable behavior from all involved."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"TBH I definitely wouldn&#39;t want my employees going around and hacking competitors in their free time. Too much potential liability. I can see giving a star performer a chance if it&#39;s their first time doing it and if they&#39;d already come clean about it to the other party, but otherwise I&#39;d probably cut my losses.It&#39;s one thing if it&#39;s a designated, well-vetted free for all, like Project Zero, with clear legal approval. It&#39;s another thing for a regular employee to be hacking competitors -- that begins to look like industrial espionage. And even GPZ doesn&#39;t hack banks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lots of people suggesting that either company was out of line here, but like, CFAA is still a thing (assuming OP is in the USA) and it&#39;s still got gnarly teeth. Let alone the possibility of industrial espionage allegations...If you&#39;re going to go hack on a company, make sure you have some legal protection first. Check disclose.io or the company&#39;s website (look for a security.txt!) to make sure there&#39;s some sort of safe harbor provision, or a pre-existing vulnerability disclosure program or bug bounty program that allows you to do this kind of testing.If you&#39;re not going to do that, then disclose the vulnerability anonymously and cover your ass while you&#39;re testing, or just don&#39;t.Meanwhile if you&#39;re an American please write your local representative and express your displeasure with the antiquated, overly-simplistic CFAA and ask them to support initiatives to have it replaced or removed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In the spirit of the old saying, &#34;the two happiest days of a boat owner&#39;s life are the day they buy a boat, and the day they sell it.&#34;The best advice I got starting out was, &#34;be indispensable.&#34;The best advice I got four years later was, &#34;don&#39;t be indispensable.&#34;In a growing company, the indispensable people may find themselves being left holding the bag while new initiatives are undertaken. I very quickly learned the meaning of &#39;working your way out of a job&#39; after the first time this happened to me.I&#39;m sure there&#39;s some min-max game I&#39;m not playing with regards to how easy I am to lay off, but once I learned there are worse fates that being laid off, I stopped looking for them. Being &#34;stuck&#34; with responsibilities is unpleasant when things are going well, but it&#39;s miserable when things are going badly. If you aren&#39;t the one who got laid off, then someone you used to trade off with doing onerous tasks certainly was, and now you&#39;re stuck doing it every single time.If given the choice between &#34;my company would be just fine without me&#34; and &#34;everything would fall apart if I didn&#39;t show up to work,&#34; the latter feels very good for a brief period when you&#39;re young, until the weight of that responsibility sinks in.  &#34;My company would be just fine without me,&#34; can mean &#34;my work here is done,&#34; and you can ride off into the sunset with a clear conscience."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The first thing to remember is – no one is indispensable. If you get hit by a bus tomorrow the company will go on without you. People may have a bit of trouble at first, but new processes will develop and new people will gain expertise just as you have now. Heck the company might be better off in the long run without knowledge bottlenecks.Second, being indispensable doesn&#39;t do a whole lot for job security. If the company is doing well, you need to perform exactly at average to stay employed, no more. And if the company is down in the dumps and there are mass layoffs, who is going to judge how much knowledge you have in your head? All the people who know how good you are are probably getting fired as well.Third, you are probably not as important as you think you are. Upper management isn&#39;t sitting around singing your praises in their weekly meeting. No, they are focused on the rising star who is executing new ideas and launching new product lines. You are meanwhile being taken for granted.Now, if you are in this position the author writes about, the time to get out of it is now. Realize that no one can help you but yourself. Start redirecting people, or ignore them altogether. Make noise up the management ladder. Play dumb if you have to. Eventually the rest of the company will find some new punching bag and leave you alone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked for a european investment bank for a number of years, and they had a policy that every year, every employee (without exception) was required to take 2 weeks holiday as a contiguous block, and during that time, their access to the company was removed, so no email access, no remote login, keycard access to the office removed etc. They basically ran the &#39;suspend this person from the organisation&#39; script and restored you when you returned after your holiday.This was primarily in place to reduce the risk of fraud in the trading/operations side of the business, but it had the side effect that it made it very obvious if the business depended on someone being in the office, since managers would have to cope with people being off and unavailable for 2 weeks. It of course also covered people leaving, or being hit by a bus etc.Overall I thought it was a very simple mechanism to avoid the business risk of being exposed to one employee both from a business as usual, and also from a fraud point of view, and also made it much easier for people to free themselves from a particular role."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Next, we keep the DERP network costs under control… by trying to never use it. When using Tailscale, almost all of your traffic goes peer to peer, so DERP is only used as a backup. We continue to improve our core product so it can build point-to-point links in ever-more-obscure situations.This is mentioned in passing, but shows a very good technique.  They incentivize technical excellence by tying it to a concrete cost.  A free plan, with DERP, is the sacred cow that must not ever be removed.  If they don&#39;t fix the &#34;ever more obscure situations&#34;, then the cost goes up.  If they pay an engineer to investigate and fix this, not only does the engineer get to do interesting technical work, and not only does the system become more reliable and &#34;good&#34;, they can also think of it as increasing the profit margin of the product (by not increasing costs).I worked with Avery on Google Fiber, and we did the same thing.  Our sacred cow was excellent US-based phone support.  That is quite expensive.  If there were bugs in our product, users would call in, and our call center costs would increase because we&#39;d have to have more people working.  So every week in our team meeting, we would look at summaries of calls, and take on engineering work to address the most common class of problems.  That let us scale up the business and still provide friendly and competent phone support, because we were reducing the problems that people called in about.  (This was things like having our Wifi access points steer 5GHz capable devices away from flakier 2.4GHz signals, or fixing &#34;black screen&#34; bugs where TV randomly stopped playing for software or network reasons.)  Because we had that &#34;sacred cow&#34;, every obscure bug that we spent months fixing not only made the product better and were intellectually stimulating to finally figure out, but had a concrete impact on how costly it was to deliver the service.What most companies would do here to reduce costs is simple.  Don&#39;t fix DERP bugs, just charge for it.  Don&#39;t fix &#34;black screen&#34; bugs, just hide the phone number on your website so people can&#39;t figure out to call.Avery has found the perfect balance between cost reduction, interesting engineering, and the somewhat nebulous &#34;good product&#34;.  Normally conflicting concerns, all living together in harmony.  If everyone copied his technique here, the world would be a better place."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For me it’s the opposite: I actually don’t mind paying for a great product such as Tailscale (which I really like), but have security and privacy concerns!Mesh VPNs have substantial control over networks that they manage (they bypass firewalls by having users instal agents from within).  They could add hidden nodes to networks, which is a major security concern, and see who is taking to who, how long, what service they are running, etc, which can be a privacy concern. They are targets.Is there a way to address these concerns, and make them “really” (not just on website) zero trust or at least minimal trust? Will Wireguard preshared keys as an option help (a maliciously added public key lacks a secret key exchanged among peers out of band)?What are the implications of the substantial control that Tailscale has?Or we have no way, but to trust someone? Looking at events of the past decade, I don’t have a good feeling about this!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Tailscale reminds me of Fly.io; fantastic tech that &#34;just works&#34;, run by people who know what they&#39;re doing and know how to write about it. What other companies belong in this all-too-exclusive cohort?"</p>

Who has the time or money to pay 5 people to just go around harassing and stalking people for political gain only?Then I remember the story of the lady in East Germany who, after it fell, managed to get the Stasi records that finally proved that yes, they had been stalking her, harassing her, and spying on her.They would do things like wait until she went into a store to buy something, then let the air out of her bicycle tires. Just stupid little harassing things like that, so that if she complained about it to her family they&#39;d think she was crazy.Next time you hear some nutcase on the street talking about things like this to whoever will listen... ponder things like this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These details are wild, scary, and fascinating. Fascinating from the perspective of how easy it is for foreign governments on the other side of the world to try to scare the shit out of US citizens by hiring some scumbag PI for probably as little as $5k.&gt; Beginning in September 2021, Lin hired a private investigator (the PI) in New York to disrupt the campaign of a Brooklyn resident currently running for U.S. Congress (the Victim), including by physically attacking the Victim. The Victim was a student leader of the pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square in 1989, who later escaped to the United States, served in the U.S. military, and became a naturalized U.S. citizen. In September 2021, the Victim (then living in Long Island) announced his intention to run for a U.S. congressional seat on Long Island in the November 2022 general election.&gt; In hiring the PI, Lin explained that if the Victim was selected during the June 2022 primary election, then he might be “elected to be a legislator. Right now we don’t want him to be elected.” Lin emphasized that, “Whatever price is fine. As long as you can do it.”  He also promised that “we will have a lot more-more of this [work] in the future…Including right now [a] New York State legislator.” Lin explained to the PI that Lin was working with other unidentified individuals in the PRC to stop the Victim from being elected to U.S. Congress."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"An interesting aspect of this is that the endless printing of money in the last few years was a sort of stress test of modern monetary theory, which has been seeing lots of discussion in those same years. I never quite understood how this theory would work while avoiding inflation, and what&#39;s happening now seems to at least be related - https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/06/business/economy/modern-m...Conceptually the answer in the theory is to suck up the excess money with taxes, which of course is not going to fly in the US. But maybe this inflation will make that more viable in the future:
&#34;Ms. Kelton and her colleagues make clear that the pandemic relief packages did not follow one of M.M.T.’s key tenets — they did not try to account for resource constraints ahead of time. In an M.M.T. world, the Congressional Budget Office would have carefully analyzed possible inflation ahead of time, and lawmakers would have tried to offset any strain on available workers and widgets with stabilizing measures and tax increases.&#34;"</p>

This is confusing correlation for causation. Indeed, Bertrand Russell wrote:&gt; The method of a hereditary leisure class without duties was, however, extraordinarily wasteful. None of the members of the class had been taught to be industrious, and the class as a whole was not exceptionally intelligent.

The Williams sisters and their father are one obvious example but if you dig deeper, you will see many more examples. Rafael Nadal was tutored by his uncle. Tiger Woods was tutored by his father. Also, look at coaches. They are often the sons and daughters of coaches.Tutoring allows exploring and independence of thought which is really how you improve your thinking whereas standardized education mostly does not. Tutoring is bidirectional and standardized education is most unidirectional."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Most people here are interpreting &#34;genius&#34; as something like &#34;really smart&#34; or &#34;able to make scientific progress&#34;. I don&#39;t believe that&#39;s the author&#39;s meaning: he&#39;s talking about individuals whose work single-handedly upends our understanding of the world and causes a revolutionary change in thinking. By that definition, making a faster CPU, or a very successful product is not sufficient. By that definition, who are the Einstein-level geniuses? Someone in the thread said Whitney Houston, but... uhh, anyone else?"</p>

A lot of the conversation around RISC-V seems to conflate the open source nature of the ISA with the the actual implementation. Even the reference implementations are BSD licensed so people are allowed to distribute proprietary derivatives to say nothing of completely proprietary implementations.If all or most of the implementations are propriety, I feel like it is a mostly lateral move from ARM as, although it is not open source, the ARM ISA is readily available [1], and the same kinds of rarified CPU engineering and academic circles that will have influence in the RISC-V Foundation, already influence ARM.[1] https://developer.arm.com/architectures/cpu-architecture/a-p..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m surprised at the number of commenters who think permanent DST is favourable to night owls and bad for morning people.I think it&#39;s night owls and delayed-cycle teenagers attending school who will suffer most under permanent DST.In the Winter, permanent DST means everyone has to get up an hour earlier for work or school&#39;s clock time, relative to the sun which regulates their body rhythm.Someone pointed out virtually nobody sets when they wake by the sun.  Fair enough.  But the sun does affect how well and how long they sleep, how restored they are, how they feel when they wake, and energy and concentration through the rest of the day.Night people already struggle with getting up early enough for clock-time social expectations.  As it&#39;s a struggle already, getting up an hour earlier is going to be harder for them.  (If the sun makes no difference, why is it already hard?)Research (e.g. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30691158) suggests that overall, health will suffer, sleep will be shorter, and educational attainment in teenage years will reduce.  Even brain development may be adversely affected.But there will be more shopping (economic activity), so that&#39;s ok."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think I can say this on behalf of most developers who have ever had to fix DST errors in their code: Thank fucking god.I am shocked that none of our unit tests failed on Monday. One of the first code reviews I did here I pointed out that his tests were going to break in a few months when DST kicked in because his tests asserted that there was a 24 hour gap between two calculations. He responded this code was temporary and it would be gone by then.There was another PR on a certain Monday a few months later. Told ya so."</p>

Big congrats to Chris.Interestingly, DigitalOcean has a knack for acquiring these technical dev sites, in 2019 it acquired Scotch.io[0] which was one of the better technical web development sites out there.Fun fact about Scotch, the founder (Chris Sev[1]) sold the site to DO, joined their team, and later managed to broker a deal to 301 redirect a lot of the pages to his new project Better.dev[2].Absolute genius.[0]: https://www.digitalocean.com/blog/scotch-io-is-joining-digit...[1]: https://twitter.com/chris__sev[2]: https://www.better.dev/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is part of a broader trend. Last year, Balaji Srinivasan tweeted about the idea of SaaS companies buying media companies – https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1374363031417753609 – and as an observer/operator in this space, I&#39;ve heard about a lot of conversations going on behind the scenes with larger companies expressing an interest in smaller media companies (including my own - I value autonomy too much but for the right multiple.. :-D).Consider Hubspot buying The Hustle, Robinhood buying MarketSnacks, Stripe&#39;s various acquisitions (like IndieHackers), Insight Partners bought The New Stack.. and this is all happening in the developer space too. Subscription based companies with high cashflow but high customer acquisition costs will continue to buy attention-based companies with relatively low acquisition costs because, frankly, the owners of the latter are generally quite happy with &#34;modest&#34; (&lt;$40m, say) exits that the former can easily cover."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hope they keep the site as it is, css-tricks.com has been consistently one of the best, if not the best CSS site around, to the point that I search there for a particular topic before going to general purpose search engines, and you&#39;ll frequently find Chris&#39; original articles copypasta&#39;d by &#34;content marketers&#34; anyway. I guess the big time push for CSS3 with ever-changing responsive requirements and new UI idioms of the 2000&#39;s and 2010&#39;s is behind us, as witnessed by css-tricks&#39;s forum with contributions from other world-class experts having closed down last year or so.

For solving generic problems, you&#39;re trading off the generic code that best expresses them, for codegen, dynamic downcasting, or Ctrl-V.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think beyond the obvious large sports stadiums, local high schools are among the worst offenders. New tax levies for &#39;schools&#39; almost always pass despite much of that spent on new sports fields meant for the exclusive use of sports teams that constitute only a very small percentage of the student body population (not to mention the overall population). Meanwhile, the school will not even have safe ways for children to ride bikes to school and bus service cannot even be properly maintained."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The financials on this are settled. Sports stadiums are an awful financial investment.  However, running a government is not all about making sound financial investments.  Sometimes it is about pooling resources to provide a joint benefit to society.  Other times it is about trying to price in externalities to allow the market to do its work.  These two issues are not as settled as the investment angle and are almost never discussed.  Sports teams provide utility to people in the region, including people who never pay a cent for a ticket or merchandise. How do you quantity that value and should the government compensate the sports team for that value?  I don&#39;t know the right answer, but I would like to see some economists at least engage with that aspect of these decisions.Also the only way to stop these gifts to private companies is likely with a new federal law banning them. It is simple game theory. These businesses will go where the profit is. Any city or state that refuses to pay will lose out until every city or state refuses to pay.  The best way to force that is with a federal ban."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What really upsets me about public stadiums is when the locals can&#39;t even watch the game.  Take the Rose Bowl in Pasadena.  That stadium is 100% publicly funded by the taxpayers.Since 2011 the Rose Bowl game on Jan 1 has been on ESPN.  So two colleges, the majority of which have been public schools, play in a public stadium and the locals can&#39;t even watch for free.I think at the very least they need to make a law that says all events that take place in a publicly funded stadium need to be broadcast on a free local channel that reaches all of the taxpayers who paid for the stadium."</p>

The exact same goes for the surveillance programs.Losing the moral high ground degrades the whole society.The whole anti establishment movement rallies around stuff like this. The lefties and the right-wingers will be after  different things but they will be able to come together on the hypocritical stance and corruption of the current system.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I lived in Dharamshala (home to the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan government-in-exile) for 3 months a few years ago. My partner at the time went back to the US to visit family, and I didn&#39;t want to leave Asia so I went there since I had some interest in Buddhism at the time, too.In random book stores, I met actual monks who had served time (in China) as political prisoners. One of which had also written a book about it. It was kind of funny to walk in into a book store, see these two guys drinking tea and then get pulled into a conversation out of curiosity. But, as for the stories themselves, probably not that funny. Some of the people (monks, mostly) had physical scars and their stories were anything but fun.I also went to their offices (a modest distance away from the Dalai Lama temple, but very walkable) and got to speak to senior officials there. I asked them basics questions like, &#34;What do you think is the future for Tibet?&#34; and they were very accommodating.We had tea, laughed and talked life. At first they thought I was a journalist, which was hilarious since my approach was very blunt but curious at the same time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a zen Buddhist, I&#39;ve always kinda felt our Tibetan &#39;dharma brothers&#39; style of buddhism (admittedly, I don&#39;t know a lot about) feels much more like a proper religion than the kind of thing I&#39;ve been into.. Which put me off quite a lot of it, I still hope to someday visit the place.It’s pretty sad that such an essentially peaceful and introspective group of people are abused thus, even if they believe in some pretty mad shit.I’ve never worked out what china wants in Tibet tbh though, does anyone have a clue? Chan is bigger in .cn than Tibetan Buddhism (and chan (which became zen) also rejects any kind of eternal self / reincarnation / non-impermanence) and so thus there are no such thing as a lama.So I guess the restrictions / bad business china got unto in tibet are related to some kind of territorial dispute? But what’s there? What do they gain?I can’t see how it’s making them a profit.."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Awesome! A huge amount of work must have gone into this.I did some playing around with VGA graphics from the Pico when it first came out (wrote a simple library to produce SNES like graphics, wrote it all up on my blog https://gregchadwick.co.uk/blog/playing-with-the-pico-pt6/). It felt like Doom should be doable but I figured you&#39;d need an off chip RAM expansion interfaced via the PIO. Clearly not.The Pico really is a very fun board to play around with. Could be a great target for a retro style mini console thing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This thing even has networked multiplayer! In about 256K of RAM and 2MB flash! (It&#39;s the Raspberry Pi Pico board)Carmack would be proud!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s cool, it&#39;s Doom in a completely self-contained cartridge size. Would it be possible to just hook up a cartridge like this to a monitor (through e.g. usb-c) directly?Also if the RP2040 is just $1, does this mean we should be able to get e.g. Doom on cheap handheld single-game devices like the old Game &amp; Watch and similar machines? I remember spending hours on these &#34;racing games&#34; or 12-in-1 Tetris LCD machines from the toy shop. How much does a small (2-4&#34;) color OLED or backlit LCD cost these days? Actually, what is the cheap handheld market looking like these days? I had a boggle at the local toy shop&#39;s website, VTech is still going for it but mainly with baby toys it seems, and those Tetris handhelds are still the same from 20-30 years ago, they cost just €3,99 these days. I&#39;m also seeing some products from a company called Wonky Toys, and miniature Atari arcade cabinets."</p>

At least, nothing stands out as being so unusable that users would flee for your competitor.As for &#34;Gen Z preferences&#34;, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s enough to go on here to prove that. I&#39;m over 35 and have watched user interfaces go from the the fun, colourful and UNIQUE designs of the 2009-era iOS apps to the hyper-corporate, boring af grid system that&#39;s &#34;Apple Approved&#34;. Android is similar, w/ Material Design. I think they have a new one now that replaces MD, but I can&#39;t be bothered to look it up.You&#39;re creating a video speed dating app. Dating is supposed to be FUN. Why design it like Zoom? Have you used trivia apps like QuizUp? You&#39;ll notice how different the design and dynamics are compared to most apps that are designed to render text/image data in specified fields.Also look at TikTok/Douyin for an example of unconventional app design. They could have just copied Instagram, which is blandness personified. But they went with an unfamilar style that nonetheless took off. Nobody&#39;s asking &#34;how do I turn my camera on&#34; there, are they?"</p>

You are different&#34;.Thinking about it further, I actually think this is a super clickbait way to get hits and link clout?

								<p class="story__comment_others">"For better rendering on high-DPI screens and (more subjectively) screens of people that have zoomed in because HN’s text sizes are unreasonably small, add c.style.imageRendering=&#39;pixelated&#39;.I was going to say that the insertion of these 24 bytes allows you to save ten bytes elsewhere by halving the size of the image (making features one pixel in size, rather than two), but then you’d also have to set the doubled image dimensions, and that’d cost more than ten bytes.(Me, I use HN at 120% on top of a native scaling factor of 150%, which is currently implemented as downsampling of 200% rendering because Firefox hasn’t got fractional scaling right yet under Wayland, and widget.wayland.fractional_buffer_scale has some fairly debilitating side-effects on popup windows including non-rendering and crashes, which is a pity because it improves rendering so very much.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m extremely skeptical of this story, at least as written.It makes great clickbait, but it doesn&#39;t really make sense. Where would someone implant a bluetooth earpiece into their ear? There&#39;s not really a lot of empty space in that area unless someone is very overweight and the device is implanted in layers of fat adjacent to the ear, which aren&#39;t great at conducting sound. Did someone really wrap an earpiece in some bio-compatible material, put it in someone right before the test (battery life is limited), and that person was then in a low enough level of pain and/or on enough painkillers that they could still complete the test? I&#39;m extremely doubtful.But the bigger question is: What use is a 1-way communication device? Did the student have a second cheating instrument to photograph the test and send it to someone off-site? Or did they have someone with the test answers reading them off in real-time (&#34;Question 34 - Answer is C&#34;)? It seems this would only be useful in an extremely narrow set of circumstances, if it could be pulled off at all.Really though, why wouldn&#39;t someone just grow out their hair or wear a wig and put an earpiece under their hair? The idea of surgically implanting something that could be easily concealed seems like a modern urban legend."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In my undergrad days, my sibling&#39;s medical college (KMC Mangalore) had an interesting case where the student had hired the service of a rice-engraving artist to etch complete medical manuals onto the sides of metallic ballpoint pens. He was wearing a high powered lens as bifocals.He was caught because he was noticed shuffling a wad of pens too often &amp; then the bifocal glasses were peculiar, prompting some investigation.He had paid the grain-engraving artist to the tune of $30,000-35,000 for the whole set (2006). It is a lot of money!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of people are missing the bigger point here.This person was just one who got caught. The likelihood that they’re the first one to think or do this is very low.There are probably more sophisticated ways of using tech to cheat and I would be very surprised if they haven’t been employed in high stakes exams like this before."</p>

Windows and other Microsoft products tried to make features (and products) &#34;discoverable&#34; by pushing them on you with alerts and banners, but the result, when multiplied by dozens of product teams and PMs, was an overall user experience that was noisy and unpleasant.Looks like a new generation of engineers and designers is ready to learn this lesson the hard way again!"</p>

MacOS: The File&gt;Save dialog has a unchangeable 35 character limit for what can be viewed in the file name field. WTF?! It&#39;s like these jokers have never worked in a real office where people create documents with dictated naming conventions like [Customer Name]_[Project Name]_[Project subtask]-[Date]. Maybe they think it is a way to force businesses to use Tags? Dear Apple, your OS seems toy like.2. Linux: There is an age old Ubuntu bug (which bleeds into many Ubuntu based Distributions) where the installer wipes out the bootloader of a drive that you aren&#39;t even installing the OS on. Dear open source community: your desktop OSs are still hobbyist tweaker mode. I3. Windows: First data mining telemetry and now you are going to show me ads? Dear MS, you keep trying to be Google or Facebook and all it has done is undermine a once serious OS.(note that this is just a &#34;what pissed me off this week list&#34; and not intended to be a comprehensive criticism)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve seen this when searching for restaurants, and I spotted it right away. It&#39;s a classic dark pattern and I&#39;m surprised that more restaurants aren&#39;t suing them over this.Google search results have become dangerous (for lack of a better word) and really hard to use when searching for some things lately. I shouldn&#39;t have to carefully scrutinize every link ON Google and then double check I&#39;m actually ending up where Google said it was sending me. I understand they want to squeeze every possible dollar out of every search, but I no longer trust them for certain searches.I&#39;m not even talking about the results, this is just what&#39;s on the actual Google search results page. There&#39;s just way too many ads and other tricks like this happening."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I could be wrong here, but, I think the lawsuit is totally misdirected. Restaurants should be upset with the ordering platforms (e.g., DoorDash) instead.The problem is the ordering platforms enabling this integration without restaurant consent. (Or, perhaps worse, offering orders without restaurant consent?)Google just provides an API that allows restaurant ordering from Maps, Search etc.  It connects to the ordering platforms (e.g., DoorDash) [1].  The ordering platforms integrate with this API by uploading data feeds and implementing a server with specific interface. [2]I don&#39;t think Google even takes a cut!I worked on an integration to a similar API, &#34;Reserve with Google&#34; [3]. With that one, at least, it can be enabled/disabled at the restaurant level.  I assume that &#34;Order with Google&#34; is similar.[1] https://developers.google.com/actions/food-ordering[2] https://developers.google.com/actions/food-ordering/guides/b...[3] https://www.google.com/maps/reserve/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had this happen to me. Went to order something for pickup from maps. I thought it was the restaurant&#39;s page but the order went through postmates. When I arrived to pick up my order, the staff seemed to think I was an employee of postmates.Anyway, when I got home I did some searching and found out the restaurant had a different webpage from what I ordered from. The prices I paid were a little higher than the actual business websites. It seems postmates charged me more, taking a cut while doing nothing to make the food or deliver it. What a parasitic business to inject yourself as a third party like that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Unless you work at a company that “gets” it (as listed below): instead of hoping or arguing for a raise that puts you and your colleagues in tech in-line with the market, just go out and interview for offers that should increase your total compensation 30-50%.I’ve been writing about this topic for months, including publishing how much companies in 2021 did one-off adjustments as discussed on HN [1] (a list of about 50 companies, between 5-30% as one-off increases outside annual raises) and suggesting to those in charge of budgets to do one-off adjustments ASAP to retain their engineers.Although many CTOs and VPEs read and understood the rationale, the majority could not get meaningful budget increases. The reason? Their non-technical CEO and CFO.This very hot market is only the case for tech and the rest of the business struggles to understand why tech should be any exception at annual budgeting.I see it as the typical story of execs assuming tech leaders are crying wolf when there is no wolf. By the time the wolf takes away most the sheep, it’s too late.The only exceptions I’ve seen are:1. Companies seeing attrition impossible to ignore. In May 2021 a company in the UK announced no pay raises till Apr 2022 answering an all-hands question. 25% of senior engineers left the next 3 months, and the company did an emergency 15% raise across engineering in November.2. Companies that collect, and act on market data. This is mostly Big Tech. It’s why Amazon has been decisive in increasing base salaries, and why Meta increased RSU refreshers by ~20-25% this year. They know the market better than any salary benchmarking company does (which companies’ data is outdated).I still get messages of engineering managers asking how they can make their leadership understand their dire situation. I tell them that unless their company is in the #2 category, the only way is to put them in #1, and suggest these engineering managers lead by example in securing much higher offers, leaving, and after enough people leave, non-technical leadership might eventually act.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29320889"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is just my anecdotal view but it’s based on a few decades in non-tech organisations, from startup to emerging-into-enterprise to enterprise (my path was enterprise -&gt; startup -&gt; e2e) and I think we’re a while out from non-tech organisations understanding the value of their own development resources.Its everything from how IT is still often viewed as a “them-and-us” resource drain similar to HR but less understood (and this less valued by the organisation) even though 95% of the people in every organisation now works with IT devices that wouldn’t operate without IT. To how development continues to live in the weird spectrum of the business that actually needs something more than excel, being under digitalisation (efficiency) and IT (operations and development are natural frenemies).It’s having to live in a 2022 where the “standard” solutions, the “document libraries” the “data-warehousing”, the “data-management-systems”, the “enterprise-architecture”, the “data/ml/bi-architecture “ is still just a bunch of really shitty systems and drawings that can’t connect together and quickly become a nightmare for anyone trying to do any real work leading back to massive excel usage and a constant need for “connection-inhouse-solutions” to make things actually work.Leading to developers still being one of the best paid resources inside organisations with almost limitless tolerance for their non-conformity and rolling eyes in management meetings because most of us simply don’t understand the organisation lingo or the internal political power plays (yes, the bullshit).Anyway, I’ve seen no change in change management to suggest that developers are going to be more valued going forward. If anything I think the want and belief in “standard” solutions might just birth the opposite in the coming decade, until the money managers once again realise that developers are simply necessary in a world where every “standard” solution is just as shitty as it was 20 years ago."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"HR isn&#39;t getting any memo, they are threatening me with disciplinary measures because I refuse to follow their return to the office location policy.
They even proposed to cut my salary in half if I persist in preferring to stay remote to save on expenses.I think some fast growing tech companies are causing many developers to leave their jobs for better pastures, and that&#39;s mostly because some tech companies are performing poorly hence not keeping up with decent salary increases.Easy to get a job with a salary bump ? My recent attempts took well over 6 weeks each, with 3 to 5 interview rounds, mostly being screened by developers and managers having significant tech skills gaps, making the questioning a painful dissonance exercise.But sure. The market is hot for developers and compensation are on the rise."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m currently reading through Johanna Rothman&#39;s &#34;Manage Your Project Portfolio&#34; and related literature and a bunch of this resonates:* Finishing work is more important than starting it* Teams working together on a single priority (&#34;swarming&#34;) seem to be more successful than teams where each person is doing 1-2 things on their ownA few subtle points in this article that made me think:* Keeping existing features working as well as customers expect is a great zeroth priority but it can be hard to know what customers actually expect. Absolutely the worst is when you carefully maintain a very reliable, feature-rich thing that no one particularly wants or uses. In an org without a dedicated PM, I&#39;m never quite sure how to account for time spent on the product-management work of &#34;listen to my customers about what they want from my service&#34;.* The article talks about engineers and stakeholders caring about &#34;project X&#34; and &#34;feature Y&#34;. A bunch of literature suggests that anyone who is thinking this way is probably a bit lost -- they have lost sight of the business outcome that the team&#39;s work is supposed to be getting (more sales, quantifiably happier customers, fewer pager alerts interrupting engineers, whatever). If you can tie particular features/projects to outcomes maybe you can make it easier to explain why you&#39;ve prioritized other work first (it makes bigger outcomes sooner)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In my experience/opinion (disclaimer: small teams only) this single-item paradigm misses a lot of opportunities. I prefer the 60-30-10 approach (see https://minimal.app/603010) as it is more experimental/open while still capturing great focus.To back that up, I’d like to acknowledge that almost all significant contributions I’ve witnessed weren’t the top priority item (instead, they’re some weird experiment). I am generally suspicious of the human ability to form a hierarchy of needs/opportunities, so I try to favor qualities like experimentalism, curiosity.Of course, this is all circumstantial. I’m sure some teams have hard deliverables where there is little value in exploring or doing things with no known measurable impact."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a self-employed person, this is essential. I&#39;m constantly using Things3 to take down notes on ideas for things I want to do, or could do. But there&#39;s only so much I can do in my waking hours. So when it comes time to &#34;prioritize&#34; and make my plan for the week, I throw everything that&#39;s not on fire in a secondary list called &#34;brain vomit&#34; that I simply never look at, while filtering out the important and urgent stuff to the main actual list of things I&#39;m actually going to do.This probably sounds insane but it&#39;s working for me. I think part of the reason is that I often don&#39;t have the mental bandwidth (or discipline) to recognize at the moment of task creation whether something is a good idea or not. I&#39;m simply moving too fast, multitasking too much, to make those calls. So I batch every new idea into the inbox and review it later. And even if I discover good ideas in there later, if they aren&#39;t essential to my work or life they go in the brain vomit folder. So I get all the satisfaction of stream of consciousness &#34;ubiquitous capture&#34; (a la GTD) without the emotional burden of having to actually do all that non-critical stuff."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; An example from another industry: when I worked at a small chip startup, we had in-house capability to do end-to-end chip processing (with the exception of having its own fabs), which is unusual for a small chip startup. When the first wafer of a new design came off of a fab, we&#39;d have the wafer flown to us on a commercial flight, at which point someone would use a wafer saw to cut the wafer into individual chips so we could start testing ASAP. This was often considered absurd in the same way that it would be considered absurd for a small software startup to manage its own on-prem hardware. After all, the wafer saw and the expertise necessary to go from a wafer to a working chip will be idle over 99% of the time.This paragraph from the article reminds me of the recent HN discussion about resilience. In this particular example idling 99% of the time is cheaper, but even if idling 99% of the time is slightly expensive, it might still be a good idea not to outsource due to resilience. What if the vendor goes bankrupt? What if the vendor&#39;s vendor is unable to perform their contractual duty due to a disease outbreak? Or a geopolitical risk? You avoid these risks if everything is in-house, so these risks need to be priced in when determining whether to outsource. But more often than not, these risks are priced at exactly zero."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think it&#39;s that you don&#39;t notice things that work well. House foundations, light switches, filesystems, silicon manufacturing, water delivery, grocery store logistics, etc etc etc.These are all things that most people never notice because they just work. It doesn&#39;t even occur to people day-to-day that these things can fail."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Looking through old Sears catalogs and seeing the prizes on older game shows, I think some of our memory is selective. Even in photos and SD video you can see the terrible build quality on many consumer products from those earlier times. This seems to be especially true for furniture and exercise equipment. When you convert into current dollars, this low quality junk often is more expensive than what is available today. There&#39;s plenty of junk being sold today too and paying more doesn&#39;t guarantee quality but the notion that it&#39;s more difficult to find quality today than in the past doesn&#39;t seem universal. We have plenty of items that survived earlier eras and are examples of durability but the landfills are full of junk that we don&#39;t see."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Couple things:- C4 fixation is a characteristic of smaller, monocot plants.  Trees are slower-growing dicots.  There are more pathways to these organisms than just increasing energy production efficiency.  For example, have you proven that trees actually reinvest the excess glucose into growth, rather than trigger negative feedback pathways to slow glucose production?- Also, you claim that the plant is faster growing with harder wood.  Typically with trees, the speed of growth is inversely proportionate to the strength of the wood - i.e. cottonwoods and box elders grow fast but are terrible woods, while oak and maple are the inverse.  Given the long lifespan of these organisms, have you any preliminary data to back up these claims that these trees are growing faster and stronger?I used to do plant transgenics in a past life, and while skeptical, I do see projects like this as a solution for the future - though more along the lines of faster growing algae because ultimately the bottom line is the variable cost of converting sq meters of sunlight into carbon energy.  It&#39;s just super easy to fall for hype and go straight to science fiction rather than focus on the science."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow - this post is getting a lot of great discussion. We are working on responding to the comments directly. A few key points to add that help frame how we think about the role biotechnology plays in carbon capture and removal.Similar to how advanced biotechnology was able to help develop covid vaccines in record time, biotechnology can and should be used a tool in our fight against climate change. Living Carbon works on a broad array of biotech projects to help improve the carbon capture and sequestration of carbon underground.We chose to share our work on photosynthesis-enhancement as an example of one of the biotechnology tools that can be utilized because 1) there is precedent in literature for similar pathways working in other crops and RuBisCO engineering has been worked on for decades 2) many of the solutions to storing carbon underground for longer are metabolically taxing to plants and can benefit from biotechnology.In response to vague fears around genetic engineering, if Living Carbon’s work resulted in ecosystem destruction we would not have achieved any of the goals we set out to achieve as a company. We have warmed the world so quickly plants do not have the time to evolve to survive in the harsher world we have created.It would be silly to think that our trees alone could or should stop climate change. We view each pilot project as an opportunity to study trees in different ecosystem and understand any impacts they have on underlying ecosystems.We’re intentionally planting trees on land that human previously degraded - such as abandoned mine lands. We’re working to restore ecosystems that have already faced the consequences of human intervention, rather than integrating our trees into already-thriving wild forests.Many of our test pilot projects include the testing of different microbial treatments to help quantify the impact on photosynthesis and the growth rate of trees.75% of the earth’s land has already been degraded by humans. 60% of plants are struggling to survive because there are fewer animals and arable land to spread their seeds and maintain a meaningful population. Whether it’s through paving over our rivers or our urban sprawl, we’ve been modifying our world for centuries. Evolution, which is essentially sums of averages over, cannot move at the speed that humans have moved to degrade our plant and warm it.There is not silver bullet to climate change. Many solutions like mineralization, biochar, and DAC can increase their rate of carbon removal using biotechnology and more efficiently remove carbon from the atmosphere. We need to use human technology to help reintegrate ourselves into our ecosystem and understand how carbon farming using many different carbon removal technologies can help remove carbon from our ecosystem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We&#39;ve got excellent mechanisms for improving the efficiency of plants through engineering and breeding that doesn&#39;t involve a for-profit company controlling IP and maximizing short term returns (the way that YC works). There is an academic community supported by governments and NGOs that works, even if agribusiness siphons off some of the expertise. I am happy that software companies can be created and destroyed quickly if venture companies want to support them. A 5-7 year return on capital doesn&#39;t really work for the carbon budget or agricultural heritage of the planet."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Holy crap! They&#39;re actually doubling the pricing (for some important products)!I actually followed the links and found this:    &gt; Coldline Storage Class B operations pricing will increase from $0.05 per 10,000 operations to $0.10 per 10,000 operations.

    &gt; Coldline Storage Class A operations pricing in regions will increase from $0.10 per 10,000 operations to $0.20 per 10,000 operations.

    &gt; Coldline Storage Class A operations pricing in multi-regions and dual-regions will increase from $0.10 per 10,000 operations to $0.40 per 10,000 operations.

    &gt; For all other storage classes, Class A operations pricing in multi-regions and dual-regions will increase to be double the Class A operations pricing in regions. For example, Standard Storage Class A operations in multi-regions and dual-regions will increase from $0.05 per 10,000 operations to $0.10 per 10,000 operations.

This announcement is just an eye wash to hide the fact that they&#39;re doubling their pricing structure for some products. And they claim most customers will see a cost decrease.Sigh, I was just thinking of moving all my stuff, projects and even websites from cloud hosted solutions to my own home server and slapping a cache like CloudFlare on top of it and calling it a day. This is only pushing me in that direction, haha.Reference: https://cloud.google.com/storage/pricing-announce"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google cloud has to be the most confusing product suite known to mankind. What an unbelievable mess.After merging two companies I had to move a bunch of stuff over to a new bankaccount. three weeks later and I&#39;m still not 100% sure that I got it all, the interfaces are so opaque and the different ways in which you can get billed so confusing (never mind the bills themselves) that it is nearly impossible to get a clear picture.This does not feel like it is an accident, and this message is very much in line with that.I always wonder how such systems come about. The number of confusing error messages you have to deal with for pretty basic stuff is off the scale. You can name anything, except of course when it actually matters and then only some cryptic UID is shown. Don&#39;t get me started on users and permission management, or how it is perfectly possible to orphan an entire project[1] if a person leaves your org. (Gsuite and GCP may superficially appear to share a bunch of stuff but that just sets you up for some very cute surprises, from which it can be extremely difficult to recover.)[1] https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/project-suspe..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Will customers’ bills increase? Decrease? The impact of the pricing changes depends on customers’ use cases and usage. While some customers may see an increase in their bills, we’re also introducing new options for some services to better align with usage, which could lower some customers’ bills. In fact, many customers will be able to adapt their portfolios and usage to decrease costs. We’re working directly with customers to help them understand which changes may impact them.There is a zero percent chance they haven&#39;t ran the analysis and concluded what % of customers would see a bill increase. It&#39;s high. If its low-to-zero, cloud companies are clear about how the prices are changing, and usually outline how many customers are would be negatively impacted. If it&#39;s high, they&#39;re ambiguous about what is changing, and shift the blame onto customers; if its still expensive for you, you&#39;re just not using it right."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wish companies would be forced to do that same for everything, and at a reasonable cost.It&#39;s infuriating how if I buy, say, a dishwasher, and the heater pump goes, it&#39;s around £100 for a new one, but the whole machine costs maybe £400. Are you telling me that all that steel and plastic and motors and controllers and labor and profit and shipping and everything is actually 75% of the cost, and 25% of the entire value of my dishwasher is tied up in the value of that one part, the one that happened to need replacement?And don&#39;t get me started on cars!If we as species cared about sustainability (we don&#39;t), companies would have to sell their parts for little enough that you could buy all the parts for a whole new machine for no more than the cost of the new machine. That would focus their minds on using interchangeable, standard, COTS parts to avoid having to maintain SKUs and also avoid having the parts fail in the first place. Rather, now, it&#39;s highly profitable to make parts fail: you either get to ding the customer for a replacement part at 500% markup, or they give in and buy a whole new machine, and the old one goes to scrap."</p>

If fixed batteries makes product smaller or better then it’s choice of creator, maker and hacker. Consumer should be voting with their wallets and they should have a choice. This kind of constant interference from EU burocrates without understanding technical details is what led to completely pointless “accept cookie” disaster all over the Internet that has already cost billions of dollars collectively while not benefiting anyone."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is so great. Thanks for sharing your code and your collections of tilesets etc, as well as where you got them from. I&#39;ve been wanting to make a learning app into pokemon style quest adventure for quite some time now but I don&#39;t know anything about game development/engines out there. Your repo is a great introduction to exactly this kind of thing.I wanted to do something with javascript/HTML5 that let me switch between this kind of map and little exercises that would switch over to React/DOM stuff. Seems like Phaser 3 would be a good (the best?) tool to do this? Any thoughts or suggestions? I mean like I would love to have a little world just like this you could walk around in but then when I walk up to a certain section in the library it would jump into an exercise which would involve Q&amp;A with the questions and promps using React and the DOM. Then when the person finishes the challenge it would jump back out to this tiled world.I see people embedding Phaser games inside React apps, but is it possible to embed  interactive React DOM components inside Phaser games? Or does everything have to stay in Canvas/WebGL mode?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I used .NET Core for a backend API relatively recently (3.1) with no background in .NET prior (mostly javascript/typescript, php, and ruby). I found it incredibly productive and to be an enjoyable developer experience. Entity framework is one of the best ORMs I&#39;ve ever worked with. Solutions and projects took some getting used to but I like it in retrospect. I now use IntelliJ products as a consequence of having used Rider for that project (developing on a mac) and enjoying the experience. C# as a language is now one of my favourites. I find it hard to convince colleagues and peers to give it a chance (mostly ruby and javascript devs) which is a shame."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have worked with .NET for a long time and recently did some work with Java, node and python. .NET has a lot going for it but i feel MS is making things more complicated than they have to be. When I need to achieve something a little off the beaten path in the non .NET technologies this is often pretty straightforward to achieve whereas in .NET I have to find some obscure interface  and overrides to implement and then deal with weird side effects. I think .NET has become too big for its own good to be maintained by one party. The documentation also has a lot of volume but almost no structure. When .NET started out it was pretty coherent but in the last few years it felt very disjointed without a central design philosophy. Don’t even mention desktop development which is a complete mess since Windows 8.Maybe I am too negative on .NET but personally find the open source alternatives easier to work with and more fun."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love .NET. It is highly productive, reasonably performant and you can competently write any kind of software using it beside systems programming. It is an excellent jack of all trades, and you can move with ease from game programming, to web applications, to desktop software, to small glue programs and utilities, to mobile apps, to web frontend and what not.In the future even systems programming might be possible with push towards native apps and direct memory access. If at some point it will be possible to disable the garbage collector and manually manage memory, .NET could be used for everything.For a company investing in .NET is a good idea since you can move with ease a developer from one role to another. And even if you don&#39;t move the developer, having a mobile developer who can read and understand the code for the backend APIs can be quite beneficial.For me, personally, working with .NET was quite a win. I moved from desktop apps to web, then, when I got bored I moved to the gaming industry as a game developer and now I am again a happy web developer writing microservice based web apps. Meanwhile I also developed a few mobile apps for myself."</p>

It’s autoplay blocking has actual teeth: I’m delighted when YouTube’s annoying autoplay-next-video is foiled by it.Since it is smaller and from a less well-known group of developers, I can totally understand this being untenable. But the added risk is worth it for me, because while it isn’t perfect, it feels like I have gotten a little slice of control back with it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I played a bit into this game (maybe about 20 hours), and it&#39;s good. The size of the map dominates the game-play as you aim to explore all the types of destinations. It&#39;s a procedurally generated world, and some hilly towns will get a little weird. The glider is really a killer features, because the mountains are really really steep, you climb up to the top and the glide to cover a fairly large distance on the map.It was still hard to get into the social element of the game, because of so few players and such a large map. I think other players tended to be concentrated at the main spawn point, so a lot of the rest of the world was a backwater essentially.They also have a giant tree. It will cost you some hours, but it&#39;s quite different than anything else you&#39;ll find."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a little curious, is there a technical reason why voxel games are easier to build than non-voxel ones? The docs mention that all of the assets are community-contributed. Does making them voxel-based just drastically lower the skill theshold to make a contribution, vs. smoother ones in something like Blender? I guess I&#39;m a little curious about the relative amounts of effort that would have been required to make this kind of game (procedurally-generated open world, I believe) using non-voxel assets and mechanics, since the existing set seems to be pretty fully-featured."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like some of the &#34;inspired by cubeworld&#34; stuff is a little too heavily inspired, but I really enjoyed taking a quick look at the source and logging in to check things out.Things seemed pretty clean, and because everything has source posted I was able to mess around with the apis, and try a few things against your services :) (hope I didn&#39;t set off any alarms lol). That said, what I&#39;m assuming is Sha256 could always be a bit tighter, consider a strength upgrade on those credentials.There&#39;s a bit of snobbery going on here for go / voxel hate, but I really enjoyed digging into a completely open source setup for something that is already a nice intro of game, services, and execution, well done :)"</p>

Given that there are no patterns, no sequences whatsoever, it&#39;s just one single 16 position loop per &#34;device&#34;, an entire song could easily fit on the URL. Eg the TypeScript playground live-updates the url as you type: https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?#code/FAYw9gdgzmA2CmA6WY...That &#34;record&#34; feature is neat, but it&#39;d be way neater if I can just share an URL with my composition with a friend and they can remix it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Top reader comment seems apt w/r/t the pollution aspect anyway:As a scientist (an immunologist) who leads a research lab on lung inflammation including asthma, the cavalier attitude Times columnists have toward scientific references in their articles is appalling.RMI is a thinktank with an agenda. Not a research institution. And Brady Seals is not a scientist. Note the lack of PhD. She has an MBA and has never worked in science. Nor did she &#39;author a study&#39;. She authored a REPORT. Which is not peer-reviewed and not published in a reputable journal.As an immunologist I assure you that scientific evidence does not indicate that &#39;increase of asthma is on par with living in a home with a smoker&#39;.And frankly- just walking outdoors in NYC you&#39;re exposed to far higher levels of lung-irritating pollutants than you are cooking stir fry on your stove.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I fitted an AEG induction hob in our kitchen about 3 years ago. It is absolutely amazing. It&#39;s so controllable - you can go from &#34;barely hot enough to melt chocolate&#34; to &#34;so hot your pans start discolouring and everything burns&#34; - and back again - in seconds (and everything in-between obviously).I always thought gas was the best for cooking. But I was wrong - induction is. Gas is great for medium-high power cooking, but it falls apart for lower temps, and it&#39;s very hard to get it consistent. The only time I really miss gas is when stir frying - you can&#39;t really use woks on induction.It&#39;s also wipe clean!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s not a coincidence that all the main characters featured in this video are women. The main thing the filmmakers are trying to show is that these are girl-bosses who can do anything men can do (and more) and it&#39;s so important to show that with utter, relentless completeness, that they&#39;ve created characters that are magical, who don&#39;t need to overcome anything, characters who matter mostly as individuals, who have no duties or responsibilities to anyone else (most certainly not to any men). They&#39;re just total kick-ass take-no-prisoners empowered women.That&#39;s why these characters are good at everything from the start. It&#39;s why they never struggle. The overriding point that&#39;s trying to be conveyed in every scene is that these women kick ass. That&#39;s why the modern Mulan can&#39;t be shown as weak and later overcoming her physical weaknesses in other ways. No, she cannot be weak -- full stop. If she encounters a much larger man, then she has to kick his ass.Addendum that shouldn&#39;t be required, but of course it is: I want to make it totally clear here that of course women leads can be interesting and dynamic and multi-dimensional. If you think I&#39;m saying otherwise, then please don&#39;t even bother engaging, because you will have totally missed my point, which is that this particular approach to featuring women is ham-fisted and risible and probably counterproductive, in the end."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another enormous gripe I have with modern movies, other than the (lack of) interesting moral lessons from OP, is the sound design. Loud explosions and music, with quiet, mumbled lines[1]. I&#39;m forced to watch every movie with subtitles on, or to miss a good chunk of the dialogue.And I&#39;d go beyond that, and blame the mumbled lines for our lack of interesting quotes. It&#39;s a lot harder to have unexpected turns of phrase, speech patterns, or novel vocabulary choices when the audience is struggling to understand even the most basic, predictable sentences.[1] https://www.slashfilm.com/673162/heres-why-movie-dialogue-ha...Edit: for people mentioning audio mixing and stereo, that&#39;s only part of the problem. Even with my (admittedly cheap) 5.1 setup, I sometimes miss most of the dialogue in some scenes. I think the change from theatrical to more realistic enunciation is also to blame."</p>

There are so many choices that I harshly judged older people for making (how to allocate their time and money, where to live, what to allow or not allow the kids to do, how to behave at work, etc.) that I now find myself making as a married guy in my mid-30s with four kids. It makes me sad, but on each point I&#39;m like, &#34;Oh, now I get it.&#34; I fear that this pattern could continue until I become my father in my 50s and 60s. I try not to judge people so much anymore.Anyway, I appreciate the article as someone who will soon try my hand at teaching. I will have a lot to learn."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This perfectly describes my experience as a TA in graduate school. At first I didn&#39;t understand why my advisor insisted on being so precise in assignment instructions. Then when TAing with him I saw how students could creatively misinterpret instructions, even when I could not imagine how to make them more precise. An exception for the new case would be added to the next iteration of the assignments. I only understood why we went to such lengths to prevent cheating because in my first year I watched my advisor spend two weeks of his time sitting down individually with each student and present evidence that they had cheated. Only about 10% of the students had cheated, but in a class of 1400, that&#39;s 140 students! I can&#39;t even imagine how much work that must of been on the head TA."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; every word of the assignment creatively misinterpretedOTOH when I took operating systems I got an assignment that said “implement a job scheduler, using FIFO, LIFO or round-robin job scheduling”. So I picked FIFO, got it working and I had time left over so I thought, “what the hell?  I’ll do LIFO too”. So I did, and I still had time so I took a crack at round-robin, but I didn’t have time so I turned it what I had, proud of myself for going above and beyond.I got back a 66 on the assignment. I asked why and he said, “you didn’t even attempt round robin”. I pulled up the assignment where it VERY CLEARLY said “or” and he said, “well, it should have been obvious I meant ‘and’”."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What I find incredible is: Once this fully ramps up, this one power plant is expected to satisfy 14% of the entire country&#39;s electricity needs.  7 of these could power an entire country, 24/7."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What&#39;s surprising is the length of time of this project. It was started in 2000, and just completed. That&#39;s 23 years of development. These nuclear projects appear to take a significant amount of time.By comparison, this wind turbine project near my parents was approved in 2016 and completed in 2018, providing 78 megawatts of power. Yes that&#39;s significantly less than the 1.6 gigawatts of this Finnish power plant. But, consider that in the same time period, 10 of this wind projects could be completed.On top of that, solar projects are also much faster. Look at the Solar Star solar installation which provides .5 gigawatts of power, started in 2013 and completed in 2015. So 10 of these could have been completed in the same time as the Finnish system. No, I&#39;m not suggesting that Solar is a good option in Finland. And yes, it would be important to work on massive battery storage systems, to make these work.This just points out just how uneconomical nuclear power is. On top of that, with nuclear facilities coming under fire in Ukraine and Russia making (probably bluffing) threats against Finland, it really makes nuclear an unappealing option. Can someone point out why these projects are so attractive to so many people when it would appear that a combination of renewables appear to both be faster to bring on line and overall safer?Edit: forgot the links,Arkwright Summit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkwright_Summit_Wind_FarmSolar Star https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_Star"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good job Finland. I respect the opinions of the environmentalists and agree with most of what they say, but until we have something more reliable that can put out power 24/7 year round, we need more new, modern nuclear plants."</p>

These aren&#39;t really &#34;system&#34; preferences so much as Apple cloud service settings which have been wedged into System Preferences.(And where it is used, it&#39;s doing the barest minimum.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wasn&#39;t surprised to see the Family Sharing pane in the first screenshot. It&#39;s easily the most janky part of System Preferences that I&#39;ve had to struggle with:- Loading indicators for several seconds when switching between categories in the left sidebar, on a very decent internet connection.- Janky animations and transitions when opening modals, like clicking the &#34;Details...&#34; button on a family member.- Within the &#34;Invite people to your family&#34; modal, clicking &#34;Not Now&#34; causes the &#34;Invite People&#34; button (the default, highlighted action) to blink before the modal closes.Yes while these are absolutely nitpicks, I feel that Apple has lost some of the attention to detail that set them apart."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The error messages could be better yet.The example uses a different code per issue, for instance: &#34;user/email_required&#34;. Most integrators will build their UI to highlight the input fields that contain an error. Making them parse the `code` field (or special-case each possible code) is pretty toilsome.    // from blog post
    {
        &#34;code&#34;: &#34;user/email_required&#34;,
        &#34;message&#34;: &#34;The parameter [email] is required.&#34;
    }

Make it parseable:    // improved
    {
        &#34;message&#34;: &#34;An email is required.&#34;,
        &#34;error&#34;: &#34;missing_parameter&#34;,
        &#34;parameter&#34;: &#34;user.email&#34;
    }

In addition, I:* rewrote `message` to be an acceptable error message displayed to (non-technical) end-users* moved message to be the first field: some developer tools will truncate the JSON response body when presenting it in the stack trace.---As an added bonus, structured data allows you to analyze  `error` frequencies and improve frontend validation or write better error messages: https://twitter.com/VicVijayakumar/status/149509216182142976..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sometimes, I feel that we ought to have a simple protocol, on top of HTTP, to simply do remote procedure calls and throw out all this HTTP verbs crap. Every request is a http POST, with or without any body and the data transfer is in binary. So that objects can be passed back and forth between client and server.Sure, there is gRPC, but it requires another API specification (the proto files).There I said it. HTTP Verbs constrained REST APIS are the worst thing ever. I hate them.They introduce un-necessary complexity, un-necessary granularity and they almost always stray away from the &#34;REST principles&#34;. To hell with &#34;Hypermedia&#34; stuff.I find it such a joy to program in server rendered pages. No cognitive overhead of thinking in &#34;REST&#34;.But, of course, all this is only where the client and server are developed by the same person / company.For publishing data and creating API for third party use, we have no serious, better alternative to REST."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some nice tips in here. However, tip 15, I strongly disagree with:&gt; 15. Allow expanding resourcesI would suggest the opposite. A REST API should not return nested resources at all. Instead, and to stay with the example provided on the website, to obtain the &#34;orders&#34;, the /users/:id/orders endpoint should be called.It might be tempting to return nested resources, because clients would only have to make a single call.Technically this is true but once the domain of your API starts to grow, you will find that the interface will become increasingly muddled.The suggestion provided (use query parameters) is basically a work-around. If you want to offer this to your clients, front your REST API with a GraphQL API instead. It is literally the problem that GraphQL solves. Keep your REST API clean and dumb and focused around CRUD."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not directly related to the title, but further in the article:&gt; newly minted MBA ex-consultant who’s just started working at Dropbox as a product manager: and here is my presentation about why it is imperative for us to expand from file synchronization and, for some reason, password management, into financial service integration through our automated financial information archival tool, and then ultimately into financial services, which will strengthen our moat against competition from other file synchronization servicesI think this is largely part of why modern web services are getting more annoying and aggressive about monetization strategy -- a massive proportion of people in product these days seem to not be the sort of nerds-solving-real-world-problems who founded Dropbox, but someone coming from big consulting companies where the main output seems to be 300-slide presentations. It does not seem like they have much of an exposure to the more human-centric style of building a good product, but rely mostly on buzzwords and spreadsheets, because that ties in closely to what they did before.I&#39;d like to hear a counterargument from any ex-consulting product managers, or people who hire them though :)That being said, the password management seems...okay to me? Services like 1Password already used Dropbox as a backend, so if you&#39;re paying Dropbox, it seems like a fair feature expansion for them to give you further reasons to keep using them since the space overhead is presumably trivial. You probably have a decent amount of sensitive data in there as well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I got into the fifth batch (s07) and remember my other startup friends staging an intervention to dissuade me from accepting  because &#34;the valuation is really bad.&#34;Interesting to see how long even the industry insiders failed to take YC seriously. And then once it was working, they flipped immediately to complaining that YC was too powerful and too influential (unbeatable network effect, seed/A valuation inflation, and so on).I also remember the constant naysaying about scalability and batch size. Our batch was ~19 companies. People kept naysaying, &#34;Well this model is fine for now, but it will never work past 20 teams.&#34;PG would always reply with something like, &#34;Yeah, they said that when we had fewer than 10 teams also. We aren&#39;t thinking too far ahead; each batch, we just find the next bottleneck and solve it, and we&#39;ll see how far that gets us.&#34; Which evidently got them pretty far. A lovely example of doing things that don&#39;t scale."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love YC.Even though I&#39;d never apply and thus never get in because of my preconceived notions about YC&#39;s preconceived notions (too &#34;old&#34;?, proud Dad of a bunch of homeschooled kids, mostly solo founder (well, I&#39;ve got kids who code!), building a social/chat app way outside of the Bay area echo chamber, and not toeing any particular political lines (hey, I&#39;m a coder so I&#39;m allowed to recursively nest parens -- don&#39;t tread on me), and even if I&#39;m doxing myself a bit with this comment!), YC and PG (through his essays, Hackers and Painters, and his genuinely kind and sincere approach to everything, even with people who are on the opposite side of the political aisle, like me) have taught me so much about how to be a force for good in this strange and weird world.PG seems to truly live out Jesus&#39; wisdom and the Golden Rule. He wisely avoids getting dragged into political discussions, and the HN moderators wisely steer even very wild discussions away from flame wars. For my next act, I&#39;d like to build a social app that scales up the same sort of non-partisan (or multi-partisan!) active, intelligent discourse that occurs here, even if there are, sadly, very few dang&#39;s in the world.I would like to say a very, very warm and very sincere thank you to pg, dang, and the rest of the YC team who make it possible to still have a civil, mostly uncensored, and wide-ranging conversation, and has helped so many great startups get off the ground, both inside and outside of YC with things like the SAFE and the startup-school opened to all, proving to VC&#39;s how things can and should be done, and just pursuing the most interesting startups, period. If I truly thought I had a chance given my coloring so far outside the SF political lines, I&#39;d apply in a heartbeat!Much love from someone deep in the heart of Texas. Keep up the incredibly awesome work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"YC has been an invaluable resource for me.An acquaintance was in the 3rd batch of founders and turned me on to the ecosystem and community here. Around that time, I was a few years out of high school and working for minimum wage at a pizza shop.I was experimenting with web design, making a few extra dollars running google ads on phpBB forums, and learning to code in the process. I never realized my geeky side could translate into something entrepreneurial until I started spending time here. Tracking the progress of my friend and this community planted a seed that turned into a dream of someday being a founder.Today, my two business partners and I have been running a successful software business for almost a decade. We were distributed before it was mainstream. We&#39;re in the WordPress space and have a team of 20+ people all over the globe. I&#39;ve had the opportunity to travel, meet investors, smoke cigars with business heroes, sleep in if I want to, and enjoy an exciting and fulfilling life.I still find myself regularly googling about issues that arise in my company with &#34;hacker news&#34; appended to the end of the query. The stories here helped us navigate a very stressful M&amp;A process and countless other &#34;business stuff&#34; hurdles that we encountered over the years (ie business insurance &#34;hacker news&#34;).YC provided me with direction and inspiration when I was floundering around in my early years. The simple ideas that you don&#39;t need an MBA to start a business and being an odd duck is a valuable entrepreneurial trait were life-changing. The community and discussions here are where I come to learn and be inspired. I sincerely hope it continues to be that for myself and others for many more years to come.Thanks YC!"</p>

You can flip to a random page and understand what makes a front yard really fulfill its purpose, or you can flip to a different page and learn why some public plazas just don&#39;t get used, while others flourish.It&#39;s a template system for designing a room, a house, a neighborhood, a city, etc.Makes you think about what a component is, what makes it &#34;good&#34; or &#34;bad&#34; at what it&#39;s supposed to do, and what makes it harmoniously integrate with other components."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like there must be better mathematics books than those two if what you want is a taste of mathematics. What you get from Euclid is the idea of proofs from a set of axioms, but Euclid in the original is quite a painful way to get introduced to that. And I&#39;ve never understood the obsession with Spivak. Of all the calculus and analysis books I read, it definitely wasn&#39;t up there as anything special.Not sure what the best books are these days to give people a flavour of university style mathematics. I quite liked Introductory Algebra and Analysis by Geoff Smith when I was teaching first year mathematics years ago but I assume that was published 25 years ago so I imagine has been superseded."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From the commentsNothing in your analysis shows this.
Moreover unless you explicitly deployed a root certificate on your clients (or if an app on the client did it), the router can&#39;t decode TLS traffic (deep inspection) without you getting certificate warnings on the client.
In that case, the only thing the router can see is the dns request, the IP and the TLS SNI.
In short your title is misleading.permalinkembedsavereportreply
[–]ArmoredCavalry[S] 11 points 14 hours ago*I agree they couldn&#39;t be inspecting the contents of your traffic over TLS, but they could easily view destinations. I also agree, there&#39;s nothing in my analysis that proves that all the requests are related to network traffic.
However, if you look at the wording of the reply (directly from TP-Link) to XDA in their review, I don&#39;t see how it could be interpreted any other way? Regardless, I probably should have made my title &#34;appears that it may send traffic related data&#34;.
I&#39;ll be happy if that isn&#39;t the case, but the lack of clear explanation from TP-Link when I&#39;ve contacted support leads me to assume the worstpermalinkembedsaveparentreportreply

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember reading in the UK government&#39;s security assessment of Huawei that one of the issues is not necessarily data being sent to bad places or backdoors in the software, it&#39;s that the engineering processes behind these devices/software are completely unable to protect against any sort of supply chain attacks.The sorts of things they highlighted were: no version control, no code review, production builds happening on arbitrary machines, no automated testing, poor access control on code, no audit trail on code changes, the list goes on, and that&#39;s just for the software side. The conclusion was that Huawei were about a decade away from being able to even claim they had no backdoors. And that&#39;s a major telecoms hardware provider, trying to sell into governments and major infrastructure projects.I&#39;m not in the least bit surprised that TP-Link are doing this, and also not at all surprised that when questioned on it they are (so far) unable to actually describe why it&#39;s happening or really seem to know anything about it.I think this sort of product is built in a very different environment to what most HN users would expect."</p>

They are a German company and as far as I know software development is also done in Germany, so I expect that they operate within the relatively strict privacy regulations of the EU.[1] https://en.avm.de"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi all! Some background on the project: I want to build a house someday, and the first step is deciding where to build. I knew an interactive map like this would be useful, but after fiddling with leaflet.js for a while and googling for climate data, I felt a bit lost. So I decided to try something new: I hired a contractor on Upwork who had experience with map visualizations. They built an MVP within a few weeks, and from there I was able to tweak and optimize the code to my liking. I think this is a great strategy for side projects that you&#39;re too busy for. :)It&#39;s still mostly a toy at this point, but I&#39;d like to add more knobs and data so that I can narrow down the best place to live (and hopefully help other people do the same). If you want to contribute, the code is open source: https://github.com/lukechampine/goldilocksThe site weighs about 1.6 MB (gzipped -- the full climate data is ~35 MB uncompressed!) and is hosted on a Linode, which seems to be holding up pretty well.Also, a big thank you to those in the comments who shared links to similar projects! The &#34;pleasant places&#34; map is super close to what I want. Ideally this project would look something like that, but with the ability to select your own preferences for what constitutes a &#34;perfect&#34; day."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like data like this - it reminds me of the pleasant places maps[1].That said - you have to be wary of both types of maps because it doesn&#39;t take into account other potentially annoying factors.  The biggest being humidity - there&#39;s a huge difference between 90 degree phoenix and 90 degree miami.  Then there&#39;s rainfall, and one a lot of people don&#39;t think about - wind.To add - if you&#39;re thinking about seriously comparing two climates, check out this comparison tool [2].  Has any metric you can dream of charted together.1 - https://kellegous.com/j/2014/02/03/pleasant-places/2 - https://outflux.net/weather/noaa/index.php"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I must say, it&#39;s frustrating clicking this link and landing on a page narrowed to the USA, and, to top it off, in Fahrenheit… Maybe a title change would be welcome."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What a truly beautiful and elegant design. This is so reminiscent of the hacker ethos in how it captures the potential and love of technology. How can a project this creative not be more famous? I have seen many of these kinds of &#39;small, powerful computer projects&#39; before and I&#39;ve never felt inspired by any of them. But this project really captures the imagination with the potential of modularity / expanding capabilities.This is honestly so creative. It makes me filled with that childish sense of wonder I initially had with coding. What things could you make if you had a whole box of snap-ins and a few Pockits? This is frigging insane. If you&#39;re an angel investor consider throwing this guy a bone!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As far as I can tell, this is a single individual that has done all of this work. I am floored at the design and intricacy of this project.Really, truly blown away. I&#39;m sure there are plenty of edge cases to correct for but I haven&#39;t gotten so excited by a demo in a long time. I&#39;ve obviously signed up to learn more."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sometimes the point of a technology is not its direct utility but to
carry forth or promote an idea.Because of what&#39;s happening with climate, pollution and e-waste, the
future is modular. Modular phones, computers, cars and even nuclear
reactors.Having this kind of thing in schools helps kids get used to the idea
that technology is configurable at the physical level without
electronics skills.Strong interoperability legislation should be a part of technology
going forward. Industry will welcome and adapt to it because it&#39;s
ultimately a better compromise than tougher regulation and export
controls."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article doesn’t really provide much in the way of explanation for why this law is being enacted. Here [0] is a better article that quotes supporters and objectors to the law.It includes the (IMHO not very convincing) figures that &#34;Between 1993 and 2003, around 130,000 Palestinians were given Israeli citizenship or residency through family unification, including children, according to court filings. The Shin Bet security service told the Knesset on Monday that between 2001 and 2021, about 48 were involved in terror activities.”48 of 130,000 amounts to 0.037% being involved in terrorist activities which seems very low to be used as justification for a law around security.[0]: https://www.timesofisrael.com/after-coalition-battle-knesset..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We see more and more similar laws being passed in recent years, laws that are blatantly discriminatory. This may raise the indignation of many people, but in my opinion, Israel is shooting itself in the foot by passing these laws, because it reinforces the argument that it is an apartheid regime. Israel is slowly losing its support in the free democratic world where people believe in the inalienable universal rights of individuals and are less and less willing to turn a blind eye to such institutionalized racism."</p>

Substitute &#34;Palestinian&#34; for ANY other nationality, ethnicity, race, sexual orientation, or other adjective describing a group to which YOU belong.3.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve seen this issue in a slightly different context.  A few years ago, my Android phone began dying much more quickly than before.  Looking at the built-in battery stats, nothing was amiss and there were no apps causing excessive wakeups.  It was only when I used Android Battery Historian that I saw there was a ton of bluetooth wakeups caused by Google Play Services.But why would it be waking up so much?  Usually the wake requests originate from some other app, but I didn&#39;t see any associated wakeups in the stats dump.  After a while I remembered that I installed GasBuddy recently, and a Google search revealed that other people had Bluetooth battery drain issues after installing it.  Apparently GasBuddy had an ads SDK that aggressively scanned for Bluetooth beacons.  Removing the app stopped the drain.I was shocked that no battery stats screen showed GasBuddy was the culprit.  Even the Battery Historian tool (which requires the user to run a Docker image and dump a bugreport) only hinted that there was some Bluetooth wakeups, but didn&#39;t show which app they originated from.This AirTag seems to be a similar issue, especially if a less experienced user doesn&#39;t realized all the &#34;Find My&#34; wakeups are caused by nearby AirTags.I think Apple needs to make the &#34;deep sleep&#34; states of their devices more strict so they can minimize drain when sitting (both when sitting overnight on a nightstand, or for a week in a living room).  Notifications (besides calls) can usually afford to be batched since users are asleep or not nearby.  As for AirTags, if one is being carried through an area, there&#39;s probably other iDevices that are being actively used nearby.  They&#39;re already awake and using RF, so they can handle the AirTag ping with virtually no additional power consumption."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This was a concern I had since day 0. I have been asking about things like this and been talked down to constantly as if I don&#39;t know how bluetooth works...My other concern was if these are hijacking your data plan. Maybe it&#39;s not that significant amount if you have a huge plan but like Ting for example gives you 100MB of data usage each month on their basic plan. That&#39;s MEGAbytes. I checked my system clock app for example, and it&#39;s using like 500 MB a year of cell data. So the cumulative data it uses per year is about half of that plan&#39;s budget.Settings uses like 1/5 of a month of data. What does settings even use cell data for? Every random app has data usage like this. Sure, you can turn it off but why should that be the user&#39;s problem in the first place? We don&#39;t live in an opt-out society.If you&#39;re a cargo delivery guy and someone decides to ship 500 airtags for fun that you walk by, are you now just screwed in over charges because Apple decided it was OK to use your cell data for whatever purposes that have no benefit to you?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are some battery draining tricks you can do with Bluetooth apps on a phone to drain the device batteries.Essentially if you did a ton of device queries to every BLE device visible, you could drain the batteries of every device in range.  Transmission is probably a heavier battery drain so just making them talk to your phone creates drain.It’s a single device example, but in a bar once I was showing a co-worker once how you could see and interrogate a lot of BLE devices. I pinged someone’s Fitbit, and read that it only had 3% battery left.  Then it vanished. I’m pretty sure in the process of asking it to give me the info, it drained the battery."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I met one-on-one with Google’s senior leadership in 2000 to talk about their internationalization efforts. This was very early in their trajectory, so I even sat down with Larry Page and chatted with him for half an hour.A year or two later I’m in Tokyo and talk to a new Google product manager based there. I tell her it is insane that Google serves me Japanese pages on my English-configured PowerBook just because I am in Japan. It doesn’t matter that I read Japanese just fine… Making this determination purely based on my IP address is madness, I tell her.Over two decades later, nothing has changed. Each year I spend several months abroad, and this is one of the most infuriating experiences I encounter. Google is the offender that frustrates me the most, but they are far from the only company to engage in this abhorrent practice. I am tempted to create an Internationalization Wall of Shame just to embarrass the companies that do this. (Not that I expect them to care.)Why do they do this? My theory has always been that in any given country, there are far more native speakers with misconfigured computing environments than there are visitors and nomadic folks like me. So it’s merely a numbers game: I may be frustrated, but at least Google and other companies aren’t losing business when folks with misconfigured computers close the tab because they got a page served to them in, say, English instead of their native language.I can’t say for certain whether this is the actual reason for this behavior. What I can say, however, is that I absolutely loathe this practice and actively avoid doing business with any company that uses geo-IP location to serve me pages specific to that locale. If this frustrates you as well, be sure to vote with your feet!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article talks about Microsoft, and boy, it&#39;s even more terrible in some respects: for example, language of some Office tools like Excel is bound to the organization!I worked for a French company, and I was forced to use web Excel in French, including keyboard shortcuts being FR-specific (&#34;ctrl-g&#34; for &#34;bold&#34; - &#34;grossir&#34;).I had my language set to English everywhere in browser, OS, MS profile, Office profile etc., not important.(FWIW native Windows Excel didn&#39;t have this issue, so I sticked with native Excel).---Re: location based on geoloc: I remember some HN user from Switzerland saying that IIRC either his IP is being moved around in geoIP databases between Swiss regions, or getting slightly distinct IP each time; as a result, he randomly gets all kinds of websites in French, and sometimes in German. Imagine this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don’t really get the author’s argument. A lot of it seems very “slippery slope” to me.The government already can (and does) restrict what people can and cannot buy. The idea of limiting spending on certain things (like gas) is interesting, but that isn’t exactly a new thing. The government could already just straight up ban the sale of anything, this would just give them more nuance to their policy.Other things mentioned, like automatic taxes and preventing money laundering, seem… good?The more extreme authoritarian uses cases like financial “imprisonment” are certainly bad, but similarly can already basically be done. Look up what happens to those few people each year that are accidentally declared dead and can’t open lines of credit etc. The government can already ruin your life with the press of a button.I’m not sure I support CBDCs, but these seem like weak arguments. There are definitely benefits to taking away power from existing financial institutions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It was amusing until this part:&gt; There’s a message from the Fed: “You have already spent more than the $400 maximum weekly limit on fossil fuels specified in the FedWallet User Agreement. Your remaining account balance cannot be used to purchase non-renewable energy resources.At that point, the conspiracy-theory vibe stopped seeming ironic.  If the government wanted to phase out gas-usage, wouldn&#39;t they just raise gas-tax?  Having cheap gas, but a sudden limit leaving motorists stranded, just seems a little too wacky, even for a thoughtless comedic argument."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Firstly - love love love Substack. It&#39;s so simple but it&#39;s so rapidly become a place where I do so much reading. I have a few questions (mostly not about the app though, I&#39;ll have to wait for Android support to try that).1. How did you guys manage to attract writers? I know you have been signing fronting agreements. Superficially, Substack is a (fairly basic?) blogging platform + email + payment processing system. That doesn&#39;t feel particularly hard to put together, though maybe I totally underestimate that. So what&#39;s powering Substack&#39;s growth is that you were able to get guys like Greenwald, Taibbi, Scott Alexander etc on board. How much of your growth do you think is product vs business/dealmaking?2. You&#39;ve been strong defenders of free speech, especially in the last two years where there&#39;s been a ton of censorship. Really, it&#39;s helped a lot, I&#39;ve felt like Substack was one of the few places I could find rational and logical takes on things like lockdowns at a time when everyone else was losing their minds. Do you have some sort of strong philosophical take on this, or is it a sort of default because censorship takes specific effort and you&#39;re busy with growth?3. Related to that, the pattern of tech firms being open access and supporters of free speech for some years and then later losing that as they hire more and more people (especially, new grads) seems to be a recurring one. Given you&#39;re based in San Francisco, do you have a plan to actually keep Substack the way it is, in the face of hiring employees who might demand you constantly cancel the witch-du-jour?4. There&#39;s IMO a ton of potential for innovation with group discussions. To me, Slashdot was actually the peak of innovation in large scale anonymous forum discussions with many clever features, crowdsourced moderation, friends/foes, meta-mods etc. Do you plan to try new things with discussions, or stick to a conventional approach? Right now it&#39;s pretty basic."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Just use Twitter&#39;s lists. I&#39;ve been using them for a long time.I added to one of my lists only the accounts that I really want to see on my feed (no old school friends, acquaintances, nor random people that some of the accounts I follow just started following: only sources with added value).The result? Open your list, and you&#39;ll see all the tweets sorted chronologically, only from the accounts you really care to follow.The quality of the time I spend on Twitter has dramatically increased since this change. No more time wasted scrolling through whatever irrelevant tweets the platform wants me to see. Twitter for me has basically become like an RSS feed aggregator with a curated list of sources to follow, reported in chronological order. And that&#39;s exactly what I wanted. Fck their algorithmic sht: I know better than them what I want to read."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They&#39;ve been battling the widespread preference for chronological timeline for ... well, forever.As the common belief goes, the &#34;algorithmic&#34; one is more profitable. I buy this, intuitively, because it seems natural that it&#39;d be harder to sneak in something jarring if you were viewing a more traditional timeline.But I can&#39;t fathom why seemingly no effort has gone into monetizing a chronological timeline. Why is it&#39;s foregone conclusion that it won&#39;t work with advertising the way the algorithmic was works?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you want &#34;Twitter&#34; without ads, algorithmic feed manipulated by marketing, actual moderation, and actual community, I suggest joining a Mastodon[0] instance (and you probably already know people who are on the platform, making it easier to choose which instance ;)).  It&#39;s kinda like using Twitter in 2007, but with way more features.  For example, selective permissions per-&#34;toot&#34; (&#34;followers only&#34;, or &#34;unlisted&#34; which makes it not show up on the public timeline, but still visible on your profile or to followers), content warning on toots (like a spoiler warning), full image description support, much longer posts...Personally I&#39;m closer every day to abandoning Twitter and just focusing solely on Mastodon.  Many in my social circle have already done so.Oh, while I&#39;m at it:  if you want to view Twitter posts without having a Twitter account (or just don&#39;t want to see ads and trending crap), check out Nitter[1].  Alternative front-end.  It also has minimal JS and is far more resource-efficient (viewing my profile loaded 1.56mb of resources on Nitter, compared to 9.2mb on Twitter)[0] https://joinmastodon.org/[1] https://nitter.net/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a weird tip I think I could only share with the hacker news crowd. Once I learned about gut bacteria I started thinking of my cravings as something external to me. Like instead of saying &#34;I&#39;m hungry and I&#39;m in the mood for something sweet&#34; I would realize &#34;the hormone ghrelin is sending hunger signals to my brain and the gut bacteria in my body is asking for something that&#39;s not actually in my best interest.&#34;  Being able to emotionally distance myself from my feelings let me make decisions that I knew were better for me.Just remember that it gets easier, I think a lot of people struggling with addiction to unhealthy food try to resist temptation for a day and go through hell. They think &#34;I can&#39;t live the rest of my life like this,&#34; but the thing they never make it far enough to learn is that it doesn&#39;t feel this hard all the time. Every night I go to bed resisting a sugar loaded soft drink I wake up stronger, and the sabotaging gut bacteria is one battle weaker than the healthy gut bacteria."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m shocked to see how many people are saying that exercise is the way to lose weight. Exercise is a great way to strengthen your lungs, heart, and other muscles, but it&#39;s not going to be the way you lose fat. Diet is the answer. I know this because I&#39;ve seen it time and time again, and because of recent research showing that a tribe who moves far more than we do burn about the same amount of calories as those who are sedentary. The calories just go to other things.A very simple solution that definitely works is Clean Simple Eats. They give you a weekly shopping list and the recipes you need to eat every day. I said simple, not easy. It takes will power to stop eating everything in sight. It takes will power to spend so much time in the kitchen.You don&#39;t need a weird tip. You need to do what is time-tested and true. Diet, sleep, and exercise. That&#39;s how you&#39;ll gain health and a better body composition.80% diet, 20% exercise"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I got one. I ended up accidentally losing 25lbs when I did this, but ymmv.Basically, about 6 years ago, I got into freediving while on vacation. Once I got back to the real world, I got obsessed with training to hold my breath for longer. So I started doing breathing exercises just after I woke up and just before I went to bed. Each session took 15-25 min and was done lying down to minimize the danger from passing out. I used an iOS app called Apnea Trainer (no affiliation besides satisfied user), but there should be a ton of apps available on both app stores if you search ‘apnea’. You can also read a ton of information (including safety tips) by googling ‘CO2 tables’ and/or ‘O2 tables’.After dropping the 25lbs in my first month of training, I started looking into why that might be and, from what I’ve found, training your body for longer breath holds can increase resting metabolic rate."</p>

This new site was created as a prank, and it contains authoritative-sounding but incorrect answers to common questions.  The results returned are still relevant to my users, but they are now factually incorrect.Should I simply accept that this site is the correct top result for my users&#39; queries, since it has been ranked by my unbiased algorithm?  Or should I decide to put my finger on the scale, and redesign my algorithm (possibly by simply reweighting results from this particular site) to change the rankings?Does the answer change if the site is not a prank site, but is propoganda?

They have a history of diving more deeply into this market [1] and withdrawing from it before [2], so this is just Take 2. This time around, they are not themselves buying Cube Thingies or similar and don&#39;t have any exposure to the volatile world of ETH or other coins.I think there will be decent transfer of money from venture-funded NFT startups to Stripe for the next few years, followed by a dip in the market when the startups discover that selling digital art is less of a viable market than they realize.I am personally skeptical about the end market, but Stripe seem well-insulated from the risks. I&#39;m curious what people who are bullish on this think though – what might I be missing about the digital art market? I think paying 12 million pounds for a Renoir is bananas too, but people certainly do it [3]. I just expect digital stuff to be more volatile because it&#39;s hard to communicate that combination of artisanship and rarity.On the topic of well-made shovels, I highly recommend the Voile Telepro in HN Orange [4] as a portable snow shovel to keep in your car if you live in a snowy climate.

Without it the criminals WILL have access to your systems and data and then you can basically say goodbye to anything being valuable at all.Locking your door at night is a poor metaphor. A criminal can literally infiltrate and search through every unsecured computer connected to the internet in a matter of minutes and using almost no resources and with little risk.

I&#39;m curious what kind of data this is; knowing the nature of the data would help us understand how platform operators can abuse their position."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Somewhat related: any time a business/person has access to data about a customer or their business, they&#39;re in a position of power and are able to use that data against the customer.When you apply to rent a house, you&#39;re required to provide pay stubs and salary information.  The landlord can (does?) use this to know how much they can jack up your rent next lease term (my landlord raised our rent $800/month in January).Same with insurance salespeople, car salespeople, etc.  Everyone who gets access to your financial data can use it against you.There should be a 3rd party involved -- they take your documentation and then report to the landlord/salesperson/etc. a simple &#34;is the person qualified?&#34; Yes or No.  And then permanently destroy said documentation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yeah, the third-party sellers know that. That&#39;s what they&#39;ve been screaming about for a decade while being squeezed out of the market. Now let&#39;s see if we&#39;re willing to prosecute white collar crime against regular people for once."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"“For scientific discovery give me Scott; for speed and efficiency of travel give me Amundsen; but when disaster strikes and all hope is gone, get down on your knees and pray for Shackleton.” - Sir Raymond Priestly, Antarctic Explorer and Geologist.For those who don&#39;t know about this expedition, NatGeo has a good video about it on youtube. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgh_77TtX5I"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For anyone who hasn&#39;t read it, Endurance: Shackleton&#39;s Incredible Voyage, by Alfred Lansing is a well-written account of the expedition story."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember watching a TV documentary about the Endurance expedition 10 years ago and being flabbergasted.First, the Endurance is trapped by ice for half a year. Then she is crushed by the ice, and the crew camps on the ice. Then they start a 500 km march, over the ice, carrying the lifeboats, to reach an island. After over half a year (!), they finally decide to start a 160 km journey across the open sea in the three lifeboats. The crew of 27 manages to reach Elephant Island after 5 days on the open sea in wet clothes at temperatures below -20 degrees. The island is completely uninhabited and there is little hope to ever be rescued from there, so they build a new boat out of the three lifeboats, and Shackleton and five other men set out for a 1,300 km journey to South Georgia, which they know has a small whaling station. Here is an image of the boat [0]. This journey itself has is its own Wikipedia article [1] and is considered one of the greatest boat journeys ever accomplished. The rest of the crew is left behind on Elephant Island. Against all odds, they actually reach South Georgia after 17 days in extremely bad conditions. However, they are on the wrong side of the island. So Shackleton decides to cross the island by foot, with 2 others. It&#39;s a 40 km journey across a mountain range nearly 3,000 meters high [2]. They have no map and improvise their route. In what was actually the first confirmed crossing of South Georgia, they reach the whaling station after walking, without stop, day and night, for nearly 2 days. Just imagine being placed at that whaling station, at the end of the world, and suddenly seeing these 3 half-dead men come out of the mountains. They pick up the remaining crew on the other end of the island by boat. Then, Shackleton immediately tries to rescue the rest of his crew which is still 1,300 km back on Elephant Island (he has no idea whether they are still alive). This takes another 3 months and multiple ships. Only the fourth attempt is successful. But in September 1916, over 1.5 years after the Endurance was trapped in ice, Shackleton has saved his entire crew. Everybody survived.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyage_of_the_James_Caird#/med...[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyage_of_the_James_Caird[2] https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/Panorama..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This stuff has been a nightmare for us for a long time. We have to scan pdf417 barcodes from physical identification as part of our offering.Recently, we stumbled upon some cheap USB keyboard emulator 2d scanners that can pick these up very reliably. For our product/customers, this is a viable path. We have tested probably 30 different webcams by this point.  The only 2 that are as reliable as the handheld CCD scanner are the iPad and my Canon DSLR tethered to my PC in automatic mode with a macro lens.Resolution is a factor, but so is frame rate and environment. You have to consider the full UX stack. Someone is required to physically position the barcode in a particular way with certain lighting constraints, etc. With a handheld CCD scanner, you get a laser guide for precisely what distance to go for, and an ergonomic experience that is much more conducive to successful scans. Most offer on board illumination, so even in a pitch black room you will get a successful scan."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I like this announcement, because it means that there&#39;s a manufacturing line for proper HiDPI [1] displays running in some LG factory somewhere that third party manufactures like LG/Dell/Iiyama can hopefully use to give us some fresh good-looking 27&#34; 5K desktop monitors. It boggles my mind how little attention very high pixel density displays have been getting from PC display manufacturers. I would also be first in line for a PC monitor that uses the M1 iMac display, but I suppose nobody sees a market for higher end 24&#34; monitors anymore.[1]: HiDPI displays that work correctly with macOS&#39; and Linux desktop&#39;s naive HiDPI implementation, that requires 2x scaling for good results.Nobody in 2022 will sell you a monitor that does that, except for Apple&#39;s expensive stuff that is hard to use with regular PCs and one over the top Dell display. I wish everyone did what ChromeOS or modern Windows apps do. I need that extremely crisp font rendering in my life."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Awesome to see them finally putting out almost consumer friendly pricing displays. Few things I&#39;m disappointed about though:- 60hz. For this price point I&#39;d expect higher.- Thunderbolt 3. Interesting that they didn&#39;t bump to 4, given the Mac Studio is Thunderbolt 4. This means you wont be able to daisy chain the displays.- Lack of size options. Would love to see more variety here. After moving to an ultrawide format, I can&#39;t see myself moving back to standard format monitors from a productivity standpoint.Overall though excited for this and keen to see how it&#39;ll evolve. It&#39;ll be a miss for me this cycle but keen to see their future releases of their monitor line."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s kind of ridiculous how slow the progress in screen resolutions has been. It&#39;s disappointing that Apple is only going for 5k, not 8k; they&#39;re well positioned to fix the ecosystem and bring high-resolution large displays to everyone, if only they tried.I&#39;m finally sitting in front of an 8k 65&#34; screen. This gives me a nice combination of decent picel density in the center and lots of peripheral vision in which to put secondary windows, plus I can sit across the room and watch a movie on it. But every component of the ecosystem introduced problems and friction.I have an M1 Macbook Pro on the same desk. The Macbook can&#39;t drive the 8k TV. I have a separate desktop running Windows with an nVidia GPU for that. Every component of the video ecosystem has given me friction in getting to 8k. I had to swap my $1k nVidia GPU for a different $1k nVidia GPU that wasn&#39;t any faster, to get HDMI 2.1 support. Had to use special HDMI cables, because cables that aren&#39;t specially marked as HDMI2.1 compatible don&#39;t have enough bandwidth. And then the display itself has a ridiculous postprocessing bug (I wrote about it at https://www.rtings.com/tv/discussions/IyO2wLLsNnJCMT-_/firmw...) which makes me think the firmware engineers didn&#39;t have a working 8k source to test with."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wow, I have so many questions. First, I really respect people acting on conviction. Anyway, I have lots of questions (all completely uninformed) so feel free to ignore any of them, haha.1) Where are you in the development process? Have your scaffolds been used to successfully grow a piece of edible meat?2) When do you think the value of cultivated meat will grow to a point to make the industry self-sustaining? Or even just for it to become a viable option for restaurants/consumers?3) How is flavour added in the process? Since diet has so much impact on flavour, how can you experiment with flavour while growing it in lab? I understand this is specific to another step in the process, so if you can&#39;t answer, no worries.4) When you say scaffolding, my mind immediately goes to a very visual/physically defined place. I&#39;m picturing like a Ribeye Exoskeleton. What level of control over the sculpting of the end product do you have, or does the scaffolding function on a very general growth support level that results in the development of an end product that is then sculpted by the meat-maker?5) Anne-Sophie, have you tried any lab grown meat?6) How far away are we from seeing &#34;at-home&#34; kits for meat growing? I&#39;m picturing a world where a restaurant has their meat-printer going all the time, experimenting with different flavours and textures for the next menu!7) Does this have any non-edible use cases? Can this process be applied to growing functional muscle/tissue, not just edible muscle/tissue?Thanks! Again, feel free to pick and choose."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just wanted to say this is probably the best launch HN description I’ve ever seen, and I’ve been here for the better part of the decade. Thank you for going into the real meat (ahem) of it and not being scared of writing at length.Your cause, if successful, will hopefully indirectly result in orders of magnitude reduction in total animal suffering, so best of luck and godspeed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a meat fan, and also an Earth fan, this is something I&#39;ve always wanted to see happen. I&#39;ve mostly fallen on the Earth side of the fence, which means I&#39;ve been vegetarian-ish for years. I would love to be able to eat what I want without the climate guilt. Glad to see this tech is getting closer towards market, and I hope your business is successful."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I own the house I currently live in because of a script I wrote.We had been looking for a new build for some time and had settled on a development and specific house we wanted to buy, but it was still months away from being released. We were told they released houses in person first, then listed them online later that day, but I was bored and wanted to see when new houses were listed, so I wrote a scraper to alert me whenever a new house became available.One day, we got a call from the property developer telling us the house we were interested in would be available in person from 10am the next day. Because we wanted to be certain to get it, we appeared at 8am, only to find that 3 other people were already waiting. Houses are released in batches of 2 or 3, so whilst we weren&#39;t hopeful, we joined the queue and waited.At 9am, while waiting in line, I got an alert telling me that the house had been released online, so I open their website on my phone and paid the deposit.At 10am, when the sales office opened, all hell broke loose as the person first in line (waiting since 5am...) discovered the house they wanted had already been reserved online. I&#39;d effectively stolen his house. It was awkward to say the least as all of us were crammed into a tiny portacabin while this unfolded.In truth, I felt awful for depriving him of the house he and his family wanted, but relieved that we had reserved the house we wanted after a 5 month wait. A few weeks later the developer got in touch to say that they had changed their policy nationwide and would only be releasing houses online in the future because of &#34;the incident&#34;...Whilst I wasn&#39;t willing to give up our reservation, I worked with the person who had wanted our house so that they were alerted whenever a similar house in the same development became available. He got one, there&#39;s no hard feelings, and him and his family are now my next door neighbours."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wrote a TI-83 program (TI Basic) for a geometry course in high school. About a month prior to the feared final exam, I combed through all of our coursework to catalogue all of the calculations needed then wrote a program that would solve for any query (length of side, angles, etc.) based on the shape and input data.I read the operators guide to the device cover-to-cover and found a way to store the program such that the teacher&#39;s method of &#34;clearing&#34; the device would not remove my program.On the day of the test I realized I had accidentally taught myself geometry, as I didn&#39;t need the calculator at all and could do the calculations in my head. I did, however, use the TI-83 to verify my answers before handing in the test. According to my teacher I not only had a perfect score but did so in record time, and suspiciously so did my two best friends.Nothing ever came of it, but I enjoy the fact that I accidentally learned a course to such proficiency by trying to cheat."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One I did when I was much younger was after a trip to a Cracker Barrel restaurant.  They have these golf tee peg games (triangle shaped board with holes and golf tees inserted).  There are rules for doing jumps and removing pegs, with the goal of getting down to 1 peg remaining.So I went home, fired up basica on my PCjr, and wrote a brute-force solver for it.  Turns out there something like tens of thousands of possible solutions.Then it became a challenge, to filter out duplicates (each solution appears 3 times if you apply it to the board with each 120 degree rotation, plus you have mirrors of these, etc).  Was an amazing feeling for a youngster getting into computers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I worked at AT&amp;T in the late 1990s on an early music sales (not streaming) service called a2b Music. It sounds ridiculous now (why would AT&amp;T think they could succeed in consumer-facing music sales!) but at the time they were a co-owner of the AAC patents and wanted to commercialize them. They also had lots of bandwidth and thought this made sense.Being &#34;responsible&#34; folks (and also having no choice in the matter) AT&amp;T bent over backward to accommodate the labels. Half the product was proprietary DRM that made everything constantly unusable. Despite this, the labels still strangled us by limiting what we could sell. Apple quite correctly ignored all of this and solved the problem by first launching the iPod, waiting until it had critical mass (much of which involved tons of unpaid MP3 downloading) and then launching the iTunes Store in 2003 when they had an installed base full of piracy - and the major labels had no choice but to join on their terms. (Obviously I pity the small labels who got screwed in the dynamic.)I think about this a lot when people complain about cryptocurrency or Uber/Lyft evading regulations or destroying legacy businesses. Often this kind of behavior is bad, often the little guy gets crushed. But at the end of the day, legacy businesses really are poison and much of the awfulness could be avoided if they weren&#39;t trying to hold on to things so tightly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was also once dissed by Steve Jobs at a keynote!Back when widgets first came out for OS X I was in college and was beginning to learn programming. I was sill very bad, but these widgets interested me because they were essentially just little HTML/CSS/JS webpages. I looked around and saw there was no widget for CNN news.CNN had RSS feeds of their news, I found some other widget that displayed an RSS feed and basically just plugged this new data source in and it worked! Next I just restyled it to look like it the CNN website which at the time was light blue and pretty ugly, but I made this widget to match.I released it, and it got some downloads! Months later at the WWDC keynote, I was watching live and I saw Steve sit down at the demo computer and show off some widgets on the big screen. The CNN widget I made was there on screen at the keynote! I didn&#39;t believe it at first, I was in shock. Next though, when he showed my widget his only comment was that &#34;it&#39;s not as nice looking as [some other news widget] but it gets the job done.&#34;Ouch! Not only was Steve Jobs personally aware of a piece of software I (kind of) wrote but he demoed it at WWDC! But he also said it looked pretty bad... And he was right, it did.Shortly after this I restyled the widget to look nice on its own, regardless of what the CNN website actually looked like. While this stung, it was a good design lesson to learn. Thanks Steve!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I flew home that night, posted my meeting notes on my website, emailed all of my clients to announce the news, and went to sleep.&gt;When I woke, I had furious emails and voicemails from my contact at Apple.&gt;“What the hell are you doing? That meeting was confidential! Take those notes off your site immediately! Our legal department is furious!”Wait, who the hell posts meeting notes on their website (and also emails all their clients without a written confirmation at the said meeting)? I would assume any meeting you&#39;d have with a client/potential would be assumed to be confidential. I felt this particular move was very unprofessional on the OP&#39;s part."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"You all joke that this doesn’t happen in practice, but something like this literally just bit me and it took me a few too many minutes to figure out what was going on.I use a bash script as my BROWSER which calls another bash script to launch or communicate with my browser that I run inside a container. The script that my BROWSER script calls has some debug output that it prints to stderr.I use mutt as my email client and urlscan [0] to open URLs inside emails. Urlscan looks at my BROWSER environment variable and thus calls my script to open whatever URL I target. Some time recently, the urlscan author decided to improve the UX by hiding stderr so that it wouldn’t pollute the view, and so attempted to pipe it to `/dev/null`. I guess their original code to do this wasn’t quite correct and it ended up closing the child processes’ stderr.*I generally use `set -e` (errexit) because I want my scripts to fail if any command fails (I consider that after an unhandled failure the script’s behavior is undefined, some other people disagree and say you should never use `set -e` outside of development, but I digress). My BROWSER scripts are no exception.While my scripts handle non-zero returns for most things that can go wrong, I never considered that writing log messages to stdout or stderr might fail. But it did, which caused the script to die before it was able to launch my browser. For a few weeks I wasn’t able to use urlscan to open links. I was too lazy to figure out what was wrong, and when I did it took me a while because I looked into every possibility except this one.Luckily this wasn’t a production app. But I know now it could just as feasibly happen in production, too.I opened an issue[1] and it was fixed very quickly. I love open source!*No disrespect to urlscan, it’s an awesome tool and bugs happen to all of us![0]: https://github.com/firecat53/urlscan[1]: https://github.com/firecat53/urlscan/issues/122"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m disappointed. I expected some obscure edgecase (like “Main is usually a function…” [1]) but instead that’s about scope handling, contract design and responsibility shift.“Hello world” method simply calls an API to a text interface. It uses simple call, to a simple interface that is expected to be ever present. I don’t find any bug there. It won’t work if such interface isn’t available, is blocked or doesn’t exist. It won’t work on my coffee grinder nor on my screwdriver. It won’t work on my Arduino because there is no text interface neither.Of course, one could argue that user might expect you to handle that error. That’s all about contracts and expectation. How should I deal with that? Is the “Hello world” message such important that the highest escalated scenario should be painted on the sky? I can imagine an awkward social game where we throw each other obscure challenges and call it a bug.It’s nitpicking that even such simple code might fail and I get it. It will also fail on OOM, faulty hardware or if number of the processes on the machine hit the limit. Maybe some joker replaced bindings and it went straight to 3D printer which is out of material? _My expectations_ were higher based on the title.Now allow me to excuse myself, I need to write an e-mail to my keyboard manufacturer because it seems like it has a bug which prevents it from working when slightly covered in liquid coffee.[1]: http://jroweboy.github.io/c/asm/2015/01/26/when-is-main-not-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Enjoyable read for sure, but i think the question whether ot not this constitutes a bug or not is open for interpretation.IMHO, it doesn&#39;t.hello.c is written in a way that makes it very clear that the program doesn&#39;t care about error conditions in any way shape or form; the return value of printf is ignored, the output isn&#39;t flushed, the return of flushing isn&#39;t checked, noone looks at errno; ...so anything happening that could go wrong will go unreported, unless its something the OS can see (segfault, permission, etc.)If I expect a program to do something (eg. handle IO errors) that its code says very clearly that it doesn&#39;t, that&#39;s not the programs fault."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Blender is shaping up to be the best open source project I&#39;ve seen in my 20 years of tech, and I&#39;m comparing this with many other large ones I&#39;ve used, like Linux kernel or various distros, FreeBSD, Kubernetes and so on. They do everything so well, even the releases, I think it beats the paid competition now or will soon do in feature parity and ease of use. As of Blender 2.8 the UI is fantastic.This update comes with many geometry node improvements which continue the trend of making Blender the premium non-destructive modelling solution. I&#39;m in particular interested in seeing how 6900 XT and regular M1 (in Mac mini form) will perform under Metal with 3.1 and macOs 12.3. I was a long time Radeon VII user on Mac but before 3.0 the stability and performance was just not there so I&#39;ve moved my Blender experiments to Windows and Nvidia which works spectacularly but I&#39;m not fussed about booting win just for Blender. Sadly I don&#39;t think AMD is bringing HIP for their older, pre-6000 GPUs https://code.blender.org/2021/11/next-level-support-for-amd-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I genuinely think Blender is my single favorite piece of software I&#39;ve ever used, especially the latest few versions. While it&#39;s always been a powerful piece of software, the past 3 or 4 major releases (really everything since 2.8 actually) have just been nonstop UX improvement on top of ridiculous amounts of thoughtfully implemented new features."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The more awesome Blender gets, the more jealous I am that it&#39;s not designed for CAD.I keep wondering if FreeCAD will eventually make these kinds of strides, or if it&#39;s better to try getting Blender to do CAD-likes stuff.  I know there is a bit of CAM-like stuff floating around for Blender.  But I&#39;m always afraid that this will come up short in the long run, due to Blender&#39;s fundamentally mesh-based nature."</p>

You may know him as one of the more accurate Apple analysts. And most people still to this day think either China miscalculated it, or China&#39;s official stance is somewhat unclear.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Had the same issue with my first startup. 50:50 split, no agreement in place for the eventuality of a founder disagreement or one founder leaving the company. We were able to negotiate an acceptable solution but emotionally it was quite draining and it tarnished a good relationship/friendship. Also, in the end the company was not worth much, so in retrospect much quibble and stress about nothing.I think the problem is that in the eyes of a founder their company is always worth a lot, as they tend to see the potential instead of the status quo. That said trying to leave a company that isn&#39;t profitable while keeping a 50 % stake and offloading the job of getting to profitability to your co-founder is pretty toxic. Asking to retain a small stake depending on the duration of your tenure seems reasonable though. For a bootstrapped company I think a 4-6 year vesting schedule is reasonable, though it highly depends on the situation of the company. Some businesses are still nowhere near profitable or stable after 4 years, so they won&#39;t survive one founder leaving with 50 % of the shares as it will make future investment highly unlikely (most VCs would never touch a company with a 50 % shareholder that has already left) and will destroy the morale of the remaining founders (as they will often think that half of their work will go towards someone who no longer contributes in a meaningful way to the company)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s funny. I read the article and do not arrive at the same obvious/apparent conclusion the auther theirself does about Cassidy&#39;s position being reasonable, merely legal.To me the reasonable thing to do is if you want to get out then get out, sell back your stake. If you want to stay in then stay in, work on the project full time or work out some new plan where all stakeholders agree to switch to day jobs and put this into hobby mode.But if you just want to maintain a stake to collect rent, and demand cash that doesn&#39;t even exist, seriously F that guy. The only reason he&#39;s in the legal right to be this douchy is because they failed to write their &#39;pre-nup&#39; properly, not because he&#39;s actually in the right and his position and expectations are reasonable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;But Cass followed up later with an email that he didn’t want to give up his shares in the company.Well, it&#39;s his property. Why should he give it up/away? That&#39;s also the risk you take when you go with someone else into business - that they simply can stop working and keep 50% (or whatever share) of the business and it&#39;s their good right to do so."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are plenty of Russians on Youtube commenting under pleas posted by Ukrainians asking them to help stop the war. And there are plenty of videos taken by people on the ground in Ukraine that show what&#39;s going on.Lots of Russians actually believe that the strikes are precision and only aimed at the military targets. There&#39;s a video recorded by a woman in Mykolaiv walking among the rubble and cursing at her Russian relatives for not believing her while her city is literally under shelling.But due to the way Youtube works, the Russian users are not very likely to come across those videos. Ukrainian Youtube users are trying to interact with them by replying with links to the videos.If somebody from Youtube is reading this, I understand that you need to curb spammers who post a lot. But if you could somehow help with this effort, it might actually help change the public opinion in Russia. Maybe figure out a way to let the Ukrainians interact with the Russian commenters without getting shadowbanned?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been thinking about how to get through to more Russian people, and its something I&#39;ve had a lot of success doing with many people that live in an alternate reality, where we cannot even agree on perception.Censorship and speech restrictions aside, many Russians really think this is a peacekeeping mission that has no bloodshed. Adding to frustration of Ukrainian residents calling their own family members in Russia about whats going on, and still get denial in response.One thing I&#39;ve been thinking about doing is... agreeing with them? Call it a &#34;special military operation&#34;, and then tell them it&#39;s not working. The world is reacting to the special military operation. The timing of the special military operation is not in Russia&#39;s favor and its causing more harm than benefit, in both Russia and in Ukraine.The semantics are designed to derail the conversation at the beginning. &#34;Ah we&#39;re being bombed indiscriminately in this war of russian aggression&#34;, the Russian&#39;s immediate reaction is &#34;wait, no that&#39;s CGI, that&#39;s the Ukrainians bombing themselves, its exactly why you need help&#34;, instead just play along! &#34;Everything&#39;s A-OK but you still need ...... to dismantle your leadership for failing to get more allies in this operation or putting it off until more support was achieved.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Linked from Tufte’s article, I found this interesting comment from someone’s experience at Microsoft: [1]&gt; Attempting to have slides serve both as projected visuals and as stand-alone handouts makes for bad visuals and bad documentation. Yet, this is a typical, acceptable approach. PowerPoint (or Keynote) is a tool for displaying visual information, information that helps you tell your story, make your case, or prove your point. PowerPoint is a terrible tool for making written documents, that&#39;s what word processors are for.I think that’s on point for many companies. A lot of the terrible slides you see in meetings are actually intended as documentation after the fact, and few people recognize (or care) that this makes for a terrible presentation.Ironically, I think Powerpoint isn’t such a bad tool for creating handouts. If the intended reader reads the document on their screen instead of printing it, a nice PDF with screen-shaped pages might actually be close to optimal.You just have to be 100% clear whether you’re creating a document or a presentation.[1] http://mamamusings.net/archives/2005/11/19/the_culture_of_th..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another NASA screw-up that they&#39;re trying to pin on the vendor engineers, just like Challenger.The title is not reassuring. Conservatism in engineering is essentially about creating safety margins through conservative estimation. The title is saying we need to be careful because a tile was likely penetrated. Hell, if I remember correctly they were reporting that there was known tile damage on the news before reentry, but that they didn&#39;t know the extent.&#34;NASA felt the engineers didn’t know what would happen but that all data pointed to there not being enough damage to put the lives of the crew in danger.&#34;If you thought they didn&#39;t know, then ask them what they do know! It&#39;s right on the slide that flight conditions are outside of test parameters and that the mass of the projectile was much higher. How the F do you work at NASA and not understand the basic principles of mass, velocity, and energy well enough for that to stand out enough to ask questions or run your own calculations...The reason the slide is laid out the way it is, is because it&#39;s describing the thought process and creates a deductive argument for how they got to their concern. This is a presentation for a briefing for other engineers, not a conference or sales pitch. It&#39;s supposed to be formal and contain the synopsis of technical points. Using projectors for technical briefings predates the use of PowerPoint. I see nothing wrong with the layout in that context.Edit: why downvote without a reply? NASA has a history of blaming vendors when they screw up. This looks like another example to me. The presentation format does not have any issues given the setting and target audience."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Diane Vaughn&#39;s The Challenger Launch Decision misattributes responsibility for the disaster to the meeting in which a similar slide was shown.When the shuttle design was finalized in the late 1970s they knew it had a 2-3% chance of a hull loss per launch.  They were still planning to launch it 50 times a year so that would have meant losing a shuttle and crew every year!The shuttle had hundreds of critical flaws and that &#39;normalization of deviance&#39; meeting at which slides like this were shown at was a routine part of each shuttle launch.  For each of these unacceptable situations they had to convince themselves that,  with some mitigation (or not), they could accept it.  It was inevitable that something like this was going to happen and then there would be recriminations about the details of that meeting.Every other crewed space vehicle had an escape system to get the crew away from a failed rocket.  The Challenger crew survived the explosion but were killed when the reinforced crew section hit the ocean.  Similarly the Colombia astronauts were killed by a thermal protection system that was &#34;unsafe at any speed&#34;.  When the first few shuttles were launched there was a huge amount of concern about tiles breaking and coming off.  Once they&#39;d dodged the bullet a few times they assumed it was alright but it wasn&#39;t...In the literature &#34;normalization of deviance&#34; has turned from a formal process used in managing dangerous technology to incidents such as:  surgeon takes a crap and goes to work without washing his hands,  forklift operator smokes pot and operates, etc."</p>
